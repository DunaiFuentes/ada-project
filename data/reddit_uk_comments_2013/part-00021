true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;*""You've been given bail which as a foreigner you wouldn't be if they thought it was serious so you're not going to prison.""*

I'm sorry but that's completely not true at all. I've had various dealings over my life with the police in London and I personally have someone in my family who has been on bail for 3 offenses and went to prison each time. One offense was pretty similar to the one the OP is describing. He was working as an electrician, and forgot he had the knife in his workers trousers pocket when he went out with friends on a Friday evening after work, got searched, found the knife, and then got put on bail for a year. He got 7 months (of which you only have to serve half, so really 3 months in prison). Apparently that was considered a heavy sentence, although it was his first offence, and from what I know living in London apparently the police and sentences have got heavier since then. 

To clarify OP, you are on **police** bail, and you will next have to go back and see the police in February, but that is not when you are sentenced. What is currently happening is the CPS (a public prosecutor) is reviewing the police evidence, and will tell you the CPS decision to prosecute you or not. Contrary to popular belief the police have absolutely nothing to do with that decision. If they do then when you go back to the police station in February then the police will either tell you the date you have to go to Magistrates Court (the lowest) or tell you the case has been dropped (good news! normally first time good luck too). 

This means you will either be put on **court bail** (to appear at court) or let free. Now from my experience of Kingston I know they have recently closed the Magistrates court there, so it's likely you'll be going to Richmond magistrates court. This will be another wait of 6 months on bail or maybe more before the Magistrates even see you because the system is really busy. (So basically another 6 months after February, which is late August). 

The magistrates there will decide if your case is serious enough for them to deal with, which is good because they can only send you to prison for 2 years (of which you serve 1 year max, remember half rule in UK), and they won't do that anyway, they don't like sending people to prison, you'll probably get community service since it's your first offence and it's not a very serious knife and clearly an accident, or they will decide that the case is serious enough to go to Crown Court where you see a real judge, have a jury and real trial and the maximum sentence for this crime is 4 years. Either way once the Magistrates decide how serious the crime is, **YOU STILL DON'T** get sentenced then, you have to come back again for either the real magistrates hearing or crown court trial, this is usually another 2 months. So October 2013.

Then, when you have had your trial the magistrates or judge from crown court will send you away for a pre-sentencing hearing with the Probation Service, which in Kingston is the Surrey &amp; Sussex Probation service, which is near Nando's. This takes another 2 weeks, and then finally you go back and get your sentence.

This could be a simple fine, community service, both, or prison time. You won't find out after all this delay until November basically.

Welcome to the British Justice System. If you need serious tips on how to reduce your sentence then contact me and I'll help you. But I'm not going to bullshit you and try to make you feel better, because I know the court system doesn't work like that and I've had my hopes raised and crushed far too many times.

Just to clarify, in the UK it's actually Probation who are the gods, and who will decide your sentence, they basically make a recommendation after your pre-sentencing hearing with them, which is like a one on one interview with a member of Probation staff, to the magistrates or judge. The magistrates or judge can choose to ignore this recommendation, but doing so is very controversial and 9 times out of 10 they don't. Basically this means when you go for your sentencing hearing, which you will most **definitely** do, even if it's only going to be community service or a fine that you'll get, then you need to **suck the probation arse** big time.",0,1359679581,null,0,1359680246,0,c877zqh,t3_17nho9,t1_c877zqh,t1_c876drj,null,1431145854,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

I can on the one hand understand that you may not have had any malicious intentions, but knife crime is an issue here in the UK.  And unlike other countries, we don't think MOAR knives will fix this, so we're pretty harsh on people that carry them.

I can guarantee that the poor bloody security guards at the club have had knife related incidents so it is entirely understandable why they are so strict and why they have a metal detector.

If I was involved in the prosecution as well, I'm sorry, but your cry of ""I did't know the Law"" wouldn't stand either. it's arrogant in the extreme to not bother to educate yourself on the laws of the country in which you're a guest and it's presumptuous as hell to assume that everywhere is like your country of origin.

I've been on a jury when someone used that as a defence and it didn't stick. 

I'd say don't use it as a justification of your actions - ignorance is no defence - and to be fair, that is one nasty ass looking bit of kit there. 

Just apologise profusely and emphasise that while it was your own fault for not bothering to find out the law (though seriously, you're in London, right?

I've given my reasons for why the moves might happen, as well, and the Skrtel one isn't knee-jerk - I've stayed the conditions under which that move might take place:

&gt; if Carragher's still first-choice CB at the end of the season and/or Skrtel doesn't show the leadership &amp; attitude Rodgers wants

Also, at no point am I saying ""Skrtel sucked he should leave"". That's knee-jerk. I've just got an opinion that Skrtel has lost his spot in the first XI to Carragher, who played both the Norwich &amp; Arsenal games. If Skrtel starts the Man City game, I personally think it will only be because Rodgers has decided Carragher is at the age where he can't play 2 games in 4 days.

Alternative reasons for why Skrtel didn't play against Norwich &amp; Arsenal? I don't buy the suggestion that it's rotation, because CB's need the least rotation out of any outfield player; Skrtel isn't known for injury problems; and he regularly played multiple games a week earlier in the season when he'd play the big games in the Europa League group stages. If it were Agger we were talking about, it'd certainly be rotation.

So for me, the most logical reason is he's been dropped from the first XI. For a CB who should be entering his prime, and has recently signed a new contract that puts his wages at the equivalent for a first XI CB, losing your first-team spot to a veteran close to retirement isn't a good sign. Obviously there's ages this season for him to reclaim that spot (hence, again, the conditions that need to be met for Skrtel leaving to be a possibility), but my point is that if Skrtel doesn't reclaim his first-team spot by the end of the season, I'd be surprised if he doesn't leave the club / get moved on.",0,1359685128,null,0,false,0,c879sfo,t3_17me0n,t1_c879sfo,t1_c879kz6,null,1435635564,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The number of shots Defoe takes can be somewhat misleading, given his propensity for taking 25 yard shots from an angle rather than passing the ball to an open teammate in the center.

We've had games where we're facing a packed defense and don't seem to have a clue how to get through or around them, just Defoe and Bale taking countless shots from 25 or 30 yards. This is especially a problem when our wingers are marked out of the game. The recent QPR game comes to mind. Holtby will help here, providing creativity from the middle.

We've definitely had games where we produce a good number of chances, but can't seem to finish them. Parts of the Manchester United game.

We've had games where we get pressed aggressively, can't keep possession, resort to long, aimless balls out of defense, and fail to threaten goal in the first place: see the first half against Norwich.

Lloris

Walker Kaboul Vertonghen BAE

Sandro Dembele

Adebayor

Let's assume all 11 of those players get injured (we're already 2/11 of the way there, as Kaboul and Sandro are out).

Friedel

Naughton Dawson Caulker Friers?

Parker Huddlestone/Carroll?

Bentley? Sigurdsson Dempsey

Defoe

This is by no means a title-winning team, but for having all 11 starters out, it could be much, much worse. Bentley starting is probably the most alarming thing. Also, I can't claim to know whether or not there's a recall clause in Townsend's loan agreement, but I'd suspect there is.

Believe me, I wish we had a shiny new striker and more/better options on the bench, but I think today we definitely have more strength in depth than we did at this juncture last season.

Arsenal have strengthened an important position, no question, and will play and win some very one-sided games. However, they will also drop some points. Their defense is still shaky and that won't change overnight.

Everton generally does play much better in the second half of the season, but if there's a team with squad depth issues, Everton is it. 

I'm not trying to be a blind optimist here, but pointing out our lack of depth and ignoring Everton's is a little too one-sided for me.

Adkins had previously said they wouldn't be getting anyone who wasn't better than they already had. I can see us having a hard time getting a player better than Lallana, but I feel they are focusing too much on improving their starting 11 and not their bench, where there are some clear weaknesses.

QPR - Loads more players! Samba was a good buy who will fit right in because of his experience, but I'm not too worried about them because they won't gel together for a while. Buying loads of random players just doesn't work, and unless one of them starts shitting gold, nothing is really going to change. Glad they didn't get Odemwhingeie.

Aston Villa - No panic buys, only smart changes for the future. Seems to me like they want to ensure promotion to the premier league.

Reading - Building on what they have with some good, although unproven, youth. Shouldn't fix them much for this season and will still have a hard fight, but all smart, responsible moves.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Are your political beliefs set in stone, or do you believe you're open minded? 

I've had a long time to formulate my beliefs, and I've traversed a great deal of political, philosophical, economic, anthropological and sociological thought to get there.  I suspect I'm stuck with my belief system for life, but I'm always open minded and I've considered and rejected many others on the journey.

&gt;My issue with you is your categorised belief systems

You'd have to explain to me what you mean by this.  Either or?

&gt;and how you abide by them so stubbornly.

It's very rare to see someone actually make a fundamental shift in their beliefs in real time.  It does of course happen, but normally more slowly and privately.  My own beliefs have shifted ground in many ways over the years, and many of those I've discussed politics with have been instrumental in that.  But, on the other hand, I'm not some teenager who's latched on to an ""extremist"" ideology to shock or attention seek, I've gravitated to where I am politically over a couple of decades.  You can characterise it as stubborn, if you like, but I'd argue it's just well-grounded and deeply thought out.

&gt;Being a mutualist/socialist/communist.. can't quite work now, can it? 

Why not?  In many many ways (less so in others) the world is far more mutualist/socialist/communist than it has been at any point in modern history.  I expect things to continue to drift in that direction in some ways and to have to fight in other areas.

&gt;I mean honestly, at the end of the day mate, man will always be man.

And presumably those who don't identify as male will continue to be what they are too!  And if you're retreating into the intellectually vacuous ""human nature"" argument, we might as well just stop this right here.  Aside from anything else, capitalism is only a couple of hundred years old, and one day it will end.  It's only your ideological attachment to it which makes you believe it's true, just and right for all time and in all places, that it's the only way and that it's the end of history.  The Romans believed that about their empire as well, and the Greeks did too, as did the Persians, the Mesopotamians etc..  You simply can't think outside the box. 

&gt;Understanding that is to be a 'realist', then to make observations is to be 'progressive'. 

Understanding it may be to be a realist, to simply accept it is to be a defeatist.  Anarchism isn't about setting up utopian goals and having them as a masturbatory fantasy, it's about action and motion, and trying to make progress in the way you live your life.  I do that every day, and I teach my children that.  Freedom and equality may be a utopian pipe dream, but there's no reason not to strive for more freedom and equality every day and in every way.",0,1359695519,null,0,1359702919,0,c87cwd9,t3_17mmhb,t1_c87cwd9,t1_c87cghw,null,1431148471,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We're looking at about £55 mil of players there, or more specially, one Carroll and a Downing. And these are players with huge potential, who could turn into world beaters in a few years. So I think he's been successful in the market.

Bringing in players like Wisdom, Sterling and Suso has been a revelation. I can't remember the last time we had three academy players playing consistently. It instills a sense of pride having the kids represent the team. Another thing he's handled well.

Slowly, especially at Anfield, his style of play is being implemented. Our possession stats are the highest in the league. It's only a matter of time until everything clicks. 

Ensuring players like Suarez, Agger and Skrtel extend their contracts, the way he's handled the media, talking to fansites with courtesy and intelligence, I think Rodgers has handled the job brilliantly. 

Obviously he's not been perfect. I think he struggles tactically sometimes, and doesn't know whether to stick or twist, but the positive far outweighs the negative. He's only been here half a season and already there's a sense of positivity surrounding the club that hasn't been there for years.

Likewise, I'd rather we keep Kelly out on the wing (allowing us to say we have 5 FB's in Johnson, Enrique, Robbo, Flanno, and Kelly). Widsom is a bit of a question mark for me. Where is he going to settle? He appears to have the pace and positional awareness to at least pass at FB (better than Flanno and Robbo have recently), but will we miss his size in the middle? 

What it boils down to for me is that we need EITHER a top flight FB or CB to rotate with either Enrique and Johnson, or Agger and Skrtel.

All whilst ring-fencing money for the new stadium and seeing the new training complex open.

Let's be honest, we do not have it too badly at our club and we certainly don't have a Chairman (like Villa do in Randy Lerner) who never takes his wallet out.

This squad is good enough to get us in the Top 4 over the first half of the season, and I don't see why they won't be good enough to complete the job.

It's all perfectly well defined. You just don't know how because you don't live here. You just need to be on your way to or from a legal task that needs a knife.

You might not like it, but  it's very straightforward.

&gt;  could understand having repercussions for waving the damn thing around threatening people or committing a crime with it, but getting locked up for just carrying one around seems a bit extreme, especially in the case of the OP where, according to him, he didn't seem to have any malicious intent.

The problems we have with knife crime aren't with people waving them about or threatening people with it, but with stabbings, where often no one will see the knife.

The OP brought a locking knife, that is one designed for both stabbing and concealment, into a club that has such a problem with knife crime that they need metal detectors on the door. This means it was probably a designated knife crime hotspot, and the police and security didn't have any discretion about whether or not to escalate this.

&gt; Right at the end of the interview, Luis Suarez delivers the line that will bring some light to a rather dark week at Liverpool Football Club. 
Asked what he will do if Liverpool do not qualify for the Champions League this season, Suarez is cryptic at first. And then, unexpectedly, categorical.

&gt; 'I will wait until the end of the season and see how we are doing,' he says. 'We won't know until then how we are doing and what our position is so I am prepared to wait until that time. 

&gt; 'But I want to say now that, if you want to know what will happen to me if we don't qualify for the Champions League, then I will say this: I have a contract with Liverpool and I am very happy here. I will stay.'

&gt; Suarez has said some peculiar things during his Anfield stay but here, in a small interview room at the club's Melwood training centre, the Uruguayan is right on message. It is perhaps as well. 

&gt; There have been times this season when one wonders exactly what would have happened to Liverpool had it not been for their remarkable striker. 

&gt; Suarez is the kid who used to pretend to be Liverpool manager on his PlayStation back home in South America, the kid whose dream came true.

&gt; In 84 games in his two years at Anfield, the  26-year-old has scored 43 goals. Much has been said and written about him during this time that has not been about his football. Although inevitable, given what has happened, it is also unfortunate when he remains one of the most remarkable talents in the game.

&gt; Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard paid his team-mate - and the man who captained the side in Gerrard's absence last weekend - the most striking tribute, telling newspapers Suarez is the best centre forward he has featured alongside in his decade-and-a-half in professional football. 
When I mention to Suarez that this moves to one side players such as Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Fernando Torres and, with England, Wayne Rooney, he puffs out his cheeks. Briefly, he looks like that teenager at home in Montevideo again.

&gt; 'I get goose pimples when I hear he said that,' said Suarez. 'In my country, we call it Carne de Gallina. Like the skin of a chicken. That's how I feel.

&gt; 'Gerrard is such a good player and what he said about me I will never forget. It's unbelievable. He has such a good record over many years in the English game and is a great example to all the players here, especially to me. 

&gt; 'We all respect him. He has won almost everything and if anything goes wrong on the pitch he never tells the players off. He just speaks to them afterwards and when he speaks to them you can take it as a fact that he is right. He is just trying to help people.

&gt; 'Steven has also said things to me in private that I will never forget, about things that have happened and things that I can do here. These are conversations that players have. People don't hear them but they are so important. They make a difference to a person like me, to my career and my life. 

&gt; 'The ones we had are private but say everything about him. Steven has given me motivation to carry on and do well with what he has said. He has helped me hugely.'

&gt; The last time Liverpool came close to winning the Barclays Premier League, in 2009, Gerrard's relationship with Torres almost got them home. Four seasons on, the Gerrard-Suarez axis is just as important, even if the team's current horizons are more modest.

&gt; Suarez rightly hopes his time at Anfield may bring him a league title. He is contracted until the summer of 2016. For Gerrard, though, time is beginning to run out.

&gt; 'It's incredible that Steven hasn't won a championship,' said Suraez. 'Crazy. It must be like having a fishbone stuck in his throat. It is permanently irritating to him. I can't really believe it. You still have to recognise he is an outstanding player. 

&gt; 'He is a legend in the club and has lifted the Champions League for this club. That makes him special. After all, how many players in Europe have actually done that?' 

&gt; As we talk - with the help of an interpreter - Suarez pours water from a flask to make the traditional South American hot drink Mate (pronounced mah-te).

&gt; 'It wakes me up in the morning,' he says. On the flask is a sticker carrying the name and face of his two-year-old daughter, Delfina. More observant readers will realise the name is an anagram of Anfield. That is a coincidence but the fact Suarez kisses the right wrist every time he scores a goal is not.

&gt; 'I kiss the back of my ring finger first of all,' he said. 'That's because of my wife and all I owe her. Then I kiss the wrist because I have my daughter's name there on a tattoo.' 

&gt; View the video below **(note: it's the gif of her from the FA Cup game against Man United last season)** and you will see wonderfully moving footage of Suarez and young Delfina.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; 'She is two-and-a-half and she can sing the complete song in English, the complete song,' said Suarez with a laugh.

&gt; 'I haven't taught her it, honestly. She learned it by coming to matches. She has always come, even as a baby.

&gt; 'Now she likes to have a scarf, too, so that she can wave it at the start when everybody sings. My wife, Sofia, and her always come to the home matches, whatever time they are. That's important to me. They are the most important people to watch me.

&gt; 'It's especially important for my little girl to see her papa at work. She was actually very good for me and helpful during my difficult times here in England as when I came home - no matter what had happened - she was there welcoming me with a smile. These are the things that I never forget.'

&gt; The tale of Suarez's courtship with Sofia is a love story in the traditional sense. Having met her when they were teenagers, Suarez - whose parents had separated - was so poor as a young player at Nacional that he found ingenious ways to sustain what was a fragile courtship.
 
&gt; 'When I was playing for Nacional in Montevideo, the players who lived outside the city would be given money by the club to get there and back on the bus,' he said. 

&gt; 'I lived in Montevideo, though, so I never got any money. I was not entitled. 'Sometimes, though, I would tell them a little lie. I would say I had to make a journey to see someone in my family. I would get the money and that would enable me and Sofia to go out for dinner.'
Despite his efforts, the night Sofia prepared to travel to Barcelona to study was still a desperate one. The young couple wept together at a bus stop. 

&gt; 'We started when we were very young,' he said. 'It was difficult as I had no money to support us and when she went to Barcelona I had no money to go with her. I didn't even have enough money to communicate with her while she was there.'

&gt; Ultimately, Suarez's move to Dutch club Groningen in 2006 kick-started his career and saved his relationship. Given 12 days off on arrival to settle in, he instead travelled to Barcelona. He returned 10 days later with Sofia in tow and the couple have never looked back. It is a relationship that sustains him.

&gt; It is not hard to wonder how he would have coped during the troubles of the last 18 months had he been simply another young footballer alone in a foreign city.

&gt; 'We had some hard times when we were young but we have conquered those problems,' he said. 

&gt; 'She is special and it's an important relationship in lots of ways. She can he hard with me, though. 

&gt; 'Sofia says that when she sees me with such anger on the field, people will think I am like that at home and think I am always an angry person. Of course, at home I am different. I am completely calm but she thinks people won't know that.

&gt; 'She does tell me off when I misbehave on the field and I hope that has helped me become calmer. I much prefer being told off by Brendan Rodgers than by my wife. Brendan is more careful than my wife with what he says.' 

&gt; On the Monday morning we meet, Liverpool are reflecting on a defeat the previous day by Oldham in the FA Cup. Later that day, Rodgers is to use a press conference to leave a sizeable lump of criticism at the door of his younger players. Suarez is not included in the criticism. He had scored, just as he did on Wednesday at Arsenal. He may have erred at times in England but he has dragged his club manfully through the first half of the season with performances that make you wonder what he may achieve if Rodgers can surround him with the players he needs.

&gt; I ask Suarez why Liverpool are yet to beat anybody better than Sunderland in the league this season and whether some team-mates share the desire to scavenge for points the way he does.

&gt; 'This is the way it is at the moment,' he said. 'Sometimes we play well, as good as being in the top four of the Premier League. Then other times we don't play anywhere near as well. It's just one of those things with football. As a player I just want to win every match but sometimes we just don't play well enough. 

&gt; 'Every player feels differently about playing football. We are all different people. I am the type who wants to win all the time. I hate to lose. What I can say is the younger players here are very good and the good thing is that many of them are home grown. That means they have a passion for the club. I am sure they are doing the best they can. 

&gt; 'This year we are playing well against lower teams and are winning. Last year we were not winning those type of games.

&gt; 'We are hoping we can do better against the big teams. If we do we have a chance. We have to become stronger in our minds.

&gt; 'Look at the Manchester United game (Liverpool lost 2-1). The second half at United was actually very good. We were better than them. In that moment, mentally we were very good and this is the way we should play every week. We actually left the stadium happy, even though we lost. 

&gt; 'We would like to qualify for the Champions League if possible. If we are able to do that the title will be something for the future. 

&gt; 'The culture of the manager here is good. The players like the way he makes us play and once the players become more mature they will be able to win the championship.' 

&gt; Suarez's relationship with Rodgers will clearly be key to his future at Anfield in many ways. The Liverpool manager has sought to educate his star player in different ways this season.

&gt; 'All my managers have asked me not to talk so much on the field,' he said. 'I used to gesture quite a lot during matches. Many managers have told me to behave better on the field and that is good. 

&gt; 'Myself, though, my style of playing is to show my passion and that is the way I am. I will never allow that to be taken out of me. 

&gt; 'I have much to thank Brendan for, though, and he knows how much I appreciate this. He always praises me in public and that helps me a lot. It takes some pressure off me. 

&gt; 'This is really a great club. From being a young boy people want to play here. That's why I came here. It's a dream come true. 

&gt; 'You can ask my friends and my brothers and they will tell you. Four or five years ago I always played as Liverpool when I was on the PlayStation. Of course I used to win all the matches.

Right at the end of the interview, Luis Suarez delivers the line that will bring some light to a rather dark week at Liverpool Football Club. Asked what he will do if Liverpool do not qualify for the Champions League this season, Suarez is cryptic at first. And then, unexpectedly, categorical. 'I will wait until the end of the season and see how we are doing,' he says. 'We won't know until then how we are doing and what our position is so I am prepared to wait until that time.

Keeping count: Luis Suarez eyes his season's tally of 17 Premier League goals, notched on the post

'But I want to say now that, if you want to know what will happen to me if we don't qualify for the Champions League, then I will say this: I have a contract with Liverpool and I am very happy here. I will stay.' Suarez has said some peculiar things during his Anfield stay but here, in a small interview room at the club's Melwood training centre, the Uruguayan is right on message. It is perhaps as well. There have been times this season when one wonders exactly what would have happened to Liverpool had it not been for their remarkable striker. Suarez is the kid who used to pretend to be Liverpool manager on his PlayStation back home in South America, the kid whose dream came true.

On target: The Uruguyan scored in Liverpool's 2-2 draw at Arsenal on Wednesday night

In 84 games in his two years at Anfield, the 26-year-old has scored 43 goals. Much has been said and written about him during this time that has not been about his football. Although inevitable, given what has happened, it is also unfortunate when he remains one of the most remarkable talents in the game. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard paid his team-mate -and the man who captained the side in Gerrard's absence last weekend - the most striking tribute, telling newspapers Suarez is the best centre forward he has featured alongside in his decade-and-a-half in professional football. When I mention to Suarez that this moves to one side players such as Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Fernando Torres and, with England, Wayne Rooney, he puffs out his cheeks. Briefly, he looks like that teenager at home in Montevideo again. 'I get goose pimples when I hear he said that,' said Suarez. 'In my country, we call it Carne de Gallina. Like the skin of a chicken. That's how I feel. 'Gerrard is such a good player and what he said about me I will never forget. It's unbelievable. He has such a good record over many years in the English game and is a great example to all the players here, especially to me. 'We all respect him. He has won almost everything and if anything goes wrong on the pitch he never tells the players off. He just speaks to them afterwards and when he speaks to them you can take it as a fact that he is right. He is just trying to help people.

High five: Steven Gerrard described Suarez as the best centre forward he has played alongside in his career

'Steven has also said things to me in private that I will never forget, about things that have happened and things that I can do here. These are conversations that players have. People don't hear them but they are so important. They make a difference to a person like me, to my career and my life. 'The ones we had are private but say everything about him. Steven has given me motivation to carry on and do well with what he has said. He has helped me hugely.' The last time Liverpool came close to winning the Barclays Premier League, in 2009, Gerrard's relationship with Torres almost got them home. Four seasons on, the Gerrard-Suarez axis is just as important, even if the team's current horizons are more modest. Suarez rightly hopes his time at Anfield may bring him a league title. He is contracted until the summer of 2016. For Gerrard, though, time is beginning to run out.

Surprise: Suarez is stunned that Liverpool captain Gerrard has never won a championship during his career

'It's incredible that Steven hasn't won a championship,' said Suraez. 'Crazy. It must be like having a fishbone stuck in his throat. It is permanently irritating to him. I can't really believe it. You still have to recognise he is an outstanding player. 'He is a legend in the club and has lifted the Champions League for this club. That makes him special. After all, how many players in Europe have actually done that?' As we talk - with the help of an interpreter - Suarez pours water from a flask to make the traditional South American hot drink Mate (pronounced mah-te). 'It wakes me up in the morning,' he says. On the flask is a sticker carrying the name and face of his two-year-old daughter, Delfina. More observant readers will realise the name is an anagram of Anfield. That is a coincidence but the fact Suarez kisses the right wrist every time he scores a goal is not.

Family matters:Suarez poses with his wife Sofia and daughter Delfina at Anfield

'I kiss the back of my ring finger first of all,' he said. 'That's because of my wife and all I owe her. Then I kiss the wrist because I have my daughter's name there on a tattoo.' View the video below and you will see wonderfully moving footage of Suarez and young Delfina. In the clip, she is standing on her father's knee in the Main Stand at Anfield. As You'll Never Walk Alone drifts from the public address system, the toddler holds aloft a Liverpool scarf. 'She is two-and-a-half and she can sing the complete song in English, the complete song,' said Suarez with a laugh. 'I haven't taught her it, honestly. She learned it by coming to matches.

That's important to me. They are the most important people to watch me. 'It's especially important for my little girl to see her papa at work. She was actually very good for me and helpful during my difficult times here in England as when I came home - no matter what had happened - she was there welcoming me with a smile. These are the things that I never forget.' The tale of Suarez's courtship with Sofia is a love story in the traditional sense. Having met her when they were teenagers, Suarez - whose parents had separated - was so poor as a young player at Nacional that he found ingenious ways to sustain what was a fragile courtship. 'When I was playing for Nacional in Montevideo, the players who lived outside the city would be given money by the club to get there and back on the bus,' he said. 'I lived in Montevideo, though, so I never got any money. I was not entitled. 'Sometimes, though, I would tell them a little lie. I would say I had to make a journey to see someone in my family. I would get the money and that would enable me and Sofia to go out for dinner.' Despite his efforts, the night Sofia prepared to travel to Barcelona to study was still a desperate one. The young couple wept together at a bus stop. 'We started when we were very young,' he said. 'It was difficult as I had no money to support us and when she went to Barcelona I had no money to go with her. I didn't even have enough money to communicate with her while she was there.' Ultimately, Suarez's move to Dutch club Groningen in 2006 kick-started his career and saved his relationship. Given 12 days off on arrival to settle in, he instead travelled to Barcelona. He returned 10 days later with Sofia in tow and the couple have never looked back. It is a relationship that sustains him. It is not hard to wonder how he would have coped during the troubles of the last 18 months had he been simply another young footballer alone in a foreign city.

Net gains: The Liverpool striker scores against Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny on Wednesday night

'We had some hard times when we were young but we have conquered those problems,' he said. 'She is special and it's an important relationship in lots of ways. She can he hard with me, though. 'Sofia says that when she sees me with such anger on the field, people will think I am like that at home and think I am always an angry person. Of course, at home I am different. I am completely calm but she thinks people won't know that. 'She does tell me off when I misbehave on the field and I hope that has helped me become calmer. I much prefer being told off by Brendan Rodgers than by my wife. Brendan is more careful than my wife with what he says.' On the Monday morning we meet, Liverpool are reflecting on a defeat the previous day by Oldham in the FA Cup. Later that day, Rodgers is to use a press conference to leave a sizeable lump of criticism at the door of his younger players. Suarez is not included in the criticism. He had scored, just as he did on Wednesday at Arsenal. He may have erred at times in England but he has dragged his club manfully through the first half of the season with performances that make you wonder what he may achieve if Rodgers can surround him with the players he needs. I ask Suarez why Liverpool are yet to beat anybody better than Sunderland in the league this season and whether some team-mates share the desire to scavenge for points the way he does. 'This is the way it is at the moment,' he said. 'Sometimes we play well, as good as being in the top four of the Premier League. Then other times we don't play anywhere near as well. It's just one of those things with football. As a player I just want to win every match but sometimes we just don't play well enough. 'Every player feels differently about playing football. We are all different people. I am the type who wants to win all the time. I hate to lose. What I can say is the younger players here are very good and the good thing is that many of them are home grown. That means they have a passion for the club. I am sure they are doing the best they can. 'This year we are playing well against lower teams and are winning. Last year we were not winning those type of games.

Partnership: Brendan Rodgers will be integral to Suarez's future at Liverpool

'We are hoping we can do better against the big teams. If we do we have a chance. We have to become stronger in our minds. 'Look at the Manchester United game (Liverpool lost 2-1). The second half at United was actually very good. We were better than them. In that moment, mentally we were very good and this is the way we should play every week. We actually left the stadium happy, even though we lost. 'We would like to qualify for the Champions League if possible. If we are able to do that the title will be something for the future. 'The culture of the manager here is good. The players like the way he makes us play and once the players become more mature they will be able to win the championship.' Suarez's relationship with Rodgers will clearly be key to his future at Anfield in many ways. The Liverpool manager has sought to educate his star player in different ways this season. 'All my managers have asked me not to talk so much on the field,' he said. 'I used to gesture quite a lot during matches. Many managers have told me to behave better on the field and that is good. 'Myself, though, my style of playing is to show my passion and that is the way I am. I will never allow that to be taken out of me. 'I have much to thank Brendan for, though, and he knows how much I appreciate this. He always praises me in public and that helps me a lot. It takes some pressure off me. 'This is really a great club. From being a young boy people want to play here. That's why I came here. It's a dream come true. 'You can ask my friends and my brothers and they will tell you. Four or five years ago I always played as Liverpool when I was on the PlayStation. Of course I used to win all the matches.

Arsenal were there for the taking, if we had pressured them (like, actually pressed them when they had the ball) and attacked in more numbers then we could have won easily. Instead, we only attacked in numbers a handful of times, each time looking threatening. How Rodgers couldn't see this is beyond me.

The good thing is that Rodgers is, in managerial terms, as young as Sterling is in playing terms. He seems to pick things up very quickly so I have no doubt that in time he will learn how to alter things on the pitch in order to benefit the team.

I personally would prefer it. My office lets people work from home on Fridays. My mate has an office where he gets to go home at 3 on Fridays.  Both of these are dependent on nothing being 'urgent'. Then again, economic &amp; political research is rarely urgent.

I think there is a lot of mindset of the 'olden days' in some cases. For example, my old office, which was young and 'hip' had no problem with people having earphones plugged in. My current boss crucified me when he saw me doing it a year and a bit ago, different attitudes.

Each workplace is different, let bosses decide as they go along. However, I suspect that as E-working becomes more common, more flexible working will be molded around employees rather than employers.

true,Xuth,null,null,"'Arms' refers to the [heraldic coats of arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms) which represent families of royal or noble birth, as well as towns, cities and historic guilds. Many pubs take local nobility or landowners into their names. This would have been a tradition of Inns and pubs going back centuries as the importance of the local rich would have been strong. Newer pubs may want to emulate the feeling and atmosphere of older pubs and opt to go with the 'arms' naming convention as well. 



For example - there's a pub near me called the Bedford Arms. Outside on the wall hangs a sign which has a picture of the coat of arms of the town of Bedford. As far as I know it may have been called this in honour of the Duke of Bedford as well. 



Other pubs which don't necessarily use the word 'Arms' may still be referring to local landowners too, by being named after elements of their shield. For example: a Lord may have coat of arms with a black lion on it - and a publican might call his pub The Black Lion. 



There's lots of other naming conventions for public houses [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_names)

One of the issues that the article doesn't really note is that the US government can get rights to access data from companies operating in their country, however the new bill would not permit this under the act if the person was European - the person would have to be asked first.

EDIT: data portability is where I see other issues - can you take your data out of one system and put it in another.  Companies (mainly US ones) will have to spend money making sure this is possible.

The other two things that I like are the increase in the fines that the governments can issue (we in the UK are currently are limited to £500k, but the new rules would go up to €2m) and the insistence of a data protection officer at larger companies whose job it is to make sure everything is right.  The ICO has recently been making some great strides in this area (it had a lot of criticism 18 months - 2 years ago) - there was a £250k fine for Sony for the PSN loss of data - but it is still too slow and doesn't have enough power.

We were shown a house which we decided to take, it was a little dirty but were told it would be professionally cleaned before we moved in fantastic we thought. 
We were allowed to move our things in on the 1st of July but were not allowed to move in till September. when I moved my things in I told them that the house had clearly not been professionally cleaned, and at this point the garden was overgrown, filled with rubbish bags, old tvs and mattresses. I told student digz this, they told me not to worry and it would all be sorted by the time we moved in. 
When september came and we moved in none of these things had been fixed or cleaned, when I complained I was told 'some dust and dirt is bound to appear while the house was empty' . 

We found a list of things that the previous tenants had been charged for, including the removal of TVs , cleaning ect. the previous tenants were charged for this, but none of the things on the list ever happened
so basically student digz stole this money from them, the same way they did when we moved out.
Over christmas we were told that If we could all stay out of the house for a month then they would renovate the house. This included a leaking bath which made the downstairs toiliet roof fall through. Something we were blamed for.
We all stayed away for a month when we returned the house had not changed. expept that the boiler had broken , something which took them three weeks to fix. this was during a cold snap whihch made the insides of our windows freeze over and a can of coke I left out freeze and burst out of the can.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; In this case, a new regulation would offer major improvements over current law. The data protection reforms as proposed by the Commission would consolidate existing data protection rules, would require data breach notification within 24 hours, and would include a “right to be forgotten,” allowing citizens to “delete their data if there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it.”

Sounds pretty reasonable to me. Americans being irritating bastards yet again.

It also includes provisions to allow data portability; Facebook has a huge vested interest in keeping your data to do whatever they like with but this legislation seems to be aimed at saying ""no, I want to be anonymous"" or, more subtly, ""I want to switch to this service instead of yours"" which would actually be quite good for competition; we won't get locked in to a facebook or a google because it wouldn't be legal for them to do so. 

There are further plans to prohibit the use of data for profiling and advertising without your permission.

I think this is important; a lot of people will cry ""but how will they make money!?!?"" but this is a red herring, advertising will still work, it can still even be targeted to demographics better than television, radio, posters or cinemas. What they loose is to build a direct targeted profile they can use to advertise at you; to engineer and design a tool that has the single purpose of manipulating your opinions and actions for the benefit of others.

To me the ability, enshrined in law, to opt out of this is really important. If you couldn't be manipulated, if your opinion couldn't be altered and your actions couldn't be influenced through advertising and marketing companies wouldn't spend billions of dollars doing it. I can't predict the future but I know better than to think, with arrogance, that there isn't an algorithm someone could invent to control me in some way.

Imagine a child is born into the world 20 years from now; at birth he is issued an online profile, her activities are logged; everything she watches, everything she eats, everything she learns, every time she isn't doing anything that can be logged, every time she plays with here friends, exercises, drinks, whatever. By age 25 a machine learning algorithm has developed a ruleset to the extent that it knows, roughly, what advertising she will respond to, can apply a probability to what will titillate and distract her or what she will do if she is exposed to certain stimuli. What if she decides she doesn't like this? What if she decides that the people with this information aren't worthy of trust any more? By opposing this and lobbying against this legislation the US government are, in effect, saying that they don't want this woman to be able to have that choice.

I'm sorry if you feel I resorted to hyperbole here, I'm intentionally avoiding using  any specific examples of what someone might do with this data because I hate the whole ""1984, 1984"" crap you see all over Reddit, my imagination allows something a little more nuanced from this; I imagine this hypothetical machine learning algorithm that is yet to be fully developed as a sort of life companion that follows you everywhere and understands you better than you understand yourself. Sort of like a husband for the woman I discussed before, I just think that this woman should be allowed to leave this relationship if she thinks it's become too abusive and no corporation or government should be able to stop her from making this choice.

If a guy from a foreign country known for it's lax attitude to weapons in general goes to a club and pulls out a tiny knife then openly puts it in the fucking dish for the metal detector you can be pretty sure he didn't have it with the intent to stab someone. 

If I was a policeman and you brought this guy to me I'd work out within a 2 minute conversation that this was clearly an innocent situation based on naivety of the law because of the guys actions and where he's from. I'd be able to distinguish between this and violent criminals roaming the street with knives with the intent of using them. This is why the police should use discretion and not robotically follow the law to the letter. 

&gt;Knife crime is a huge problem in London and if not being able to carry around a knife that you have no realistic chance of using helps to solve it then so be it.

We have thousands and thousands of knife related crime regardless of the law just as we do with drugs. Illegality doesn't stop many people from doing things it just stops those who would probably never have done anything wrong in the first place.

Given that they hold a respectable degree in the medical profession (which actually took longer to get than my Engineering masters), and provided that my ailment is not serious enough for me to want to visit a doctor, I personally would be inclined to take their advice.

What so we should just get rid of all the knife laws because criminals are breaking them? You can't really compare this to drugs, because drug crime is fairly contingent on it being illegal in a way that knife crime isn't - if we were to get rid of the drug laws then much of the associated crime would (in theory at least) disappear, but if you get rid of knife laws people will still stab each other. The only benefit that relaxing knife laws would have is that people could carry knifes to protect themselves from other people knifes and that is a pretty stupid argument - just change knifes for guns and you have the same thing we're all laughing at the US for.

If we actually showed interest in other strikers, we could actually buy them, or Inter would realize our eyes are elsewhere and maybe play a bit easier in regards to the transfer.  But I think we should have stopped pursuing at the beginning of this window, it seems from the media that it was never that likely anyways.

I can't decide between Carragher and Skrtel. Agger can't possibly sit this one out, so it's got to be between the two of them. I might just go with Skrtel, I think Aguero might find Carragher easy to deal with, and will likely stick close to him looking for a through ball (by Silva, probably. Little bugger does all sort of magic tricks) to latch on to.

Midfield we should have the classic Lucas-Gerrard and of course, Henderson. Assuming he isn't in need of a rest.

Up front we have Suarez (I'm a little bit afraid, he did look quite tired in the closing minutes against Arsenal), Sturridge and Downing, like you said. If we decide to drop Suarez (due to fatigue, and put him on as a sub?) or Sturridge, we should play the remaining one up front and play Downing + Sterling as two strict wingers. Man City fullbacks tend to cover a lot of ground and go up field a lot, since they like to play centrally and don't have a real winger. Having two wingers like that could really help, it discourages the full backs from getting forward since a counterattack (started by Gerrard, he can ping those balls around easily) via the quick legs of Sterling or Downing could easily happen if the full backs are caught up field, and having to deal with a 3 on 2 (or 3) situation.",0,1359734341,null,0,false,0,c87jfx5,t3_17p591,t1_c87jfx5,t3_17p591,null,1431151545,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

&gt; You can't see anything wrong with the idea of a doctor lying to their patients?

The GP isn't lying. The placebo effect is real, so they will genuinely feel better.  The GP simply has to make it clear the homeopathic treatment is pharmacologically inert.  This is commonly done by saying something like ""Well as a man of science I don't believe homopathy works, there is nothing in it that could possibly treat your problem, but if you want to try it, do so, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong""

Presented with a patient that says they fear putting chemicals in their body and favour homeopathic treatments, the correct policy is to respect the patient's views and find a suitable treatment that works for them. Remember magic pills will likely work for them for certain ailments, the placebo effect is real, it is observable, but we don't yet fully understand it.

If the treatment should be a course of antibiotics, then no, homeopathy shouldn't be used, and the doctor needs to explain that to the patient.

But for some things, magic pills are likely to work as well as conventional medicine. You can't just ignore the science behind the placebo effect and its power to be an effective treatment simply because you don't like homeopathy. 

If you're interested in this I'd recommend reading The Lie That Heals: The Ethics of Giving Placebos.

(Of course, by nothing I mean ridiculous amounts of job searching to appease my mighty overlords.)

I'm still going to take the job, and do the best I can, and hope for occasional overtime, but still, the system is failing me.  I'll make this clear before the usual trolls reply, I'd do full time if it had been offered, but it's not, so I'm doing what I can to get off JSA and into work, yet I'm being financially punished for it.  Without wishing to knock the company that's hired me, they're offering about half full time hours, when it's fairly obvious that they could have taken on half the people full time instead.  I'm guessing there's enormous perks to having part time workers in terms of tax, benefits, flexibility etc.

I've phoned around and everyone agrees that it's wrong and it shouldn't be happening, but they can't do anything about it.

At a time when part time jobs are all employers are offering in many cases, we need to make sure they're an attractive option against JSA.

Sure we'll have to pay benefits to part timers, but it'll be less than the unemployed.

OF course, IDS has already got onto this problem, promising more cuts to welfare so I'll be comparitively better off than on JSA.

How foolish of me to want my money to go up instead of everyone elses to go down.

2. The young girl is afraid because she believes there is something in her bedroom that shouldn’t be there. She’s right. (“Prisoner Zero has escaped” and the crack in Amelia’s wall; the Clockwork men in Reinette’s room)
3. This ‘something’ has come through an alien portal. (The crack in the universe in the wall, the fireplace in the bedroom)
4. The Doctor appears and reappears several times throughout the girl’s life as she grows up. 
5. he ‘something’ has been there with the girl, now a young woman, her entire life. It has disguised itself to blend in and has not been noticed. (Prisoner Zero and its ability to morph, the Clockwork men and their clothing)
6. Throughout the years of waiting for the Doctor to reappear, the girl has grown attached to him, yet she still finds love in another man. (Rory Williams, King Louis XV)
7. The Doctor closes the portal and saves the girl.

She was more useful in half an hour than everything I'd experienced in the 3 months before that, and that includes the 90 minute mandatory 'back to work training session' that suggested I should have a CV and apply for jobs, well, thanks for that.

If I had my way, we'd get all the private companies out of the system, use half that money to fund voluntary organisations who help the unemployed find work, as they're doing it for the right reason in the first place, and extra money would only help them do it better, and the volunteers did so much more for me than any paid staff (excepting the lovely advisor I got at the end.)

I'd also move the focus away from trying to trick people into making a 'sanctionable' mistake, and devote that effort into helping people find work, and if that's not currently viable, into training and volunteer work.

Getting people into any old job is short term, and leads to them being unemployed again soon.

Getting people into a worthwhile job that they feel comfortable doing...that leads to long term employment, and it's better for everyone.

I keep on saying, dumping highly skilled people into cleaning jobs, retail, food service jobs and the like, just means there's no vacancies left for the lesser skilled who'd have fitted those jobs far better, and the skilled worker is left underused and demoralised.

900MHz and 2100MHz spectrum is already assigned to the networks and is already used for 2G and/or 3G. 1800MHz is the other band, and is currently already used for 2G and 4G (by EE and soon, Three). What OFCOM is doing is permitting 4G services on every band that is currently in use - this seems logical considering that EE already have permission to use 1800MHz and O2/Vodafone have already got permission to use their 2G spectrum for 3G. All of the operators will be able to use any of their existing spectrum for any service.

800MHz is new spectrum that has been taken from broadcast television.

&gt; This is commonly done by saying something like ...

Brilliant. It isn't lying. It's deliberately playing on the ignorance of the patient. How can you say that, when faced with a patient who does not understand the treatment given, the correct policy is to go along with their ignorance rather than, I don't know, educate them? Why would you fortify someone's belief in 'medicine' that does not work and cannot work by any useful definition of the word? Why would you let homeopaths advertise theirs wares ""as endorsed by the NHS""? Why would you risk patients turning to a homeopath for future treatment? What happens to those patients whose source of medical information is now a person who fails to grasp basic chemistry? What happens when they come down with something serious, something that requires actual medicine rather the cargo cult medicine of placebo?

""Gee"", they think, ""homeopathy worked so well last time I was ill, and Dave over the road says that homeopath lady on the High Street was ever so attentive."" And then they die slowly and painfully of something pathetic because the only thing they took for it was a sweetie.  

/end rant

You seem to be having trouble separating the idea of using a placebo and using any particular non-medicine as a placebo. While I personally disagree with prescription of any kind of placebo by doctors, yes, the placebo effect is real (though its actual benefits are generally much less than studies show) but no, qualified doctors should never prescribe non-medicines based on pseudoscience. The long term effects of reinforcing misinformation and legitimizing pseudoscience will always outweigh any short term benefits to the patient.

Had we the audience seen some human element of Jackie Tyler in that cyberman we would have reacted differently. Anger, vengance, sadness, maybe even a sense of closure to her being taken earlier in that story. With her complete conversion we're denied that and our focus moves from the emotional loss of Jackie to the reinforcement of the power and threat of the cybermen. That's also why Ricky had to die. The killing off of familiar faces, even though we know they aren't ""our versions"", made the cyberman threat that much more menacing for  the audience."")

My local: probably a once quite grotty North London boozer, still looks like that at the back half with the odd pool table and big screen and sparsely scattered chairs.

Out front, somewhat gentrified, old leather sofas mixed with normal pub tables, not especially expensively gentrified though. My area's got a huge mix of incomes so I think they try to make everyone feel comfortable.

Pub food: typical burger and chips and stuff, though you can also get eggs florentine. 

Customers: very mixed.

Atmosphere: usually quite quiet. Some young couples/groups of friends, some older hardcore drinkers in their 70s and locals who have lived here for years. Never seen any trouble. Busiest I've ever seen it was for the Olympics opening ceremony when it was probably half full. 

Lols: pub bands. Always comedy boards with Friday's entertainment outside. I've never had the pleasure of hearing any of them though. 

Booze: they seem to get decent guest ales in quite often. Not seen a cocktail list. Which is as it should be. 

Overall, it's a bit of a confused pub, can't quite make up its mind what it wants to be when it grows up. It's not a posh gastropub nor a local dive, and maybe that's why it's never packed on a Friday night. Or maybe people just generally don't have much money where I live, and those who do go 15 minutes up the road where it's absolutely heaving full of pubs, bars and restaurants (but they can't quite afford to live there).

I have consistently stated we shouldn't be spending millions on it. Done properly, tap water can be value for money compared with real drug expenditure.

&gt;  How can you say that, when faced with a patient who does not understand the treatment given, the correct policy is to go along with their ignorance rather than, I don't know, educate them? 

Doctors do try to educate, they won't recommend homeopathy on the first visit, but faced with a patient who choses nothing if they can't have magic pills, the doctor should work them to achieve an acceptable outcome.

&gt; You seem to be having trouble separating the idea of using a placebo and using any particular non-medicine as a placebo.

Nope. I'm favour of using anything that works. But for a placebo to work , the patient must believe it works, and in some circumstances that will mean using magic pills as that will tap into their belief system better.

&gt; while I personally disagree with prescription of any kind of placebo by doctors, yes, the placebo effect is real (though its actual benefits are generally much less than studies show)

In other words you believe in the scientific method until it disagrees with you and then you dismiss it.  



&gt; but no, qualified doctors should never prescribe non-medicines based on pseudoscience

The placebo effect isn't pseudoscience.

&gt; The long term effects of reinforcing misinformation and legitimizing pseudoscience will always outweigh any short term benefits to the patient.

Always outweigh?  Such a position screams fundamentalism. A terminally ill patient sick of drugs and wanting some ""traditional"" pain relief would be forced in your world to spend their dying days suffering, because come hell or high water you aren't going to humour their wish for magic pills.


Homeopathy is dangerous. It does encourage people to avoid medicine and risk their lives.

But, a doctor's first duty is the patient in front of them. High minded plans to eradicate homeopathy for the long term benefit of the public is all very well, but that isn't the GP's primary concern.  You cannot and should not refuse to treat a patient or allow a patient to refuse treatment, when you know there is an alternative solution that may work.

What you have done is an offence, I assume that you had no reasonable excuse for having it. Especially if you were on a night out. A reasonable excuse would be along the lines of a carpenter carrying a Stanley knife for work. It was just there and you forgot about it. Having forgotten about it does not count as a reasonable excuse. Given that we have youth knife crime problems especially around night clubs and so on, these matters are taken seriously.

As for leaving the country, stay here, answer to bail until the matter is closed. I'm not sure why you were bailed but I imagine that there are some other enquires going on, ie getting statements from the door staff, getting CCTV from the club, that kind of thing. Most likely, its a first time offence, there doesn't appear to be any malice in carrying the knife, I'd say you're most likely to get a very, very minimal punishment.  I arrested someone with a fair bit of previous, for being drunk in charge of a vehicle and having a similar blade, he got some unpaid community work. Worst way I'd say its not the end of the world. Just don't go aggravating the situation by leaving the country until the matter is solved or failing to answer to bail. You're on police bail at the moment and its pretty standard.

Yes he will occasionally drop a ball into his own net and he's incredibly erratic with his decision-making, but those mistakes live in the mind far longer than the world class saves he can also make.

09/10 he was one of the biggest reasons we qualified for the Champions League. In games against Arsenal, City, and Chelsea--our 3 most important wins of the season probably--he was absolutely outstanding. 

I know for a fact that our goalkeeping coach Tony Parks rates Gomes very highly, probably higher than Friedel and Cudicini were regarded actually. It's been unfortunate what's happened to him but consistency is probably the most important trait for a keeper and Gomes had a nightmarish stretch in 10/11 that was the end of him.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Gylfi surely has to understand that making a big jump is going to come with a period of acclimation. For some players that period is a few weeks, for others it's an entire season, for others it never happens.

Ultimately he needs to be patient. He has ability and he's shown it coming off the bench. If not for some world class saves and a crossbar he would probably have three game-winning goals in the PL. 

If he looks at the situation right now, he's one injury away from being in the team every week. We have no natural wing cover, so it's Gylfi Dempsey and Holtby who could very well end up on the right or left if one of our wide men is rested or injured.

The only thing he can do is be patient and keep giving his all when he's given chances. AVB's comments about Gylfi are very understanding and will hopefully give him a boost. It's entirely common for new players to have a rough first season only to flourish eventually. And he has to be buoyed by the fact that Dempsey is not going to be around for too many seasons.

Competition for spaces is a feature of our squad, and it's a healthy thing to have. Gylfi can look to Michael Dawson for inspiration. The guy was on the verge of being sold and many of us here (myself included) were absolutely fine with that. But a few poor Caulker performances and suddenly Daws has forced his way back into the team.

Naughton as well. He impressed a few times when given chances, and this resulted in him getting a good run of performances at left back and allowing Vertonghen to play his preferred position. Then he had one or two mediocre games and BAE fought HIS way back into the team.

I don't think Dempsey is undroppable. I think Holtby will start this weekend, but if not, I think Clint will be on a tight leash. Another performance like the one against Norwich and he could drop to 3rd behind Gylfi and Lewis in the pecking order.

Gylfi doesn't strike me as a dumbass, nor does he strike me as particularly unhappy. If he keeps working hard (which he does every time he plays) he will eventually get his reward. Surely he has people in his ear giving him confidence and telling him to keep fighting. Shit, Bale had to fight his ass off to get to where he is.

Does the ""it"" you refer to above refer to law or capitalism?  I'm a fairly reactionary anarchist(!) in that I'm a refugee from the field of law and more than a bit sympathetic to it (or at least the idea of ""justice"").  I think there's value to having consensually agreed laws, but not capitalist laws enforced in capitalist courts.  Those are unjust and imposed, even when they are imposed by trickery and sleight of hand.

&gt;I think part of the problem is that those most interested in any real reform are very poorly organised and/or completely unrealistic. 

That may be so, but sadly, those most oppressed by hierarchy will always be the most disorganised.

&gt;I do think it is the best practicable system of having a large group of people co-habit and be productive.

Why are you so obsessed by productivity?  And the obvious corollary is productive for whom?  Most of history is about power elites trying to squeeze additional labour out of reluctant slaves.

&gt;How do you envisage an Anarchistic society would work better than that?

Better than capitalism?  Better for whom?  Self-directed worker-run enterprises are consistently shown to be more productive in practice than capitalist enterprises, but they are less profitable (and so experiments get cancelled).  So I ask again, productive for whom?  Do we want progress or profit?

Add to that, currently the US has transnational corporations with something like 4 trillion in liquid assets sitting idle; one fifth of the US means of production are rusting away, making nothing, with twelve and a half million (or more, depending on how you count) million Americans rusting and sitting idle too.  18.6 million empty homes in America, but 3.5 million homeless, between 6 and 25 empty homes per homeless person.

Do you use 'obsessed', because I'm targeting the most obvious flaw in your system? You kind of answered your own question too. Those who are more productive, are more powerful.

Productive, as in, adding value. So profits are key to this. I could pay someone a million pounds to make toothpicks. They would be really happy and produce plenty of toothpicks, but I would be out of pocket because it would be ridiculously inefficient. To keep the business running, I would have to charge higher prices, and a capitalist company would take the entire market share.

I've run out of steam, trying to argue with a ton of people who aren't happy that you need to be useful to succeed in the world. I'm getting spamming delays from reddit so this is going to be my last reply.

* Communism doesn't work. What's up USSR!
* What makes you think that an even less organised ideaology would work
* There's such a thing as cash reserves. What's the point in investing if there's nothing profitable to invest in?
*Capitalism isn't perfect, but in relative terms, it might as well be compared to any idealist approach that reckons we'd all sit back round the campfire, toke on a j, and all be mates.

&gt; If it's on the NHS they aren't getting ripped off

I say again, either it's value for money or it isn't. If it isn't then people are getting ripped off. You can't say ""Its not a rip off cause we could pay less if we wanted to"". We aren't and it is.

&gt; but faced with a patient who choses nothing if they can't have magic pills, the doctor should work them to achieve an acceptable outcome.

This falls under the concession I made at the end of my post which I see you misinterpreted, but we'll get to that. If the only option is to give the patient a placebo they should still not be given homeopathy, but a non-specific placebo instead. 

&gt; But for a placebo to work , the patient must believe it works, 

[Perhaps not true.](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015591) I believe it is the case that playing into people's expectations can increase the effect but again this would fall under the concession I made.

&gt; In other words you believe in the scientific method until it disagrees with you and then you dismiss it. 

I can't imagine where you think the scientific method fits into this or how I have dismissed it. You completely misunderstand me. I do not agree with prescribing placebos because of the implications, ethical or otherwise, of doing so. [Ben Goldacre on the subject.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=wsFTgirKXHk#t=199s)

&gt;The placebo effect isn't pseudoscience.

Again, you misunderstand, I did not state the placebos are pseudoscience. Qualified doctors should never prescribe non-medicines based on pseudoscience - such as homeopathy. To be explicit my stance is thus: prescribing any kind of placebo, I disagree with the practice for reasons other than the direct effects, prescribing pseudoscience that only works as a placebo? *Definitely not.*

&gt; Always outweigh? Such a position screams fundamentalism. 

Perhaps so and in your deliciously extreme example I would not suggest such a cruel action. But I would not make the mistake of expanding the charade to family of the patient so that they are lied to and misled. And I certainly wouldn't tell them all I gave Gramma a homeopathic remedy so that they can go and tell their friends how much help it was.

&gt; High minded plans to eradicate homeopathy for the long term benefit of the public is all very well, but that isn't the GP's primary concern.

It really should be. And for a body such as the NHS, it certainly is. 

I simply do not agree that the wider and longer term situation should be worsened for the benefit of a stubborn patient here and now.

This is a bit of a capitalist meme.  Adding value, what the fuck does it mean?  Labour adds value.  But what capitalists mean seems to be ""can I get a premium profit from it?""  So for them, value is added by sales and marketing people, which is just nonsense.

&gt; I could pay someone a million pounds to make toothpicks. They would be really happy and produce plenty of toothpicks, but I would be out of pocket because it would be ridiculously inefficient. 

So to encapsulate - efficiency - for you - is the profit margin?  The NHS is hopelessly inefficient because there is no profit?

&gt;I've run out of steam, trying to argue with a ton of people who aren't happy that you need to be useful to succeed in the world. I'm getting spamming delays from reddit so this is going to be my last reply.

I really genuinely sympathise with this.  I wish reddit would find an algorithm which can distinguish between an ""unpopular"" argument in a well attended debate, and spam.

&gt;Communism doesn't work. What's up USSR!

I'd say communism hasn't been implemented on a societal level ever.  There are plenty of examples of communism in the world though.  Several Silicon Valley start-ups are communist. I'm not actually a communist though, I'm a moderate! :-)

&gt;What makes you think that an even less organised ideaology would work

Baukunin (an anarchist) provided Marx/Lenin with a fairly clear picture what would happen in the USSR, there was a bit of a debate, but it's pretty obvious who was right.  The anarchists won the theoretical debate, they lost the military battles.  Hopefully, next time we'll get to try our ideas without the Stalinists and fascists and capitalists ganging up on us?

For drinks they do 2 guest ales which change a little too often, then they have a couple of west german style largers , a larger and lime is about as an exotic a cocktail as they would do.

The pub is also full of lots of working musical instruments ranging from guitar to an accordion all for anyone to pick and play on an evening .

Also I'm so happy we have a player who lurks between the lines, demanding the ball and finding space.

I'm convinced it's something that can't really be taught. There are players who just naturally drift into the right spots and it helps teams flow so much. 

Also he has the balls to play forward passes which is shockingly lacking in our midfield. I don't care if his pass completion % ends up at ~80 every single match: he tries to make shit happen and he has the ability to do it.

It took him all of 5 seconds to complete a more incisive pass than anyone on our team did the entire match.

1.	I do not agree with the coach that our interest in Damiao is over. Yesterday, I was following the live transfer news on a couple of websites and was hoping the news that Spurs get Damiao will suddenly appear on my screen. Unfortunately, this did not happen but I am sure we will not give up and will get the Brazilian striker in the summer. 
2.	I think it would have been better if we had accepted Reading’s offer for Gylfi. He did not manage to establish himself in the starting eleven and with the arrival of Holtby, his playing time will be further reduced. According to media reports, the Royals were offering around £10m and this is a big sum for a reserve player. We could have used some of this money to make a better offer for Damiao. We have many attacking midfielders but we lack strikers! It’s really tough to play the whole season with JD and Ade only.
3.	Our transfer target Willian left Shakhtar to join Anji. The rich Russians paid €35m for the transfer and beat the Premier League competition. I have watched the extremely skilful Brazilian quite a few times and for me he is one of the best wingers in world football. I would love to see Willian at Tottenham but we already have a fantastic left winger – Gareth Bale!

Oderint dum metuant. 

Or as Patrick Bateman put it 

&gt; there is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there. It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. Myself is fabricated, an aberration. I am a noncontingent human being. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent. My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago (probably at Harvard) if they ever did exist. There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed. I still, though, hold on to one single bleak truth: no one is safe, nothing is redeemed. Yet I am blameless. Each model of human behavior must be assumed to have some validity. Is evil something you are? Or is it something you do? My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this—and I have, countless times, in just about every act I’ve committed—and coming face-to-face with these truths, there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new understanding can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing.

Maybe successful states are a bit like psychopaths in that they do have utter indifference to all the mayhem they have caused. Not apologizing for carpet bombing Nuremburg because you might need to nuke Moscow one day (as Ministers were apparently advised) is pretty psychopathic for a person but maybe states really are beyond good and evil.",0,1359758834,null,0,1359762663,0,c87s4p0,t3_17pdap,t1_c87s4p0,t3_17pdap,null,1431155785,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

This.  Traditionally we are quite a conservative people who are taught not to display public emotion (although not to the extent of the Japanese).  Think of the stiff-upper lip, and antiquated notions of decency and politeness, of how self-deprecating our humour can be, and what-not.  Historically it was considered embarrassing for gentlemen to display too much emotion.  

The problem with this is that we are also inwardly fussy; we like things ""just so"" and don't particularly care for change.  Ergo, we are doomed to live lives of repression, forever shaking our heads at the way society is going but unable to share our displeasure with anyone else.

In fact, I'll point you to the one of the first chapters of *King Rat* by James Clavell, where King (an American) makes Peter (an Englishman) a fried egg.

true,ItsDare,null,null,"&gt;value is added by sales and marketing people, which is just nonsense.

Adding value is how you turn your product or service from the sum of the raw materials, into something worth more. So that might be giving someone a cup of tea whilst you give them a haircut. It can be your branding, which is a kind of guarantee of the quality to expect from the product.

Well, to call it nonsense clearly isn't fair, as marketing is involved in any business, and is central to some of the biggest businesses in the world (for example Apple). Wrapping a present, that's marketing, that's adding value with the element of surprise. 

I'm not overly fussed about arguing this though. Your next point irked me a little though.

&gt;The NHS is hopelessly inefficient because there is no profit?

Firstly, not the profit margin, just the profits. Secondly, the NHS is an exceptional case.

The NHS is inefficient. Fact. There is lots of wastage, there are incompetent staff which are hard to get rid of cause they're on government contracts. The fact that they have no risk of failure also encourages them to be lazy.

Hopefully you're not raging just yet. The thing about the NHS is that there are a huge amount of positive externalities from it. It pays to have a healthy country that isn't crippled by hospital bill debt. For that reason, we take the cost of inefficiencies on the chin like a champ.

That's not to say you couldn't privatise the NHS and still get similar results. The problem would come with trying to heavily regulate and subsidise all the healthcare. In our situation, it makes sense not to privatise.

The US system is under-regulated, and a complete clusterfuck as a result.

Summary: NHS good, I'm not a free-market economist, I believe in regulation and nationalisation where it is needed.

&gt;I really genuinely sympathise with this.

Thanks man, I have enjoyed debating with you, as you have provided a reasoned and well thought argument. Others have not (looking at you beard-maketh-the-man). I still believe you're wrong though haha.

As for your last few points... I'd reiterate that, I didn't deny this sort of thing could *function* on a small scale, between trusting parties, just not between strangers and thugs.

Finally, I'd say that winning wars is a fairly key part of being a country. Otherwise you stop being your country, and start being someone else's.

Again, nice ideal, not practicable.

It's been a pleasure.

I do think, and honestly hope, that we're done with Damiao.  I would have been glad to sign him yesterday, but we really need a striker.  My point is more that I think there are better options available, or at least comparable ones, and Damiao, what with third party ownership and Inter's apparent lack of desire to sell, isn't a must have.

I don't like the idea of selling Sig.  At all.  He's our only creative attacking mid after Holtby right now, and we need all the midfield depth we can get.  Dempsey is a different player, so I wouldn't say that Sig in anything less than second choice, not to mention he's only 23.  He has room to grow yet, and I firmly believe he will.  Also, Holtby can spell Dembele if need be, and I'd rather have another creative option when he does in Sig, as opposed to a player like Deuce, who has more of a goal directed mindset.

As for Willian, yeah, he would have been great, but Russia out priced anyone. I'd honestly rather have Son, as he can play striker and cover the wings.",0,1359765606,null,0,1359767305,0,c87u4mm,t3_17pwwf,t1_c87u4mm,t1_c87s1fy,null,1431156726,8,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,8

I know he is one tough motherfucker after seeing some of the beatings he has taken, but his recent form doesnt show that. We have a young world class side with a top shelf training facility, and we paid good money for him... there is absolutely no reason for him not to succeed with us and quite frankly the fact that he hasnt done that is disappointing.

Actually I like comparing the last two episodes of Spearhead From Space to Auton  and The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood to the Silurians. Even though it is essentially the same story, it's fascinating to see how different doctors react to different scenarios on such a great level. 

As for straighter parallels....
I have to say that the TV movie and the eleventh hour have a strange amount of parallels. You have:
1.A shape shifting enemy
2.A plot involving a hospital
3.A newly regenerated doctor
4.Good looking foreign(to england) redhead.
5.Big car scene
6.a sonic screwdriver inherited by the previous incarnation
7.a plot driven by a time limit
8.Clothes stolen from a hospital
9.an intro episode heavy with continuity references
10.New tardis interior(i count the deleted linking scene as ""the eleventh hour"")
11.Skeptical male companion, willing but starting skeptical female
12.Big driving moment for the doctor
13.Emergency tardis landing
14.Previous incarnation seemingly destroyed the daleks for good
15.Doctor mistakenly tries to use sonic to put an end to the enemy
16.The doctor has exactly one REAL confrontation with his enemy and plenty of false starts
17.The big bad uses mind control on companion
18.Both are overly long for a single episode
19.Both are unable to use their tardis for a long stretch of the episode
20.Both stories big bads are captive prisoners at the VERY beginning of the story who escape
21.The tardis exhibits a brand new and unexplained power in the story(tardis regeneration? humans being brought back to life?)",0,1359786714,null,0,false,0,c87z8b1,t3_17p2c3,t1_c87z8b1,t3_17p2c3,null,1431159132,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

So that might be giving someone a cup of tea whilst you give them a haircut. It can be your branding, which is a kind of guarantee of the quality to expect from the product.
&gt;
&gt;Well, to call it nonsense clearly isn't fair, as marketing is involved in any business, and is central to some of the biggest businesses in the world (for example Apple). Wrapping a present, that's marketing, that's adding value with the element of surprise. 

Although it's not fundamental to anarchism in any way, many anarchists would be adherents of one or other of the numerous labour theories of value, which, although usually unfairly and often illogically characterised and derided by neo-classical economists, were the mainstay of classical and Marxian economics and have been usefully updated and largely synthesised with subjectivist approaches by the mutualist Kevin Carson.  From these perspectives, all value derives from labour.

I'm not against all aspects of marketing, I don't quite take it to [Bill Hicks levels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDW_Hj2K0wo) (NSFW language), but I do think much of it is about creating artificial scarcities and using fear-based emotional blackmail to promote consumption, both of which are pretty ugly characteristics of modern corporate capitalism.

&gt;The NHS is inefficient. Fact.

All bureaucracies are inefficient.  Fact.  That includes capitalist corporations.  And in terms of determining relative efficiencies, it's a shell game because [it's based on calculating cost and benefits in a cost-benefit analysis, which means selecting from a potentially infinite set of variables based on arbitrary political considerations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D36R1xXpZk).

Pleased to hear you support the NHS though.

&gt;Thanks man, I have enjoyed debating with you, as you have provided a reasoned and well thought argument.  I still believe you're wrong though haha.

Anarchism is less a destination and more a process anyway, and if I have the slightest impact in helping people to think more anarchistically, or even just less disparagingly about anarchists, I'm doing fine. ;-)

I also agree with you that anarchists need to think far more seriously and creatively about how to defend their gains and communities.  I'm not a fan of bloody revolutions and war, I'm more interested in creation than destruction, but if it comes again to such a costly adventure, I want to be able to say, hand on heart, with good reason to believe it, that the sacrifices are going to be worth it, that we've learnt from the past and won't let the prize be stripped away from us again by enemy States, internal strife or duplicitous allies.",0,1359789460,null,0,false,0,c87zpqr,t3_17pfzy,t1_c87zpqr,t1_c87t1kc,null,1431159428,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Anarchists have done this of course, and continue to pursue such approaches in various ways.  What generally happens is that they are permitted to do so until there's a danger of their community actually working and providing a positive role model for other such communities, ""infecting"" them a la the domino theory if you like, and then excuses are found to shut it down.

David Graeber put it this way in his AMA thread:

'The dice are loaded. You can't win. Because when the skeptic says ""society,"" what he really means is ""state,"" even ""nation-state."" Since no one is going to produce an example of an anarchist state—that would be a contradiction in terms—what we're really being asked for is an example of a modern nation-state with the government somehow plucked away: a situation in which the government of Canada, to take a random example, has been overthrown, or for some reason abolished itself, and no new one has taken its place but instead all former Canadian citizens begin to organize themselves into libertarian collectives. Obviously this would never be allowed to happen. In the past, whenever it even looked like it might—here, the Paris commune and Spanish civil war are excellent examples—the politicians running pretty much every state in the vicinity have been willing to put their erstwhile differences on hold until those trying to bring such a situation about had been rounded up and shot.

true,jbphysreddit,eng-kent,Kent,"The fees paid to schools are not gift aidable - only genuin donations. Note the quote below. Gift aid is merely a way of the tax paying individual deciding which recognised charity receives the tax they paid on the money they earned. 

If something is doing good i.e. education/instilling good morals (arguably church.. that's another debate)/supporting people in more diverse political views) and someone earns enough to donate to them the government letting that individual decide to give the tax they paid on the donation as well seems great. I can't see anything bad with either of these things. 

&gt;The payment of fees to a charity is not a gift to charity and so fees paid to a Trust are not eligible for the Gift Aid scheme. Whether non-fee payments ('donations') made by parents (and persons connected to them) to a Trust qualify as Gift Aid payments depends upon the surrounding circumstances and the situation for each Trust is judged on its own merits.

It will only be a matter of time, anyway, as Warnock has come to play every game.

The whole thing started around 2005-ish. Not because they won the league, but because of FIFA actually. I wanted a team to play with and I actually started out with Fulham. Didn't like playing with them, so I went through the league again.  Then I settled on Chelsea.  
My brother and I would make our own teams (back in the day where you could actually make your own teams on FIFA) and we picked the best players from the world in our teams. I chose Lampard, and I always had that name in the back of my mind since then. Didn't fully start watching Chelsea until 2010ish until I decided to jump on the wagon. Looked for streams and found a game.

Also men have worn them as disguises before and acid attacks are common in relationship disputes from jealous rivals or spurned lovers.

It is possible that the attack was religious, but there is nowhere near enough evidence to support such a conclusion at the moment.

That said - I think we should ban the niqab in areas like airports, banks, and shops/businesses should be allowed to request their request their removal as well for security purposes.

But in this case someone could just have easily performed the attack wearing a motorbike helmet or a scarf so banning the niqab would have made little difference.

true,kannazuki,null,null,"My question for Mr Potter is thus:

As an international student who already pays £9000 in fees, I applaud your efforts in wanting to investigate and eliminate ""Hidden Costs"". However, I have one … issue with this proposal.

As a former BSc Biology student, a book for any of my modules would be anywhere between 30 to 50 quid. These books are often huge, often in the region of 800-1500 pages. Take ""Molecular Biology of the Cell"", a pretty standard Biology textbook. this costs 55 quid on Amazon and has over a thousand pages. It's in full colour and has many many diagrams and comes with a CD. Very helpful.

However, in my current course of BA Philosophy, the most expensive book I have ever had to purchase is just edging into 20something quid (Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia) and it has around 400 pages of Nozick blathering on about property rights and the free market. No pictures.

The problem with your proposal is that it seems to want to shame departments who have legitimate reason to choose certain books either because they are the ""standard"" in the field or the module just needs that much information and this is true with subjects that have heavy focus on statistics and mathematics. 

Then you'll end up with the situation of departments trying to legitimize the high cost of books as put by publishers and other external forces, which causes stress for lecturers and could be seen as a deterrent to the department for putting a variety of modules. The other situation is then students choosing modules for economic reasons rather than taking the subjects they really need. Would it not be more reasonable to assist students in obtaining these books either through student discounts at Waterstones or obtaining more copies of certain books in the Student Collection in the library?

Float the idea out there, see if there is any appetite for change.  The Conservative party have greater extremes than the other parties and is struggling to satisfy them all.  The centrist politicians, who could almost sit in any party, are what the majority of the UK wants, this is reflected in the polls.  But the conservatives have any old school members who don't want to accept change.  These are not a unified group so while there may be cross over between the Euro sceptics, anti gay marriage, reduce tax burden on business, don't regulate banking groups there is no one voice.  But the Conservatives are losing voters to UKIP and the main party sees this as a real threat so the party will move further to the right.  
There is no real opposition to the Conservatives but their infighting will split the party.  My worry is that if there was a credible leader of any party they would win many floating voters.  Why is this a worry?  Because that could further to the right, it's very easy to blame outsiders when times are tough.

I didn't say anything like that, and in the post linked in my edit, I even say that I agree with people when they say that Moffat's episodes back in the RTD era are the *best* of the whole show. That has nothing to do with my question.

My question is: ""why does he have a reputation of being the kind of guy who will make a napkin on a table thirty episodes ago mean the death of someone you like?"" That's more of a Joss Whedon reputation, but I've seen people comment that they feel that way about Moffat all the time, and I just don't understand why. He has never done *anything* like that.

TL;DR: Moffat has a reputation for outrageous twists for some reason. I'm asking why.

EDIT: A good example is in the hype-based buildup to The Angels Take Manhattan's release. Everyone all over this subreddit was constantly saying ""there's no way he's gonna just [](#s ""send the Ponds back in time""), that's way too easy and he's Moffat, he'll do something way more complicated than that"".

To that effect while there are blatant cliffhangers its not done in the fake 'pump-you-up-with-unnecessary-and-superficial-suspense-then- whoop! new episode come back next week' kind of way.  You go into the next episode of Doctor Who wanting to know what happens next because of the foreshadowing and unique story. And afterwards you can sit with your closest internet friends and say 'oh my gosh! Moffat totally referenced this person/place/thing/event 1-25 episodes ago! I wondered how that would be relevant later!'.

Things as small as this OP's note about uncle Digby make me happy.  Same as when that same plane crash that brought the family to Digby's house was referenced in the cabinet war room during Victory of the Daleks. Making a point to put little details in and leaving you to find them makes it a more engaging and intimate experience.

I rung NHS direct and were told the number of a couple of dentists that were supposed to be open on a Saturday but weren't and after lots of back and fourth I was given a number for denta care. 

I ended up calling denta care who told us to call the local walk in center and ask for an emergency dentist appointment. Managed to get one for 2 hours after I called and ended up getting the tooth took out. 

I honestly couldn't wait though. I was taking everything to make the pain go away, Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Codeine, dihydrocodeine (which I was prescribed for tooth pain before) and I even had to end up taking a Diazepam to get me to sleep(stupid I know but I don't regret it because I am one huge pussy when it comes to pain)

true,Iazo,null,null,"You are a fucking twat, you know that? Regardless, perhaps you need some enligtenment, because you seem to not quite understand how history worked.

Roughly, Romania is composed of 4 territories. Wallachia, Moldova, Transylvania and Dobrudja. For most of the history, these territorries have been divided between greater powers, like the Byzantine empire, the Ottoman sultanate, the Hungarian kingdom, the Austro-hungarian empire, the kngdom of Poland and the Russian empire. Allof these. held large territories of present day Romania since 1000AD to roughly bloody 1850

This meant that everyfuckingone in both WWI and WWII had 'historical reason' to demand one territory or other, and the fact that there were sizeable greek/turk/hungarian/german/bulgarian/russian, minorities did not help.

At about 1850 Wallachia and Moldova were united under a common ruler, while still under the suzeranity of the Ottoman empire. In 1877, after the war of independence, Romania, backed by Russia, managed to gain independence and Dobrudja, in exchange for ceding Besserabia to Russia.

Come WWI, Romania wanted Transylvania, And the Entente...that included the UK btw were getting pounded heavily on the west front, Russia was not doing too hot either, and  the UK was losing battle after battle in the middle east against the Ottoman sultanate.The Entente desperately needed a flunky to open a new front to strain the Central powers...and they promised fucking EVERYTHING to Romania. At the time, the US was still not in the war, and the Entente was losing badly.

Romania entered the war. And got ground into a raw paste by the Austro-Hungarians and the Germans. Thrn things got worse. Russia had the bolshevik revolution and made a separate peace. Then things got even worse. By 1918, Romania was all but occupied, only holding Moldova. The government wanted peace, but the king stalled peace talks, in hopes the US will turn the fucking war around. They did, and the end of the war saw Romania barely on the winning side.

At Versailles, Romania was given everything it wanted. Transylvania, sure. Besserabia? Well the Russians were traitors so you could have that too.

So for 15 or so years things were great. Except all the neigbours were pissed at you. And then fuck, Germany had a depression and now had a big motherfucking army. And the USSR had two revolutions and then they too, had a big motherfucking army. 

And they both pointed the guns at Romania. USSR took not only Besserabia, but the whole fucking east half of Moldavia. Hungary requested arbitration from Hitlerand the result was the dick shaped dick you see on the map,in the article you linked. Even Bulgaria jumped n on the train and got douthetn Dobrudja.

So, smart guy, if two guys point guns at you and demand your sweetroll, without the benefit of hindsight bias, which do you choose to give your sweetroll to?

At least Hitler granted Hungary a penis, but did not give them the whole Transylvania. USSR just took every motherfucking thing they could and then some.

Romania allied themselves with the ones who were not entirely dicks. Hindsight bias is a wonderful thint, but at the time, there were not many choices to make...and they all sucked. The chsllenge was to find out the one sho sucked the least. Politically, the game wad not as simple as 'nazi=bad'.

**Head-to-head**

•	This is the 50th competitive match between these clubs. Cardiff won 22 of the previous 49, and **Leeds 14**.

•	Cardiff are on a 14-match unbeaten sequence in league and cup against the Whites (W9, D5).

•	**Leeds** last defeated the Welsh club with a 1-0 away victory in the old Second Division in February 1984, five months after achieving a similar result at Elland Road.

**Leeds United**

•	Leeds have won their last three in all competitions, and are 
bidding for a seventh home successive win in the Championship.

•	The Whites, who eliminated Tottenham from the FA Cup in front of their home supporters last weekend, have gained 17 more points at home than away (29 at Elland Road, 12 on their travels).

•	Neil Warnock's side is the only club not to have conceded a Championship goal in the first 10 minutes.

**Cardiff City**

Only one does not get out of a fucking alliance with the nazis, with german tans all over the country, american aviation bombing Bucharest...and all the guns were pointed the wrong way anyway.

An example, this top 10% under Labour was paying only 40% and 15-17.5% VAT on all their luxury items. Under the Tories it's 45% tax and 20%VAT on luxury items. 

Labour happily threw money and bailed out the banks. 

Reduction in public services, yes they've cut funding. Show me another party that hasn't promised to do the same? It is accepted that public spending was to be reduced, it's just a matter of how far. 

Look I personally didn't vote Tory, I personally don't think they have made the best decisions in all aspects but I'm not having this nonsense they are all about the top 10%. Rightly or wrongly they believe in a smaller state and a less regulated market. Clearly that is correct in many areas, in others I personally don't believe it is.
