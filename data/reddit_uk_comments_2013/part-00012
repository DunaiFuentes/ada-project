The important thing to remember is that Gordon Brown, in 2010, was seriously unpopular, whether it be because of press manipulation or the general laying of blame at the Labour Party because of the recession. People were not going to have 4/5 more years of him (Brown in particular) in charge. 

However, I would place a bet saying that in 2015, there will be another hung parliament, and it will be a Lib-Lab coalition, which I would support, because David Cameron is weak, Ted Heath-weak, and the prevailing attitude will be more 'I'll vote Cameron out' rather than 'I'll vote Miliband in'.

Is ""rationalising"" it bad? Well, you probably take it as giving people convenient excuses. But if you know why people act a certain way, you can do something to prevent that.

What you're doing - ridiculing the panic buyers - is a way of setting up incentives. Trying to make a behaviour socially unacceptable. Trouble is, given a choice of doing the shopping a day early and getting ridiculed a bit, watching a child go hungry, or having a high risk of having an accident due to leaving the shopping to the normal time - well, there's reasons why that social incentive has never worked.

Basically, automatically using ridicule and criticism to control people's behaviour is just an instinctive Cro Magnon response - a tribal behaviour that worked well enough when we lived in small tribes. But it won't make someone choose to see their child hungry, or risk an accident walking and driving on packed snow and ice getting shopping at the regular time (assuming the deliveries could make it, which sometimes they don't), rather than bring their shopping trip forward a day or two.

Instead the BBC receives most of its direction from Frameworks. For example, this from the Fair Trading Policies Framework:

&gt;The benefit that Licence Fee Payers obtain, and expect, from the BBC is directly tied to the value and reputation of the BBC brand. The Trust requires the Executive to preserve and enhance the brand and reputation of the BBC, both in the UK and overseas, in such a way that maximises the value of the BBC.

It goes on to further quote “A public service for all: the BBC in the digital age”, Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of 
State for Culture, Media and Sport, March 2006:

&gt;The Government has recognised that **“it is important that the BBC should continue to promote its services on-air so that licence fee payers are aware of specific programmes and the breadth of the BBC’s overall offering”**

There is no point to a BBC if it isn't watched or listened to; similarly the breadth of content available on the BBC is unlike any other broadcaster in the world, and in competing with the other three main broadcasters (ITV, Ch4, BSkyB), it shifts the dialogue of television in a positive way.

I don't have sky or go away for my holidays (or any other real luxuries) and even often have to load up the credit card to eat. So when they start going on about poverty with their twisted measures of it, I can't help but feel that they don't really care about how it's paid for.
I think they've lost the plot. They think that the end justifies the means and that the money tree will just keep giving if they squeeze it harder. Clearly not a strategy that will keep working..
Sometimes I think I would be better off on the dole because I would have the same amount of money and would have a lot more time.",0,1358549371,null,0,1358549561,0,c7zfzua,t3_16r2id,t1_c7zfzua,t1_c7z0gmu,null,1431007106,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

How many divers go onto have careers in their thirties? Most know that they'll have to go onto other things - in fact, I might be wrong, but I believe Waterfields' original doubles partner moved into coaching, and is actually featured on the programme Daley fronts.

Yes it sucks that he's having his funding withdrawn, but it's nothing new. This happens to athletes every year. How many long distance runners will have faced funding cuts in 2012/13? Should Mo Farrah be criticised, because he's taken his success on track and turned it into commercial success?

I seem to remember reading Waterfield had been confirmed as Daleys' partner for the commonwealth games next year - had he also been told he'd be receiving funding until that point, then he has a right to feel, frankly, pissed off. If not - if his position was confirmed, but there was no mention of funding?

There have been thousands of athletes who have a successful sporting career - as he has [and hopefully will continue to do] and then once that comes to an end, move onto other things.

true,Tetzel,null,null,"Really enoiying/enjoyed playing this game, but it does depart massively from the original hitman games. Levels are now over several parts so to achieve a Silent Assassin rating you must get a SA rating on each part of the level. 

Disguise system has changed and is heavily criticised. Disguises are almost useless a lot of the time now because they're quickly identified as fake. If you dress as a guard other guards are suspicious of you, which wasn't how it went in old Hitman games. To be truly stealthy you need to get a disguise that is different from those you're surrounded with, if that makes sense.

The score system gives it an arcadey feel, and has also been criticized. Killing someone loses you points, but hiding their body gives you those points back. To get a SA rating you still have to not kill anyone/be seen, etc, the same old stuff, but there's no indication about what score threshold SA rating is achieved on, because you get a 'SA bonus' which tips you on to the SA rating.

Some levels it's impossible to get SA on because these do not feature targets to kill, and instead focus on you evading the police or finding information or something or that nature. The whole sandbox nature of the games has been removed, with only a few exceptions, and whilst the game is still fun to play, especially with the added 'contracts' mods which is the online game, it doesn't feel at all like a real Hitman game.

If they removed Hitman from the name this game would be excellent, but they didn't and it comes with a certain expectation that it really fails to utilize. The levels are often tiny. The game feels very linear. And the new shooting system really kind of forces your hand in some respects.

true,hotspur9,null,null,"Of course, I watched the match vs. QPR and when Sandro got injured in the middle of the first half I hoped the injury will not be very bad. Unfortunately, I was wrong and we will not see our Brazilian star in action this season :) It will be quite tough to replace a player like him but I think Parker can do the job. We have a lot of games ahead of us and when Scott gets a tired, we can field Huddlestone or Livermore. However, it looks like that Villas-Boas aims to strengthen the defensive midfielder position with the acquisition of Rennes starlet Yann M'Vila. QPR have already sent a £6.2m offer for the Frenchman and we are planning to outbid the Hoops. Moreover, Arsenal are also strongly linked a move for M'Vila and Wenger is known as a great admirer of the player. There is no doubt that M’Vila is a quite good player with significant potential but his troubles with the discipline make him a high risk, high reward transfer target.

I am still torn on whether i would want him or not, pros and cons to a signing like him.  Pro being the quality and potential of what you are getting at a bargain price (sounds like a Levy/Soccernomics move).  cons being he has been painted as a pain in the ass and that we already have Sandro (who before injury was the best DM in the EPL) and at some point we will have to deal with how do you get both playing time along with Dembele, Gylfi, Holtby, Carrol, Jake, Hudd, Parker, Falque and Dempsey. Presumably a couple could be sold but i would guess that Sandro and M'Vila would both expect to start and if we move to a system like AVB is used to running then only one would be on the field at once, sounds like a man management nightmare with one of the players (M'Vila) already having a bit of a prima dona reputation.

Speaking of racist cunts

http://www.newstatesman.com/2012/08/how-rochdale-grooming-case-exposed-british-prejudice

&gt; The grooming case seemed ripe for exploitation: all the girls were white, all the accused were Asian Muslim men, and they had displayed a searing contempt for their victims. “You white people train them in sex and drinking,” one of the accused men told the jury during the trial, “so when they come to us they are fully trained.”

...

&gt; Shafiq told me that he first heard about child sexual exploitation in 2006, when he encountered a mother in Blackburn whose daughter had been abused. “At the time, she was blaming Islam. She had gone to the mosque leaders for help but they had slammed the door in her face.”
&gt;
&gt; This wasn’t out of contempt, he explained, but rather a complete unwillingness to accept that it was anything to do with them. “If you look at it from a religious point of view,” Shafiq said, “what these guys did was evil. Islam does not sanction these sort of activities or these crimes, so, from the point of view of a mosque, it was, ‘This has nothing to do with us; we don’t encourage this sort of behaviour. If people go out and do this sort of thing, it’s them who should be held responsible.’”

Is it really evil from an Islamic point of view though? After Muhammad owned a Christian slave girl, [Maria the Copt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_al-Qibtiyya). So how can enslaving Christian girls be evil according to Islam? I bet the sermons at the Mosque are pretty scathing about non Muslim girls.

Look at this speech by NS writer Mehdi Hassan 

[We know that keeping the moral high ground is key. Once we lose the moral high ground we're no different from the rest, of the non Muslims; from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending to fulfil any desire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4hpfqFt-0Q)

So with racist views like being conventional wisdom amongst Muslims and the Prophet himself having a Christian slave girl he had sex with, is what these men did really against Islam?

I feel nobody in politics shares any of my principles whatsoever and as a result I offer no votes and  have no hope for a better country whatever colour(s) the ruling party fly. I would offer no fucks either, if I didn't feel a pinch.

I do not feel I am alone in this. I read Private Eye for a dose of misanthropy.

I hate Labour because Mandleson reclassified universities from education institutions to businesses and I hate that they sent us on a phoney crusade in the Middle East. 

I hate that the Tories - well - the Eton Boy's Club, are cutting so much from vulnerable people and letting off people who already have more than they deserve, that they award multi-million pound contracts to private companies owned by individual donators that then become peers for some reason. 

I have no love for the lib dems either, who are now just surplus Tories. Can't even be bothered to hate them.

I hate that they all serve the same masters because of the nature of campaign donations. I hate the swindling expenses, the de-industrialisation to other countries when we need the jobs, the way the BBC has to report Israel, the stifled arena of debate, the symptomatic relief of social problems (for profit, as in the prison system) as opposed to resolution of the root causes, whatever they might be (such as soft drug decriminalisation).

There is no real liberal class in the media and there certainly is no liberal class in parliament. I can feel the whole country moving further right with each successive cycle of government. The rot is so deep that unless we have a proper united revolution, like Iceland, classism will continue and all the social problems caused by plutocrats will continue because it is in the benefit of all those who are participating in it. 

As a nation we are conditioned to put up with this. My dad was looking at Hideous Gideon on telly and asked me how he ever got there. Fact is we put them there because we tolerate them and continue to vote for them. 

We still think we're democratic and that's why we still aren't, or maybe never were. A two party state is barely any more democratic than a one party state, but the one party state probably has a broader arena of political debate. As we are so much depends on just a few issues, whatever flavour they are that year, for drawing in voters.

I would rather...
*Fund campaigns for any party equally, entirely out of the public purse on a ""per-candidate"" basis (removing corporate interest from politics)
*Reform voting to actually achieve something, use technology to promote direct democracy, complete multiple party magic, encouraged and regulated to go to the people
*Establish the House of Lords in an accountability check role as Plato's philosopher rulers, disinterested but without absolute power (thereby removing costly committees)
*Regulate the markets to relieve some of the evils of capitalism (such as to abolish unfair trading in corporate monopolies on third world nations and the absurd amount of money in the football industry)
*Deregulate soft drugs and hemp to slash crime and make a whole new green (figuratively and literally) industry
*Pump more money into science and remove public funding for religious schools
*Increase the minimum wage (by a lot), have a single percentage of tax, calculated from GDP, for everyone irrespective of salary and ensure there are work and homes for everyone.

And to all those who say people can't be trusted with this kind of power, well, they have never been given it. If they had it, it would mean more to them. It would be empowering to have more of an impact on your environment.

People would be able to do more of what they wanted since the standard of living is fairer (remember this still isn't trying to pretend to be communism). Enthusiasm would be more important so technological advances and culture would increase to match. 

This kind of reform would be an achievement to me.

I've probably just really over-thought it but I really don't think it's cameras haha

Taking only one example like that it would be easy to think it's cameras, but it has a definite 'ticking pulse' to it and it's identical every time you hear it in games. Sometimes there might be 30 seconds between the bursts, sometimes there's 5 minutes but there's always the same 'beat' to it. I know there's cameras around the mics but compare this very regular pattern to the random timing of a group of photographers (like the cameras at the end of the Showcase Television credits on Trailer Park Boys ). I just think that for a group of photographers to make that noise they'd all have to start at exactly ~0.6 seconds (or whatever the tempo to it is) apart from each other. I just think it's way too perfect to be random groups of photographers.

Oh dear, you've fallen for the media bullhshit that we're failing at home because of the atmosphere. I call it bullshit cos that't what it is, total and utter bullshit.

We lost to Swansea because of two freakish errors and we had a terrible striker up front. We had more chances with Ba on for 10 minutes than we did with Torres for 80. 

We lost to QPR cos we dropped our best players, the manager made his subs too late and they got lucky with a scuffed shot which Cech may well have saved if he'd been fit.

Drawing with City is not a bad result. We drew with Southampton because Rafa failed to make a change when the game had obviously changed and we paid the price. The players are at fault as well for poor defending. It was nothing to do with the fans. None of it is. Stop talking shit.

The booing is at the end - something after the final whistle doesn't affect the result. I fail to see how fans making a noise for Frank is going to depress the team, that's just silly. Players are concentrating on the game, they do not pay attention to the lyrics of chants, and as most are foreign they generally wouldn't understand them anyway. In any interview with players they always say they don't notice specific chants when they're on the pitch.

Also the atmosphere is nothing like you seem to think it is. Yes there's been booing of Torres, but boo or cheer he's always been shit so it's not really an issue. Standing and clapping in the sixteenth minute is hardly going to traumatise the team so they're unable to play anymore.  Chanting for Di Matteo has been limited to the 16 min thing and the end when there's not time left. The fans are not a factor.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Stamford Bridge has become a difficult place for Chelsea to win and it is largely down to the horrible atmosphere. 

Bull shit. Rafa has a thick skin and knew what he was getting into, this is hardly an excuse.

&gt;there is the Frank Lampard farewell roadshow and the hounding of Fernando Torres. That is distracting for the players on the pitch.

Again bull shit. Lampard is a club legend and deserves the attention he is getting JUST like Torres. The guy was worshiped for no good reason for two years and now he is invisible again. So he plays like shit when we support him and he plays like shit when we boo him, irrelevant statement here. They are professionals, if its ""distracting"" man the fuck up. 

&gt;Chelsea may not l ike Benitez but he is a good manager. He's won the Champions League, league titles in Spain with Valencia and made Liverpool as strong as they've been in the Premier League.

Thrice bull shit. He left Liverpool in shambles getting rid of Alonso and pissing off Yossi and Reina, he did a piss poor job at inter and he is doing a piss poor job here.

&gt;Contrast it with Manchester United, who made 10 changes for their FA Cup tie with West Ham - Robin van Persie wasn't playing - and there was no booing.

Because they are top of the bloody league and aren't losing integral matches or running their club like a bunch of 12 year olds on FM (yes this is directed towards Roman)

I agree booing is counter-productive, and I dont like booing players in general. But Im sick of everyone blaming the fans for our poor form. Its the responsibility of the players, the manager and the OWNER.

We are letting two legends leave (after another left in the summer), fired the manager who won us our first CL and hired one of the most disliked managers by Chelsea fans, who openly was rude to the club and fanbase - and hasn't won anything good for 7 years. 

All this talk that Chelsea fans are so quick to show disappointment when they are 'spoiled' by Abramovich is rubbish. Only just now are we starting to show frustration towards Torres, after two years of dire performances where we cheered him the entire time.

Yeah, Rafa doesn't deserve all the stick he gets, but he is such a good representation of the deep rooted problems we have at the club. As a fan I feel we have to show our anger at this problems, otherwise they may never get fixed.

Give yourself at least half as much time as normal to make a journey.

Turn the anti-skid system off.

Avoid heavy use of brake and accelerator.  A little bit of wheel spin when pulling away from a stop is fine, just don't overdo it and keep the revs steady.  Unless it's a hill then it's about not spinning the wheels and hoping your tires have enough traction to reach the top.

Brake early and gently.  Try not to panic brake and lock the wheels.  Once you have all four wheels locked up you are at the mercy of momentum and friction.

You need to make a noise diary. Environmental Health should have copies they can provide you with, or they may have one online that you can print out .

Note down the time and date of every occurrence, along with a description of the noise. Make this as detailed as you can without rambling on, that is, don't just write 'banging' every 15 minutes. If you can identify the tune then do so.

If you have any neighbors who are affected then they should also make diary sheets. 

Speak to Environmental Health as they need to witness the nuisance themselves, whether first hand, or by way of monitoring equipment. 

They may have a night time noise team who can come out, but this is not guaranteed. The LA I work for has no night time noise team (yet another this cut due to Government budget constraints), but may be willing to make a night time visit if they feel it is warranted. 

Even if they do have a night time nuisance team ask if they can install some monitoring equipment in your flat for a few nights. 

Its all about evidence, they more evidence the LA has the more likely it is that they can do something. The LA cannot do anything based on somebody just saying 'they make noise'.

Be warned though, the process takes time and doesn't always go smoothly.

We have a great record against Bristol City and generally strong form at home, which says to me that we should have a good chance of beating them. However, my prediction reflects my opinion that Leeds will make hard work of it, which probably won't surprise anyone. Unfortunately I won't be there, due to the weather making the 100-mile trip inadvisable.

Here's how I think the team will line up:

---------------Kenny

Byram---Lees---Peltier---White

Green---Barkley---Austin---Tonge

----------Diouf---Becchio

Personally, I would consider playing Varney instead of Tonge, as he had a decent game against Birmingham and could draw confidence from a run in the team. However, he seldom plays well at Elland Road - I think that the pressure to do well is too much for him. I also see McCormack dropping to the bench to accommodate Becchio, which may be a shame for him but I'd rather keep Becchio in the team.

I really, really hope that he keeps the defence the same, as I think it could be a lot better than Pearce and Tate at the back, which looks like racing snails at times! Also, I think that Austin and Barkley could be a fantastic combo in the middle of the park. They're both strong players who like to get stuck in, can shoot at the goal, and both will often have a height advantage on most players in central midfield.

It's an unsecured form of credit. When administrators are brought in, the company they're overseeing effectively ceases to exist. HMV - the HMV that issued gift vouchers, no longer exists. Even if Deloitte find a buyer who keeps all the stores open, it still won't be the HMV that issued the cards.

Which has been paid for for far longer by my generation, your parents, than yours.

&gt; Housing - the average age of a first time buyer is now closer to 40 than 20, because all of the housing stock was bought for next to nothing and then kept for retirement or let

Bought for next to nothing compared to what? To the prices now? As for being let, home ownership was in the minority amongst the working class until the 1980's. Most working class people rented. Home ownership is a relatively new thing.

&gt; Jobs - the abolition of the retirement age means that there are fewer opportunities for younger people, and it won't matter if the young people are more capable as seniority is usually rewarded over competence

Unemployment when I left school in the 1980's was 20% higher per capita than the height of the current recession.

&gt;  Not just free but paid higher education, without the £25k+ of debt at the end of it... etc etc

What paid higher education? Fewer people went to university because there was absolutely no support for living expenses. There were no such things as student loans.

Indeed, I said ""charter"". In corp speak that would be include ""strategic objectives"". As you note the Royal Charter set up the [BBC Trust](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/), the trust provides the charter: 

&gt;We set the strategic objectives for the BBC.  We have challenged the BBC to:

&gt;    * increase the distinctiveness and quality of output; 

&gt;    * improve the value for money provided to licence fee payers;

&gt;    * set new standards of openness and transparency; and

&gt;    * do more to serve all audiences.

I'd say that 1, 2 and 4 are summarised quite well by ""provide quality programming"".

Read your emboldened quote again. It says promote *its services* and make license payers *aware of specific programmes*. That is exactly what idents and station adverts do not do, they do not promote the services as they make no mention of specific programmes they're simply artistic puff that negatively impacts value for money (objective 2).

If they compete with the other broadcasters then they do not shift the dialogue of TV at all, they simply add to that already there. They should be complementary to the other channels precisely for that reason, offering more uplifting, more challenging, more distinctive and quality broadcasts (objective 1) rather than racing to the common denominator and bowing to audience figures alone.

As much as I appreciate Abramovich' loose purse strings, he's also a significant contributing factor to the problems. If Benitez leaves at the end of the season...it'll be 3 different managers in a single year.

3 different managers with 3 differing styles and philosophies. You can't expect stable / consistent results under an unstable and inconsistent regime. The team is severely lacking leaderships qualities, particularly if rumours of Terry, Lampard and Cole being shipped off ASAP are to be believed.

More importantly, this Champions League obsession is ludicrous. Given our current form, there's a possibility of not making the CPL. The Premier League must be the priority like it is for Man United. They prioritise the EPL...and played two finals in 3 years against Barca. Sure, they weren't successful, but they're in the CPL year in, year out.

To reiterate

- Torres

- Stop fucking sacking managers

- Prioritise the EPL, and we automatically qualify for the CPL...play those games as they come along

- Take purchasing power away from Abramovich...unless he's going to step in as manager.

Sadly none of the above parties do this. We build our economy on taking money from rich foreign chaps, investing it and making money appear from it. Our foreign policy is apparently decided by BP/the US?

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"another major factor which affects our home results vs. away results is the way we play. 

When we play away, teams come out to play us, which leaves space for us to attack.

Lower league teams have come to the bridge, sat back and defended and looked to hit us on the break when we overcommit players to the attack. 
When we are playing against an organised two banks of four, it is extremely difficult to break them down. Rangers had some success in the Champions League playing two banks of four, Chelsea did this against Barcelona (Barcelona were the best in the world at that point in time, showing how tough it is to break down two banks of four which are extremely organised and try to force a goal)

Southampton pressed extremely well and defended tightly and deep when we had the ball in their half. Our speed of attack was slow which allowed a lot of the players to get back. Even with Demba Ba in the middle, we did not play extremely wide. On many occasions, you could see Oscar, Hazard and Mata on the same side of the pitch, which left us very exposed defensively on either the right or left side of the pitch (see Luke Shaw's assist for the second goal which coupled in an over commited attack)

QPR was much the same, it would have been 0-0 but not for a well taken chance from SWP, something that they denied us from the get go. 

Swansea would have been 0-0 but for Ivanovic's mistakes. 

Villa were extremely different because they were not organised very well defensively and our attack took advantage 

Our physicality and directness used to be a major thing for us against this type, however now we can't break teams down that are bigger than us and will push us off the ball in a 50-50 on the edge of the box

true,[deleted],null,null,"The BBC is literally a government information machine, that is incontestable, it provides funding, tight control and up until recently the corporation could be directly steered by appointment. The BBC Trust doesn't seem that different. Former Tory MP Chris Pattern's appointment as Chairmen was approved by the Queen, and after stage-managing the Pope's visit he was seen sitting during the Jubilee coverage in the royal box. I could go on but I think that one example more than hints and the incestuous links at the ""top"". It is clear that the BBC is at least shameless royalists.

Let's look at topology: is the BBC designed to give employees journalistic freedom or is it an entrenched hierarchy where for the longest time MI5 routed at political dissidents? Are people quickly decapitated should they veer from the company truth? Further, does the BBC provide clear reference of authorship when it comes to articles? No, it does not. Quite interesting is looking at how the BBC was birthed and what came before but that would make this lengthy reply too much so.

The real contention therefore lies in whether the information under state control is good information or bad, and the other consideration is how inclusive the coverage is. The BBC can be judged perhaps more accurately by what it does not say. One of the best in depth looks from an academic apolitical stand point was the book ""Bad News From Israel"" which in part using statistical and linguistic analysis showed that the BBC favoured Israel. Now, before you cry ""anti-semite"", this isn't really about Jewishness (although that definitely features, if you are interested research [Jonathan Sacerdoti](http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/who_is_jonathan_sacerdoti_the_bbcs_go_to_man_on_gaza)), but an alignment with military interests. (The flotilla coverage was awful as was the recent attack on Palestine, and Harry gets a cushy ride also.) One example that comes to mind is from Leveson: the BBC were offered access to the leaked cables and to quote a BBC employee he ""wouldn't touch them with a bargepole"".

That gets me on to a related point: how does the institution treat political dissidents? We have the rapist Assange, [the almost invisible Bradley Manning](http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/news/?q=bradley%20manning&amp;video=on&amp;audio=on&amp;text=on), and by contrast the heavily covered pussy riot and the noble Syrian rebels.

**Head-to-head**

•	Leeds took their winning run against Bristol City to five, with an odd goal in five success in the reverse fixture in September; El Hadji Diouf got a second-half double for the Yorkshire club.

•	Bristol City last took points off the Whites with a 3-1 top-flight victory at Elland Road in November 1979.

•	The Robins have registered three victories from 12 trips to the West Yorkshire club since 1921.

**Leeds United**

•	Mid-table Leeds have won 11 and lost 11 of their league games, scoring 38 goals and gaining 38 points.

•	The Whites are challenging for a sixth successive home league win, and have not dropped a point at Elland Road since Watford's 6-1 win on 10 November.

•	Neil Warnock's side have mounted a divisional low 224 goal attempts, and are the only club not to be have conceded in the first 10 minutes of a Championship match.

**Bristol City**

•	Sean O'Driscoll makes his debut as manager of bottom-placed Bristol City, and has to halt a sequence of three defeats in league and cup in 2013.

•	The new boss has to immediately shore up a defence that has not kept a clean sheet this season, and has shipped an unequalled 54 Championship goals.

•	Ten of their 22 points have been gained from matches in which two or more goals were conceded, which is the joint best such return in the division.",0,1358605852,null,0,false,0,c7zqs84,t3_16vjkz,t1_c7zqs84,t3_16vjkz,null,1431012339,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

Articles are, opinion pieces aren't unless they have a left-wing slant.

Blogs/columns on the Mail website are fine, they're not connected to the celebrity obsessed part of the site.

&gt;You get people of all political persuasions here (though there seems to slightly be weighted toward the centre left, but then again I think most brits are too) and if you make a controversial point (like I did about Johnson the other week) you will get a lot of flack and will have to defend it, unlike in the main subreddits. 

It's massively slanted towards the left.

/r/ukpolitics did a poll a while back.

http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=50e0916fe4b0c066f1c5557c

The left got about 71% of the vote, while other got 13% and the right got 17%.

This subreddit might be slightly more to the centre than /r/ukpolitics but I doubt it.

&gt;For generalised discussion, I think /r/uk and /r/ukpolitics is pretty good. It resembles the quality of what I saw on the front page when I first joined in 2007. 

/r/ukpolitics is far left. Post anything not to the left and you'll be decimated by downvotes. 

I've tried to post some conservative links in recent days but they've ended up stillborn since everyone downvotes before they become widely visible. The fact that most of these had another left-wing opinion on the same subject is just more proof of how it's purely about ideology and not about quality.

There was a link claiming UKIP had gone down in the polls, so I posted one explaining that the poll used was inaccurate and mine got downvoted while the lefty link made it to the top of the page for a few days. It's completely ridiculous to state that there is any level of impartiality there.

Look at how many links I've posted and how many have no replies and no upvotes:

http://www.reddit.com/user/Feint1/submitted/

What a joke.

&gt;You get thought out comments, balanced discussion, wit and a general no-bullshit attitude here. It's one of the subreddits that people visit to pass time in the same way they might fill out a sudoko and so I get the feeling that nobody really cares about the points here unlike a lot of the reactionaries on the larger subreddits.

If endless comments about how the Tories are evil can be called ""balanced discussion"".

Post after post of armchair morons lecturing match-attending fans on what they're doing wrong when they go to games. Even worse is the post in here of the bloke who went to one game (the general sale Swansea debacle) who has thus decided that the fans are definitely to blame - ""season ticket arseholes"" were his terms. Not sure who he thinks he is coating Chelsea like that.

""You're supposed to cheer non-stop, sing your heart out. If I were lucky enough to go I would sing for 90 minutes no matter what"" and so on. Like fuck you would you cunt. If I want to sing about what a cunt Benitez is then I will. Does that stop me wanting Chelsea to win? No. Does that stop me singing during games? No. Does that mean that I'll tell Benitez to fuck off when something goes wrong? Yes, that's the rod Abramovich made for his own back when he dismissed a club legend for much less than Benitez has ""achieved"" here.

For me, part of being Chelsea is letting everyone know that you couldn't give a shit about being ""classy"". I'm proud that we're humungous cunts and that everyone hates us. It's better than being midtable dross that no-one gives two shits about. Like Fulham. Fuck that.

Threads are voted up or down depending on if it's the type of content you want in the sub - people don't want bias, unreliable sources that tend to exaggerate or misreport on purpose. So they downvote them, which afaik is adhering to reddiquette. It keeps the quality of the submissions higher.

But, in comments, downvoting should only be done if that comment adds nothing to the thread, or is breaking the subs rules (offensive, personal info etc.) The problem is people end up using the downvote as a disagree function.

true,punkfunkymonkey,null,null,"&gt;What paid higher education? Fewer people went to university because there was absolutely no support for living expenses. There were no such things as student loans. If you didn't have parents who could pay for your living expenses at Uni or you didn't have a job that could cover the cost, you didn't go.

Fewer people went but if you could carry yourself in an interview and get the grades then you could go to uni or poly. Plenty of people didn't bother even attempting because of the perception that it wasn't for the likes of them and even through reverse snob-ism (one guy on my course had been disowned by his parents for not taking a job they had lined up at a local firm). Towards the end of the 80's the move to increase the number of uni participants above the traditional 10% was under way with the conversion of polys to universities and the expansion of the BTEC route towards a degree.

Financial support was available, grants, bursaries, sponsorships and student hardship funding. I got by on my grant, very occasional casual labour in the holidays and some bar and door work in the SU term time when things were tighter than I liked.

1980 the grant was £1,430  
By 1989, the year student loans rolled out (£420 pa), the grant was £2,265. If you went to Oxbridge you could claim dole in the holidays.

The, ""I was born here, it's my right, you've wronged me, I must sue"" brigade.

We really must knock that on it's head rather than aiming straight for the 'multicultural is bad', ""Jonny foreigner is stealing my medicines"" trail of thought. Yes, there are bad apples in every walk of life, but concentrate just on those and you miss the bigger picture and give yourself coronary every time you see a black man in a doctors surgery (ignoring the fact he was born here, and his family goes back 4 generations, but then that's beside the point).

I really think the community spirit still exists, we just need to stop being so up our own arses sometimes and share a friendly chat with a neighbour, regardless of their skin type or origin. 

We are too afraid to show any patriotism or be proud of our national for being seen as politically incorrect, or that we are ignoring our problems, past and present. It's a fine balance which we are struggling to find. I believe the Olympics went a great way in making people realise that it's OK to be proud of our achievements.

Be proud that we do have a health service, and it doesn't turn away those in need. Yes it might not be perfect, but it gets the job done. Likewise with our government.

Weekend of ""wrong kind@ of snow in London , Heathrow and other big cities brings more losses to the economy than all the equipement that could be bought to fend of mild winter we got here.
People abroad laughing at us because we can not decide if winter is not big enough to invest in resources or we think its a national catastrofe with people staying home like their feet don't work on snow  and media screaming STAY HOME ! there is a snowflake outside!
All that with such mild winter , its bordering on joke.

We could be invaded by Albania, just for fun if it ocured in winter.

Profits aren't what essential services should be driven by.

Our roads, Healthcare, Police, Army and schools are paid by taxes and if they do generate profit , it means there is something wrong with it. Those aren't factories.
When we stop seeing money in absolutely everything , then maybe we could have a sand on the pavements  and people going to work.

&gt;Since that influence mainly came in the time after Cú Chulainn then to find the accent closer to the pre-christian Ulsterman you need to look at the parts of Ulster that were less affected by this influence.

Cuchulainn was made up! Consequently, for an actor to sound authentic to an audience, it'd probably be a good idea as he suggests to replicate a distinctly Northern Irish brogue, since no one is going to jump up and exclaim ""I recognise that accent! Why, it's the voice of a pre-Christian Ulsterman!"". So a reasonable conclusion would be the more northern the better, a la Neeson...

&gt;Just because he fights off Connacht for Ulster does not make it about separatism.

And plenty of people who thought that is what they'd get have found it changed or the company has gone bust and the pension pot with it.

&gt;  Housing - bought for a few month's wages. 

What fucking year was that? It certainly wasn't any time from the late 1960's. And whilst you got a house with your job, such as agricultural workers, when you left the job you lost the house. 

&gt;  Whereas now, the average house price is what, five times the median annual wage?

In the 80's mortgage interest rates were between 12-18%. So whilst the houses were cheaper, you couldn't afford the mortgage repayments.

&gt;  Unemployment - excluding young people in full time education, the current unemployment rate is 20.3% whereas it was about 26% at the worst point of the 80s recession. So you're right, although I don't see that it addresses the point about the abolition of retirement age.

My wife's boss is 67. Still working because he can't afford to retire. My own parents are reaching retirement age next year and will continue to work because they can't afford to retire.

&gt;  On higher education, each educational area gave grants of many thousands of pounds a year to students for living expenses. Students were actually paid to go to University. There were no tuition fees.

They still do now. There is a post above that states the grant for 1980. You couldn't live off that - it would barely cover rent.

One of the things that makes it worse is that when one person starts, another does the ""do it back to them"" thing. Seriously, it never works, it just means the quiet neighbours are getting double or treble the noise.

The noise I get isn't always loud music. One neighbour (not sure which) has a dog. Sometimes, that dog will bark continuously for anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. That's bad enough, but as neighbours start shouting at the owners and banging on walls, it just gets worse.

A tip for other shouters and wall-bangers - if the dog is barking, the owners almost certainly aren't in. Making some noise might quiet the dog for a few seconds, but in the long run you're teaching the dog that if it barks it'll get some attention and encouraging it to bark more.

Tip for retaliatory music players - you already know they're inconsiderate arseholes. Do you really think they'll just back down over a little retaliation? Will *you* back down when it doesn't work? Odds are that all you'll do is create a who's-the-noisiest-arsehole competition.

Near the top of that list is the secured creditor. People that can demonstrate that (say) HMV are holding property or money specifically for them are allowed that property/money back, and it can't be divided and shared with other people.

At the bottom of that list is the unsecured creditor - people that can claim they are owed money, but not that HMV have put that money anywhere specifically. That's where our giftees are currently, as unsecured creditors, because their money was mixed in with cash payments made in the normal course of business.

If, however, their money was kept in a separate account kept purely for gift card owners, they *would* be able to claim an interest in that account as secured creditors, above all others. The administrators could not give that to anyone else, as it was held on trust for anyone owning a valid gift card.

true,ajehals,eng-yorkshire,Sheffield,"&gt;Don't you think there should be some sort of minimum residency period in order to be able to access free healthcare in this country?

There is.  You have to be resident in the UK, so if you have lived outside of the UK (citizen or not) for more than 3 months in the last year you may have to pay, that goes up to 6 months for some people.  Moreover, whilst emergency care is available to anyone (i.e. A&amp;E, some family planning etc..), access to the NHS for immigrants and temporary workers will depend on the leave they have been granted, length of visa and what bilateral agreements we have set up with their home country.

You can't come to the UK specifically for NHS healthcare either and if you claim to be coming for private treatment and then use the NHS you would be liable.

However for people working and living long term in the UK they will have access to the NHS, which makes sense given that people working here will pay in and it means people have access to normal care (rather than resorting to A&amp;E..).

Fair enough, having poked around a bit, I've exaggerated on the change in first time buyer price to earnings ratios from the 60s onward, but they're currently about 5:1 compared to a long term average of 3.5:1 and have been above that average since 1994. So while I may have overstated the advantages to older generations in purchasing, it doesn't mean that there's no disadvantage to younger, prospective homeowners now, in combination with low wages and high unemployment.

Depends what you mean by can't afford to retire. They literally wouldn't survive? They'd have to choose between heating and eating? They live in accommodation which is unhealthy, damp and cold? Or they desire (perfectly reasonably!) a certain standard of living? Many older people don't want to give up work, not because they can't afford it but because it keeps them mentally and physically active and is a reliable point of social contact. The usual pattern seems to be for employees approaching 65 to decide to retire, then change their minds and reduce their hours or stay on indefinitely.

If you're very good at budgeting and managing what you eat then you'll won't be going over about £15 a week on food, especially if you stick to the value food brands (there's not that bad, and when you're a student, you get used to it). If you have plenty of freezer space and you don't mind frozen food then your food bill will be reduced by a lot more (shop in Iceland, they are frozen food heaven).

**Housing**
That are many student properties available are that a lot cheaper than £900 a month, even for a place by yourself. I've recently been looking for properties and a top end 1 bedroom flat in Gunwharf (the very expensive part) is about £750 a month.

However, I would recommend going on a website such as easyroommate or sparerooms or similar to find people to share with as it will come out a lot cheaper! My house I currently live in with 5 people is very expensive in comparison to other places as we pay about £380 a month each. So if you look around, and preferbably soon-ish you will find plenty of cheap properties above!

**Clothing**
If you have the money, then buy clothes. I'm not telling you not to. But if your clothes are in great condition and last throughout the year, then there's no point in buying new clothes! But of course spoil yourself once in a while :)

**Transport**
As said before. You also won't need to pay for transport as the university is quite close to many of the student properties available. If you get a house in the Fratton/Southsea border area, you'll also be very close to the free university bus (which is also a bonus)!

**Personal care**
This is the one where the budget is probably about right. 

* Medicine - stick to supermarkets. The basic medicines are fairly cheap and you don't need anything too fancy for the occasional headache (unless it's something quite bad, then go to your doctor)! 

* Tampons (if you're female, it's stated on the budget so i'll mention it anyway) - stick to tampax, don't go cheap on these things (trust me, I did, they were horrible). 

* Toiletries - shop at Poundland on commerical road. Decent brands and still £1 each

**Entertainment**

* If you're going to the cinema often then it's worth getting an orange sim card (or friends on orange). Then you can get 2 for 1 offers every wednesday. I'm personally on T-mobile, but I have an orange sim card reserved such for the occasional text to orange wednesdays for the bargain.

* In regards to eating out - two words - Freshers Fayre! Go to all the stalls from the commerical restaurants etc. and get as many vouchers/deals as you can. They won't last long, but they are definitely worth it, especially the Subway vouchers. As a president of a society, I hate the fact everyone goes to Freshers Fayre for the freebies, but I do like to take advantage of them myself

* I also do recommend looking at the UPSU.net website to see what societies/sports are available so you can budget in any you are interested in. They are definitely worth while

true,thor214,wardr,Hurt,"FYI, typically, video resolution is referred to by the height when only using one dimension. When used in reference to typical TV-format widescreen productions, the aspect ratio is assumed to be 16x9 (1.78:1), so the width can easily be deduced.

Although for a still image, it is best if you used both dimensions for clarity. For example: 1920x1080. 
_______________

It is honestly a weird convention, but it makes sense when you consider that for digital cinema, you can get a reliable pixel density it you ask for the height, as the width can be anywhere from 1440x1080 (4:3 aspect ratio) to 1920x1080 to 2048x1080 (2K digital cinema resolution) to 1920x1080/2048x1080 with width being stretched via anamorphic lens (""Cinemascope"")


(for more clarification, the standard film (35mm) aspect ratio today is 1.85:1. If showing via 1920x1080, you get about a 40 pixel height gap on the top and bottom of the image that is letter boxed. If you use 2K resolution, that letterboxing disappears, allowing full use of the screen.)",0,1358618103,null,0,false,0,c7ztnkd,t3_16vimu,t1_c7ztnkd,t1_c7zsov5,null,1431013679,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

What this is an argument for is experience based wages in particular jobs. Here's a very simple counter example that gets to the point OP is making in their complaint.

Jon starts working in a pub at 16, waiting tables. He's there for 3 years before going to uni, so gets a year 1-2 years working behind the bar too. While at uni, he continues to work in another pub until he's 22 and leaves. That gives him a total of 6 years experience working in the pub trade, 5 of which are at the lower minimum wage.

Jane has never had to work before, and has been enjoying that freedom at uni. Unfortunately due to an accident she had to take a year out and has need to earn some money on the side in her final year, now at the age of 21 and a half. She gets a job in the same pub Jon does. She immediately gets paid the higher minimum wage solely in virtue of her age, but she has *no* experience of work whatsoever.

Now, tell me how your argument is persuasive? What I'd take your argument to be persuasive of is that everyone *irrespective of age* should get the lower minimum wage for the first 1-2 years of their employment in a particular trade, then the higher minimum wage after that (in jobs that pay minimum wage etc.etc.) Essentially, you've argued persuasively for probationary pay, something that already exists in a lot of jobs (in supermarkets for example).

It may appear childish at times but a lot of the people in the sub are those youths that are 'coming out' for the first time.

Church may still act as a communal service for the elderly community(generalisation) and also sometimes the wider community at Christmas and Easter but it isn't something which is seen to be necessary. When someone becomes an atheist here they become part of the apathetic masses who are also an atheist, 'get over yourself', type thing. 

I don't disagree that culture could do with a rejig in the network society but the atheist circle jerk is something which is becoming archaic in some sense towards our society. We should be focusing on harnessing the connections of the populous and those shared experiences as markations of identity and solidarity.

Don't get me wrong, Hendo had a fantastic game, and I'm one of the biggest Hendo fans on this sub, but today, Gerrard was the hero.  All over the pitch, running down players, making great tackles, and pulling off some truly incredible passes.  One or two of the more ambitious ones ended up with Norwich in possession, but overall, he hit an incredible number of shirts in red from thirty or forty yards away with more accuracy than Luke Skywalker blowing up the death star.  And a lot of his passes- a lot of his long passes- were smart, not the ""hollywood"" style for which he occasionally garners criticism.  There were some great low penetrating passes right up the middle that had me grinning like an idiot :)  And of course, his goal was...oh, it's pointless, there isn't any way I can describe it and do it justice.

It is hard. For me, it was not *as bad* as Torres leaving. When he left, he did not leave us in the same situation Torres did. But he went to Real. He said some comments. Which burnt his bridges with Liverpool. Afterwards, I guess he felt his loyalty to Liverpool was gone when he returned to the EPL. 

So, in some ways, you can almost understand Owen. Also, think how bitter he was to ""want to go and win trophies"" and then we win the champions league (am I correct that he has not won it? Or did he get one medal with the Mancs?) Despite being able to understand him, he could have remained an Anfield legend, still gone to the Madrid and return to the EPL for a non-Manc team. But that is not what played out. So he will never sit among the legends.

As gifted as he is, his technique has never been his forte, and I think it won't improve enough to play in the dominant force we are trying to evolve in. 

That being said, even if we do count on him making some serious steps, this can only be achieved by regular playing time. Get a top notch striker to come in, rotate him with Ba whose knee won't hold out forever. When Ba is served up, bring in Lukaku and Feruz, and you have two experienced complementairy strikers and a young talent.

true,miss_bonbonbonbon,null,null,"&gt;Even in those, a person with several years work experience will outperform one with none.

This is purely assumption. Yes, this can be the case but a young worker could be very good at their job and outperform older workers but still be paid less money. Also you can easily have a person of 21 years or older walk into a job for the first time with no skills and potentially be paid more that a 20 year old who has worked in the same role for 4 years. If you are suggesting that it is fair to pay less money for poorer performance than surely that should be based upon actual performance within the role, not age.

&gt;Do they fuck pay equally. The older employees will be on more money. I don't know how old you are but your lack of experience of the workplace is obvious.

In skilled jobs some people are on more money than others but this is usually based on years of *actual* experience within the role - not on their age. For example, you could have 2 newly qualified nurses with 20 years difference in age, if they both started the same job at the same time with the same level of experience they would both be given the same wage. Other nurses within the same job may have been working there for years and would have built up increment for those years within the role so they would get paid more based upon their actual experience not an assumption made on the basis of age.

&gt;How much have you paid into the system compared to someone who is 25?

Once again the problem here is that this is based upon the assumption that someone who is 25 has paid more into the system. Often this is simply not the case. If JSA payments were tiered based on how much people had paid into the system then you would have a point but basing it purely on age *is* ageist and wrong.",0,1358622626,null,0,false,0,c7zuwk8,t3_16vdjk,t1_c7zuwk8,t1_c7zpr5t,null,1435641596,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"There is a big economic debate over what the minimum wage should be for certain demographics and how it affects employment. Though the minimum wage is a sound idea to guarantee everyone a minimum standard of living it's useless if it causes cases of unemployment where people are earning nothing at all. If you have skills worth £8 an hour the minimum wage is your friend. Employers will make money from giving you the minimum and with any luck and the market working correctly you'll soon begin to climb. If you've got skills worth £4 an hour no one is going to hire you. You'd be asking for charity and you won't be able to climb. A simply look at demographics shows that most unskilled people are young so it makes sense to have the minimum wage based on a person's age.

It is not a right-wing idea to suggest that even the minimum wage we currently have for the young is too high as it already stands. It's an idea realized by organizations created to help those who are on low pay or unemployed. An extract from an article I found:

&gt;The TUC say the following:
&gt;&gt;    The number of young people who have been unemployed for more than a year since 2000 has increased by an enormous 874 per cent (from 6,260 to 60,955), going up by 264 per cent in the last year alone.
&gt;
What could be the cause of this? Could it be the introduction of the national minimum wage on 1 April 1999? Yes, actually, it could be and almost certainly is. Even the Low Pay Commission, the people who set the NMW, think that this might be the cause:

  &gt;&gt;  Firms may be reluctant to create jobs by recruiting inexperienced staff because they are put off by the increased wage bill, the Low Pay Commission has suggested.

It's just, like you say, I can also buy four dvds for that, or a couple of mp3 albums on amazon, or two months of unlimited music from spotify.

Speaking of spotify, what would really have kept HMV alive for me, a self-styled music conneuisseur, would have been if they had something equivalent in place 10 years ago, i.e. searchable streaming of (at least) everything they stocked nationwide.  Better yet, also access to the even bigger range of stuff they didn't keep physically in stock but could order.  At that point they'd have something in-store you couldn't get out of store, at least not legally: a way to fully preview even fairly obscure releases.  Push a button and pick up the cd in 1-2 days.  Or a week for 'long-tail' items they had to order in.  

I'd have spent a fortune that way, instead I turned to youtube, spotify, amazon, occasionally popping into my local HMV on a whim, watching as the twilight posters and one direction calendars, games, dvds, overpriced headphones and so forth slowly crowded out even the poppiest end of music I might want to buy.

Beyond QPR, it looks like Villa and Newcastle are now in a race to the bottom, and this should hopefully help in our quest to stay afloat. It'll be interesting to watch developments at Southampton as well, as I'm not sure if Pochettino can conserve the momentum from Adkins recent run of good form as well as connect with the players.

true,Shameful_pleasure,null,null,"The subject of gift cards is quite interesting. Yes they are unimiginative, but they can be useful.  I work in a supermarket with a full 4' display of gift cards prominently displayed near the checkouts. The store makes no profit on that section, they are just there as a service offered. It's not just for those that can't be bothered though, I have seen someone buy iTunes vouchers as a present with a birthday card, just for someone to come in later stoned trying to get a refund for the same value of iTunes vouchers being produced from a birthday card. They are good for when you have an idea of what someone wants but not the exact details of it, and don't want to get it wrong. Or when you don't know what to get, but you know that cash would only be pissed away on everyday crap, bills or going out on the lash.

They are also a good idea for refunds and exchanges from a business point of view, if there is no proof of purchase available from someone wanting a refund it gives an option other than a flat no, that doesn't leave the company out of pocket, promotes further custom at that store and improves the sense of positive customer service.  

I myself have a £35 gift card from HMV sitting in my pocket that I got for a game I traded in. Was it a mistake to take this instead of the lower amount of cash offered? In hindsight yes, but at the time I really didn't think this would happen. If anything I thought that GAME would go fully bust first, which is why I didn't do the trade in there.

So I do not believe the protection needed is to say don't buy them, and have thoughts of hell mend you if you do and it backfires. There does need to be a guarantee put in place as gift cards are currently a multi million pound industry built on trust.

British TV drama's in-crowd regularly complains about how they can't compete with brave stuff coming out of HBO like *The Wire*. But one of the purposes of BBC3 was to give an audience for new drama, to act as an incubator for new content and new talent.  So the question *shouldn't* be ""with what do we fill the rather lacklustre shoes of *Merlin*?"" but rather ""which of the many successful, innovative programs on BBC3 should get the million-quid-an-episode boost to the BBC1 bigtime?""  

I genuinely don't know if BBC3 has produced viable successors for this slot. If it hasn't, shouldn't some heads roll?

true,NotMud,null,null,"One of my first experiences of reddit was /r/srsdiscussion. I mistakenly interpreted the 'srs' bit as an abbreviation of 'serious'. Aha, I thought to myself. This is the kind of intellectual stimulation I signed up for!

There was a thread about eating and eating disorders. I weighed in with what I knew about them, basically advocating communication with (and care for) friends who are struggling. If somebody is having problems with their eating in any way, they could be unhappy and could do with the support of their friends rather than a weird, isolated limbo. Right? Apparently not - the resultant fiasco was very different to what I was expecting. Apparently my suggestion was basically the same as making clucking noises when a fat person came into a restaurant, 'body-policing', and all sorts of other phrases. 

I wasn't sure what was going on and felt I was being misunderstood, so I gently clarified my point that if a close friend is having problems of any sort, medical or otherwise, you should be supportive in any way you can. Not unsolicited comments about people's weight of course (the inhabitants of /r/srsdiscussion seemed to have immediately assumed I was talking about obesity, whereas I actually had undereating in mind) I was told - and I think this is verbatim - to ""take my concern and shove it up my ass"". I was then banned, leaving me baffled as to how this so-called 'serious' discussion group could possibly be so hysterical.

So no, it's not possible for anything of value to be discussed on /r/srsdiscussion because contentious comments (or indeed platitudes like the one above) are declared 'problematic' or 'triggering'.

It's not as though the technology wasn't there either. I used to live not far away from Milton Keynes, where there still is a large HMV &amp; there used to be a massive Virgin Megastore. The Virgin used to have an online catalogue &amp; listening station that was very well stocked with both content &amp; information. Surely the step up to what you say, and I have to agree wholeheartedly with, is not a quantum leap?
I believe in later years, that it even got to the stage where, instead of taking an album up to the counter &amp; them playing it in a booth for you if you wanted to hear it, you could scan the barcode of the CD &amp; it would play straight away at a listening post.

If HMV had kept their eye on the ball, they would have adopted this technology &amp; kept on developing it as they went along.
Some HMV's may have had a similar setup, but I never noticed one &amp; I used to be a very good HMV customer, having spent literally thousands over the years.

They would have been on to a winner if they had listening stations whereby you could browse, order, listen to whole albums by scanning a barcode, listen online to anything they could order &amp; as the technology developed, have the facility to download specific songs (like iTunes) to a phone and/or email address, all being paid for at one of these stations.

I'm sure that the business model would have to be adapted to reduce stockholding of physical CD's in this scenario, but adopting new technology, adapting existing practice &amp; altering their stock lines in accordance with all that, may just have kept them alive.

This all may be with the benefit of hindsight and iTunes influence, but I think they missed several tricks along the line.

Without a flag, there wouldn't be one symbol of the country, unless you used something else, which would still inevitably be tied to illusions of grandeur in some way or another from the past. 

You also make the point that being under the same flag automatically aligns us with the acts of our predecessors. This is not true! You assume that due to the flag, and presumably the act of flying the flag, we are *proud* of our past. I'm not sure that holds water. The flying of the flag in the mind of most simply symbolises their nationality. While they may be proud of their nationality, it's more likely they're proud of what they're doing now.

&gt;you listen to the modern Iroquois living on reserves and try to get past the later influences of European settlers in north America.

True, but we aren't talking about two separate races from two different continents with two separate languages, so there is no comparison with Ulstermen and Scots from Gaelic backgrounds. And I thought we all shared the same mid-Ulster English anyway so what unique aspects of Cuchulain would be captured when any observable differences have no doubt been lost over the past, oh I don't know, several hundred years? His religion? lol.

The idealised republican view of planters as somehow non-'native' has no practical bearing in today's NI. Moreover, given the shared history of this part of Ireland and Western Scotland, the Scots influence on Ulster would have been around prior to Cuchulainn visiting Scotland himself. So reflecting this in any modern day setting would not just be providing a familiar crutch to an audience already aware of the NI accent, but likely the most accurate representation too.

Essentially we defended in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Henderson on the LW not RCM where you have him. When we switched to possession it became much more fluid and hard to define in terms of a structured 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 formation. 

Basically [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=g7g) is what it looked like when we were in possession.

Henderson dropped deep and came inside multiple times, while Suarez was given a free role, drifting all over and, at times, into the space Henderson created.

Right now it would be Shelvey moving back to the reserves, so Henderson wouldn't necessarily be losing a spot in the squad. Sneijder would need time to adjust seeing as he hasn't played in a while, and the English League is FAR more fast paced and physical than the Italian league. 

If we want to try and go for top 4 this season, then Sneijder could be the link we need.

However at the same time, Suarez has been scoring goals for fun and we are drastically improving as a team. Against the top 10 teams, we need improvement moving from the second to the final third of the pitch. 

Henderson has the technical skill and capacity to be a wonderful player in that position. He's also physical commanding, quick paced and presses for 90+ minutes a game. Sneijder doesn't really possess any of those qualities. Something Rodgers needs in the squad.

I think it's one of those ""for the right price"" situations.

If you don't provide evidence of jobsearching, then they can stop your benefits. If you don't like the way your adviser checks your jobsearch, then provide other verification if you can. Reply letters and emails printed out are best.

No. Unless there is a very good reason why you cannot do them.

I'm not sure on this, though it is their job it to help you find work, and essentially get you off of their system. If you refuse to do more than the minimum, they may assume you are just being an arse, and look for other means to get you off of their system, like trying to suggest that you are actively dodging work.

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"This is not really necessarily true. From my own perspective, I would probably vote (with significant reservations) to stay in the EU. It does however irritate me when people say that to be pro-EU is the only educated decision. There are many reasons to be against EU membership, just as there are many reasons for.

The EU is a large market, and developed, and it is in our economic interest to be able to trade and move goods and people as easily as possible within it. As a trading bloc it is economically the largest, although will probably be overtaken by the ASEAN union in the next 50 years. 

It isn't however good in terms of regulation regarding state aid, procurement etc; much of our economic recovery has been hampered by regulation designed to maintain adherence to a common market but prevents either state-intervention in certain enterprises that need it to remain competitive etc. It also makes us less competitive in terms of exporting to developing nations, and the BRIC countries. This is just a small snapshot.

There's also the issue that the EU is becoming more and more a club with interests diverting from the UK interest- it is not only an inevitable but, for it's future, essential fact that EU policy will become more and more focused on the good at the eurozone, even at the cost of non-EMU members. There are legal structures being determined that absolutely require consent of the peoples of the Union but likely will not face the test of popular opinion. In the implementation of the Lisbon treaty we also saw French and Irish votes ignored, which should worry anybody of a liberal or democratic disposition. So many people who wer natural supporters of the EU are finding that it is becoming an organisation that is following troubling precedents in troubling times. The treatment of Greece in the last 3 years ranks as one of the continent's greatest shames since WW2.

So even though I don't necessarily agree with secessionists, there are many educated, logical people who want out, and an EU exit certainly wouldn't benefit the elite of this country.",0,1358644547,null,0,false,0,c800qwr,t3_16vg6l,t1_c800qwr,t1_c7zu6br,null,1431017146,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of Sneijder at Liverpool, but I also love the idea of blooding out young players into who they could become. Henderson's performance today completely sealed for me the opinion that he could FEASIBLY step into that Stevie G role when our beloved skipper moves to greener pastures (hopefully as a coach), and I agree, he is inconsistent. But I think the prospect of him coming into his own as a true, die-hard, Liverpool presence on the pitch is there. Under a layer of youth. Keep handing Hendo starts (at least over Allen, until Allen starts showing up in the position he wants to be played in) and I thin that £20 mil price tag might prove to be an investment for the future much more than an immediate £8 mil(?) offer for an immediate reprieve.

No, you cannot. They can mandate any training, and it's all cheap and worthless.

Yes. Your JSA is separate from the WP, and they can mandate additional job searching. Even the New Deal were able to do this, we used to have to apply for 4 jobs a day there.

If anyone is reading this and thinking of doing the same, don't! Refusing to apply for any job is an instant 4 week sanction-able offence, whether it was given to you by the jobcentre or the work programme. It sounds like FPS was there voluntarily, which is perhaps why they were more lenient with him/her. The jobcentre can give you a JSD to apply for a job, or raise a 'doubt' about your availability for work if you refuse. Both lead to a sanction. The Work Programme merely have to kick you off the course for refusing a mandated action, which is an instant sanction too.

Think of it like writing in a journal. You come to have a journal that's full of notes, written from page to page, not an empty spot missing on any page. This would be the Eccleston and Tennant days, but you realize there's no more room to write anything. So you put away this old journal and grab yourself a new one.

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"I'd like to contrast how we played this game with how we played against United with a CM of Gerrard, Lucas and Allen.

Yesterday there was a lot of movement by the players at the top of the formation (and/including Johnson), with Gerrard a link between the top/front 4/5 players (Suarez, Sturridge, Downing, Henderson, and Johnson), and the defensive 4/5 players (Carra, Agger, Wisdom, Lucas and Johnson). This meant that everyone had a lot of space to move through/to and people to pass to, with lots of cross field and up/down field runs to open more space, receive and give better passes etc.

Against United however, the front players were very disconnected from the defensive players with both Gerrard and Allen trying to provide a link up, but both doing so from a very flat line that was either too close or too far away from the defence.

My worry is that a CM of Gerrard, Lucas and Allen simply won't work. Allen appears, to me, to be redundant in a 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 formation that we're trying to play. He neither distributes the ball well enough, nor reads the game to intercept/tackle well enough, compared to Gerrard or Lucas, leading him to be a bit ""jack of all trades, master of none"". Anything he does can be done better by both players, and I mean anything, in that he has nothing more to add. He's competent enough to fill in for either player as he did for Lucas at the start of the season, but not to play at the same time as both of them.

Further, if you look at the contribution of Henderson today, a player who has completely different attributes to his game to Allen, you see what is clearly missing when we load the CM with Allen in addition to Gerrard and Lucas: not enough pace, no shot threat, poorer tackling, less movement, and so on.

What're you thoughts on this? Do you think that these problems are systemic, or just a consequence of Allen having a poor game? I personally think they're systemic, and we won't - or at least *shouldn't* - be seeing Allen play in CM with Gerrard and Lucas again for the rest of the season regardless of Allen's form. Allen should be trained to be a replacement for Gerrard's new deep lying play making role.",0,1358679083,null,0,false,0,c807o84,t3_16w0if,t1_c807o84,t3_16w0if,null,1431020538,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; Without referring to anything else, intrinsically, taken without qualifications, etc. A common example is negligence per se. See also malum in se.

...which might be as clear as mud (a simile, if I'm not mistaken!).

So, your sentence contains the same meaning without 'per se'.

&gt; The thing is in America there are a lot of teenagers 'coming out' as atheists, into families that will shun them for doing so and it's a rebellious act.

Your use of 'quote marks' indicates to me, at least, that we need to understand 'coming out' is being used as a metaphor (I hope - my English teacher might correct me), not as an actual statement of ""I'm stepping out of this room/closet.""

My experience of Asian people is that they bring with them an entrepreneurial spirit and higher standards of education. Their kids do better than white kids, despite often not speaking English when they start school, in terms of GCSEs, only black kids remain behind white kids now.

With regard to muslims, they don't drink; our binge drinking culture (which I admit to partaking in from time to time) is dangerous and costly for the NHS.

Immigrants also can't start claiming benefits for a while, so they aren't a drain on the government and have to work, unlike English people.

I could go on but it's pointless. Whilst I agree that they can be more prejudiced, this won't enter the law over here, and after a couple of generations I'm sure that most of the new kids won't share the same out-dated views.

But if we manage to make 4th place it would be amazing.

At the rate we're going, I'm pretty sure we'll have CL football by next season, if we can keep Suarez and get a legit attacking midfielder.

Edit: Arsenal have two games yet to be played and are tied on points with us. They face Chelsea today (hopefully dropping points) and West Ham in three days before facing us. Realistically, they might lose to Chelsea and beat West Ham, going three points ahead of us. We can then close that gap if we beat them away in 10 days.

Everton's next two fixtures are Southampton and West Brom, I think they will take 4-6 points from those two games. Hopefully 4.

Spurs face Man United and Norwich next. They might take 3-4 points from those two games.

He and Coutinho are hugely different types of players, and Coutinho is much better suited to what we're after - he can play along the front 4, he's a pacey dribbler and a good passer. 

Also, keep in mind Benteke's looking good because Villa are a long-ball team; if you rank the PL teams in terms of what % of their passes are long (on a per game average), Villa are 6th, behind Reading, Newcastle, Stoke, West Ham &amp; Sunderland; ahead of Norwich.

1. Your e-mail is private, he/she has no business or authority to go poking at your e-mail account.  The standard form the DWP had you fill in is sufficient evidence.  At worst print off the e-mails (on site, using their printer) and present those to the adviser.   If he/she won't accept them:  complain, in writing. 

2. Yep, welcome to course hell.  None of them will be much if any use to someone with even a GCSE level education, most will be missold to you by your adviser and thus you'll often be walking in to an 'advanced interview technique' session to face basic literacy and numeracy tests with nothing else. 

3. Can you drive a truck?  No, you don't have a HGV license.  Does that stop you applying for a truck driving job?  No, it doesn't.  Do you have any chance of getting that job? No, not even the slightest chance.  Is it an extra application?  Yes, yes it is.   

You are being told to hoop jump, so hoop jump.  The purpose of the exercise is hoop jumping NOT finding you a position of employment.  Job hunt on your own time and not theirs would be my best advice to you.
