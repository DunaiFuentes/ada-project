true,TedsBabies,eng-derbyshire,Derbyshire,"They can't just evict tenants because of the uproar that it would cause. The government coming along and forcefully removing an old lady from her house doesn't make for good headlines. This story doesn't make them either, but I don't believe that she killed herself solely because of £20 a week. I believe she had other underlying issues. The charge on empty rooms is just to motivate people to move, it's a lot friendlier to the tenants, and is better for the government, as they don't get labeled as tyrants. 

In the long run, I can see the charge being a very good thing by helping to efficiently allocate the current housing. Also, from the BBC (whom I trust much more than the Mirror): ""The council said Mrs Bottrill had two successful bids for properties and as far as the authority was aware, she was going to move into one of those."" So there were two properties that she had been offered, and one of those was 30 minutes from the bus stop. Although we know nothing of the other one, from the Mirrors slant on the story, and the fact that they only included one of the prospective properties, I have a feeling that the other one was much better, and the Mirror didn't include any mention of it as it would have gone against their argument. 

Any new charge or benefits cut carries the risk of someone that isn't completely stable doing something drastic, such as what Mrs Bottrill has done, but one isolated incident should not mean complete reversal of a plan that has been put in place for the good of all of those that have to rely on council provided accommodation.

&gt;Intending to confirm the **solidarity** which binds Europe and the overseas countries and desiring to ensure the development of their prosperity, in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

&gt;Resolved by thus **pooling their resources** to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty, and calling upon the other peoples of Europe who share their ideal to join in their efforts,

true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"Computers are more accurate. But they can't make decisions, and can't respond to unprogrammed scenarios. With road vehicles, that's less important; the amount of responses to any problem is limited, and will always start with stopping the car. Also Google has far from proven this; while they have said that the only accidents were when it was being driven manual, they haven't maid available the amount of accidents that were avoided due to the safety driver being there.

I am a pilot, but not an airline pilot. But there is no risk of automation taking airline pilot jobs. Search and rescue, police helis, maybe cargo aircraft a long, long time down the line but not passenger aircraft. Automation is, as I have explained, about helping the crew, not replacing them. The crew are still *the* integral part of the system. From your reply, it's clear you didn't read all of what I wrote as automation on airliners is not autonomous. It is controlled by the pilots. Computers and stupid and need people running them.

The technology has existed for 30 years that would allow you to make an aircraft that needed no human input, ie fully autonomous. It has not happened because it is not safe enough. For example, the Global Hawk, a semi autonomous long range UAV used in surveillance (not combat) has an accident rate of 8 per 100,000 flying hours. Modern western built airliners have an accident rate of 0.004 per 100,000 flying hours, thanks to the safety systems the pilots have at their disposal, the aircraft they are flying, the training they have received, the help they have been given by ATC but most of all, their skill and judgement.

That's the way it is and will always be where safety is integral to flight. The industry understands this, people who think like you do are outside it with no experience.

If Airbus or Boeing thought they could make a pilotless airliner, they'd do it in a hearbeat. But even their most advanced aircraft take 2 well trained, competent people to fly.",0,1368533028,null,0,false,0,c9yi0o2,t3_1ea2o2,t1_c9yi0o2,t1_c9yhq46,null,1431162751,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,VikingHedgehog,mcgannnew,new McGann,"I started with Who back in 2005, with the Christmas special. I was living in England and as an American, who was only 18 at the time, I had NO idea what Doctor Who was. The people I was staying with made a HUGE deal about having to watch the Christmas special on Christmas day! It seemed really strange to me. I watched the first episode with David Tennant and was confused but sort of enjoyed it. Not enough to look into it further though. 

So jump ahead to a few months ago and I ran out of shows to watch on Netflix so I figured I'd give it a try. I started with 9 and was confused (not getting the whole regeneration thing yet) as to why he wasn't the guy I'd seen way back when in England, but let it go and watched on. I LOVED 9 by about the middle of his series and when he left I was so upset! 

Then I moved onto 10 and it took me a few episodes but then I realized I was in love with this Doctor. He was great. I liked everything about him. I was very upset when he left and many tears were shed. I had handled the 9/10 switch the best I could, only taking about 2 episodes for me to fall in love with 10. 

So, pushing forward I sped into 11's first several episodes and I was...not amused. I was still upset about 10 and just not getting on board with 11. I persisted though and am all caught up and have since re-watched all the episodes. I'm still not a huge 11 fan, but he is still the Doctor to me now. He grew on me, like I think they all do. Like I think they all should. 

I think that's just part of how the show and the Doctor are supposed to be. At first you're like ""WHAT?! Who's this new guy?!"" but then slowly they at least win you over enough to still enjoy the show. They might not be your favorite, they might not be YOUR Doctor, but they are still the Doctor, so you still love them for that.

true,Grumbillz,null,null,"I know there are a lot of Torres fans on here, I'm one of them. I love the guy as a person, but he has had his chances and is not good enough for this team. 

Yes, he does other things like help out in midfield, but that is not his primary job, and does not preclude whoever we get instead to also help out in midfield, maybe even better than him. I think Rooney has shown that he can play this secondary role as well for example, while being a far superior striker. 

Yes, all the good strikers miss a lot of chances and rack up stats against weaker teams. But by ""missing chances"" that means keepers tipping over the bar, creating chances out of nothing under heavy pressure and then slipping it just wide of the post, bringing down a longball with a sublime touch, beating a defender and hitting a shot off the woodwork. 

It doesn't mean being dispossessed of the ball with ease, a horrendous first touch that brings any build-up play to a screeching halt, falling over when no-one else is around him, or dribbling shots straight into the keeper. I've exaggerated both sides of this spectrum to more clearly make the point, which is those other strikers are simply better skilled at the striker position. How much of this is Torres' fault or injury I don't know.

Even with a style that does not prioritize a striker as the main focus of our goalscoring attack, we still create a disproportionate amount of chances for our strikers.

If a gay couple rents a room from an anti-gay landlord, the landlord isn't harmed in any way due to their sexual orientation. As long as they pay their rent on time, keep the property in order, etc. then there is simply no justifiable reason for the landlord to deny services to the couple.

On the other hand, if a landlord is permitted to discriminate, the gay couple in question do suffer measurable harm in that they have a restricted choice of services when compared to non-gay couples, among other things. If this is allowed to happen, it will put discriminated minorities at a sociological disadvantage to the rest of society, which at the end of the day is bad for everybody.

It's simply unjustifiable to inflict this amount of harm on members of society who are doing absolutely nothing wrong, just because the landlord finds it 'icky'.

true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"What are you talking about here, automated road vehicles or others? For aviation it definitely is about safety, because unmanned aircraft are demonstrably less safe and pilot action saves more lives than are killed by pilot error. That's why UAVs are really only being used (and are only foreseen to be used) for high risk flying, that you're actually making safer because you're taking the human out. Aviation isn't concerned by what the public thinks, because they know the public will come to accept any change. But it is concerned with safety. 

If you're talking about road vehicles... Well it's a lot of reasons. One is safety, there are safety concerns with automated vehicles. However, as I said, it's much less of an issue than aviation because there is really only one response to any problem (stop). It's easy to program for a lot of eventualities. However, not everything that is fully automated is safer (quite the opposite). Trust is a bigger issue than most people make. If a large car manufacturer was able to demonstrate that a driverless car was as safe if not safer than a driven car, then any opposition would melt away, as it would if Boeing or Airbus were able to demonstrate an unmanned airliner with an accident rate of 1 in every 10 million flights, which is what we have now with 2-crew airliners. 

But there's more to consider than just this for cars, such as development costs, an apathetic public (not scared, just not very interested... lots of people like driving), laws which are based around conventional vehicles, infrastructure which doesn't fully support the vision of driverless vehicles etc. Also, I'd be careful when talking about the google car because despite not being very accident prone, it drives slowly, can't handle heavy traffic properly, and ends up creating traffic jams all the time. In other words, it's not operating in a normal environment. 

Anyway, tech in road vehicle is not applicable to air vehicles, the difference in inherent risk is massive. That's why airline pilots are some of the most highly trained professionals on Earth and to drive a car you need to pass a 40 minute driveabout. 

Also you have to remember that people accept a certain level of risk when they drive... People expect their flight to be as safe as is humanly possible, however. ",0,1368535096,null,0,false,0,c9yidzw,t3_1ea2o2,t1_c9yidzw,t1_c9yi7ol,null,1431162576,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

By the way, the reason why there is a name for the persecution of Jews is because, regardless of what you just said, it is fundamentally different to other forms of discrimination. It's not racist, religious persecution, political persecution, xenophobia, etc. rather, it's all of those combined. Don't pretend that a persecution culminated in the extermination of two thirds of the population of peoples on an entire continent - 70 years ago in a country that is today one of the foremost progressive democracies - is in no way significant.

I know that it's popular amongst revisionists to point to other examples of genocides and persecution in history and act like it invalidates the holocaust and subsequent stress of countering anti-Semitism. However, what makes the persecution of the Jews significant is not that it was uniquely bad, and certainly not that it was a unique example of genocide, but rather, like I said, it was the near annihilation of a group that had been living in the foremost progressive continent in the planet for thousands of years. What's more, what almost single-handedly caused the holocaust was nothing more than poor economic circumstance, which we are experiencing now, and has lead to the rising of a Neo-Nazi party in Greece. People who denounce the holocaust as insignificant are simply reflecting the fact that they don't understand what gives it its significance.

If we look at facts, City won 1 FA Cup and were lucky to win an EPL, but they've got out prematurely twice in the champions league and lost the FA cup final, in which bar Chelsea, they had another very easy route. 

You can argue that 'He's the first manager in 44 years to win blah blah' but its also the first time in 44 years that Man City were able to spend the money they have; it all correlates.

Journey's End is when I got sick of Russel T. Davies. He had this habit of constantly one-upping himself with the season finales and this one felt to me like he finally put down the pen and just decided to masturbate to his own brilliance all over the script. A cop-out regeneration, really? 

Plus, he gives the annoying, so-glad-she's-frakking-gone companion everything she ever wanted in the whole wide world while he shits (taking away everything she ever wanted in the whole wide world) all over the companion that best compliments the Doctor and brings none of the silly romantic undertones to the table.

End of Time makes me cry because RTD undermined Ten's character to set up for the regeneration. After years of a strict ""can't change fixed points/established/important events"" policy he suddenly gains a ridiculous god complex that facilitates his entitled, whiny, pre-regeneration rant. Having Ten throw a *temper tantrum* was the worst thing RTD ever did. Despite my love for Ten and apprehension over how Matt would perform, I was glad when the regeneration finally came just because it meant RTD wouldn't be able to fuck things up anymore.

The problem? It wouldn't be safe. Global Hawk (UAV, not a combat role) accident rate: 8 per 100,000 flying hours. Modern airliner: 0.004 per 100,000 flying hours.

The problem is that although a computer is more accurate than a human, and can do tasks quicker, it is not (and will never be) more intelligent. That is a fundamental limitation of computers as we know them now. As such, there are some things that a computer can never do - react properly to unexpected or unprogrammed situations, for example. Automation, as it exists today in airliner cockpits, as it will continue to exist is there to help the pilots, not to fly for them. 

&gt;Just because a passenger plane cant land today automatically, but a drone can does not mean that it would be impossible for that technology to one day apply to passenger aircraft. Indeed, it is odd that such things are not routine already.

Just stop talking, your lack of understanding on the subject is comical.

Passenger planes can land automatically. They need the pilots to control the autopilot and handle all the ancillary systems but automatic landings, as I've said, have existed since 1965. However they are ground based navigation aids so if an airport doesn't have the equipment you can't do anything. The system is also prone to error, and when doing autolandings you need much bigger spacing between aircraft to avoid interference. 99% of landings are manual because pilots need the manual flying practice, as autopilots fail, things go wrong and the A/P can't handle half the situations you can throw at it.

""It is odd that such things are not routine already..."" Good god, I hope you become educated on the subject, and take a look at this again... 

Now, I actually don't have a problem in believing that, in 100 years, there will be a way to engineer pilots out of airliner cockpits safely. However, not with the tech that is being trialled here, which is for high risk missions. 

And don't forget that this ""discussion"" (although discussion implies that both parties are knowledgeable on the subject) stemmed from you saying that pilots are simply a back up and do not fly, which is quantifiably false. Pilots fly their aircraft whenever they are in the air, with the AP on or not; the crew are in command and control at all times.

&gt;All drones are not created equal. Some have different crash rates, just as manned systems do, according to drone expert Peter Singer. And, like manned craft, crash rates diminish as the technology advances.

&gt;""The crash rates tend to go down the longer that they've been in service,"" said Singer. ""The newer the system the more technical problems, the more we don't know about its particulars, the more kinks that have to be worked out."" 

...

&gt;""You sometimes put them into situations that you might not put a manned system in,"" said Singer. ""Or in certain situations, you decide to crash them, lose them, destroy them in a way that wouldn't be on the table with a manned system.""

&gt;A deliberate loss of a UAV would count in the accident rates.

...

&gt;But despite the high-tech nature of the aircraft, not all crashes are technical mishaps. Early versions of the Predator drones were fair-weather fliers and were prone to crashing in icy conditions. Now, de-icing systems have been added to the UAVs.

&gt;""Many of the (crash) cases have nothing to do with the fact that it's high technology. It has to do with the fact that it's new technology and they have to work out the kinks,"" Singer said.

&gt;Then there's the human factor. In 2010 a Predator drone crashed northeast of Kandahar Air Base in Afghanistan after the remote pilot pushed an incorrect button. 

So, some of the problems have nothing to do with the drones being unmanned, some of the problems are due to the military taking advantage of the fact that the drones were unmanned and some are actually caused by remote pilot error. Fully automated vehicles would stop some of those problems from arising in the first place.

You say that the hardware is different in road and air vehicles, but that's not really the issue. The issue is the software which controls that hardware. Such software would be considered pretty basic by today's standards and if the hardware was going to fail, it would fail regardless of who or what was controlling it.

Otherwise, I am on the fence about him.  We would get more money for him than Defoe, but I still would rather have him stick around than Defoe.  Defoe is older and just isn't as versatile.  Having re-watched the Stoke match, I thought that Adebayor may have put the most effort into the match of our players.  He looked hungry, had a good touch, and just seemed very different compared to what he has done before now.  He didn't look as sharp as he did last season, but I think he is certainly regaining that.  I think people criticizing him so far is completely fair, but I hope those people also can recognize he has stepped his performances up significantly recently.

Sure, that is the idea behind a representative democracy. Unfortunately in our situation it is flawed by an apathetic or poorly informed electorate and a corporate media.

So they won't consider the issue for its merits. Because they care about being elected or getting other top jobs should that cease to be the case. Which often means going against the interests of the electorate (even if the electorate doesn't realise it).

true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt;With regards to UAVs, from this article:

Oh wow, CNN!

&gt;All drones are not created equal. Some have different crash rates, just as manned systems do

This is true. However, the 4 aircraft with the highest accident rates in the USAF? All drones. 

&gt;""You sometimes put them into situations that you might not put a manned system in,""

Not the Global Hawk or any other current USAF combat program. In civil use, yes you would, that's the point of them for that role. 

&gt;. Early versions of the Predator drones were fair-weather fliers and were prone to crashing in icy conditions. Now, de-icing systems have been added to the UAVs.

Right, that was back when the Pred had a 70 per 100,000 flying hour accident rate. Now it's 6, which is still one of the highest in the fleet. 

&gt;Fully automated vehicles would stop some of those problems from arising in the first place.

That's certainly true. But it would introduce many more, such as failure of responses to new situations.

&gt;Such software would be considered pretty basic by today's standards and if the hardware was going to fail, it would fail regardless of who or what was controlling it.

The fact that it's failing isn't quite the question. The point is the response to that failure. In 2005, a British Airways A319 lost all power for 90 seconds while climbing out of Heathrow. While the First Officer went through the steps to get power back, the Captain flew manually with no instruments by looking at the horizon.

In 2009, a Tu-154 lost all electrical power and the pilots were forced to find - by sight - an abandoned runway in the forest and landed safely.

In 2010, a British Airways 747 was accelerating for takeoff at Johannesburg when the reversers for engines 2 and 3 registered unlocked due to an electrical fault. The inboard slats (high lift devices) retracted automatically, causing the aircraft's stall (aerodynamic) alarm to go off. The aircraft was at the proper speed and attitude, the flight director (computer program) disregarded the warning. The First Officer flew the aircraft at very low altitude along the runway until he was convinced the aircraft was not stalling before climbing away. Had they followed the FD and continued the climb, they would have crashed.

In 2008, a British Airways (lots of BA stuff here, partly great pilots but also that's just what I have info on) 777 lost thrust in both engines while on approach to Heathrow. There was no warning, because the engines did not fail. The aircraft did not know that anything was wrong. The pilots realised they weren't getting the thrust they needed, and while the FO glided the plane down, the Captain retracted flaps 2 nothces (something they had not been trained to do - this was an intelligent, human response to a new situation) and extended the glide, narrowly landing inside the airport boundary.

In 2005, a Malaysia Airlines 777 went out of control when the aircraft received inaccurate air data while flying on autopilot. The aircraft registered both low and high speed warnings simultaneously, and the autopilot set full throttle and rapidly pitched up, almost stalling and rolling lover. The crew recovered, continued manually and landed safely.

In 2011, a Sunwing 737 was on takeoff when the flight director commanded a nosedown input. The pilots continued the takeoff normally, did not engage the auopilot and turned off the flight director. Had the aircraft been flying automatically, it would have flown into the ground.

In 2009, a US airways Airbus A320 lost all thrust after ingesting birds on takeoff. The crew ditched the aircraft safely in the Hudson. 

Going back further... In 1989, a United Airways DC-10's tail mounted engine flew apart, taking out all hydraulics. The pilots fly the aircraft by differential engine thrust on the remaining two engines alone, and managed to crash land on a runway, saving 2/3 of the people on board.


These are all unforeseen events, that the crews were not trained for, and that were never thought possible. The crews in each case used their experience, knowledge and training to save the aircraft in a way a computer simply couldn't - these events were not thought possible; if the pilots weren't trained for it, a computer wouldn't be programmed for it. A fully autonomous airliner would have crashed in every one of these scenarios.  There are many others than just like these. 

Forgetting the fact that the tech doesn't really exist, forgetting the fact that an airliner is safer if it's being controlled by humans, forgetting the massive investment required to make an autonomous airliner, forgetting the public mood, forgetting the current laws, forgetting airline preferences, forgetting what the manufacturers know and want - for that reason alone, the response to sudden and unforeseen emergencies, pilots are worth having.

Key comment:
&gt;The researchers concluded that after initial weight reduction in obese people, circulating levels of hormones thought to encourage post-diet weight regain do not revert to the levels seen before weight loss. One of the researchers described this as a “co-ordinated defence mechanism” with multiple components all directed towards making us put on weight. In other words, the body mounts a backlash against dieting and the reduced intake of food and energy it brings.",0,1368540651,null,0,false,0,c9yjp7k,t3_1e7r35,t1_c9yjp7k,t1_c9y9w54,null,1431161958,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Its called shopping around and the rent is high because consumers are perfectly happy shopping at these service stations because they provide a convenience. Only very immature people complain about the prices they charge.

In fact if the rent is so high then its not actually the business owners fault at all that they charge higher prices than places less conveniently located, completely destroying the point of the announced proposals.

TBH I expect most of these internship positions to move to apprenticeships so that they can pay £2-3 ph. I expect a few internships will be withdrawn as they will not be profitable even at the apprenticeship wage.

So you could argue here that by government intervention in the market, we are seeing a less efficient outcome. On the other hand, the free market theory doesn't specify anything about the desirability of the allocation of resources that is achieved, only that (assuming perfect competition, no barriers to entry etc) that the most efficient outcome will be achieved. Are we better off with only the wealthy having access to highly competitive jobs? Maybe that isn't an optimal outcome after all - as wealth doesn't have an exact correlation with ability or skill.

It's tough for every one right now. I am not above working in a low paying customer service position but I am not at that stage yet where I have to lower my aims and ambitions. I'd like to think I can stay working in my sector.

I personally feel its borderline racist against black people to be putting them on this pedestal and to produce shows highlighting the fact. This appears to have been misconstrued to mean I am being ""Oh me oh my I'm a white and no one will speak for me"", which is actually the polar opposite of my view. The stats don't lie, I will concede that but they don't help break down the walls for black men. They just highlight them and then we all go ""oh that's a shame"". What about black men is really holding them back? I very much doubt that every job they go for has a racist boss who won't hire them. Perhaps I am simply too naive as a non-racist white man though? 

I believe every one should be treated on their merit and the governments current position on people with disabilities and minority targets getting guaranteed interviews goes against what I believe. If you are good enough, if you can do the job, you should get it. It shouldn't be a case of ""oh dear we've hired too many non disabled people, we better positively discriminate to get some people in wheelchairs on board.""

Likewise it pisses me off to go through an application process when the government have made it illegal to give jobs for mates. There has to be a proper process and every one is apparently in with a fair shot. I find that incredibly counter productive as I will go for a job, spend that time preparing only to see they employ someone they have previously had in mind for the role. What's so bad about jobs for mates any way? 

If you watched the show you'll have seen that they spent a good 1/4 of it following a guy who was a thief, had no qualifications and had been arrested a few times. They basically made him out like his skin colour was to blame (at least that's what the tone of the show suggested) rather than his upbringing or other issues. Why is that any different from any skin colour or ability? 

Perhaps I live in a dream world though. I don't work in the business sector which appears to be where a lot of the stats used last night came from. It was 1 in 100 board room members were black I believe, something extreme like that. I bet there's not many who come from normal backgrounds, who didn't go to university or who don't have rich parents either though. 

So direct answers..

1. I'd like them to focus on the fact that this generation of youngsters are being told that university will fix their ills, how it's a good investment and the best option. Only for them to come out of university saddled with debt (not for us Scots luckily), face a bleak future, for their degree to be almost meaningless beyond someone taking a quick look to make sure you're ""smart"" enough for a role that has nothing to do with your degree. 

2. The show could have gripped me more by actually focussing on young black men who were digging deep and trying. I felt happy for the kid at the end who got to work in Buckingham Palace (his cv will glow from that) but I don't see why the focus on the criminal was so high. I don't feel sorry for him for making his choices.

Yes, I agree, it's *possible* that we create cheap artificial intelligence tomorrow, and get get rid of pilots. It's possible, as anything is. Is it more possible in 100 years? Very likely so. 

I still don't *think* it will happen. And don't say that's what my argument boils down to because it doesn't - I am talking from a realistic standpoint inside the industry. And if you think that I am wrong in saying that pilots won't go, because I can't account for future tech, then you too are mistaken in arguing that they will because you, also, are assuming things about future technology. 

I'll rephrase then:

Barring a tremendous technological breakthrough (which is possible but I find unlikely), airliners will remain crewed by humans for the foreseeable future. 

In any case, it doesn't change the fact that your assertions of airliner flying **as it is today** are conclusively false, and that the contents of this article - the test flight - pertain not to passenger operations, but to dangerous or long endurance civil ops (search and rescue, environmental research etc)...

I do agree that expanding the time slot wouldn't necessarily do a whole lot of good to every episode, but if you're blaming the writer for ""not writing a 45 minute episode"" then it's obvious that you've never written a script for anything before. To blame Neil for writing an episode that was apparently exactly 5 minutes ""too long"" is like blaming Matt Smith for not saying his lines fast enough to fit more in. 

This is kind of the nature of scriptwriting, after all. The general attitude is, write more than you know you could conceivably film. The writer presents a story, the story is trimmed a little bit for filming, it's filmed, and then cut some more for time and budget. It's very rare to hear of a show or movie that only writes exactly what's going to be filmed, and only airs exactly what was filmed.

What you should try to do, and it will more than likely keep you from going back to eating meat is diversify your diet completely by drawing protein sources from nuts, grains, pulses, vegetables. 

These protein sources have the added benefit of much needed vitamins and mineral especially iron. Quorn is very bland unless you are going to cut it up and use it in bakes/stews/curries/stir frys etc. Also Quorn is processed and has a high salt content compared to other sources.

&gt; the last recourse is for the government, acting on behalf of the apathetic public, to step in and create legal protection for the minority.

This is really the crux of the issue. Yes, on the whole we try to adhere to certain ideological principles about freedom. However, in certain edge cases, the government really needs to step in to protect society as a whole. This already applies in dozens of areas, for example:

* **Benefits**. *Most* people are expected to work to support themselves. Some people, in certain circumstances, simply aren't able to do this. Maybe they're disabled, need new qualifications or are too elderly. The government steps in to keep them afloat during this time.

* **Children**. People are, *on the whole*, expected to keep themselves alive, but people who are too young to look after themselves are entitled to care from the government. Either their parents must take care of them, or they must be taken into care. They must attend school, which is provided for free.

* **Prison**. People are *generally* entitled to freedom of movement and privacy. For some people this right has to be removed - to protect others - while they are rehabilitated.

* **Freedom of speech**. People are *normally* entitled to freedom of speech, but in some cases that speech - e.g. on national security issues - subjects others to immediate and serious danger, so it can be restricted.

* **Monopolies**. *Generally*, companies are free to compete in the market using whatever strategies they want. However, if one company dominates the market, its behaviour can be limited by the government to prevent it seriously abusing its power.

* **Employment**. *For the most part*, companies can fire and hire workers and control their job description/working conditions. However, in the past this has led to serious abuse of the workforce and widespread injury/health problems. The government and courts can step in to prevent companies treating their workers in certain ways.

* **Weapons**. In *general*, you are allowed to own whatever items you want. However, allowing people to own grenades and machine guns poses a massive threat to society, so these are prohibited.

etc.

This is not the case for those given life sentences (primarily murders).

The fixed term assigned in a life sentence MUST be served as a minimum. They still serve a life sentences, and must apply for parole. 

The change you are referring too is the removal of indeterminate imprisonment for public protection, or IPP. These were different from life sentences, and could be applied to a whole host of crimes, including straightforward assault, if the judge assessed the risk of the offender as being suitability high.

Someone could be sentenced to two years, or less, but with an IPP, and not be released for many years, often due to administrative failings in the parole system. It relied on being able to access rehabilitation systems in prison which the government neglected to supply funding for. The parole baords simply couldn't get the information they wanted due to either long waiting lists, or no facilities at all. It was this sentencing option which was removed in favour of longer sentences. 

Life sentences are less problematic because over the course of 15-25 years there generally IS time to appropriately access rehabilitation and psychological assessment facilities in prison, allowing the parole boards to act in an informed manner.

AVB has said before that he prefers two senior strikers (Ade/Defoe) and one youth striker in his setup as his preferred systems (4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3) only use one striker. All of spurs youth strikers are years from eclipsing either Ade or Defoe (if they do at all) and so if a striker is going to get bumped it is going to be be due to someone coming in.

So, assuming spurs bring in a class striker (who cannot play another position), which is doubtful, one of Ade or Defoe will probably have to move on. I cannot see Ade leaving before Defoe. Defoe is 30 and realistically has less than 18 months left at spurs, Ade is 28 (with a higher potential when he plays at it) and was purchased with a large upfront payment to subsidize his wages.

One more so that likely should have become set in stone based on the Doctor's belief that once you read/see something about the future it has to come true.)

Sadly those who need the homes the most can't get on the ladder as banks will not give them mortgages, and instead they must pay over the odds on Rental fees, wiping out a good 50-75% of monthly earnings leaving them very little to save.

And at the end of Season 7. We may know what the Doctor's name is. But that won't be the relevant piece of information either. Since it will be what is the fall out.

Silence must fall could mean literally anything. Hell it might just mean that people would bow down in silence. Or it could mean the downfall of the silence or a million other things. It's a very broad thing.

It doesn't imply the end of anything. But taken a certain way it could.

It also doesn't imply why the falling of the Silence is a bad thing.

Unfortunately I'm not even halfway into a 24 month contract, so I don't think I can do much with that.

I currently have a package with Sky that includes home phone, broadband and the most basic tv package they have. I may consider cancelling the Tv altogether but I will need to find out how this will impact the cost of my other parts of the package.

I could pay monthly, but I would be looking at payments of at least £50 per month, and there's no way I can afford that.

There isn't much overtime going right now, as our hours are based on our performance against projected sales, and we are barely meeting the target right now, most colleagues will be on their base contract hours.

I have not long set up my own computer &amp; games console repair business from home, and I do get the odd job but not much. I would like to advertise in the local newspaper, I just haven't gotten round to it yet.

I currently have 6 days off every second week, so I could do with a small job to fill some of those days and make me an extra bit of money, but there's nothing unskilled going in my area, most jobs are high paying professional roles.

My Fiancee currently pays in £20 more than me each month for the bills so she is giving a little bit. I work just round the corner from home and she has to take a short bus journey which costs her around £100 per month, so there isn't a massive gap in income. Not to mention simple things like she has to pay for more expensive and sometimes more frequent haircuts.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"I do. I don't think it was a failure of the system in the first half as much as it was the failure to take advantage of the opportunities it presents, and an unfamiliarity with how to do so. Some of the early movement was very good, but when Fulham started controlling a bit more of the ball, I felt like the midfield was a little unsure of their own positioning - the pressing from about the 10th minute to the equaliser was appalling. When Fulham started containing our movement a little better, we stopped finding space altogether. Jonjo was the real odd-man out, he didn't have the empty space to move into and the positions he wanted to take were often filled by Hendo and Coutinho, we spent a lot of time with 4 CMs and they didn't quite gel, understandably. 

So I think the system could work and the personnel do make sense, but it'll take more training and familiarity to get it out of the experimental stage. Maybe there *was* more to learn than I thought.

Depressingly, Coates still doesn't look like he's going to make it under Rodgers, although he wasn't bad in this match. Still too much of a Rafa/Kenny or even Houllier-style defender, not proactive enough to work under Rodgers. I would really like if he could go on loan and maybe develop into the player we thought he could be when we bought him, but I feel like he's more likely to be sold. Wisdom looked good, though.

It's a conglomerated bastardised version of the United States. Except with far, far more corruption and inequal levels of inequality. It's worked well for countries like Holland and Germany who were able to export in a high currency (the euro). If they'd had to trade with Spain in Spanish currency (therefore devalued on the international market) the Germans wouldn't have been earning a ton. 

Here's an example of this union - [whilst Germany knew Greece was going Pete Tong they only agreed to a bail out provided Greece spent billions on a german submarine](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/19/greece-military-spending-debt-crisis). Hypocrisy at it's finest. 

&gt;""It owes another €1bn as part of the deal. That's three times the amount Athens was asked to make in additional pension cuts to secure its latest EU aid package.""

What's more the politicians in the EU don't  feel the backlash UK (or other countries politicians do). They can't be voted out by the people - which is alarming if you believe in the best available proportional representation and a reliable democracy. 

Is a united Europe worth it when you let countries fall into desperation and everyone else into stagnation?

The EU's official motto is *United in diversity*.

I guess that's catchier than *Dragging Each Other Under.*

In regard to the UK I think it's a shit or get off the pot moment. Either we split or we come back to the table putting in all our effort to the EU. 

Edit: Thought of a few more. The EUs reliability for food is utter bullshit. How can you have free trade links with cpuntries like Italy and Poland who are owned by the Mafia? Who can intercept food without and put god knows what in it with impunity - no one has been prosecuted or charged since the horsemeat scandal! And the EU is going to open up free trade with the US who fill their food full of corn as its their main export and is why they have so many allergies/lactose intolerance. No thank you.

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"my experience with Private landlords as they are are far far worse than Social Housing Landlords.

I have been with the SHA for over 8 years, all issues fixed promptly, yearly checks done on the dot, no problems.

My sister on the other hand with private landlords has had everything from moving in then being told to leave within a matter of weeks because they wanted the property back (thus breeching tenancy agreement) they then turned up and accused her of damaging the property and stole her corporate laptop (police called) in the end the council intervened and struck the landlord from the rental lists, had them taken to court and fined for not placing the security deposit into the fund as obliged to do.

Then her next private rental had the landlord turning up and letting himself in to inspect the property, refusing to carry out repairs etc.

Much rather go Social than Private (plus the rent is controlled on social as they are not allowed to make a profit, but Gov lends them the money to build or purchase new properties, which any excess cash is used to pay back)

Just shame Gov stopped doing this and left Social Housing groups with land they can't build on (no free cash assets to pay for it as per Social contracts)

**TL;DR of my post:** 

* **How would the statistics help create a meaningful context for you in terms of time allocated to each demographical representation in the show?**

* **Due to confusion in one response section, do you believe in ""individual merit"" of a person rather than ""fair shot"" when applying and qualifying for a job of any position?**


# ` `

&gt; I personally feel its borderline racist against black people to be putting them on this pedestal and to produce shows highlighting the fact. This appears to have been misconstrued to mean I am being ""Oh me oh my I'm a white and no one will speak for me"", which is actually the polar opposite of my view. The stats don't lie, I will concede that but they don't help break down the walls for black men. They just highlight them and then we all go ""oh that's a shame"". What about black men is really holding them back? I very much doubt that every job they go for has a racist boss who won't hire them.

* How would be the best way to highlight the statistical data in your opinion? Feel free to be as detailed as you would like. It helps to understand (like this great reply as done!) more of what your opinion is.
* What in your views IS ""breaking down the walls for black men""? 
(I guess I do not understand this because of lack of clarity and personally, I felt the show didn't do a good job in explaining this, because it didn't say the cause for the statistical data for young black men... except for the opinions expressed at the start of the show by young black males meeting Sol Cambell).

By the way, in my personal view, to the point: ""they just highlight them and then we all go ""oh that's a shame"", you don't have to respond like that. You could just see the highlighted data points and just... listen to them (without the reaction of ""oh that's a shame"" as nobody is forcing a person to respond in that way). Even better maybe, is to ask further probing questions towards the statistical data.

# ` `

&gt; I believe every one should be treated on their merit and the governments current position on people with disabilities and minority targets getting guaranteed interviews goes against what I believe. If you are good enough, if you can do the job, you should get it. It shouldn't be a case of ""oh dear we've hired too many non disabled people, we better positively discriminate to get some people in wheelchairs on board.""

I see.  
To show my personal example of this to you (that there are people who believe in the same thing), I asked you questions because I trust you (or anyone really) to stand up for yourself by merit (by means of your own discussing / debating abilities) rather than to see skin colour (your, ""I'm white"" statement without preface) as a deciding factor of the point you are trying to highlight.
Hence why I appreciate the time you have given me to answer my questions fully.

* What do you think of my answer / response to ""this"" (your own as well as ""to giving people an equal chance"") case?
* What ways would you suggest to me to be more ""equal chance deciding"" via merit by your own experience of this (your reddit post) today?
 
# ` `

&gt; Likewise it pisses me off to go through an application process when the government have made it illegal to give jobs for mates. There has to be a proper process and every one is apparently in with a fair shot. I find that incredibly counter productive as I will go for a job, spend that time preparing only to see they employ someone they have previously had in mind for the role. What's so bad about jobs for mates any way? 

I apologise but I do not understand clearly what you are trying to say in this paragraph. :(
What are ""mates""? Friends? Currently, I read this paragraph as follows:

""The government has made it illegal to give jobs to friends. There needs to be a proper process and every one is apparently in with a fair shot.""

(*ASIDE - Is this a bad thing? I'm confused because your previous paragraph said: ""I believe every one should be treated on their merit and the governments current position on people with disabilities and minority targets getting guaranteed interviews goes against what I believe"".  
Do you mean in summary, that everyone should be treated on his or hers own merit, but this **does not** mean they have a fair shot?*)

""I find that incredibly counter productive as I will go for a job, spend that time preparing only to see they employ someone they have previously had in mind for the role. What's so bad about jobs for mates any way?""

(*ASIDE - Adding to the previous section, are you saying, you believe that as a friend of someone in the business already, your merit is stronger than someone outside of the inner business circle and that ""fairness"" is not possible?  
Or, that because businesses are hiring friends anyway, why is the process of hiring friends who they know, illegal?*)

# ` `

&gt; If you watched the show you'll have seen that they spent a good 1/4 of it following a guy who was a thief, had no qualifications and had been arrested a few times. They basically made him out like his skin colour was to blame (at least that's what the tone of the show suggested) rather than his upbringing or other issues. Why is that any different from any skin colour or ability? 

I agree that it was unusual, **without statistical evidence for their reasoning**, why the show spent ""a good 1/4 of it following a guy who was a thief"".

* If the statistical evidence (which I was unable to find, maybe someone else could verify too) was there, how would you have liked it added into the show?
* Do you feel the particular demographic he was possibly representing (""no qualifications and had been arrested a few times"") was even needed in the show at all?

# ` `

&gt; Perhaps I live in a dream world though. I don't work in the business sector which appears to be where a lot of the stats used last night came from. It was 1 in 100 board room members were black I believe, something extreme like that. I bet there's not many who come from normal backgrounds, who didn't go to university or who don't have rich parents either though. 

I also would like to know more about the statistics used in the show.
The only information I could find linked was:

Thanks very much for reading and answering my questions! If you have anything further to say, I will read them and try to respond fully in kind. 
:)

By the way,

&gt; Sure I'll answer you because you haven't just insulted me or tried to be a smart arse.

The only thing I noticed about your first post on reddit, is that you didn't **preface** your ""I'm white"" comment (meaning as to why you thought it was important to state it in the context of the conversation). Only after asking you the questions did I understand more of where you are coming from with your comment.

Hope that helps and I hope something comes your way for you (career-wise)!

~ In reference **to what jobs**?  
~ What would the university you've attended, do with the vast and diverse range of jobs out there for people in your opinion?

# ` `

&gt; * Why didn't they mention literacy rates?

~ What are the literacy rates?  
~ Of whom? All black young males in the UK or the survey size of the television programme? 

# ` `

&gt; * Why didn't they mention black kids get far more spent on them than their white counterparts in the public education system? 

If you don't mind, please reference this with a source if you will.

# ` `

&gt; * Why don't they mention dropout rates of college courses for blacks?

~ What is the dropout rate?  
~ ""Dropout rates of college courses for blacks"" in compared to what in your view? 

# ` `

&gt; * Why didn't they ask a few businesses WHY it's like that? From personal experience with family, it's because very few of them can write a letter properly, are lazy, have no respect for authority and don't have relevant qualifications (which if I go back to my school days is because they're lazy as shit and don't turn up to lessons and when they do they would scream, shout and then complain that the teacher is rayciss when they failed)

~ What questions would you ask the businesses if you were in charge of that portion of the show?

~ Have you tried referencing and comparing what you have experienced to some sort of national average metric?  
How would you go about measuring ""respect for authority"" or a characteristic trait like ""lazy as shit"". Please define the metric.

true,thelawenforcer,cnty-uk,Newcastle,"the UK's biggest trade partners are within the EU. whilst that wouldn't change at first, it would start to decline as we more and more found ourselves to have different regulatory standards etc that would slowly begin to force our withdrawal from European markets. we could comply voluntarily i suppose.

politically - the UK has delusions of grandeur in terms of its current political clout of the global stage. without the greater political backing of the EU, that would decrease further (though the EU has hardly been united on foreign policy for instance - often with the UK as the outlier though).

the whole thing is a bit like 'small business vs corporate giants' - we root for the small business, we are sympathetic to it, we want it to survive and thrive, but the simple fact is that the corporate giant is able to get more done. hes also a giant cunt, but thats how economics work.

what would the UK gain - national pride. independence is a powerful feeling and could lead to renewed confidence and drive, though how long it would last im not sure.

regulatory independence - the UK will be able to insulate its markets from the EU regulatory regime, though non compliance will probably cost us alot of trade in the long run.

judicial independence - the UK will be able to make its own legal judgements and individuals will no longer be able to appeal to the ECHR etc. im not sure this is entirely a good thing, it seems that the ECHR has to a certain extent, protected some our rights from political expediency. does anyone really want to give theresa may more leeway in undermining our civil rights?

monetary independence - with the mess the euro is in, this one is quite easy to see :) the uk would be able to set its own policy - at the moment EU membership requires certain things to be set within certain ranges etc. im no expert.


** im british, but ive been brought up in a European schooling system etc (my mum worked at EU commission) so i have a quite EU friendly viewpoint. **

its important to note that in the 30 years prior to the EU's 60 year existence, we had twice gone to war with our european neighbours. since then we have seen unparalleled periods of peace and prosperity. for that humanitarian reason alone, the EU is worthwhile imo.

the trend, geopolitically speaking at least is to create larger and more standardised markets. im not convinced its possible to protect and expand these markets without an equally large and standardised political and economic power. an independent britain would have more options for protecting its interest but none of them as powerful as EU membership would have been. it does mean it can align itself with china one day, america the next and EU the week after though.

i think its rose tinted nostalgia for the past - we were prosperous back then, whats to stop us being so again? the tables have turned however, we used to be goliath, now we wish to be david. reality isnt fiction though, and we see goliath like institutions/organisations crushing 'davids' everyday in the modern world and i imagine it would be the same for an independent britain.

My only problem would be what happens to Sterling and to a lesser extent Assaidi and Downing? Would Sterling be young enough to change his game to play the free role behind the strikers? Would Downing be able to play wing back (Swapping with Enrique) for a whole season rather than the odd game?

A change in formation poses a lot of questions and 3 at the back is risky in the PL (See Man City), but maybe a bold move like this would help us reach our ambitions.

The UK and more so the rest of Europe take a greater stance on the side of the victims of discrimination weighing in human dignity. From observing this subreddit and now these comments, in that the arguably more liberal leanings have been downvoted highlight how we also adhere to this socio/cultural paradigm.

In a simialar fashion, a lot of the gun totting opinion of the US users appears almost abhorent to the UK users and anything of the sort would be downvoted to oblivion in this subreddit.

Although I too believe that the Canadian/European balancing of human dignity and freedoms is the better one, I am definitely slightly biased because of my culture.

true,ONLY_POSTS_THE_TRUTH,null,null,"I've been thinking of starting a topic about UKIP on the ukpolitics sub for weeks but I can't be arsed with the arguments.  

Basically I think that they instruct their members to campaign for them on every available website where British politics is discussed.  

For the last couple of years I've seen people promoting UKIP in the comments section of just about every news article, regardless of the newspaper or subject.  And any discussion forum such as reddit, message boards or blog comments. I mean, it's relentless.  

I don't recall ever seeing this from supporters of any other party.  Not the main three nor Respect, Greens, BNP or anyone else.  You might see someone mention that they support another party and explain why but nowhere near the kind of evangelising you see from UKIP supporters.  

Consider how much bigger the membership is of the others, particularly Labour and the Tories.  And while you might say that people have become disillusioned with those parties they still have massive support.  They still have people loyal and dedicated enough to go out knocking doors for them at every by-election.  But their supporters don't swarm to message boards and comment sections to reply to any given topic with ""this is why we should all vote for [X]"".  And outside of party politics there are anarchists, communists, socialists, fascists, libertarians, etc who don't support any party but have just as much conviction in their beliefs.  But they're not popping up beneath every article to preach to you.  

Here are the possible explanations, as I see them:  
  
1.  UKIP instruct their members to campaign for them on any website where people discuss British politics.  
  
2.  UKIP pay people to do this.  
  
3.  There is a huge overlap of people who are inclined to promote their beliefs at every available opportunity and people who are inclined to support UKIP.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The Conservative party is made up of a great number of people, the majority not wealthy, who support the party because they believe them to be the greatest advocates of economic growth, social mobility and general happiness for the wider public. They advocate low tax rates not to preserve the wealth of the rich but because they believe ( with quite a few economists backing them) that taxes on wealth and income have behavioural impacts which exceed the benefits of increases state spending.

The Conservative party is made up of three separate factions, the one nationers, the thatcher items and the libertarians ( this is a gross simplification). The one nationers are basically jus blue labour, a marginally more right wing version of new labour. The Thatcherites are economic liberals who think the lager curve (the tax rate at which higher taxes cost money) is low (around 37 percent) and so oppose taxes higher than that, as well as trusting the market to be more efficient than the state due to profit incentives. The libertarians are opposed to the state in peinciple and hate everything it does, so there aren't many of them.

The one nation crowd have achieved arguably more than any other political movement in Britiah history, except the 45 labour administration, the thatcherites revived British industry and broke down traditional barriers to social mobility through things like the sale of council houses, creating a property owning democracy.

The Conservative party is an exceptionally interesting institution which is constantly changing and evolving. I really hate it when people just straw man it as a party for the rich, because the vast, vast majority of the people who vote for it and campaign for it are only interested in the good of the nation as a whole.

I wish I were rich like them too, but that doesn't mean I want laws writing to stop them having a nicer life than I -- that way lies madness.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"Ill chime in on how I see a few differences

Gallas- Granted he never looked overly impressive this season, but we usually didn't rely on him, we were forced to call on him when injuries or other situations arose that made it necessary for him to play. I was never confident when he was on the pitch, but for a 4/5th choice center back, we could do worse.  

Walker and BAE- I think you are right that you would want Walker to be the person that could chase down a counterattack, but the problem is, Walker seems like he is the reason a few too many counterattacks are started.  He needs to mature a bit as a player (which shouldn't be difficult since he's so young as is), and realize he doesn't have to be an integral part of every attack.  BAE has just looked out of sorts the entire time he has featured.  Granted he was injured for a large portion of the season under a new manager, but I think if we have an option for a different left back, we should seriously consider trying to see if we could.

Dempsey- Well not really about Dempsey, but you note it could be just a settling season for a pretty seasoned veteran of the league, yet expect that much from new arrivals such as Holtby and Gylfi?  Not everyone will light the league on fire their first year in it or at a different club, I think this approach of thinking should apply to all our new acquisitions, with Vertonghen being the obvious exception.  

Ade-Defoe - I don't think criticizing one while praising the other is really fair, since I feel that both have been poor.  Granted Defoe has more goals, which win matches, but stats aren't everything.  Adebayor's flick to Gylfi against Chelsea?  Defoe would likely never do it.  Defoe's goal against Man City?  Ade in all likelihood wouldn't do it either.  I think it's all up to personal preference and how you see the game outside of the singular player you are watching.  I said in another thread on here I would rather we keep Adebayor of the two, but an overhaul of our forwards would be welcomed regardless.",0,1368554238,null,0,false,0,c9yof95,t3_1ebq82,t1_c9yof95,t3_1ebq82,null,1431159721,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

But not Pakistanis or Bangladeshis, but Moroccans. Same with France. Turks in Germany, and Somalians in Scandinavia.

There is a real problem with the mindset of Muslims in a lot of cases. Indeed, I saw an interview after the Rochedale grooming trial live on TV, and an Asian woman essentially said that the girls they groomed were white whores who led their communities men astray. 

By denying the race/religion element to their behaviour you are becoming part of the problem by preventing anything being done about it.

- His whole persona was too laid back, no boss wants an employee who talks in slang and is barely understandable
- Due to his English skills, I would place a good bet that his cover letters/CVs are very poor; thus into the trash it goes.

&gt; In reference to what jobs?
What would your university you've attended, do with the vast and diverse range of jobs out there for people in your opinion?


When we have ~~25% graduate unemployment, only those from the very best unis are getting any real jobs, therefore it would make sense that *if* blacks tend to gravitate to the lower unis; the jobless grad figures would reflect that very much.

To give you an example of what I mean, this is UCL's ethnicities of students (top 10 london uni):

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ras/statistics/current/T.pdf

577 black, 9819 white in a city where whites only make up under 40% of the population.

Blacks make up (quick look) around 3.6% of UCL's population.

Now, here's East London. A university only 30 minutes and ~~3 miles from UCL in London. This is the worst university on http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk, blacks make up over 60% (if we follow trends on this paper) of the pop here: 

http://www.offa.org.uk/agreements/University%20of%20East%20London%2027.11.06%20approved%2020.12.06.pdf

3.6% of UCL v over 60% in East London. Check any of the top 20, I bet you £1 that it'll be similar throughout. I purposely picked UCL as London is the UK's most ethnically diverse city, it'll be even less in places like Exeter, Warwick etc.


&gt; If you don't mind, please reference this with a source if you will.

&gt; Pupils of any Black background achieved below the national level – a gap of 5.9 percentage points 
– with 48.9 per cent of Black pupils achieving 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE or equivalent 
including English and mathematics GCSEs compared with the national level of 54.8 per cent.

&gt; What is the dropout rate?
&gt;""Dropout rates of college courses for blacks"" in compared to what in your view?

Looked everywhere for a research paper on UK dropout rates of post-16 pre-18 education and can't find anything on it. However, ask any teacher at a local college; it's a well known fact that it's more likely that black youths will drop out of their courses in comparison to 'white' youths. 


&gt; What questions would you ask the businesses if you were in charge of that portion of the show?

Give them anonymity, ask them why. Not hard.


&gt; Have you tried referencing and comparing what you have experienced to some sort of national average metric?

Look at attainment rates, absenteeism and crime. They all follow the same pattern.

&gt; How would you go about measuring ""respect for authority"" or a characteristic trait like ""lazy as shit"". Please define the metric.

Without being biased either way, you cannot quantify factors such as that. Furthermore, a study wouldn't be done on this as it would reveal many home truths that the academia of this country don't want to be revealed. However, I'd urge anybody who staunchly disagrees to speak to small-medium sized business owners (if they know any) in inner-city areas and ask how many black youths work for them; if it's few ask why, you'll get a similar answer.

&gt; It would be interesting to see what the general consensus (be it ""Reddit"" or ""the general public"") would be on your metric of your own points.

It would be, however sadly it'd be mainly cries of 'rayciss' from people who's only experience of the 'black male' demographic this Panorama show is referring to (i.e. underclass/below working class) is from Eastenders and the BBC.

But this is beside the point, for the only question that actually matters is:

Will it be possible for britain to remain a sovereign nation when economic independence is undermined by caucused QMV decisions foisted upon us via the managed consensus of the ECB/EBU?

To quote Gladstone:
“The finance of the country is intimately associated with the liberties of the country. It is a powerful leverage by which English Liberty has been gradually acquired … It lies at the root of English Liberty, and if the House of Commons can by any possibility lose the power of the control of the grants of public money, depend upon it, your very liberty will be worth very little in comparison …That power can never be wrenched out of your hands… That powerful leverage has been what is commonly known as the power of the purse – the control of the House of Commons over public expenditure – your main guarantee for purity – the root of English liberty. No violence, no tyranny, whether of experiments or of such methods as are likely to be made in this country, could ever for a moment have a chance of prevailing against the energies of that great assembly. No, if these powers of the House of Commons come to be encroached upon, it will be by tacit and insidious methods, and therefore I say that public attention should be called to this.”

Regarding caucused voting via the EBU:

“De jure incentives to take common position: This incentive is reinforced by the way the Commission’s ECB/EBA Regulations are currently drafted. For example:

• The ECB Regulation envisions the ECB acting as a coordinator of eurozone national supervisors, with the view for them to take a common position. The ECB has already dropped hints that it intends to actively discourage dissenting opinions amongst eurozone national supervisors.

• Through a eurozone caucus, some member states will indirectly boost their influence as their voting weight amongst eurozone countries is proportionally much greater than in the EU-27 (EU-28 with Croatia). This is particularly true of the larger eurozone member states.

• The safeguards proposed by the European Commission (see Section 5 below) leave the eurozone with the upper hand. Given that the 17 eurozone countries already constitute a simple majority, these countries would only need to seek the support of three ‘outs’ – whereas non-euro countries would need at least four countries.

De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.De facto incentives to take a common euro position: To avoid banks free-riding on taxpayers in creditor countries, the ECB, Germany and others could well insist on putting into place perfectly harmonised eurozone regulations before moving to financial backstops. This could include single-target capital requirements, rules on leverage or bonuses – and could even spill over to market access issues. In turn, this would heavily shape decisions at the EBA, as the eurozone is unlikely to accept an uneven playing field within EU financial services as a whole.

Taken together, the EBA structure will therefore significantly shift the balance of power in favour of the eurozone, at the expense of the UK and other ‘outs’.”

We do not have an answer to that question yet, but unless Cameron plays a blinding hand the answer is; most likely not!

A nation is either:

1. a broadly sovereign state within the EU (As Britain might hope to be by retaining sovereign powers-of-the purse in a post-convergence EU)

2. a functioning part of a larger sovereign entity as the euro-core will become (As members of the post-convergence eurozone will become)

The only other alternative is being a dependent adjunct to a larger sovereign entity. A Sanjak, in short, much as Greece was and is again today.

Becoming an EU Sanjak is neither liberal nor democratic, so propose me a solution because otherwise we will be leaving…………",0,1368555583,null,0,false,0,c9yox6w,t3_1ebfsr,t1_c9yox6w,t3_1ebfsr,null,1431159486,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your anecdotal evidence doesn't prove anything I'm afraid.  I have my own, in fact.  My cousin (who is not rich, and not from a privileged background) got her last three jobs by working for companies for free for a while as an intern.  When the internship was up, it turned out that she had been so useful that they didn't want to lose her.  These were jobs that weren't advertised, and didn't exist when the internships started -- she would therefore never have gotten those non-existent jobs... except thanks to the internships, she did.

It was your choice to work for these companies for free -- and that's as it should be -- who am I or anyone else to tell you that was a stupid decision?  Who are you to tell companies that they shouldn't ask people to work for nothing?  If both parties agree, then that is sufficient.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I'm fairly sure we can elevate ourselves above other species mainly due to the fact that we are a magnitude more intelligent and adaptable than other animals

Except that the severely disabled are not these things. So why are you elevating them? On what grounds? Intelligence? Nope. Emotional ability? Nope. Physical ability? Nope. You're being no different than a racist or a sexist here - they're ""better"" than a cow or a pig because you say they are, no other reason.

&gt;and it is unethical to kill a child if they can live with the disability.

Justify that please.

&gt;And if we did allow these children to be killed what would the line be?

Most philosophers argue the line should be significantly beyond where we actually think it should be, in order to play it safe and not end lives which we later find out should not have been ended.

&gt;physical?

Depends on your method of argument. I can come up with an argument for or against this one quite easily, both are good arguments. The ""yes"" answer to this requires that you do it at an early age and 100% ignore potentiality of capability, while the no answer pays some mind to potentiality, but only to the potentiality of an individual, rather than justifying elevation of all mankinds on potentiality of an imaginary/un-named human, which is what most people do. Almost everyone in our species commits the exact same moral mishap as racists did for centuries, we do this every day, and we're shocked at the thought that it might even be immoral to do so.

&gt;mental?

This would be the most obvious ""yes"".

The key points are:
&gt;the impact on industries such as food and textiles, where tariffs are much higher than the average, would be far from mild. British dairy exports would incur an import tax of 55% to reach the EU market, with tariffs on some items of more than 200%. Cheddar cheese would face a tariff of €167 per 100kg; the mark-up on Stilton would be €141. Average tariffs on clothing would push up their price in European markets by 12%.

&gt;Parts of Britain’s car industry would move out. British-based producers would face a 4% tariff on car-equipment sales to the EU, and there would be pressure to impose tariffs on components imported from it. Factories owned by carmakers with plants and supply chains in other parts of the EU would be most at risk. Vital car components might be held up by customs as they leave the continent. A cheap pound and a flexible workforce may not be enough to keep GM in Britain, for instance, even though it sells many cars there.

&gt;The calculation would be slightly different for other carmakers. Only a small fraction of the 300,000 cars Jaguar Land Rover makes in Britain are destined for the EU market. A lot of Minis, made in Britain by BMW, are also sold outside Europe, where they attract an import tariff anyway. Much of what distinguishes a Jaguar from a Mercedes is that it is designed and made in Britain (as are lots of components). There would be little benefit, but huge costs to the brand, in shifting production elsewhere. Japanese carmakers would suffer: most of their British output is sold in the EU, says John Leech of KPMG, a consultancy. But they cannot easily switch production to continental factories, and many of their supplies come from Japan. They would stick around longer than many think.

&gt;Over time, though, the general drift of business investment would be away from Britain and towards the continent. That goes for finance, too. If London wants to be the regional hub for trading China’s currency, it will need to retain its position as the main centre for settling trades of cash and derivatives in euros. Some in Europe resent this: the governor of France’s central bank complained this week that euro deals should be done in euroland. Without the shield of single-market rules, London could lose out to rival EU centres.

&gt;Financiers from today’s rising economic powers, in Asia and Latin America, are keener on access to a European market of 500m than on the light regulation that drew American banks to London in the 1950s and 1960s. TheCityUK, a lobby group, studied 147 siting decisions between 2006 and 2012. It found that more than two-fifths of finance firms gave access to European markets as a core reason for choosing London. Although the single market in financial services is still a work in progress, “passporting rights” entitle investment firms, banks and insurers based in Britain to establish branches or provide services throughout the EEA.

&gt;Aerospace is another industry that relies on frictionless trade with the rest of the continent. Britain has the world’s largest industry outside America, but it would lose ground to France. The high-tech bits of production, such as the making of carbon-fibre wing spars, could not speedily be replicated elsewhere. But suppliers of basic parts, such as metal brackets, would be vulnerable. Big manufacturers like Airbus prefer to keep supply chains simple. They might sponsor entry by new suppliers in the EU to avoid a customs barrier",0,1368556797,null,0,false,0,c9ypcze,t3_1ebfsr,t1_c9ypcze,t3_1ebfsr,null,1431159279,90,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,90

Just to clear it up, it's only if you're in the Euro (currency) you lack monetary independence. For example, Greece and Germany have the same interest rates, around 0.75% ATM, might've fallen actually. The point is they share the same central bank. 

But, we do have monetary independence, i.e. our interest rates and QE decisions are set by the MPC.

Whether that is a good system is a different debate.

I don't believe universal healthcare is going out the window, nor do I believe that the privatisation of services is a slippery slope towards that end (although I do have significant reservations about much of that process for other reasons, but again, that's not the question you are asking).

Whatever else is said about the NHS, we are always proud of the fact that it is free at point of use, and public opinion is a long way from swinging away from that. However, it is something that we should always be wary of, and defend whenever it is threatened*.

She provided a good without being compensated, and it was that provision that got her the job, which I would argue she made herself (good for her). However, there is a deficit here.

* Given the statistics you have linked, in your opinion, what would be the best way (if a person applied for a job) to check if a person is qualified or falls into the statistics you have mentioned?

* Should statistics like you have mentioned, apply to a job applicant?  
How many and which ones?

Based on the data [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_offences_in_the_United_Kingdom) something like 1 in 200 women (or 85,000 people) reported someone raping or attempting to rape them in 2006/7. Similarly, to quote from [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_offences_in_the_United_Kingdom):

&gt; a third of girls and 16% of boys [aged 13-18] have experienced sexual violence and that as many as 250,000 teenage girls are suffering from abuse at any one time. 12% of boys and 3% of girls reported committing sexual violence against their partners.

Based on this, it doesn't look like the ""Asian sex gangs"" are even statistically significant. Which is kind of depressing... While there are some people saying this is a racial or cultural problem with certain groups (which might be a factor if they have higher sexual offence rates), it would seem that the UK has a much broader problem with rape and sexual violence.

But most of the time the media doesn't care, because it is too common to be of interest to them.

[*Edit: As someone who has read far too many CEOP etc. reports on child exploitation particularly via the Internet (sometimes working in legal/policy areas is depressing), there are all sorts of issues with how things are classified, how surveys are carried out, reporting rates etc., so without further research into where the above numbers came from I'm not going to put too much weight onto them, but sexual offences are far more widespread than they should be, and certainly not confined to any one racial, ethnic, religious, geographical group or gender. Fixing this problem will take more than a reactionary response of attacking a single group.*]",0,1368557198,null,0,1368557726,0,c9ypi4l,t3_1ebge5,t1_c9ypi4l,t1_c9ylwok,null,1431159212,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;They are better than a cow because they are someones son or daughter not an animal whose main function in our society is dinner.

That's only by choice, not some natural law. Not counting that as a valid argument unless you can form it better.

&gt;It is unethical because they can live with the disability and it should be their choice

What if they're not capable of making choices here? I'm not talking about people with dyslexia, I'm talking about people whose brain function is very seriously impaired to the point where a cow can out-think them.

&gt;if you are paralyzed tommorow then shall we kill you?

No, for several fairly obvious reasons. Firstly, I can still think beyond the level of a cow. Secondly, termination on physical grounds only works prior to achievement of a certain level of intellectual capability. So it possibly works in babies, but not in any adult.

&gt;With your stance on mental, are you telling me that my friend with downs syndrome should have been killed despite the fact he can perfectly function in society and contribute?

I'm saying that by one school of thought he could have been morally terminated before the age of about 6 months to a year, yes. Should? No, not necessarily, that's really down to preference of those who have to bear the burden I'd say.

&gt;And finally money should never be a reason why someone lives or dies

true,http440,null,null,"I tutor a range of GCSE and A Level subjects including Maths. 

£10 an hour is about right for most of the country but a lot of big cities (London, Bristol, Oxford for example) it would be rather low. 

I charge anything from £0 to £25 an hour depending on the student and how much fun I have.

Tips: 

I'll keep this short, do not commit yourself before you have an idea of what you are getting into. 

Some kids just do not want to do the work, I’ll happy to help people learn but I’m not going to do it if I waste an hour of my time and nothing gets done. 

So I do two 45 minutes sessions for free a week apart, in the first session I ask for the work they are having issues with and we work through it. I will then drop off some work (at about the same level) and ask for them to look at it before the next session. If on session two they cannot recall anything about session one and have not touched the work I dropped off I walk away. 

Make sure the kid wants this and it is not the parents. Do not assume that just as someone says ‘I know this’ they do, I always get them to explain it back to you or show you. In GCSE maths  ensure that you have looked at [this](http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/about-dyslexia/schools-colleges-and-universities/dyscalculia.html) as a number of kids I have come across that hit problems at GCSE level have Dyscalculia.  

Have fun, if you’re not having fun (and teaching kids one on one has to be one of the most fun things I do in my life) they are not having fun and they will hate it. 

Keep in mind the objective, you may want to ask the parents what the school and the maths teachers think. As I have been doing this for some time I have a good relationship with all of the kid's teachers that I tutor. But do not be afraid of pointing out (to the parents) a poor maths teacher, I have had to do this before and it sucks but some teachers are poor. 

Do not neglect your own studies! As an A level student you should be off to University do not get sucked into giving too much time when you need to study, this is the start of the summer rush when parents start to panic about GCSEs, AS and A Levels. Don’t feel bad about saying no, if you are good and you improve the maths ability of the kid your tutoring you will find that you will be in a lot of demand.   

So in short, if kid doesn’t want to do the work walk away, make sure you have not bit off more than you can chew, have fun, get the parents to ask the school, and say no when you have to. 

Good luck, I only now do 2-3 hours a week  now but I really enjoy that time and have the opportunity now to see a kid go from a bad council estate go all the way to a top university.

When I was offered the internship, I was told that I would complete a three month placement and if all went well I would be taken on as a full time member of staff. 

Worked my arse off for three months, by which time I had actually been put in the position where I was managing a team of (also unpaid) workers.

The day before I was scheduled to complete the placement, the boss there told me he ""couldn't afford"" to pay me next month, but if I gave him a month more of my time then he would be able to give me the job. I agreed reluctantly, on the basis that I'd already invested three months of my time with the company. 

The money never came and I told them I wouldn't be coming back. A few months later a friend of mine got some work experience at another SEO firm where the boss was good enough to tell him that the whole SEO industry in this country runs on unpaid intern labour.

That's where the problem lies. I think if you're seeking ""work experience"" then unpaid positions have to be expected, you'll be working under someone who will help you to better understand the requirements of your chosen profession. But, there are far too many companies who will hire people like myself to fill positions that should be occupied by a paid member of staff.

It's a shame that discrimination was the word chosen in the rise of identity politics as a blanket pejorative. The ability to discriminate is one our most useful faculties, and one we use constantly. In every transaction (including job interviews, tenancy agreements) people discriminate. What is objectionable is discrimination on intellectually unsound grounds, race and sexual orientation being most prominent among them. 

As I said above, I think when it comes to jobs, property, and commerce it's beneficial to prohibit discrimination on such superfluous grounds. As others have said the right of a black man to make a living is more important than that of a racist employee to hire whom he chooses (though in most cases if the employer is that bothered about it he will discriminate anyway, but lie about his reasons for doing so, citing having found a better candidate elsewhere).

But outside of those cases it's ridiculous to assume you have the right not to be discriminated against. If a woman decides she only wants to date black men, that's her right. If I decide I don't want to have any gay friends, that is my right. If a group of men wish to form a boys' club and exclude women, that is also their right.

That is for the individuals involved to decide.  That is what a market is.

&gt; It's simply to save on costs, which screws everyone who can't afford to work for free over.

That's true enough.  No argument.  Well, maybe a small one: the characterisation that anyone is being screwed over.  By that logic, the poor person is screwed over because they have to buy a car on HP, whereas the rich person pays cash and gets a discount.  The poor person is screwed over because they can only afford £20 shoes that last them six months, while the rich person can buy £100 shoes that last them five years.  It's not ""screwing over"", it's simply that those are the advantages of being rich.  By the same logic, able-bodied people are ""screwing over"" disabled people because they have implicit abilities that the disabled do not have (by definition); high IQs are screwing over low IQs; people with 20/20 vision are screwing over shortsighted people.  It's not true though -- nobody is being screwed by anyone; they are just differences.  Some do indeed give an advantage, but that's life.

I don't see any way of using legislation to remove those differences; and legislation is such an enormous, imprecise sledgehammer, capable of doing damage, that I personally would prefer we didn't try to crack every nut that comes along with it.",0,1368558466,null,0,false,0,c9ypz5s,t3_1eb32b,t1_c9ypz5s,t1_c9ypg84,null,1431158990,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Watching Richard Branson run companies. Watching a politician work in their constituency. Watching a footballer at the world cup. Whatever it might be, kids aspire to do something based on role models. Kids don't know enough about the real world to just figure these things out for themselves. Role models help them identify things they are or want to be, and with some luck, achieve them.

Role models can also help change perceptions, which is an incredibly powerful tool in improving equality. Alan Sugar might be a role model because of what he's achieved coming from a poor background. A footballer might be a role model because of charity work they do alongside their job. Brian Cox is a role model because he makes science cool rather than nerdy (thus encouraging kids who might otherwise write it off as dull to take it more seriously).

Human nature being as it is, though, kids will typically tend to look to people that are 'like them'. A child from a lower-class black family is unlikely to find an Eton-educated politician to be a role model. An upper-class white child would be unlikely to find a charity worker working in a community living in poverty to be a role model. That's the challenge - giving kids appropriate role models to look up to no matter what their background. Middle/upper class white kids tend to have many role models.

So you shouldn't need to pay tax or National Insurance. National Insurance is based weekly so you might fall in to that one week, and not on others.

You may be able to downgrade your mobile phone package. I'm sure on o2, you used to be allowed to go down a single tariff grade, so it might be worth a try. Google is your friend for that one.

Packed lunches are also your friend. They are usually much cheaper than food at work. Cold pasta, salads, rice-based dishes I find work out better than sandwiches. Is more of a personal thing.

If you can consider putting some money aside in to a credit union for a few months, they will then consider lending to you - this can be useful for things like paying monthly on the car insurance, i.e. instead of using the insurance's (usually dreadfully expensive) monthly payment plan, you could borrow from the credit union at a more preferential rate. Needless to say, always compare the options. Debts are only an option if you know you can pay it back. You don't want to make a situation worse! Paying in a lump sum is often cheapest.

I would personally get rid of the car though, the running costs are extortionate compared to the usefulness for you, as I see it, currently. Walking isn't only cheaper, it's (arguably) healthier. I would personally walk up to half an hour to get to work, I find by the time you wait for the bus, the traffic, stops etc., it works out that I only lose about 15 minutes on average, in London.

true,[deleted],null,null,"[""Trashh"" who was meant to join the team has posted a statement](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=412743)

&gt;Hi there, I am Adam ""Trashh"" Johansson and I were supposed to be one of the new members of Quantics new Dota2 squad. I want to start this of by apologizing to Quantic and I hope that this post will make things right for Quantic and their reputation. 

&gt;DannyD contacted all of us individually and said that he were making a team with good players and he got some sponsor interested. When we were all gathered and played a few games together he said he was talking to Quantic and he said that they were interested. 

&gt;The roster that we knew was:
DannyD
ArchiTiger
Rikku
CarDinal
Trashh

&gt;But DannyD mentioned that Kebap was going to play some with us and he said that he will be doing so when he finished his finals.

&gt;He also mentioned to me personally that Kebap was getting a contract with us and that he will be our 6th player. At this point I told him that Kebap should not be mentioned or signed with us because we have not played with him or spoken to him. 

&gt;Everything seemed fine until the day of the revealing arrived upon us. Kebap was mentioned as an official player in our team and the team was really confused. 

&gt;This thread were made: http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=412722 and it started to come clear to us what Danny have done. Quantic sat down and looked through the contracts and came up with this picture: http://gyazo.com/ff6483550dfd8fc0ead2bd9c9155d77a 

&gt;It was all clear to us now. Danny faked Kebaps contract, Kebap was never involved.

&gt;Statement from Fujikura: 
Danny D^ stole the identity of Kebap and forged the contract as can be seen Here I would like to apologize to Kebap and the dota2 community for not verifying completely in the first place. The other members of the roster had no knowledge that Danny had done this. Cardinal was in fact part of the team, although I believe the team will not stay together after what Danny has done. We have no choice but to void all contracts signed and release the entire roster. Once again we do apologize, myself especially since I was the one at fault for not taking proper steps.

&gt;Me personally want to apologies to Quantic, they are an awesome organization and everything they did for us was more than I could ask for. I don´t think that Quantic did anything wrong and should not take any blame.

&gt;I also want to apologies to Kebap and everyone else who read the news.

&gt;If anything is unclear you can add me on steam: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016963812/

&gt;I also want to add that the remaining players will not stay with Quantic.

&gt;Thanks for taking your time reading.

true,multijoy,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;Provided both parties act of their own free will, it is impossible for a market to be ""skewed"" -- their actions represent the will of the market. Since the market is nothing more than the sum total of all individual actions. There is no morality or ethics to a market, it is completely neutral

This implies both parties are negotiating from a position of equal strength. If this was the case for employment contracts, we wouldn't need any regulation at all - but that is, clearly, not the case. 

The employer/intern relationship is, by its very essence, exploitative. A company is saying that it values the skills of that intern at less than the minimum it would have to pay an employee to carry out the same role. Said intern has no ability to negotiate; they can simply take it or leave it, a Hobson's choice. 

The only reason that internships exist in the mainstream is because industry has cottoned onto the fact that they can side-step the awkward 'pay someone a wage to do an entry level job' by simply giving people the opportunity to do it for free. 

&gt;Says you. What business is it of yours what a company judges to be what they can afford?

It's the business of government when they decided that the minimum value of labour was £6.15 p/h. 

&gt;Why? You seem to have a copy of some absolute morality rulebook that tells you what is right and wrong. Why is your rule book any more correct than those offering and those accepting the positions?

Call me some crazy leninist, but the fundamental principle ought to be a ""fair day's pay for a fair day's work"". This principle is undermined when people feel that they need to offer their services for free in order to make their way in this world, and the law is quite clear in that respect - if you employ someone, then you're obligated to pay them. 

If you want to take someone on for their own good, you can use the statutory frameworks to pay them less in order to compensate for the work you're putting in to train them. The fact that someone might be prepared to do it for free is immaterial. Again, the law is quite clear in that respect.

When the wealthy use their privilege to hold others down and get things the way they want then you don't have a free society. We already ""allow"" and ""disallow"" all sorts to reduce inequality and unfairness in society. Minimum wage and employment rights are there to reduce exploitation by not allowing employers to fire people unfairly or pay peanuts. Anti-discrimination laws don't allow people to select based on gender, race, etc. Why should we ""allow"" the kind of selection that will disadvantage the already disadvantaged?

&gt; Do you feel the same when Tesco offers bread at under-market price as a loss-leader? They are only able to do that because they are so privileged after all. When Toyota offer to pay you a year's insurance if you buy their new car? When Microsoft give discounted copies of their operating system to schools? When Apple offer half price laptops to students?

Terrible argument. Offering your services to someone for free in a market where people have a selection to choose from in the hope they favour your business later is not the same as insisting people give you their services for free in a market with limited options (when everyone is doing it) on the vague, non-binding promise of paid employment later.",0,1368561706,null,0,false,0,c9yr7lg,t3_1eb32b,t1_c9yr7lg,t1_c9yq9qi,null,1431158407,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Ok so you've sorted out a visa - that's good. I shouldn't think the degree will matter too much but you'll need to make sure your CV supports (in as much detail as possible) your experience working as a developer. 3 years is a good level of experience but your CV needs to convey that you can indeed deliver. Go into detail of the projects you worked on, what you used and how it was applied. That should help.

Regarding your second question; LinkedIn is catching on here in the UK but it's probably not at the same level of use as you imply in the US. You have a number of options there that you've already established and covering all of them will maximise your chances! 

* Update your details on LinkedIn - be sure to update your location details and consider joining relevant groups and putting up a post describing who you are and what you're looking for. Someone might spot it - you never know. 

* Get your CV up on the popular UK job boards. Jobsite, CWJobs, Monster, CV Library - they're all popular. There are probably others I've missed there as well. 

* Do some research into local companies that you'd like to work with. It does depend where you're moving to, though? Applying directly is not something I have any experience in so I'm not sure of the success rate on this. Some people have sworn by it... 

I'd start looking *when you arrive* but formulate how you'll do it and start as soon as you do get to wherever you're moving. The reason for this is that it'll show anyone to speak to that you're very much settled in the UK. It may sound silly but if anyone hears ""I'm planning to move to London in the next month"" - they'll worry it might fall through. If you're already in London - that problem goes away.

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"&gt;Whatever else is said about the NHS, we are always proud of the fact that it is free at point of use, and public opinion is a long way from swinging away from that.

I disagree. I think that public opinion is definitely swinging the other way.

For example, we've all seen newspaper articles where someone suggests that drunk people / fat people / smokers, etc, should be made to pay for healthcare costs because ""It's their own fault"".  A worrying number of people regularly say that they agree with the idea.  It has growing public support.

Once we start to introduce charges for people who have 'caused their own illness', then we'll go down the road of charging people who earn over a certain amount of money.  ""Why should someone earning x amount per year get free healthcare that's being paid for out of my taxes?"", the argument will go.

We will see 'free at the point of need' gradually eroded. And the tragedy is, we'll have done it to ourselves because we're becoming a mean-spirited, selfish, compassion-free nation of bastards.

I can't speak for all employers of course, they differ. Many of the ones we work with are not hung up on academics past a certain point - provided you can demonstrate you have the technical skill to fulfill the role. If you had a poor degree *and* poor A-Levels and no experience then it would be a different story of course. 

It *could* be that you lack of completed A-Levels is being held against you as an issue with commitment? Without seeing your CV however - I wouldn't like to make any assumptions. 

Some companies sadly are very set in their ways - if you have less than a 2:1 and 3 A or B grade A-Levels then they won't want to know. I *think* these tend to be the larger companies though - that can afford to pick and choose their intake because they have that prestige.

The size of the pool was pitiful, length is ok (25m I think), but the width was only enough for 4 narrow lanes. Worse than that the pool isn't built as well as modern pools, the deep end had no real way to hang on (no ledges and the lip of the pool was too high to hang onto), the stairs were kinda awkward, the tile grouting would scratch you if you kicked against the side wall (easy to do in a narrow lane).

Facilities were small and cramped, showers were open to the pool (so no washing under your suit properly) (mind you maybe I've had my expectations altered by health club showers). Even forgetting showers the place was cramped. Expansion is often difficult as the old places are in built up areas, commonly with conservation status. The chances of getting planning to knock things about, and worse than that, council funding, is low.

Finally money. The small pool cost me equal or more than a big pool would have (going by the closest competitors) and it didn't live up to it. New pools are more efficient, easier to maintain, and give a nicer swim.

It can be difficult but not impossible to change your career path - IT support and Cisco networking are not always entirely separate but it's a case of constantly searching job boards and companies to see if they have any roles that might fit.

That being said, senior Cisco engineers can make a very healthy wage - so it's worth plugging away at it. 

Another option - and it does depend on where you are etc. - is to see if there's any freelance / charity type work you could do, just to get the experience?

Living in Newcastle, if I were unemployed (or underemployed) and unable to find work in the city in a higher than retail or service industry job, I would look further afield to London, Manchester ect. However, I go to look and I see that nearly every entry level post is an unpaid internship with the 'possibility' of a permanent paid role. 

Now, I have no family in London to live with. I also have no substantial savings, I could support myself for a while but London is an expensive place to live. I can't work another job in retail or such, as these posts are full time and a part time job isn't going to be reasonable, because in order to get a ever more common zero hour contract in this economic climate, you must be fully flexible. So, I'm stuck being underemployed and it becomes more difficult to break out as people stave off retirement because of the financial crisis, while there are also older individuals with far more experience searching for the same positions. 

All you have to do, is make firms pay in accordance with what they offer, human capital should not be available freely because the economy is in bad shape. I don't believe in absolute equality of outcomes because it's absolutely ridiculous. 

I'm currently at university studying, with a 24 hour contract in one of the best paid retail positions you can get up here, as well as working casually for a paid charity position with disabled kids. I'm 21, I've not had a day out of employment since a month after my 16th birthday and I've 2 years working with charities alongside paid service and retail work and occassional summer roles with Local MP's (2 stints working in different parliamentary offices) and an upcoming work placement in my field. 

And after all this, shockingly, I won't have the savings to support myself living in London for 6 months paying rent, bills and for food, all the while working for a company with no promise of a permanent contract. Seems all a little unfair to me, I'm not asking to be paid 30k for an entry position, but I am saying I should be paid a fair wage to survive on while I work my way up in the world. 

Oh, and your cousin didn't screw over people from broken homes, she just completely burdened her parents when she should have been able to pay her way. But I suppose it's a parents duty to pay for their twenty-something childs life while a business gets all their work done for them.

Similarly I've never had anyone purposefully move to cut me off while filtering. If anything people seem happy to move over a bit to let me through. Don't count on this, ever. If someone does cut you off you'll just have to wait and try to slip back in behind them. Don't be afraid to bully your way into a small gap. People might not like it and it might not be the safest thing to do, but it's better than being stuck in between two moving lanes.
With that in mind, don't bother filtering if you think the traffic is about to move/lights are about to change etc. The front of the queue is the best place to be when lights change, because there's plenty of space in front of you to zoom into, as opposed to wobbling about trying to get into a lane. You're not meant to overtake the lead car but I've never understood this. I always try to be slightly in front of everything so I can get out of the traffic quicker.

General tips: all the safety stuff you're meant to do seriously applies when filtering. Size up the gap as far as you can see it before you try getting through. Look at wheel directions, indicators, drivers' heads, everything that can give you a clue as to their intentions. Go as slow as you can without wobbling, and keep it in first gear. Your noisy motorbike is your friend in this situation. Don't be afraid to rev or beep to make your presence known if someone looks like they might move. Don't flash your lights, people will think you're letting them out. Keep a foot over the brake ready. Look out for potholes etc. Paint lines are thicker than they look and slippery when wet. If your visor is prone to being foggy, open it a crack asap so you can see. 

If I were you I'd try and practice on stretches of road that you're familiar with and tend to be pretty stable. A nice bit of dual carriageway or even a congested motorway is probably ideal. Don't commit to anything unless you're sure you can handle it.

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert or a veteran biker. If something I've said sounds unwise to you, don't do it. The last thing we need is for the EU to outlaw filtering. Do it proper or not at all.

true,ginglymus,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridge,"You raise an interesting point with respect to the fat, drunk and smoking people.

I think the NHS will *always* remain free at point of use. However, certain products which cause increased burden on the NHS are currently taxed (in the case of alcohol and smoking, though not yet on fatty and high sugar foods) to reflect this.

Whilst this does cause an increased financial burden on users of said products, free healthcare is still available, and the taxes help fund services which help you stop using these products.

The most important thing about the NHS is that healthcare is free at point of use to everyone. How the financial burden is shared amongst the people of the United Kingdom is a secondary concern, and should obviously primarily be from each according to his ability.

How it should be shared out beyond this gets a bit nuanced. It is important to highlight that it is the product that is being taxed, not the activity. In the case of smoking, this is a little hard to see, but in the case of alcohol is more obvious.

I do not drink to excess, yet I pay the same rate of tax on my alcohol as the people buying 2l of cheap cider to get shit-faced on a Friday night and end up in A&amp;E. Thus, the burden of binge drinking on the NHS as supported by tax on alcohol sales is shared amongst all who drink (who cause no increased burden), not just those causing or potentially causing the problems (who do).

The alternative to targeting the products causing increased burden is to raise taxes for everyone elsewhere, which is arguably less fair.",0,1368563710,null,0,false,0,c9yrzap,t3_1ebvdu,t1_c9yrzap,t1_c9yr9lq,null,1431157974,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

The question is though, is that a cultural outcome or a social issue? Purely from being friends with a few Muslims in our year group, many were second gen immigrants, which would mean that many of their parents and family for various reasons (qualifications being one) would be far less likely to be in the teaching profession. It's also worth noting that many have self-employed parents (it's anecdotal evidence, but at the same time I can't say was for other schools). It wouldn't really be until about now that many would be qualifying. 

On top of that, Swansea isn't really that diverse outside of the Muslim population and students who are not permanent residents.

* Recruitment *is* a cut throat market. We provide a useful service when we're useful - we're a pest when we're not. That goes for job seekers AND companies. If we don't deliver a candidate *first* to our client and they get the job - it won't matter if we've worked with that client for 20 years - we'll get no money from them. At the end of the day, we're in business like anyone else. 

* That doesn't make bad practice OK though. 

&gt; No feedback, no further contact with agency. I try phoning and they're on the other line etc.

* If you've been to an interview and an agency doesn't contact you it could be one of two things. 1) you weren't successful and they didn't have the grace to tell you. 2) they haven't had any feedback from the company you interviewed with...

* ...Number 1 is poor form. Number 2 does happen - we've had poor clients in the past who've not provided feedback for a *month* after someone interviewed and unsurprisingly that person went elsewhere to find work. We do what we can with this... but I'd point out that's not always down to the recruiting agencies - employers can drop the ball as well. Unfortunately as the 'in between' party - we get the flak for this (despite our best efforts to get feedback). We try and minimize that - but it can happen.

&gt; Some agencies contact me, take my details and... disappear never to be heard from again. 

* I can only assume that's what is known as a 'fishing trip'. *We* don't do them but I know agencies that do. It's a fact finding mission in case your details might be useful some day in the future. Again - the dark side of recruitment. 

&gt; One email I received asked me to contact somebody to discuss career 'for free'...

* I had an email with that kind of context just last week. A bit of quick research revealed it was a spam company and a waste of time. I wouldn't even class that kind of thing as recruitment. I do not know *any* recruitment companies that charge candidates for their use. We take our money from successful placement of a person in a job. 

&gt; ...asked me to be exclusive with his agency...

* This one is easy. Depending on your preference - walk away or say 'yes' then do what you like anyway. A verbal agreement to work exclusively with this person is worth nothing and based on no contract. So take advantage of them or ignore them. *All* it is to a recruiter is a useful selling point for a candidate - our clients would love for us to have candidates that absolutely nobody else has available. It's rubbish. 

* The same goes for references. Don't bother. This is a fishing exercise to get the details of managers working at companies... *so that the recruiter can call the companies and find out if they're hiring for anyone at the moment*. References upon accepting an offer of employment... that's the rule. 

&gt; Then there's LinkedIn.

LinkedIn is a funny one. We do genuinely like building relationships with our candidates. Some candidates go on to become clients - we've had it happen many times in the past. LinkedIn is a convenient way of keeping in touch without irritating emails or phone calls out of the blue. You can see if we're recruiting for a job you might be interested in - if you go on to hire people of your own into a business - we can find out if we can help there. 

The dynamic of the social network hasn't resolved itself yet though. Some people love to Link In and will suggest it themselves - others aren't interested. I find it best to ask during a phone call and go with whatever seems best to you. 

I hope all this helps to shed some light - and do apologize on behalf of the bad ones! ",0,1368563865,null,0,false,0,c9ys1f9,t3_1e6fey,t1_c9ys1f9,t1_c9xs1cp,null,1431157946,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

&gt; a third of girls and 16% of boys [aged 13-18] have experienced sexual violence and that as many as 250,000 teenage girls are suffering from abuse at any one time. 12% of boys and 3% of girls reported committing sexual violence against their partners.

Assuming those figures are remotely accurate, that's not a racial problem, it's a massive problem with the way a huge chunk of our country handles sexuality.

-----
*Edit now I have a bit more time, more thoughts in the linked post.*

I didn't mean to suggest (if I did) that there definitely isn't a race issue here, and that the authorities are in denial about it (although it may be that the Deputy Children's Commissioner knows more than the average redditor about these specific cases), but to focus on the racial (or ethnic, mini-cultural, geographic etc.) aspect is to lose sight of the context.

These men were convicted of abusing 6 girls over an eight-year period. Now look back up at those figures (with all the various disclaimers about their reliability) - this case is statistically insignificant. It hits the mainstream media, because it is an extreme case, but there would seem to be a huge amount of child abuse going on and I will hesitantly suggest that it isn't all racial.

There would seem to be a major problem with children ""abuse"" (whether ""voluntary"", pseudo-voluntary or not) in this country, and I'm not sure it is confined to any specific racial subset of the population. And while it would be great if no Pakistani Muslims had racial issues (not that the ones I know seem to), even if we deported every one of them tomorrow we would still have a major problem. Dealing with the idea of ""it being Ok to have sex with young people, violently and/or abusively"" (whether boys or girls) is more important.

At least, going on that data.

The underlying cause of this increase in abuse (if it is one) and how best to prevent it (or render it harmless) is a huge mess that no one really seems to understand (although some blame the Internet, others immigrants, others 60s pop stars...).

------------------
*Further edit; reading through CEOP's [2012 Threat Assessment Report](http://ceop.police.uk/Documents/ceopdocs/CEOPThreatA_2012_190612_web.pdf)*

&gt; In comparison to [the NSPCC's] earlier study in 2000, the findings suggest a decline in serious forms of contact sexual abuse

Nice to know.

&gt; empirical evidence shows that approximately 80% of sexual offences against children are committed within the family or by persons known to the child or children, often in positions of trust. Similarly, approximately 80% of sexual offences against children occur in the home of either the offender or the victim. 

So while ""off-the-street"" grooming etc. by gangs may be newsworthy, most child abuse happens within families etc., behind closed doors.

On the disproportionate number of ""localised grooming"" gangs who are of particular racial/ethnic backgrounds, [the report](http://ceop.police.uk/Documents/ceopdocs/ceop_thematic_assessment_executive_summary.pdf) which is often (selectively) quoted also says this:

&gt; this assessment cannot be seen as fully representative of the nature and scale of child sexual exploitation in the U.K., or, indeed, of the ‘localised grooming’ model. Data relating to child sexual exploitation is often partial and incomplete, concealed in secondary indicator data, or simply unrecorded. 

They admit that their data is limited; nearly half of the individuals who were reported to them then had to be ignored due to there being no data on them.

&gt; Caution should be taken in drawing conclusions about ethnicity due to the relatively small number of areas where agencies have been proactive around this particular type of crime. We do not draw national conclusions about ethnicity from the data available at this time because it is too inconsistent. 

Which is, of course, what a huge number of people have done... The other thing missing from the often-quoted data is the ""unknown"" category:

&gt; for groups one and two combined, the ethnicity of 38% of the offenders was unknown, 30% were white, 28% Asian, 3% Black and 0.16% Chinese.

Other ""interesting"" data: 

&gt; the vast majority are men, with 87% males, 4% females, and 9% unknown. ... the offenders are disproportionately skewed towards young adults within the 18-24 age range, with almost half of the offenders being under 25 where their age is known.

So if we're going to single out a particular religion, race or ethnicity, we might be better off singling out men, or men between 18-24.

Basically Vegas doesn't care if you're wrong or right, all they want is for equal betting on both sides.  The line is set in a place where they believe it will encourage equal betting on both sides.  The money is made on the ""vig"" or the money that Vegas pockets based on payouts.  For instance, this bet pays -125, meaning you have to bet 125 to win 100.  My guess would be that taking the opposite bet (Arsenal -1.5) would pay something around +110 (bet of 100 pays 110).  Realistically Wigan +1.5 has a much greater chance of happening than Arsenal -1.5 so they use the +/- to offset the disparity in betting (Based on their math they can't set a line that will get 50/50).  The disparity in these payouts is where the money is made, not on people making bad and/or good bets.  If 55% of the people who bet on this game took Wigan, they make money no matter what the outcome is.

Because they contain unknown potential.

Yet for the first few months of her life, it was impossible to say if she'd ever be able to voluntarily move a muscle.

You just don't know what the future holds for these kids.

The Doctor receives an ancient and diabolical artifact that once belonged to his old rival the Master, and sets out on a journey across time and space to destroy it at the one place it can be unmade: the original Eye of Harmony, where it was created. 

Includes: 

* Five hours of footage of the TARDIS spinning past scenic mountains, rivers, nebulae, temporal nexuses.
* An all-new travelling companion, computer generated from Andy Serkis's motion capture. (NOTE: I do not mean that the companion is an effect realized in CGI, rather that the companion is an actual being made of Andy-Serkis-motion-captured CGI)
* The return of the Doctor's granddaughter, played by a third-tier American actress and given an in-depth love story, a sonic bow and arrow, and a couple of action scenes.
* Ian Holm as the Second Doctor. 
* Ian McKellan as the First Doctor.
* Christopher Lee and Benedict Cumberbatch as the Master (with beard in both regenerations).
* Blu-Ray Extended Edition Re-releases, with over eighteen hours of the TARDIS crew trekking over mountains.  
* Lots and lots of forced perspective tricks.

The argument from potential is a common one, the church uses it to argue against abortion.

You should probably argue against abortion too, if you believe in it.

The problem with the argument is this:

1) The argument goes that we should accord the normal rights and privileges of a human adult to all humans because all humans have potential.

The counter argument is that:

2) This would be inconsistent with how we accord rights in every other circumstance.

Children have the potential to be adults, that doesn't mean they can drive.

I have the potential to be prime minister, that doesn't mean I can do it now.

Your average man on the street has the potential to be a rapist, that doesn't mean we stick him in jail in case he one day would have become one.

We don't give people rights based on their potential, we give rights based on what that person is at the point in time.

&gt;A baby born a month preterm via emergency c-section, with serious cranial ischaemia due to hypoxic insult can grow up to do well in her GCSE maths, have a full social life, contribute to local community groups, advise hospital trusts on policy and listen to abominable pop music at a volume that annoys her father. Yet for the first few months of her life, it was impossible to say if she'd ever be able to voluntarily move a muscle.

Right, and I'm not suggesting that we in any way *must* euthanise sick infants, or that we *should* even, just that it's morally permissible.

&gt;You just don't know what the future holds for these kids.

In some cases this is true. Now there are cases where we're absolutely certain that the future holds nothing but pain and an early death, in many of these cases the UK healthcare system already lets the child die (in a somewhat horrible way, frankly, but since euthanasia is illegal, we *let them die* instead of killing them).

As I said a few posts up I think, you draw the line considerably beyond where you think it really should be, essentially you play it very, very safe. There are cases though where, for instance, a baby is born with essential no neo-cortex. Now we know that that child is never going to talk, communicate, or even think in any way that even low level mammals do. I'm not going to argue the in-between cases because I don't need to, I've made it quite clear that one should take a ""play it on the safe side"" approach, but in the clear cut cases it's perfectly permissible to euthanise if we're going to be consistent about our value system.

&gt;Sorry for the dense text, but you did ask.

No no, I actually welcome your example because it highlights an important point which I think some are missing - I'm not saying we should euthanise any baby which isn't ""perfect"" - I'm saying that if we're morally consistent then it's permissible to euthanise humans in cases where they're demonstrably less intellectually capable than any kind of animal we're perfectly happy to kill. Some extend this to infants, some try to find workarounds on an individualist basis, but mostly I've just been trying to highlight the taboo about taking human life which exists essentially due to species discrimination, rather than any rational or logical belief system.

Having been a Torres doubter, I now actually really like him and his attitude. Ever since he got lamped in face (and quite frankly if that's all it took, at that point I would have been lining up to 'help him' too) I think his hold-up play and crossing have been first class and I wasn't surprised when he started ahead of Demba Ba against Tottenham.

* This is our manager's first season in charge with a team that's not essentially one that he's built.

* If we win our final game, we'd break our record of most points in a season.
* We lost Modric, Van der Vaart and King this season. We then lost Kaboul and Sandro to injuries for the remainder of the season. Let that sink in.
* Our manager had to deal with having 2 strikers in our whole squad, sometimes even 1, in our fight for top 4.

Even when you consider all of these things, there is **still** a chance we can finish 4th. But no matter what, this season has seen us improve under a fresh new manager.

BBC N. Ireland are showing live coverage of the Northwest 200 [0][1]. For a motorcycle enthusiasts this is an absolute gem in the BBC schedule that they seem to insist on hiding away. (Schedule below)
 
Outside of Norn Iron the best place to catch it is the BBC website - free to view from the UK.  

If you've never heard of the NorthWest 200, it's basically seen as the 2nd biggest road race of the season - just behind the Isle of Man TT. It's traditionally ran a week before TT practice week. All the big names get themselves over to it - not least as a dry run for the TT. The classes etc are largely similar to the TT format and all the big riders tend to do both. The main differences are : 

a) the NW200 is ran on a smaller circuit, so laps are shorter therefore its possible to know every corner - so whats coming next - and the camera follows the leader for the whole race.

b) Its ""mass start"" - i.e. all the riders together, the person at the front of the pack is the race leader. (*ordinarily* - for safety there is actually groups of 20 set off together and each ""wave"" is ten second apart. It is possible to be in the 2nd wave and win on adjusted time but it is rare) 


In short it's a lot easier to follow for the uninitiated and just as compelling to watch. 

Wanna know what your 1000cc road bike can really do with a top rider on the street, on treaded tires ? Watch the superstock

As I've said I appreciate this isn't a racing-subreddit but I thought it was worth a shout as I feel a lot more people would like to watch it if they only knew about it. You know what the BBC are like - use it or loose it

If we're expecting certain types of benefit claimants to contribute towards council tax bills? What's not to suggest a percentage contribution towards prescriptions? Dental costs? Or the reduction in value of optical vouchers?

Each item on a prescription costs £7.85.

Child abuse seems to be massively under-reported everywhere (just look at all the recent pop-star etc. cases). Rapes and more broadly sexual offences are massively under-reported, and rarely lead to convictions. Given this, I'm not sure we can draw any solid conclusions.

On them having a particular monopoly over one kind of abuse... that's like saying one particular group may have a monopoly over murders using a particular weapon... it's still murder, this is still abuse.

From another [CEOP Study](http://ceop.police.uk/Documents/ceopdocs/CEOPThreatA_2012_190612_web.pdf);

&gt; approximately 80% of sexual offences against children are committed within the family or by persons known to the child or children, often in positions of trust. Similarly, approximately 80% of sexual offences against children occur in the home of either the offender or the victim

So while ""localised grooming"" by may be newsworthy, most child abuse isn't racial like this, and is happening behind closed doors, inside families etc.

Mebbe you're sort of answering your own question when you mention drawing the line a bit further back than it could acceptably be drawn. That's why we don't have the default of killing/letting die disabled babies, to give a margin for error, based largely (to my way of thinking) upon the possibilities that the bairn might rally to some extent. 

&gt;mostly I've just been trying to highlight the taboo about taking human life which exists essentially due to species discrimination, rather than any rational or logical belief system

We are an annoyingly discriminatory species. I think a human's general taboo against homicide is partly in response to fear that people will try and kill them. Which makes disabled babies a good example to twist your head around, as the baby is not a threat, and is unlikely to be in a position to stop anyone from killing them, so I guess that might imply that a taboo against killing such bairns is from fear of parental response.

I'm obviously more than a little biased in my thinking, but I equally obviously think about the subject to some depth, especially when I see elected officials making outrageous gaffes in the media.

To further your thoughts, might I suggest you ponder the impact that availability of resources has on the matter. In situations where resources are limited, e.g. drought/famine or harsh climate whatever, the line would shift somewhere other than where it is in our society at present.

In ref to species discrimination, get this one: When I was an undergrad studying pharmacology, it was considered strange of me to refuse to use tissue from animals killed specifically for training me, (e.g. if a rat lung was spare from someone else's I'd use that, but not on from a rat killed especially for me) but when I asked if I could use freely donated fresh human placenta to take measurements of receptor densities for my final year project, I was told it wasn't ethical. Mind you, they didn't like me trying to reanimate guinea pig ileum with 9V batteries either, but it was apparently fine to do so with frog leg muscle.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;To further your thoughts, might I suggest you ponder the impact that availability of resources has on the matter. In situations where resources are limited, e.g. drought/famine or harsh climate whatever, the line would shift somewhere other than where it is in our society at present.

This I disagree with, but I'm not a utilitarian in my morals (or at least, I do my best not to be) - so I don't believe that practical situations should impact upon morality, nor should issues of prediction impact upon it.

Now of course from a practical perspective a sick baby will be left to die in a tribal community which is on the edge of extinction, but humans do lots of immoral things to survive. Despite my desire to, I can't make any moral argument for the consumption of sentient animals, yet without hunting humans probably would have never made it as a species.

Nature is not moral.

&gt;I was told it wasn't ethical.

Don't get me started on ethics committees man, I'm a (student) chemist, but far enough advanced that I do research and currently I'm sitting in the whole natural products area so that's essentially the very early stages of drug development. Fuck me ethics committees are nuts! Sure, use a crab, crabs are fine, but you want to use a tiny fish to test some hypothesis? Oh no no! That can't happen because vertebrates are automatically more ethically complicated than invertebrates.

The 2 years of ethics I studied while doing philosophy at uni were considerably more enjoyable, interesting, enlightening, and most of all *rational* than any scientific ethics committee I've *ever* heard of or encountered has ever been.

If you were arguing Patriarchy then you'd have some grounds for argument, because as an ontological concept Patriarchy has some very important thoughts about power and masculinity that are very poignant but he irony of such enlightened feminists like yourselves is that you'd probably think feminism itself is too ""PC and left wing"".

I do agree we need our own identity especially as the 'noisy neighbour' routine we've been playing won't be for much longer.

In terms of the transfer market, once again time will tell what AVB is like. If he had anything to do with Dembélé, Vertonghen and Lloris then it's cause for optimism.

Tactically the managers seem (on the surface at least) quite similar. Look at the derby at the Lane and the similarity of all the goals from both teams.

true,SirMothy,num2,,"AVB: beginning of the season it seemed like he didn’t know our players that well, and started questionable players like Gallas for instance, when Dawson and Caulker were clearly better options, which led to some poor results against West Brom, Newcastle, and Chelsea. However, since then he has been immense, getting the most out of almost every player, jumping around like a mad man, passing out notes, etc. Haven’t really disagreed with much he’s done recently, hopefully he sticks around for years to come.

Lloris: Fantastic, so fast and basically acts as another defender, one of the best keepers in the world IMO, no idea how we even got him. He kicks too many balls out of bounds at times but besides that he is goddamn brilliant.

Vertonghen: One of my favorite players in the squad, a solid defender and a true footballer, never scared to go forward and attack. He’s made a few mistakes but he is all around great player, brilliant signing.

Gallas: So prone to mistakes, shadow of what he was. If he stays at Tottenham he should be our absolute last resort if everyone else is hurt. Should probably retire.
Naughton: Not particularly flashy, but decent cover for right or left back.

Dawson: Glad we didn’t sell him. He’s back on his form which got him into the WC2010 squad.

 Walker: Made some pretty big mistakes this season, but its part of the process. His strength and speed make him a definite asset. 

Assou Ekotto: Nothing particularly spectacular but a pretty good left back.

Caulker: Has looked pretty good this season, definitely a CB of the future for us.

Huddlestone: I’ve always liked Huddlestone and am glad recently he’s been getting a look in for us again.
 
Lennon: Before this season I was a severe Lennon hater, thought he was a one trick pony who didn’t score any goals. This season I realized just how valuable he is, cutting defenders up and working the ball into the box and scoring a big goal every now and then. This has been his best ever season IMO, should be starting for England.

Parker: Parker is a warrior in the midfield with the tackling and effort, such a hard worker. Not particularly good at much on the offensive end of the ball.

Bale: My favorite player, astounding, people said he
 was overrated the past few seasons, overhyped after his match against Inter. Everyone wants him now. Those people are eating their words. He’s scored in all different ways this season, so many match winners, so classy, one of the best players I’ve ever watched, hope he sticks around.

Dembele: What a tremendous signing, extremely dynamic midfield player who takes players on and plays cutting passes through defenses. My second favorite player on the team.

Sigurdsson: Love him, should start a lot more in my opinion. Saw him on Spurs US tour live, tearing defenders to pieces and scoring goals. This guy has so much talent. Worried he wouldn’t get a look in for a while but thankfully he is working his way into the team with some big goals.

Holtby: Not been very impressive, at times invisible, but he just got here and is young so he has a huge upside.

Livermore: Never been a fan, but wouldn’t get rid of him or anything.

Dempsey: As an American I didn’t know what to expect. He isn’t the best footballer, but he is a gritty player who gets himself in positions to score big goals. People talk too much shit on him on here and I hope he sticks around, he is a valuable player to have on the team. 

Adebayor: Frustratingly inconsistent. Had a lot of bad moments this season, also a few good ones. I like his style of play and I guess he’s our best striker but that’s not saying much.

Defoe: The thing about Defoe is that, time and time again, he proves he can score basically out of nowhere. He’s scored some epic fucking goals in his time with us. He is frustrating with his lack of passing sometimes, but he is a great option to have off the bench for late game situations if we get another striker.

I've noticed you're getting quite a high proportion of downvotes for your comment. I'm a current Cambridge student and I think you're completely right. I have never come into contact with anyone here who I think would discriminate against someone on the basis of race. Sure, this place has its traditions. People like to maintain them - it's fun to be part of history. They're not an attempt at pretentiousness. However it's progressive and academic too. Racism, sexism etc. are abhorred by the vast majority of students and staff.

The reason for low admissions of black students is almost certainly the fault of society itself. Statistically they tend to be from poorer backgrounds, and unfortunately that means they are forced into worse schools, suffer greater instability at home and have their ambitions crushed by low expectations.

Oxford and Cambridge really do evaluate admissions on a *very* academic basis, and are often criticised for not taking enough stock of the students' socioeconomic backgrounds. They have to do this because their courses are extremely difficult. It's not fair to admit a student who - while they may have incredible potential - simply isn't at a high enough level of attainment to begin studying the course. They would *seriously* struggle to survive.

I was lucky enough to go to a very good public school, and I got excellent A-level results. Despite this, I am really struggling here. Lowering entry standards in order to try and introduce 'equality' would result in lots of people in an even worse situation than me.

Frankly, changing the entry standard based on socioeconomic background seems to me to be glossing over the real problem: there are certain groups in society who have been set up to fail. They are born into a completely unfair system. They don't have access to good schools; they don't have access to good advice; they are continually informed by the world around them that they are not going to achieve much. That is horrendous.

I think the problem lies mainly with the earlier parts of the education system. Someone needs to work out how to run schools that can keep students motivated, provide them with a higher minimum standard of education and encourage them to aim for something.

Sadly each government - left or right - claims they can do this by changing the format of exams slightly. I just want to shake them. It doesn't fucking matter what the exams look like. If you've lost the interest of pupils by Year 9 - three years *before* GCSEs - it's a lost cause. I want better for them (and my friends here would agree with that).

This I can believe. I'm starting to think that the Independent really tries to be the most neutral paper but fails because the people who write it are just so damned gullible. Their science coverage is abysmal (they need a proper Ben Goldacre-ing).

Can anyone actually find me a news source I can trust alongside the BBC website? I'm pretty much excluding the following:

* Independent - gullible
* The Times, The Sun etc. - Murdoch's awful ethics
* Guardian - is too keen to publish unsubstantiated political stories, or they break big stories but are only partially correct. Also seem to depend on dubious linkbait stories to bring in lots of views to fund the 
website.
* Telegraph - not too bad, they seem a bit biased to the right though
* Daily Mail, Mirror, Express - I think this is fairly obvious

I know one answer to this will be 'read multiple papers'. I'm not convinced that multiple biased viewpoints average out to one neutral viewpoint, and I only have so many hours in my day.

I hope I don't offend anyone with my remarks.

1) Kent is divided in two (roughly). West Kent is largely still London, more or less. There are rich places like Tonbridge Wells which tend to be quite posh. Then there are places like St Mary Cray. The closer you get to London the more suburban it is. Avoid Medway. I don't know a great deal about this part of the world.

2) Then there is East Kent. There are lovely places here, such as Broadstairs and Whiststable as well as Canterbury. The countryside and architecture are historically interesting and beautiful. You might be tempted by Faversham. Do not be.

East Kent is largely a Dickensian nightmare, particularly most of Thanet, Ashford, Romney Marsh. There is generational unemployment, a problem with youth disaffection etc. There is (or was) a big problem with drugs like heroin and cocaine as well as more fun stuff across the region. Canterbury was always filled with beggars when I was there, some of whom became my friends.

 I have friends who have taught in the state school system in this part of the world. You will be doing a lot of behaviour management if you go into Secondary. 

Canterbury and Whitstable have some good food, but mostly there is drech in restaurants. A lot of chains. A lot of bland places. I always rated the noodle bar in Canterbury, and Paprika (a curry place) and Wholefoods. The farmers market is excellent but expensive. If you can find local suppliers, you are in the Garden of England. This means you get some of the best cherries, apples and pears in the world. 

In my experience, finding a GOOD cup of coffee is quite hard in the UK anyway.

Canterbury does ALSO have some lovely people in it. I still have a lot of friends there. There is a big hippie scene. Or there was anyway.

I now don't drink (I grew out of it). Now when I see people in the pub during the day (Saturday afternoon, for example), I just think, what a waste of time. There is so much to be doing than sitting in a smelly dark place getting pissed. Though at the same time, I'm jealous of them as they're all laughing and being chummy and wot not.

But then I think, how much of this is real. Apart from being tipsy and having lower inhibitions, are they only laughing and being chummy because the person opposite them is condoning their behaviour (drinking alcohol).

I equate it to someone trying to stop smoking. Maybe they had a routine at work of going outside for a fag break with their colleagues and then one day they decide to stop. I can imagine a scenario when some of the smokers would say to this person, go on, have one, it won't kill you. I think they're afraid that this person is leaving the pack; Maybe they now think that this person thinks they're above them because they have kicked the habit. And I think the offer of the fag to the non-smoker is more a way that should they accept, they are condoning the group's behaviour.

A bit like the school bully trying to get others involved in the bullying. It's all about condoning.

Maybe I think about these things too much.

- watch the football down there on saturday/sunday with mates, have a few beers, have some banter with mates and supporters of the other team (not like I'm gonna invite strangers into my house to do this!)
- being down the pub allows you to meet people who live in your town and builds community
- i can't fit a pool table in my house; down the pub i can have some beers, a bag of peanuts and play some pool and still have change from a tenner!

I don't consider these activities a waste of time - I spend time with friends and have good down time from work. Sure alcohol helps as a social lubricant, there's no denying that, but I don't think it's a bad thing at all! 

As for pack mentality, I guess that depends on who your ""friends"" are. If my friend who's married makes a questionable decision to eye up some bird and flirt a bit, I'll tell him to pack it in. Similarly, if they have a few beers and plan on driving I'll have word and tell them not to. If they turn up at the pub and decide their drinking coke instead of beer - well, big deal, makes no difference to me.

God forbid someone comes along and tries to change stuff by saying what he means. 

It is incredibly egotistical, so perhaps he will be quite a good politician after all.

Personally, I think if anyone thinks they can do it, if they think they can make a stand, they should. That's one of the good things about our democracy. I'm not saying he will succeed, I am just saying it's great that he can even entertain the notion.

Also I think it's funny socialists bitching about it (because of the union opposition and teachers wages thing) considering they could take so easily advantage of it. Teach working class history in history, socialist economic theories in economics, set up free schools in those deprived areas that currently aren't getting them and experiment with innovative educational approaches... but no, apparently that opportunity isn't worth the (obvious and planned) risks and downsides.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"1st....Sorry Smuckers apparently you have gone to the dark side, sorry mate.

I think if you were to look at this season alone you may be inclined to choose AVB over Wenger.  However that is taking the season as if it existed in a vacuum.  

Yes, we are in contention for a CL spot going into the final week.  Yes we have improved our point total away wins and any other number of categories of performance under AVB this season.  Keep in mind, we did finish 4th last season ('11/'12) missing the CL because Chelsea won the competition. In the previous 3 seasons before AVB we finished 4th, 5th and 4th under good ol 'Arry.  AVB has been improving on what we have been doing and in a different season we would be in the CL slots. We are still in competition for a slot going into the last day and have improved which is a credit to AVB but, we were (still are) a pretty damn good team.  As much as i love AVB he inherited alot of quality and has done fantastic things with them.  But he has done it for 1 season.

Wenger, I literally hate the man, but there is no question that he is a fantastic manager. He has done fantastic things for 15 years.  He has won 3 premier league titles and 4 FA Cups and managed the only the second undefeated team in the history of the top division of England. He is in position to bring Arsenal to the Champions League for the 15th straight season (c'mon Newcastle lets end the streak!!).  Think about that for a moment.....15 straight Champions league appearances, that is impressive as hell. Its scary to think that looking at the premier league the only other manager you can compare Wenger to in terms of accomplishments is literally SAF.  Think about that, the only manager that you can historically compare Wenger to is arguably the greatest manager in the history of the EPL. Then keep in mind how many times in that span Wenger (in most cases with a lesser calibre team) finished behind ManU and SAF. As much as i hate to say it, if it wasn't for SAF Wenger may have achieved more.  In terms of longevity only David Moyes is even close to Wenger at the moment, he was at Everton for 11 seasons and qualified for CL 1 time (and crashed out in the play-in round) and never won a cup.  

Lets look at this season, both manager have teams that finished in the top 4 last season.  We lost VdV, Modric and King. Huge losses, Modric and VdV were the engines for the team that finished 4th last season. We had to build around a new core of players with a new Manager. Make no mistake, what AVB has done is impressive. Keep in mind though  Arsenal lost RvP (to another team in the league, and who had a season that put him in contention for player of the year), and Alex Song.  And with 1 game left we are separated by 1 point.  This is actually still pretty damn impressive.

Its not fair to compare AVB to Wenger in who is a better manager because AVB doesn't have the track record to stack up (few do) and its actually unfair to Wenger to compare him to AVB because it disregards what Wenger has done in his career.

As for an undefeated season in the next 5 years, we are a really good team, but we are not that good.  Only Preston North End in 1889 and Arsenal have achieved it...in 124 years it has happened 2 times.  It is an incredibly difficult thing to achieve, and keep in mind United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool are all going to constantly be improving their team as well.  We have a good base but so do these other teams and they (for the most part) have more money to invest in their team.  I would love to see an undefeated season by all the odds are 100% stacked against it occurring.

As to whether or not Skaro was timelocked:

The answer, surprisingly, is no it was not.

The only reason Gallifrey was timelocked was to prevent Rassilon from initiating the Ultimate Sanction which would wipe out all life in the universe and cause an ascension of the Time Lords to be beings of pure cognizance rather than organic life as well as destroy Time itself.

The Eighth (or possibly Ninth) Doctor's use of The Moment timelocked all of the other Time Lords (bar the Doctor, and the Master who ran away from the war out of fear and the drumbeat in his head), the Daleks, the horrors unleashed by both sides such as Nightmare Child, as well as Gallifrey where the Ultimate Sanction was located.

Skaro had already become a wasteland at this point and was the Dalek capital in name only. Thus the Doctor had no reason to time lock it. They primarily used their spaceships to move around and congregate, which is shown in The Stolen Earth and Journey's End and again in Asylum of the Daleks. Though the Parliment ship is either a new canon, or a retcon as Daleks are supposed to only answer to the Supreme Dalek/Emperor Dalek rather than debate in Parliament.

Also places like monkey bizz, fun drum, kid zone are available which are those soft padded awesome adventure places that you wish you could break into at night with a paintball gun, crate of beer and some good friends.

Medway tends to have a lot of child related activities due to their being a high amount of young mothers and such!

Yes, there are good parts of Medway.  Hempstead for example which is also close to motorway and Hempstead shopping centre which is a nice centre and doesn't attract the rif raf that Chatham high street attracts.

I go to Chatham high street very rarely as Hempstead has most things and is a nicer day out.  Gillingham high street I would avoid, its not too pleasant an experience!  

Of course you are only 10 minute drive from Maidstone as well which is good for shopping and such, compares to Bromley shopping centre in my eyes.

Medway is good for family stuff though I would say with plenty of countryside attractions, the history of rochester (very nice high street but sort of olde style shopping!) and lots of restaurants hidden around the place.

Medway is much like any other borough to me really, they all have their good and bad areas.  Living in Orpington it was a mismatch as petts wood was round corner which was lovely, St Mary's cray was again around the corner, awful place, chislehurst was lovely, mottingham round corner not so nice.

Other areas around/in Medway to look at:

Eccles, Walderslade woods (round corner from me), Loose (outside maidstone), Boxley, Bluebell hill village, upchurch, Hartlip.

However, it seems a little like an overreaction. The word 'gay' has been used so much outside of its homosexual context that even the most progressive of people occasionally slip up. People using 'gay' as an insult always makes me wince, but every now and then I catch myself saying it too (and feel rather weird and embarrassed about it). 

**TL;DR - I like what the school is doing, but if they're doing it purely as a result of that one insult by a 5 year old it seems like an overreaction. Schools should be doing this regardless of whether someone has overheard an insult or not.** 

As an aside, 

1) wow, the comments on that article are disgusting/disturbing/worrying.

I'm not sure I do, bearing in mind that 'sissified household' comment. 

But since you asked, I think that society pigeon-holes men too much. Being tough and emotionally dead in all circumstances is to expected (beyond standard stiff-upper-lip stuff) and showing any negative emotions sans anger is seen as shameful. Want help with something? Shameful. Visit the doctor? Shameful. It's why so many men don't go for physical or mental treatment when they need it, and thus why so many die before their time. It's why I nearly didn't visit the doctor when I was depressed. I thought of myself as pathetic, because I'm a man dammit, and men never feel these things right?

And if you don't like things like football or getting drunk you're seen as gay or womanly and therefore (in their eyes) less of a person. And god help you if you know how to cook or clean, or even worse actually enjoy doing those things.

true,hotcod,null,null,"A local can be one or both of two distinct things. It can be the place that you and your friends all enjoy being in and can meet up and have a drink without having to descend on one poor sods house and it can be a place in which you are acquainted enough with the regulars that you can go on your own and spend some time having a drink and chat with other people without having to go through the rigmarole of introductions and basic getting to know people.

You may form actual friendships with other regulars in the pub but for the most part I've always view those relationships as something different exactly because of the type of issues you talk about. There's no deeper investment, if you wouldn't see a given person in some kind of regular way if they stopped going to the pub then they are an acquaintance not a friend. They are part of a common part of your life and what that part is will shape the kind of interactions you have with them. 

For example years ago I joined a band with people I didn't know, the drummer I'm only facebook friends with but one of the other guys is probably my best friend. Long after the band broke up we've worked and lived together and I see him regularly. Similarly in my current band, again made up of people I didn't know, I'm now very close with our singer and I'm she's a part of my actual life now which is extend past the life of the band, the other guys I'm also sure I'll actually still see if things changed but not so close. 

When you are a part of some one life purely because you happen to share a space in it and don't expand the relationship past it then you end up with the weird situations and issues that you brought up. It can be nice and rewarding and it's in a large part that's how wider communities work but it will trip you up if you think that those people are actually your friends because they are not invested in you they are invested in what you add to the given group at that given place/time. So you get resistance to things like talking about alcoholism in pubs because dealing with that is both a larger investment than is actually being asked or maybe even wanted and calls in to question the nature of what forms the base of your relationships.

From what I've seen in these case (There's was a rock club that from late school to well past uni I would spend a hell of a lot of time in sometimes going 3 days in a row and often without knowing if any of my friends would actually be out and a actual pub in which a few friends worked in [lived above even for a while] that was vastly more traditional and a really nice place to have a pint and read a book or have a chat) that kind of community is a lot like alcohol. Awesome for the most part but if you become dependent on what they offer or if it's the only thing in your life then it can be problematic. You can be fooled into thinking it's more than it is and you end up missing the deeper more real connections people really need from their friendships. 

Again not saying you can't actually be friends with the people in your local just that the very nature of what a local is is built around the idea of having a large aquated community, which can be built out of friendship groups but which for the most part is not a friendship group in and of itself.",0,1368616687,null,0,false,0,c9z5zb7,t3_1edc51,t1_c9z5zb7,t3_1edc51,null,1431151363,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's also a pain in the ar$e having to go to other pubs and try and make a whole load of new friends.

FTR: I've luckily never been in this situation so this is **not** my own opinion but theirs. I have a great relationship, we don't have kids, choose not to and are both breadwinners. It's pretty equal.  

So... from my conversations with them they feel like they were pushed out of their own marriages because the female wanted more from life i.e. they were never happy. Not only were they pushed out of their marriage, they were pushed away from their own children (with little or no contact  ) made to feel like they'd done something terribly wrong, then sucked dry of money when all they wanted to do was to be involved in their children's lives and felt they had the right to that. It's pretty clear from conversations that they don't want their own children growing up without any kind of male influence. In fact they want the complete opposite. 

Yet the women they married turned their own children and their side of the family against them. It was their choice. 



I have one mate whose wife just upped and moved back to Australia without even telling him beforehand, cut off all ties apart from through a solicitor ( for money obviously ) and left him devastated. He went over  to try and see his children, got a hiding from one of her brothers and they were both arrested, they ( her family ) made up some bullshit story that he was a wife beater ( not the case at all ) there to kidnap the child when all he wanted to do was see his own children. He was sent packing on the first plane home and can't go back there again under some Australian restraining order.  He's never seen his kids since. The guy is still heartbroken ten years later.  He's paying for a life he has absolutely no involvement in. 

He also thinks that because the kids were so young when she left that they'll never try and find him either because they won't actually know that he exists. It's a tragic story. But also his ex-wives choice; she had a plan to move back to her family, with their kids, using his money and he wasn't involved because he always said he didn't want to live there. 

Maybe she should have told him this before they got married. 



Now I'm no misogynist, as i said I have a great relationship with my girl. But I can empathise as to why my mates have become depressed misogynists though and I don't think that the whole single mother issue is entirely down to the male of the species. But to them ( my divorced mates ) if a women decides this is what she wants then there's not a damn thing ( in our society, under our laws ) you can do to stop it when there's children involved.

* Very detailed (pages have lots of information).

Disadvantages:

* Pages seem crammed and sometimes disorganised.

* Not officially endorsed by exam boards (you have to trust that they know the spec. exactly).

I was adopted into  a squat in the 1970s at the time being in a squat put you at the bottom of the housing que effectively creating a vicious circle. My dad got a meeting with him when he was then head of housing and he agreed to change camden housing policy to prioritise families with young children even if they were squatting. This is just an anecdote of course but it reveals to me at least the kind of listening, accessible and humane politician we crave. Ken spent decades doing work like this in London before he became head of the GLC. 

I also know another anecdote my great uncle fought in the spanish civil war like a lot of poor working class jewish boys from the East End. Every year Ken would organise a celebration of them at Jubilee Gardens and was thus well loved by a section of the Jewish community despite the incredible attempt by the pro-israeli lobby to demonise him as anti-semitic.

That said I'm not indicating he has no character flaws or that he hadn't been there long enough. I'm just saying that history will reveal him right on all his major policy planks from gay rights, anti-sexism, talk to Sin Fein, cheap busses, good social housing.

Apparently I'm satan. I learnt to ride on a &gt;250 bike. I do genuinely believe that larger capacity sports bike *can* make a decent starter bike for the right person. I may or may not wear my gear as I see fit and I'd certainly never criticise someone for not doing so. I dont own or aspire to own a cafer. I hate neither harleys or busa. I'm not riding for the image. I'm pretty sure the CC count of your bike has no impact you're ability to ride (squidness). I'm not the fastest person at the track, I'm not the slowest on the road. I think TOTW is poor/outdated. I think people should make their own informed decision about their safety. All of which puts me at odds with 90% of the posts.

In a less sarcastic tone, its just the pervasiveness of the inherited logic. Every post you see someone decides it's okay to critise the OP just because they dont ride in exactly the same way they do. Its not the difference of view that irks me, its the attitude of ""well rideit thinks this so you just suck and I'll get loads of karma points if i'm the first to point it out."" 

The attitude is that everyone is a ""squid"" if they step out of the tightly regimented constraits of what ""good"" riding is. I just find it lurching more and more towards a circle-jerking community that has a vaguely motorcycle theme. I'd be amazed if any of them actually rode half as well/safely as they make out - I'm sure if you found one that did, you'd fall over others wanting to criticise their chicken strips.

I was reading a thread on another sub-reddit about the demographic of users on rideit, it offered the opinion that rideit was majority populated by teenagers that are pre-license. A large chunk of the ""riding advice"" being offered is regurgitated from what they'd read elsewhere on rideit. The same ""facts"" and opinions being recycled from post to post without the users ever having the understanding of a bike. The few experienced riders that are/were there either dont bother posting anymore or go completely oppsite and turn into safety/maturity white-knights/evangelists. Since I read that I've started to see it more and more. 

I was begining to think i was just a some sort of crossover grumpy-old-liberal-curmudgeon. But I dropped into a stunting sub-reddit the other day, to answer a question for myself. In the process of reading various posts/comments I felt I had far more in common with the attitude of those guys than 99% of the population of rideit. I've never even tried to wheelie, it just doesnt appeal but I like talking/reading about bikes and having fun riding without feeling the need to ""educate"" everyone.",0,1368620758,null,0,1368633273,0,c9z6mfj,t3_1e967t,t1_c9z6mfj,t1_c9z5dkn,null,1431151060,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

Capped Rents during the GLC keeping London affordable for millions of Londoners - till the Tories outlawed it effectively creating a Benefits bombshell in Housing Benefits.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/jun/01/fair-rent-tenants-sitting-comfortably

Ran a fare's fare policy keeping London transport incredibly cheap (he reduced fares by a third) and then later reasonably cheap. Introduced Oyster cards creating perhaps the best integrated public transport system of any major city on earth. Introduced congestion zone against massive industry lobbying and improved air quality for all Londoners and massively improved traffic.

http://www.london24.com/news/transport/london_congestion_charge_a_success_10_years_on_1_1936089

Funded and promoted gay equality and gender movements and race equality when these were incredibly marginal concerns helping to create the tolerant London we know and love.
http://www.gayinthe80s.com/2012/10/29/1985-greater-london-council-changing-the-world/

Oversaw the steady reduction in crime to where homicide is at incredibly low levels and general crime is down.

There are plenty of other things of the top of my head like negotiating cheap oil from venezuela, talking to Sin Fein, celebrating East End Jews who fought Franco etc. etc.

Being ""time-locked"", by this interpretation, would only mean that a time traveller could never view or alter happenings from a particular period of time, in a particular section of space.

Basically, what I am saying is that even were Skaro in the time lock, if it was not destroyed in the Time War, it would still be able to be visited in the future. The events on Skaro would have been time-locked; that wouldn't prevent Skaro from continuing to exist. Gallifrey ""burned"" - that would be a different story.

There were far more staff than people signing on etc. I'm considering trying to apply for a job to actually work in the job centre. It doesn't seem like they do very much... 

I was due to see an ""adviser"" earlier in the week for the first time, they kept me waiting about 15 minutes before I got called over. The guy just said ""your adviser isn't here"" - no further explanation, no alternative. So now I'm due to see them tomorrow instead. After over a month this will potentially be the first time anyone has questioned me on what I'm looking for, and how *they* might be able to help me. And also because the 27th is a bank holiday, I can just skip signing on that day apparently. So the next time I see them will be the 10th, meaning almost a month without any contact at all, and 2 months of claiming JSA without much sign of them helping me to find work - I blindly assumed that was their raison d'etre.

I was also told I needed to show I was applying for jobs etc. ""How many?"" I asked, expecting them to want solid evidence I had applied for dozens of jobs; ""2 per week."" I didn't really know what to say, surely they should set their targets a bit higher? When I showed the guy my list of jobs I applied for, he signed off on it without even looking.

I agree with you on your comment about fiscal integration, it certainly appears to be heading that way. Much more fiscal integration is needed before monetary integration can be achieved. That is the Euro's weak point.

However most Brits believe that a country, like the UK - which has played a huge part in European history, politics and development, should be able to exclude itself from the Euro/Federal system and still retain the free trade advantages of staying in the EU. 

I think most Brits can somewhat swallow the idea of judicial compromise, but having fiscal and monetary policy determined outside of London is probably a step too far.

&gt;A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The Scottish Government has been absolutely clear in its opposition to the bedroom tax and has already outlined a range of practical measures to help mitigate its impact on the most vulnerable in our society.

&gt;“Housing Minister Margaret Burgess has written to all social landlords to encourage them to follow the example of Dundee City Council, which has agreed to use all legitimate means to collect rent, except eviction, for people in arrears because of the bedroom tax after the Director of Housing has examined individual cases.

&gt;“We have also brought forward measures to make eviction a last resort for social landlords, by ensuring that eviction actions can only be brought to court after they have gone through a number of steps, including income maximisation, early intervention and support for vulnerable tenants.

&gt;“And last month, the Deputy First Minister announced an extra £2.5 million for social landlords across Scotland to help them provide additional advice and support to those tenants who will lose out under the bedroom tax.”

Well I think this is very revealing as to the general all round shitness our D'Hondt STV ""everyone's a winner"" system has degraded into.

We have no real opposition.  Of the 108 elected MLAs, want to guess how many are in power?  103.  

For simplicity, that's 4.6%.

  Let's compare that to other parliaments nearby.
    
    Scotland: 64 in power, 63 out of power. 49%
    
    Wales: 30 in power, 30 out of power. 50%
    
    UK House of Commons:  362 in power, 288 out of power: 44.3%

What does this mean?  I hear you say.   

Peter says to Martin, I want to do pass this.  Any reason why I shouldn't?  Well, if you want us to say yes to this, then get your guys to give this one I have the green light when it turns up.  You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

What's happening now is the biggest Unionist and Nationalist parties aren't bothering letting the other parties in power into the talks.  Because, why should they?  They hold over 60% of the seats between them *and* can claim to represent ""both sides"" of Northern Ireland.

The UUP, SDLP and Alliance are now pissed because they can't intervene on the legislative process.  That said, they had a hand in creating this by saying it was okay to create legislation like this in the first place.  This means the DUP and Sinn Fein can push through just whatever the fuck they want without consulting with anyone or debating if any of it's actually a good idea.

No wonder O'Dowd was so blunt with his ""So?"".  It's a secret to everyone: the game's been rigged.  Nesbit starts complaining now it's been streamlined.

Ministers were using misleading figures (what else is new). According to this [fullfact.org](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/remploy_disability_employment_cost_access_to_work-3387) article, they got the £25k number dividing the £116.8 million in government aid it gets across the 5k employees. And saw it was significantly higher than the average ""Access to Work scheme"" (~£25k vs ~£3k).

Naturally that would make sense, Remploy actually employ people, not just find them work.

However, Remploy also found work for over 20k people in mainstream employment, according to their annual report.

Adding them into the equation, Remploy costs the government ~£4617 per person it spends its money on. Still higher than standard Access For Work, but a very fair price to get disabled people into work, and employ 5,000 of them full time.

It is all about the power and the new way of doing is not compatible with the old power structure. In short even if they adapt they lose so they are largely not going to try.

The very fact that pirate sites are able to operate with no income stream demonstrates that.

_Any_ sale at all then of a digital file should be pure profit.  That it isn't is down to two things:

 - There is more than just marginal profit to consider -- there is a base cost of production.  However, that is incurred for vinyl/CD too, so you can't really have that as a differentiator.
 - The marginal cost of your distributors payment system is distinctly non-zero.  I have high hopes that the more successful something like bitcoin becomes, the more this will stop the payment processors from stealing all the profit on low-margin sales.

I really have trouble thinking of an economic justification for why a digital copy costs around a pound for a track, when you can buy albums for less than a tenner (and we know full well that the retailer takes a good slice of that) -- it just cannot be true that there is more profit on a retail-sold physical item than a digital copy.

Only met one person working at a job centre who seems to give a shit. First claimants from my town have to travel about 28 miles round trip to be able to claim. Yet there is a job centre in my town, and it is never busy. They have an online database (I got letters from Watford the last time I was ""on"") so why the fuck they can't do shit in my local is beyond me.

Hell, the people in my local won't even acknowledge your existence if you're not signed on. I asked my job agency where I could get a fork truck license, because there's always a job out for FLT drivers, and they said they didn't know, but to try the job centre... the JC asked if I was signed on, and I said no, because the agency was giving me work.

As it is, I would have to turn down work from the agencies (making me uneligible for JSA) to get *on* JSA... or something, so that I can then ask a very simple request which would improve my earning capabilities (For the time being)...

As The Economist pointed out, about 4 out of 5 cars built in Britain are exported to the EU; what this doesn't say is that the UK exports more goods to North Rhine-Westphalia than India, and more to France and Germany than the entire Commonwealth. So supporting British exports with the United States and the Commonwealth is no option.

It's also worth mentioning that the United States are far more interested in their relationship with the EU (+450m people) than in their relationship with the UK (+60m). The ""Special Relationship"" that they currently (sort of) maintain between themselves and the UK would fare very poorly should the UK decide to vote itself out of the EU.

What would it do? Doctor ""Who."" doesn't specifically refer to his name, it refers to everything about him. If he flat out said ""My name is Doctor Tim."" that wouldn't mean a damned thing.

More so than that, his name would have to be ABSOLUTELY MIND BLOWING, so be of any use to us what so ever. After all of this time, for his actual name to be a huge plot point, for his name to need to be revealed, for us to even care what his name was...

It would have to basically shake Doctor Who as a show...

It would have to make us want to go back and watch the entire thing all over again to look for clues and red herrings and glimpses... and so on and so on.

I personally don't think this episode has to do with his name specifically, it could either be another thing that he has done in the past that needs to come to light, or it will have to do with the fact that he has been erasing himself from time for quite a while not (and with the help of Clara.) so ""The Doctors name."" could be ""The Doctor."" and mean nothing more than people finding out WHO HE IS AS WE ALREADY KNOW HIM, and THEY HAVE KNOWN HIM BEFORE, all over again...

And that would be just as awesome, depending on how they do it.

For me it boils down to one of those things. Either they won't tell us his name because it's absolutely meaningless to us, they will tell us his name because it's going to blow our brains out of the back of our skulls, or they won't tell us his name because we already know his name and it's ""The Doctor."" and the issue is that no one else knows his name right now...

Edit: I just wanted to be very clear that I don't believe they could pull of the second one. I don't believe for a second that they could give The Doctor a name and have it blow us away. It would have taken so much planning, and as we know, the series doesn't always hold under a lens.

&gt; Hmm. A bit loaded don't you think? Clearly see companies as being evil I'd say.

Not evil, self-interested. Companies will absolutely exploit consumers at every chance they get if it generates them a profit. That's pretty much the entire point of companies and indeed capitalism.

&gt; Yes of course, people cannot find things out for themselves without government intervention! God forbid they should be given that responsibility.

People *can* find stuff out without government intervention. However, driving along a motorway is actually an example of where this is very difficult to do. If the government can help people get better prices and improve the market, why exactly is that a bad thing?

&gt; Its more, unnecessary government regulation which puts a burden on companies and reduces individual responsibility. Its also costly to implement.

Paying too much for petrol is not a useful responsibility/freedom to have. The world will not become a worse place because people have don't have to try to figure out the best petrol price in a convenient area of their route. All this does is remove a bit of drudgery from peoples' lives and give them the information to make better decisions. We already do this by, for example, putting calorie counts on foods, or including tax in prices. It's not exactly a novel concept.

The cost to implement would be absolutely minuscule - the technology to do this would have been trivial 10 years ago and is even cheaper now.

&gt; If it is applied to motorway service stations it must then be applied to every industry, every single industry where there is the slightest chance consumers will not automatically have full information.

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"The article goes on to address those points.

&gt;  They could grab at two halfway options: a Norwegian one and a Swiss one.

&gt; Norway is about as close to the EU as it is possible to be without actually becoming a member. It simply belongs to the EEA. The EU is broadly happy with the arrangement, partly because Norway pays into its coffers (indeed, it pays slightly more per head than Britain). A similar arrangement might well be obtained.

&gt; Many businesses would hardly notice the difference. But a few would suffer minor irritation. Although EEA countries are part of the single market, businesses must complete customs and VAT forms when goods are shipped into and out of the EU. For big companies serving big customers, this is no problem. For smaller ones it can be a nuisance. Moods of Norway, an echt-Norwegian fashion company (its logo is a tractor), has solved the problem by setting up a small subsidiary in Sweden, which is a member of the EU. The subsidiary handles customs clearance for the European boutiques that carry Moods of Norway’s clothes. Small, export-oriented British businesses would end up doing the same.

&gt; If Britain were to join the Norwegian club, though, it would remain bound by virtually all EU regulations, including the working-time directive and almost everything dreamed up in Brussels in future. Once out of the EU, the country would have little say in the regulations and laws that would continue to bind its industry

&gt; It would depend on other countries to fight its corner, as Norway now relies on Britain to resist proposed EU legislation on offshore oil-drilling. It would be as though Britain maintained a golden fax machine linked to Brussels, which cost billions of pounds a year to run and from which regulations issued ceaselessly. It could ignore the faxes about farming and fishing: members of the EEA are allowed to run their own agriculture policies. But it would have to obey the others.

&gt; The Norwegian option could well fail for domestic reasons. As soon as British MPs learn that Norway has to swallow almost every regulation that comes out of Brussels, despite having virtually no power to shape them, they will waver. When they also learn that Norway has to pay for the privilege, they may reject it outright.

OK. So what about the Swiss option?

&gt; Switzerland does business with EU countries through bilateral deals, and by routinely aligning its regulations with those made in Brussels. To an extent, it can pick and choose. In the same position, Britain could drop some irksome labour rules. It could also move to co-operate more, and trade more freely, in some areas than in others. Switzerland has a comprehensive bilateral agreement with the EU covering trade in goods, but no equivalent agreement for financial services.

&gt;Switzerland has got into the occasional trade dispute with the EU, over Gruyère cheese for example. Still, for the most part it has secured good access to European markets so far. Its firms have subsidiaries in EU countries through which they can trade freely. And non-membership of the EEA means Switzerland has remained partly aloof from financial regulations emanating from Brussels. But the Swiss have come up with their own, often extremely stringent, financial regulations, partly in fear of losing access to EU customers.

&gt; And the country is not beyond the reach of Brussels. The Swiss are currently exercised over several European directives, including those covering finance, chemical factories and the movement of labour. Switzerland is hampered by the lack of an accord with the EU on financial services and by its lack of representation in Brussels. In the broader fight against protectionism and financial over-regulation in Europe, it relies on an informal alliance with another country that also has a big financial-services industry, as well as a valuable seat at the negotiating table: Britain.

Furthermore: 
&gt; The halfway options of Norway and Switzerland were offered largely in hopes of tempting both to become full members one day. Britain would be travelling in the opposite direction, without a map. In this, as in so many other ways, leaving the EU would be a colossal gamble.

Even something as seemingly obvious as negotiating a new trade deal won't be easy.

&gt; The British would doubtless try to negotiate a special deal with their former partners, using the argument that trade benefits both sides and that Britain is itself a large market for many. But the process could take many years (it took a decade for the much smaller Switzerland). Europe might well be more of a fortress with Britain outside. And even the country’s closest friends, who would rather keep Britain in to bolster liberal voices inside the EU, would be unlikely to be generous to a country that had chosen to leave.",0,1368630257,null,0,false,0,c9z92us,t3_1ebfsr,t1_c9z92us,t1_c9z8ufr,null,1431149831,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

Canterbury is a nice little city that takes about 15 minutes to walk to the city ""wall"" from the centre. There are quite a few nice restaurants, in that respect it has improved since Rassimo has been here I think. There are plenty of awesome cafes here, [Chocolate Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/cafeofcanterbury) and [Boho](https://www.facebook.com/pages/BOHO-CAFE/200827516598533) are my two favourites. For restaurants you have a few to pick from, [Deeson's](http://www.deesonsrestaurant.co.uk/index.php) is the most expensive but do great everything, [La Trappiste](http://www.latrappiste.com/) is also a bit pricey but has a great selection of beers to go with the foods, and [Cafe Mauresque](http://cafemauresque.co.uk/) has the best sangria and tapas, and is also very reasonably priced. You said curry, but as someone who's never really eaten Indian food as a kid I'm not too keen on it. The only place that we've tried, [the Ancient Raj](http://www.ancient-raj.com/) was really good though, so they get my vote.

The city itself is very safe. I live right outside of the walls and often leave my door unlocked at night when I'm staying up working or studying and need to step out for a bit of fresh air. It's pretty quiet, places seem to shut just before midnight (which I'm not used to), so that's good. There are a lot of homeless people, which weirded me out when I first came here because I had never seen so many. They're dotted every 10 or so meters along the streets and in the little underpass walkways.

As far as the kid-friendliness of it all, I don't have kids so I can't speak much on that, but there is a gym with a pool just to the north of the city that has lessons, and there's a small park with a playscape in the city. I see a lot of families with kids here, so I'd imagine there are plenty of daycares and the like to pick from.

true,chub79,eu,Brittany,"&gt; to get anything approaching good.

Depends on what you consider by that. Music qualities are rather subjective, what's good to me isn't to you. I think up to 15 years ago majors weren't trying to sell us good music, but rather they were trying to federate around an idea they could market. In my mind, they nurtured a context which led people to feel part of something. People would then buy stuff to show they'd belong. Not just CDs, but clothings, posters, magazines, etc.

Look at the grunge era, bands were criticizing the very system fans dove into by buying all those goodies. Why did fans do that? I believe, it was to show they belonged to that certain group. 

With the Internet, it's much more difficult to federate at such level. But I don't think the desire for people has gone away. So folks do not really care about music ""goodness"", they still want to be part of something. Shouldn't those in the industry focus on that? Pick up an idea, find the bands that match that idea and invest in them. 

The issue was that until the mid-90s and the arrival of the Internet, it was rather easy to spot social trends they could heavily invest in. With the Internet, majors seem to be unable to ""smell"" the right opportunity. They didn't come up with grunge, hiphop, punk, etc. They saw in those an opportunity and made business off them. The internet seems to have made it impossible for them to detect the next big thing and they run like headless chicken.

So there you have it (well in my mind), people want to belong and majors want to exploit that tendency. The internat has broken that subtle relationship. Now what?

Coming back to bandcamp's model. I use it a lot and I've spent probably more on it than I would do in a store. Why? Because it's cheap AND I know the band gets a fairer share (if not all the income). People browsing on bandcamp don't care about wasting a bit of time finding good stuff, they do it because they find the right ethical business model. It will likely not overtake the whole industry but it suits me fine and, though I doubt bands live off it, I'm pretty sure those I follow enjoy its model.",0,1368631107,null,0,false,0,c9z9cmi,t3_1ednh9,t1_c9z9cmi,t1_c9z8vmq,null,1431149704,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Well, if you're going to assert the right to life upon all animals then I suppose it should be up to you to provide an argument for such a position.

I have, based in inherent value of intelligence.

&gt;However I will set out a major stubling block for your position. Rights assume responsibility.

You really shouldn't be so quick to try and quantify the strength of your arguments. Better to let them speak for themselves. In this case your argument is actually tremendously weak to anyone familiar with a little bit of ethical theory, although fair play to you if you came up with it on your own.

So ok, in this case you're wrong and here's why:

There are two (well, some argue more than two, but minimum of two) categories of entities with rights. **Moral actors**, and **moral patients**.

Moral actors are creatures like adult humans, they have rights but *because* they have the capability of rational choice they also have responsibility. I have a duty not to kill because I am capable of knowing that killing is wrong, this is where that duty stems from.

Moral patients are things like Lions, or 2 year olds kids. They have rights, because they have a *certain* level of intelligence, they can feel pain, they do make choices, but because they're both of a relatively low level of intelligence, we don't hold them responsible for their actions. They're moral patients because they do not have the capability to make rational choices or to know that killing is wrong. Nevertheless just because *they* are not capable of being held to that standard, does not mean that we are the same.

There are a few different ways of formulating this, you can argue the inherent value of intelligent life as a foundation for rights, or you can go along the tack of universalisation, or you can found all rights in the duty of moral actors, which does away with needing to assign any real rights per se to animals, but ultimately the outcome is the same in all situations.

Moral patients are sometimes not given identical rights to moral actors, but the more fundamental/basic rights are always there.

Good try though, if you came up with it on your own.",0,1368631640,null,0,false,0,c9z9ixs,t3_1ebbwu,t1_c9z9ixs,t1_c9z993n,null,1431149621,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Depends on what you consider by that. Music qualities are rather subjective, what's good to me isn't to you.

Mostly yes, an unmastered track playing an a 10k (or even just a loud hifi) sound system will sound like shite however and that is partly what I was talking about (very important if you're to be played in large venues like nightclubs or on the radio).

At least music made by bands is still difficult to do (at all, never mind well) but now that you can make music entirely with computers this means that anyone and his dog can make a tune a week to clog up the new releases so yes, music is subjective but I think it's safe to say that if no label wants to sign your music you should either try harder or start your own, then you'll find out how good you really are.

I think you make some excellent points and I don't disagree with you all that much, I think there are some large failings with the current model but I really don't think it's easy to solve.

&gt;So there you have it (well in my mind), people want to belong and majors want to exploit that tendency. The internat has broken that subtle relationship. Now what?

Exactly, I think the internet has widened the audience for music but at the same time has taken the macro community aspect away which 'movements' such as grunge or punk relied upon to thrive.

More seriously, I think plenty of people are able to make a few good tracks, with more than just a computer. But a few good tracks don't make a lasting band. Or at least, a band that people will follow up.

I think there is something broken in the premise that it's by pushing down new music constantly that more money will be made.

People won't bother too much spending cash on their music. They will download for free, as if they were listening to their radio really. Fans, on the other hand, will. So if you don't invest long term on a band, you won't have fans that will invest in return.

No its not very difficult to do. Its perfectly easy to do. The government does not need to take responsibility away from people.

""Paying too much for petrol is not a useful responsibility/freedom to have. The world will not become a worse place because people have don't have to try to figure out the best petrol price in a convenient area of their route.

Too much? Define too much. I love how people with anti-market economy ideologies always think prices are 'too much' or producers are being 'paid too little'. Meaningless.

If a consumer would like to minimize his petrol costs then he must actively seek out the best petrol supplier. That is his responsibility. Not the governments.

I actually think if people took responsibility for their own lives they would be much happier. I know. Completely irrational according to your nanny state world view.

Pure fabrication. The technology is not cheap by any sense of the word. Not to mention motorway service station owners already pay high rent.

Actually no. Its not a slippery slope argument in the slightest. You provide no good argument for why this should not be applied to every single market.

So while I'm not inclined to join in heated debates about piracy I'll say one thing.  As a teenager in the 90s I was regularly forking over between 10 and 20 pounds for a CD.   Sometimes for CDs that I didn't like once I'd got them home and listened to them.  And at the time it was common knowledge that CDs cost less than a pound to manufacture.  Of course there are other costs to factor in but still, very few industries could see such a huge profit margin.  There wasn't another option though.  The same could be said about DVDs.  A few years ago I was paying upto and sometimes over £20 for a single film.  

The entertainment industry was incredibly greedy throughout the late 20th century and now they're paying for it.  It wouldn't have been such a loss if they weren't demanding so much.   

If the artists want to be compensated for what they do (and I don't think it's completely necessary, most of my favourite bands worked day jobs and made music as a hobby) then they should extricate themselves from the industry.

Stat wise, Rebic has scored well (.31 goals a game) at a slightly older age (18/19) in a weaker league. £6m and a championship loan would probably be pretty fair.

For comparisons sake you can look at Bony (who I think would be good) who is 24 he has scored excessively well at rate of .71 a game for the last 3 years (21 - 24 years old) in a much tougher league (Eredivisie). In fact, at 31 goals this season, he is top scorer. 2 of the last 3 people to get past 30 goals are Huntelaar and Suarez - no small fish.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;First off there is a difference between Scottish Labour and Labour, it's the beauty of devolution and Scottish Labour are openly against the bedroom tax.

Scottish Labour is the same party as the Labour party. It is just a branding, there is no separate registration, the MPs follow the main party whip. And even if the MSPs disagree, they can't differ from the main body of the party in anything more than rhetoric as welfare is not a devolved issue. Comparison of the main party to the SNP is the only one that counts, everything else is just unsubstantiated rhetoric with no intent to back it up or follow through. 

&gt;So people will not be evicted from their homes but the tax will still have to be paid. Part of Scottish Labour proposals was a compensation scheme for councils to make up the deficit created by the bedroom tax.

The devolved setup leaves welfare and any real taxation to Westminster. Any funding directed from the block grant to provide from monies cut from central government would need to be met elsewhere. Welfare is not within the scope of the Scottish Government 
at the moment, it spends the money on the areas where it has competence. Diverting limited funds to protect from central government policies is not a viable long term solution as it cannot go on indefinitely with an ideologically different government holding the purse strings. If Scottish Labour was about anything more than noise when it came to the bedroom tax, and other issues of that ilk, they would be looking to get more powers devolved (and I'm not talking about the meagre offerings resulting from the Calman commission).

With regards to the independence referendum, it is a little bit ironic that Labour complain about welfare policies by the Scottish Parliament despite it evidently being a weakness of the devolved setup they are supposed to be defending.

I'd highly recommend Bromley. 

Some of the top schools in the country are in Bromley (St Olave's &amp; Newstead Woods Grammar Schools) as well as some very good state schools, and there's some private schools too. Whether or not they'd hire you I don't know, but the vast majority of schools do very well (relatively speaking) and are full of affluent and reasonably well behaved children. Obviously any school has its fair share of problematic children, but compared to other parts of London and Kent, I've heard that these schools are actually very ""nice"" to teach at.

There's good connections both to Canterbury and deeper into Kent, as well as central London via train. The buses around here are very good compared to say Canterbury and Maidstone, and you can also get an ""Oyster"" card which gives you discounted travel around London (including on the buses in Bromley).

Restaurants and pubs are easy to find, as well as numerous cafes. 

The thing with Bromley is that it's split into 2 parts. The rich part and the not-so-rich part. The rich part (West Wickham, Beckenham, Orpington) is very nice and people are friendly. A few over-entitled rich white kids but nothing major. Then there's the poorer parts (Penge in particular) which do have a lot of council estates and aren't particularly somewhere you'd want to be alone in at night.

Honestly though, I wouldn't go anywhere else. It sounds ideal for what you want. Lots of family-friendly leisure facilities (swimming pools, cinemas, easy access to big shopping centers, play groups, nurseries), good quality schools, a nice area and good links with London and the whole of Kent.

true,stronimo,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"The article goes on to address Norway

&gt; Norway is about as close to the EU as it is possible to be without actually becoming a member. It simply belongs to the EEA. The EU is broadly happy with the arrangement, partly because Norway pays into its coffers (indeed, it pays slightly more per head than Britain). A similar arrangement might well be obtained.

&gt; Many businesses would hardly notice the difference. But a few would suffer minor irritation. Although EEA countries are part of the single market, businesses must complete customs and VAT forms when goods are shipped into and out of the EU. For big companies serving big customers, this is no problem. For smaller ones it can be a nuisance. Moods of Norway, an echt-Norwegian fashion company (its logo is a tractor), has solved the problem by setting up a small subsidiary in Sweden, which is a member of the EU. The subsidiary handles customs clearance for the European boutiques that carry Moods of Norway’s clothes. Small, export-oriented British businesses would end up doing the same.

&gt;  If Britain were to join the Norwegian club, though, it would remain bound by virtually all EU regulations, including the working-time directive and almost everything dreamed up in Brussels in future. Once out of the EU, the country would have little say in the regulations and laws that would continue to bind its industry

&gt;  It would depend on other countries to fight its corner, as Norway now relies on Britain to resist proposed EU legislation on offshore oil-drilling. It would be as though Britain maintained a golden fax machine linked to Brussels, which cost billions of pounds a year to run and from which regulations issued ceaselessly. It could ignore the faxes about farming and fishing: members of the EEA are allowed to run their own agriculture policies. But it would have to obey the others.

&gt;  The Norwegian option could well fail for domestic reasons. As soon as British MPs learn that Norway has to swallow almost every regulation that comes out of Brussels, despite having virtually no power to shape them, they will waver. When they also learn that Norway has to pay for the privilege, they may reject it outright.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"You didn't listen to a single thing I said and you're still totally wrong.

&gt; Again ""exploit."" Loaded language, from a loaded anti-freedom ideology.

From Wikipedia: ""*Most often, the word exploitation is used to refer to economic exploitation; that is, the act of using another person's labor without offering them an adequate compensation.*"" [It's also the first definition in the OED](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/exploit). This is not hard; it's utterly basic economics, and frankly your inability to grasp it reflects how completely baseless your entire argument is.

&gt; No its not very difficult to do. Its perfectly easy to do. The government does not need to take responsibility away from people.

You keep saying that. Responsibility is not a beneficial or virtuous thing to have if it doesn't have a specific reason.

&gt; Too much? Define too much. I love how people with anti-market economy ideologies always think prices are 'too much' or producers are being 'paid too little'. Meaningless.

Too much would we be *more than the price an informed consumer is willing to pay*. Holy shit. Go ready a book before talking about ""anti-market economy ideologies"". It is one of the nine requirements of [perfect competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition#Basic_structural_characteristics) which is not an anti-market idea, it's the entire principle on which the market is based. Imperfect competition leads to *inefficiency*, which is *bad*. Understand?

&gt; If a consumer would like to minimize his petrol costs then he must actively seek out the best petrol supplier. That is his responsibility. Not the governments.

Why? The only person that benefits from poor information is the person selling overpriced petrol. The consumer pays more, and his competition are unfairly robbed of a sale that an informed consumer would give to them. Finally, while you're educating yourself please work on your grammar.

&gt; I actually think if people took responsibility for their own lives they would be much happier. I know. Completely irrational according to your nanny state world view.

You don't know a thing about your world view, much less mine. Paying more money for petrol *does not make people happier*. You are not being robbed of any freedom or agency; this would simply give you the understanding to use it properly.

&gt; Pure fabrication. The technology is not cheap by any sense of the word. Not to mention motorway service station owners already pay high rent.

Really? They already display centrally/remotely set prices for a number of fuels, how exactly would it be prohibitively expensive to add a couple more lines? The already high rent is a reason why this kind of price is even more insignificant as a proportion of their costs/revenue.

&gt; Actually no. Its not a slippery slope argument in the slightest. You provide no good argument for why this should not be applied to every single market. Everything you've said could be equally applied to anything people buy. If you remove consumer responsibility from one market there is no good reason to remove it from another market.

Read what I said. We *already force companies to provide certain information to consumers*. Making them provide *one more type of information* in one *specific circumstance* does not mean that we then have to make them provide all information in all circumstances. Yes, the same logic could be applied to other things *but it already is*, and I gave you two examples of that. Another example is we don't allow misleading claims in adverts, because we don't think consumers should have to investigate themselves.

You can also go and comb through UCTA or UTCCR for other examples if you can find anyone to lend you the mental faculty. Lenders only tell you APR because they have to - are you upset that this deprives you of the ""responsibility"" to read tens of differently worded policies requiring complex conversion?",0,1368637335,null,0,1368637570,0,c9zbgkp,t3_1eb88d,t1_c9zbgkp,t1_c9z9zu2,null,1431148709,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
