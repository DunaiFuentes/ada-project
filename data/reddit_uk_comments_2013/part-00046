true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Should we base our economy on exploiting foreign labour and promoting brain drains from countries who need their expertise at home, how is that any ethically better than colonialism?

Well because that's pretty much an inevitable consequence of any pseudo-liberal capitalism without extremely tight border control. If we close our borders those people will go elsewhere - the UK having a stupid immigration policy will not affect emigration anywhere.

Doing anything else entails confining those who have worked hard and are intelligent to their country of birth so that said country can benefit. It's also an extremely inefficient system of economics - the more intelligent and better able and will be more productive in better conditions.

There's also the fact that your 'brain drain' argument doesn't apply as much as you might think: remittance (sending home unneeded money) is very common amongst first generation migrants and materially improves the situation of those back home. Likewise, it is not uncommon for migrants to remigrate after a generation or two, or to invest in their home country (in property or business) due to continuing family ties.

It's a complex issue but your summation is quite deceptive in its simplicity.

The general sentiment, which was really drilled in abit too heavily for me in the last episode, was that helping dependent people (in this case the elderly) is one of the most fulfilling experiences in life. Also I think the series makes everybody ask the question of them self ""How do I want to be treated when I'm elderly and decrepit"" which should persuade younger viewers to set a good example with the elderly in their life.

As to the disabled character thing, Derek says in one of the latter episodes (paraphrased) ""I don't care how I make people laugh, just as long as they're laughing"" - in my eyes if somebody behaves in that manner, you can't help but feel sympathy/empathy for the person, i.e. much more dramatic emphasis than comedic.

Karl could never really play anything but an outspoken simpleton, but when he started spouting about how he'd want to come back as Derek, I thought it was abit over the top.

On a plus not, I did enjoy the sex-obsessed characters heart-to-heart at the end, where he talked about failing because he didn't try. For me it made me think ""you've only got one shot, give everything all your effort"", nothing like seeing a failure pour his heart out to spurn you into feeling more adventurous in your day-to-day life.

true,cucumbermelee,null,null,"To be fair, I think most of your points of contention are to do with the guy on the phone who is NOT a Liverpool fan. Also, the deterioration of the club hasn't been stemmed at all and FSG said all the right things but haven't followed through with the goals aside from hitting the bare minimums. The BIGGEST reason for frustration is the stadium. Its been more than a decade of faffing over the stadium. FSG said they'll sort something out, they have done nothing but hit bare minimum targets. The Anfield area itself is in DIRE need of investment. It just seems that there hasn't been anything done for that at all. I know they changed the plans from Stanley Park to Anfield but do NOT think that that is progress. Far from it. Its just enough to keep people off their backs. 

Dempsey-gate in the summer has made a lot of fans disillusioned with them as well as with Ian Ayre. There is a lot of hate towards the upper management of the club and that is what they meant by ""managerial staff"", not BR. We can all see that BR has the potential to take us on well. And also, lets be honest, there is no better option open to us.

To be totally frank, I am at a complete and utter loss as to why these accounting figures are even up for discussion. Purely because of the amount of income it excludes and also, £80 million is a HELL of a lot better than £400 and that is all thanks to FSG. And not to mention, a significant amount of the debt is in the form of interest free inter company loans. 

As for the CL... I can see where they're coming from to be honest. Our team ISN'T a million miles away but a lot of people on this sub think that just because we are ending the season well (and I use ""well"" very loosely here) that we will automatically be able to contend for fourth place. None of this is guaranteed. Spurs will maintain their position and strength, Arsenal will be better. Everton may even be floating around. It is not out of the question either that we will not strengthen the squad enough to be able to contend for 4th. We have gotten optimistic for too long, ""next season"" is said almost as much as YNWA amongst Liverpool fans.

Basically, FSG anger can be easily be lifted by a £50mill net spend in the summer. There's a lot of distrust attached with FSG. But we all appreciate that they are a lot better than H&amp;G. Its just, after David Moores, its very hard to stomach owners that seemingly are only in this for sell-on profit. They have not maintained long term goals and in my opinion have used FFP as a tool to avoid the basic fact that they should be investing more and treating our great club with more respect than they have with regards to spending on players. 

I just hope to god we get CL next season and everyone stays happy. This league is as difficult now as it has ever been. And I think some people on this sub are living in ""next season"" delusions to a certain extent. We have a lot of improvements to make. Our squad has good players yes but hardly any depth. We need a properly busy transfer window and we have not really seen that under FSG. The net spend during their busiest season was £35mill. That is just not good enough for propelling this club on.

I'm just not that ambitious.  I don't want to work my way up past a certain level, and, so long as I can pay all my bills okay, I'm not that bothered about earning a lot of money.

The honest answer is married, bringing up a couple of kids.  Maybe, *maybe* working part time, if we need the extra cash.

What I say is: Out of my sister and I, she's the more ambitious one.  As long as I enjoy my day to day job, I'm not one of those people always looking towards the next promotion.  My goals are things like learning to drive and saving up for a deposit on a house, personal things.  As far as work is concerned, I like to know I'm doing the best job I can and that I get the same or better results as anybody else can; that's what motivates me.

I do find it very important to throw in that bit about what motivates me though, I think that's part of what a lot of employers are trying to find out with that question.

I'm also finding, by the way, that the strengths and weaknesses question is being increasingly replaced with something more along the lines of ""tell me about a problem you've had at work and how you overcame it"", which I feel is a much easier question to answer, as it's less vague.",0,1362861125,null,0,false,0,c8spnrs,t3_19zapf,t1_c8spnrs,t3_19zapf,null,1431534251,5,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,5

What I am saying is that looking at the population of Earth, people in the UK are living in the lap of luxury, even if they don't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

What you are saying is, yes, but given the enormous wealth a tiny minority of people have, surely there's a better way for society to function where we have a bigger middle class and in fact, there's enough money to support the jobless in comfortable accommodation.

I am not disagreeing with the analysis.

I am not saying I think the scheme is actually something that's a good idea.

I have two points, the first is that if the scheme is there as an attempt to find a more efficient, and perhaps heartless way of allocating a finite resource of living space then the cost to the tax payer is not the issue. It doesn't matter if it costs more if the goal is to find space for everyone.

The second is that given the relative luxury we have, moving out of town is a first world problem.

Now, I think where we are getting caught up is that you are saying - it may be a first world problem, but that's where we live and there's enough cash to go around.

I agree, however I don't think the problem is as easy as just taxing the rich.

Perhaps if we all got paid in bitcoins and there was a simple rule that took x percentage of wealth over a certain threshold and spread it out evenly I'd be more interested, here the idea being that everyone would have enough for all their reasonable needs.

What I don't think is good enough is leaving this to politicians. I'll leave it here as what follows could chew up the rest of the night but please don't think I'm heartless. Just pragmatic...

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"They ECtHR pays very little if any attention to public opinion including 'dreadlocked smelly wankers' as you so stereotypically put it. They are international experts in interpreting a convention that has been in it's current form for decades. Surely a fair trial would include not sending someone back to a country where evidence gained through torture could be used, yes? If we say that's OK, what grounds do we have to require the US stop torturing people in Guantánamo Bay, they're just looking for evidence. Evidence gained through torture is incredibly unreliable and if used to condemn someone is likely to result in wrongful imprisonment. That's what we were supporting. 

Your simplifying this to us, who want a terrorist supporter to be punished, and them, who don't care if British citizens live or die in a terrorist attack supported by this man. I think you would probably try and count me among 'them' even though I don't have dreadlocks unfortunately. I however would be offended if anyone did not think this man was a colossal twat that should stand trial for his provable actions. I don't think however that the high standards we set for ourself and that exist for yours and my protection should be thrown away in the process. In reality the Qatada situation was easily solvable by working with the Jordanian government. Instead the Conservatives have used it as a way to criticise Europe and win back UKIP voters. We should be proud of how strongly we can contemn our government if they do anything at all that violates our concrete rights as a citizen of Europe. Instead we shake our heads and wonder why we have things that hinder the government from doing what it wants. It's telling that Ken Clarke QC and Dominic Grieve QC, two of the countries most experienced legal minds, think leaving the ECHR would be a disaster. 

It's almost like Theresa May doesn't understand the concept of civil liberties and human rights when she says the ECHR 'restricted the UK's ability ""to act in the national interest""'. Of course it did, that's the point. Governments always want more power, it's frustrating when you want to do something but there's an obstacle even if that obstacle is well meaning. Human rights exist as obstacles to that creeping authoritarianism and it's laughable and incredibly naive of her to say that because they prevent the government from doing whatever it wants she has a mandate to remove those rights. She fundamentally misunderstands the point of the state and her duties while in it. At base it's one of the most authoritarian and statist things i've ever heard a (British) politician say. 

To quote Piero Calamandrei: 

'the State finds its highest expression in protecting rights, and therefore should be grateful to the citizen who, in demanding justice, gives it the opportunity to defend justice, which after all is the basic
*raison d'être* of the State.'

I know that there were other factors that went wrong with DS23 but he still showed as good of potential as Lukaku is showing on loan.

Same thing with Lukaku. I think he needs the maximum playing time with a Premiership club and then come back to Chelsea when he has at least a second position in the line up secure. Torres will get starts as long as he stays regardless of his form, Ba isn't half bad and will earn his starts so that just causes more speed bumps in Lukaku's development at Chelsea. 

I think what we need to do is to loan him to a better Premiership club who need a striker or have a good team set up for next season and are in need of a striker, or he can even stay at the same club. I have a lot of faith in Lukaku but really want him to dust off most of his cobwebs before he comes to Chelsea to become and monster because the way we are going right now, he needs to come in when he's ready and with at least a second spot secured or else it will all go very wrong very fast.",0,1362865113,null,0,false,0,c8sqo4x,t3_19z3fq,t1_c8sqo4x,t1_c8sm4q4,null,1431534654,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;There's also the fact that your 'brain drain' argument doesn't apply as much as you might think: remittance (sending home unneeded money) is very common amongst first generation migrants and materially improves the situation of those back home.

WHAT? You are happy that kids of Migrants get in their own lands, a UK sponsored ""leg-up"" on the capital ladder as their own country loses skills and makes it less likely that the poor sods who didn't bother or couldn't make it to the UK can prosper? I'm all for immigration but the fact that this can happen in Europe and what we concentrate on is the economic benefit or drain; and not the fact that these gaping disparities exist between countries: is bonkers. 

There are a million socially liberal Humanitarian arguments against un controlled migration.

The problem is, like with the NHS, people are so politicised that they simply don't bother to consider them.


Social engineering in other people's countries.

This is exactly what EUROPE SHOULD BE AGAINST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

true,__shadow,lfc50,,"GK: Reina - He's had a mixed season. He's let in a few goal but also made some amazing saves. Still the number one goalie for the club, imo.
Jones has done reasonably well, i feel. While he may not be the primary goalie, he's done well to cover up when reina was injured. I still wouldn't use him as my primary GK in case Reina retires (i certainly hope he doesn't!)

Defense: We've had an inconsistent central defense to say the least. Especially Skrtel. I know its Carra's last season in all probability, but he's made a few blunders too. Agger has been my pick of central defenders. Not necessarily only for his defensive capabilities. From time to time, he makes these incisive runs and creates chances.
RB/LB - Glen Johnson has had a great season. His defense has gotten much better. Enrique has had a poor start but then, he picked it up fairly well. To his defense, he was injured earlier this season. Now, both of them add a fair amount of attacking threat. Make really good runs and aid the wingers/ attackers. I hope Kelly gets back to the pitch asap.

Midfield: Gerrard's having a great season so far. Goals, assists, creating chances, rallying the team, you name it. He's been phenomenal. In fact, I'm gonna order a new Gerrard Jersey today.. I'm glad Lucas is back. He's getting back to his best performance too. I like Hendo and Suso. Hendo has really upped his performance. I think he'd do great in the coming few seasons. Suso has not gotten much game time lately. But he'll definitely turn out to be one of our main players in the coming few years. I think Allen is being victimized unnecessarily, these days. I remember how ppl were raving about his performances in the beginning of the season. He needs to be more versatile, that's all I can say. He'll turn out good, I feel. Coutinho hasnt played too many games yet. So I wouldn't judge him so early. But from I've seen of him, he seems really fast and technically adept. Should certainly add depth to our squad.
A quick word about Jonjo and Spearing. Personally, I like Jonjo. I think he's got what it takes in him. He's had a couple of bad games but he should focus more in training. am sure he can step up. But am not quite as hopeful about Spearing. I wouldn't want him in the bench as well. Maybe he needs to pick up his trade elsewhere for a couple of seasons.

Wingers: Downing has had a much better season, this year. He puts in an incredible amount of work every game. People might not rate him, mainly because of his poor season last year. But I think a lot has to do with our poor finishes last season. Let me get this straight though. His crosses are still not efficient. We should still get in a quality winger during the transfer window. Every now and then, he gets in a few good crosses. But he needs to be more consistent, imo. Two things people (usually) tend to not notice about Downing - his defensive capabilities and his positional play/ forward runs. He's been pretty good in that regard, i feel. Sterling has not been featuring much lately. But I'm sure he'll turn out to be a tricky customer to deal with. He's got pace. But he needs to work on is his movement. He'll get there. He has age on his side.

Strikers: I don't really need to say anything about Suarez. He's been a thorn in the oppositions defense and an absolute menace. My player of the season. Has now formed a real good partnership with Sturridge. Sturridge, even though arrived only in January, has drafted very well into the side. Lethal partnership with Suarez. Am glad he's back from his minor injury. Am so looking forward to the spurs game to see what they can do together. Borini - I want to say that he hasn't really performed up to expectations. But then, maybe its too early to judge him. Since he's been injured for the most part of the season, I don't think its fair to pass a harsh verdict on him. 
Also, Andy Carroll. I hope we do manage to sell him unless something miraculously changes him to fit into our current style of play.

I think what really makes the series stand out is your last point - the Doctor himself. His character is so different than anyone else, not only because of his origins and losses, but because of the regenerations. Each Doctor adds something new to the mix, making him an increasingly complex character. HE is what ties everything together and makes it work. He's more than just the hero - sometimes he's the villain, sometimes he's the sidekick. 

I certainly hope that DW will be regarded as a great dramatic work in the future! I think the older episodes have been, and have had a great influence on television in general. It's only a matter of time before the reboot episodes come to be as highly regarded!

&gt;The difference from colonialism is they're wilfully coming over here...

I said

&gt;Most of it's European slaves were willing on the back of promises of free land and better lives.

So, it isn't so different is it.

Which is technically true. It is not AS different as your statement suggests. I didn't bring up colonialism. 

&gt;'under funded immigration policy' is a non-sequitur given the complaint is about immigrants having an economic incentive to come here and thus depriving their home country of their skills.

Yer I am bad with words sorry. What I meant to say was; if you have an ""all-comers welcome"" immigration policy that is not based on either a ""one job- one worker"" policy or something very clever that we all agree on: you will potentially end up with the following;

Immigrants denied benefits by nation states applying muddled EU laws to compensate under estimations- Immigrants living in potentially horrible conditions for prolonged periods of time- Immigrants struggling to find jobs- a higher chance of immigrants becoming detached from the system and or pushed into black market behavior - More public skepticism of Immigrants = Less debate.

If you could plan things on the back of REAL numbers, imagine that idea, you would do the following;

Create less political tension that would mean government is not forced to wank all over EU laws by trying to write BS into them on a national level- . Guarantee a job or apprenticeship- learning course upon entry with a proper plan for citizenship- if wanted. A guaranteed place to live when you have a job. A chance to bring your family to the country with a view to integrate them in community programs- well funded things- planned by using those mysterious numbers you so solemnly protest. 

I what to do what is right for people, help them in the best way. You should be able to look after people if you invite them, it's that simple. I'm sick of it always being about how much they contribute in terms of revenue. It's a symptom, I reckon, of the issue being used as a political football by people who want to do nothing more than flex their ill thought political ideologies in public.

true,thatstevelord,null,null,"What you've posted is very much a reflection of the image that these parties like to project, an image that may have been accurate some years ago. However I would propose some alternative definitions:

**Lib Dems**: Split into two camps, one leaning more left and one leaning more right, descending from the original joining of the SDP and the Liberal Party. Doesn't have a strong whip which leads to a lot of overpromising (on the grounds that they didn't traditionally expect to get into power so it's easier to oppose) and a lot of infighting.

**Conservatives**: Split into multiple camps ranging from fairly centrist (perhaps a little right of centre) to supporting extermination of those born with deformities or disabilities. Stronger whip than the Lib Dems and worryingly close ties to big business and funding sources.

**Labour**: Formerly the party of the working class, although any interest in helping the working class disappeared with John Smith in favour of getting votes. Alternates between being under the thumb of the private sector and the unions depending on who's funding them at the time. Strong belief in developing social dependencies such as the benefits trap to secure votes (see voting in Scotland for examples). Too heavily populated with career politicians to be genuinely representative of the working class, the Blair administration was the very definition of the term Champagne Socialist.

**UKIP**: Given the breadth of the Conservative parties' views, it's unsurprising that UKIP are left of the more radical conservatives and perhaps in some ways right of the more centrist ones.

I cannot reason in any other way that the orthodox beliefs of people are creating isolation which ends up cracking and destroying what we would like to think of as a harmonic multicultural society.

This is why I think I want religion gone so bad (yes even Christianity) and things like faith schools and those tax breaks should all be done away with, i.e., freedom of religion, fine, but encouraging it? No.

Some sort of Scandinavian style secularism, hopefully resulting in people of all colours living together in a mish-mash and not divided as we tend to do now.

Just to provide another viewpoint: the HRA is viewed by many judges as merely codifying things that were in our common law anyway, even in an infant stage. Peeling away the HRA leaves that common law basis to be revived (this is Lord Hoffman's view, who also incorporates ideas of how the EU/the HRA was influenced by our common law tradition and is essentially inspired by that tradition, so doesn't provide new rights). The other main way of thinking about it is as a rights-delivery system (""bringing rights home"") so that British citizens could rely on the European level without having to actually go to a court abroad. The problem here is that the courts still don't always agree even though they are reading the same decisions and jurisprudence from Strasbourg: see the Abu Qatada controversy. To many it is an extra layer of review we don't need, especially considering cultural differences in different legal systems within European countries who are subject to the rules. Of course there are doctrines such as the margin of appreciation to facilitate the rights legislation's functioning regarding this problem, but we still end up having decisions in our courts being overturned in a way that undermines our specific administrative framework for immigrations. Case of Cart &amp; Eba in the Supreme Court outlines how well-respected the immigration tribunals are within the judiciary because of the high level of competence on that specific area within those that arbitrate the decisions - which of course, in Cart, Lady Hale knew about because she came up through the administrative courts.

Essentially what I am saying is that removing the HRA doesn't mean we can start jailing immigrants ad hoc or whatever, it just means that we don't have a supervisory level from the EU who do not always have respect for the way that immigration tribunals and the Supreme Court work, and to do with the specific societal or economic problems at the heart of such issues (application of a general immigration policy is not easy for those that have to administer such a policy, and there are already common law rules about due diligence and considering each case on its individual merits). 

The HRA is framed in very broad terms which sometimes makes it hard to apply. I doubt any replacement legislation would pass Parliamentary scrutiny without some respect for the concerns people have addressed here. It is a matter of argument as to how difficult the HRA is constitutionally for the UK, but I think I've outlined a couple of them.

Source: I'm a law student, I can point you to some readings if you want. If you really want to know, Paul Craig, Dyzenhaus, Harlow &amp; Rawlings textbook on public law would actually defend the HRA in a way that I'm not sure is necessary here considering all the comments!

Most people booed (even if a little), some sat quietly, none laughed at that part. After that joke, he recovers, and then everything in the video happens. At the end of the act everyone applauds (though he was introducing the next act)

Summer apparently comes from the Sanskrit word 'samā' meaning 'Year / Half-Year / Season'.

Winter apparently comes from the Indo-European base 'wed- , wod- , ud-' meaning 'to be wet'.

Autumn's etymology is unclear. The exactly Latin root is 'Autumnus', which might mean 'drying-up season' (which makes an interesting opposition to Winter's origin). A variant Latin spelling is 'Auctumnis' suggesting a link with Latin 'auctus' meaning 'increase', which is interesting in relation to Spring being the start of the agricultural cycle.

Spring is apparently clear, meaning spring, to rise up. Same with Fall, meaning to fall down. Like you stated.

Of our last 5 games, we're unbeaten. That's 2 home wins, and 3 away draws. In those 3 away games we doubled our away draws for the season so in the last part of the season I'm hoping we can improve on our dodgy away form. These games have also come against some tricky opponents and in all of them we have shown class in one way or another (except Blackburn, but we still played well, just couldn't finish) whereas out next 6 games are against arguably weaker opponents ( also 4 of them are at home).

Another thing to take from the previous two games is that Warnock has named an unchanged side each time, meaning he has finally found a team that can play well together and gel and hopefully improve upon a decent run (unbeaten and 3 clean sheets).

I know I might be too optimistic here, but we've done well, we coulda done better, but going into the last few games we'd have happily taking these results and this could only mean at least some confidence and form leading up to the less challenging matches that we can easily build some momentum from.

I think some austerity is necessary, some programs agreed by Labour were pointless and money-sinks. Quangos, for example, are a good place to save money. However I agree that the Conservatives are cutting too far. (Probably best to say now that I don't particularly support either party, as both have policies I am severely against). 

I think you are trying to refer to Keynesian economic theory. Well, you see, you're like the politicians here. Abusing it to suit you. Picking and choosing the parts relevant to your own beliefs.

Keynesian theory can be simplified to pretty much this:

&gt; In a ""boom"" - eg; 1997-2007, the government should be running a ""surplus"" - or making more money than it is spending. The economy will tick over nicely by itself because it is assumed that there has already been prior investment and due to the multiplier effect, the economy is just going about it's business, it doesn't need anymore investment programs. The government should just do what's necessary (provide the NHS, teaching, etc.) and not over-spend.
In a recession (2008-present) the government *should* be running a deficit. But this should be because it is investing in the economy (C+I+G+(X-M) = AD, in a recession C - consumer spending, I - investment and X - exports will normally decrease, so G - government spending, should increase to offset that), not because the taxes are too low or it's paying benefits to people who are just going to stash them away in savings, OR on interest/paying off the debts that we should not have incurred until the recession hit.

They ruined the economy by borrowing at the wrong time. There was no need to be spending so much money at a time when the economy was booming. They spent money to please voters and people fail to understand that. If they had kept the finances higher until the recession, we would've had a better deal of it.

Leith probably has the highest good-restaurants-to-people ratio out of anywhere in the UK. You haven't really gone into depth about what you want so I'm going to presume you're going all out and want a special dinner.

Three places stand out to me: the most famous is [The Kitchin](http://thekitchin.com/) owned and ran by Tom Kitchin. In my experience this is a very good restaurant with some decent staff and a chef patron who can cook excellent food despite being a complete cockbag. Second choice is [Restaurant Martin Wishart](http://www.martin-wishart.co.uk/home.aspx) which, although also slightly up its own arse, is really, really fucking special. The final top choice is a strange little restaurant a bit away from the shore called [The Plumed Horse](http://www.plumedhorse.co.uk/) which lost its Michelin star in late 2011. Why? I've no fucking idea because the best meal I've had in Edinburgh was at this restaurant.

I run a fine dining restaurant (not in Leith) and these three are all very special - if you're trying to impress a partner though, Martin Wishart's is the place. If you just want excellent food above everything else hit up the Plumed Horse.

Colleges admit students, so which College you apply to may change the entry requirements and how much weight is put on AS Levels. But from looking at the Economics website it seems that your choice of subjects is good, even without Physics.

An important point to bear in mind is that regardless of subjects you need to meet the AAA* grades to be accepted, so if you think struggling with Physics will affect the work of your other A-Levels it's best to drop it, so that you ensure you get the necessary grades.

I recommend looking at the websites of the Colleges you are interested in applying to, which will have webpages for Economics. Then if you want further advice contact the Faculty of Economics and the Admission Secretaries of the Colleges. In my position I have statistics of how many applicants/offers/places are made each year, along with percentages of what subjects successful applicants took, so you should be able to receive those stats if you ask nicely.

Levy knows that prices in January are inflated, especially for strikers, so allowing himself to have a real go at the Benteke's and Remy's after they've been relegated seems like intelligent business. Benteke is 4 years younger than Remy, making him more attractive (we wouldnt want the average team age to rise, now would we?). Maybe Levy wasnt sold on Remy (strong links with him moving to spurs over a couple of transfer windows, obviously harry was in lesbians with him) but 6 months of time at QPR with premier league proof could be enough.

I think both players have a similar chance of success/failure at spurs, and therefore don't mind either signature.

true,strolls,null,null,"Nick bet his shirt on AV.

The alternative vote would have got us more democratic governance - it's why the Lib Dem faithful (like me) have been voting for them for decades.

Nick couldn't believe that the nation would vote against a system which, even if it's not as good as proportional representation (or whatever), is not only *provably* more democratic than what we've got at the moment, but which was also recommended by [an independent commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_Commission_\(UK\)) in the most recent decade and a half of agitating for electoral reform. And because of the Jenkins Commission's recommendation, Clegg couldn't offer any other alternative electoral reform, anyway - the independent commission mandated AV as the referendum option. The only thing he could do was 

Had the AV referendum gone as Nick expected, he would have gone down in history - he would have been remembered as the most important Lib Dem for decades, it's what our grandchildren would have known him for. Perhaps he wouldn't be remembered as famously as Winnie Churchill, but still, it would have been a crowning achievement. I honestly believe that, had the AV referendum gone the other way, it would have been the event that set the British people onto a new path to political engagement and faith in their representatives.

Cameron led Nick like a lamb to the slaughter, with all his rich mates lined up [to sponsor the NOtoAV campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOtoAV#Campaign_funding).

Students and under 25s, voting for the first time, talk about how the Lib Dems let them down on tuition fees. I have a very great deal of sympathy for them. But the Lib Dems foremost policy has long been electoral reform and a more democratic representation.

I can't defend his fuck up that's left us in this situation - maybe Nick could have pushed for the referendum *and* tuition fees. Maybe he'd have won if he'd hung parliament and said ""that's all I'm asking for from a coalition, those are my two priorities"".

But it's hardly Nick's fault if the public have voted against their own interests, the first chance they've been given.

A student might feel betrayed by 4 years of tory rule, but I remember the first student protests, when they scrapped the grants. I remember the poll tax riots. You might feel betrayed over one election, but I've been waiting my whole adult life for what the British public pissed away in May 2011.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Zlatan would come to city because he wants to play in the Premier League and if Mourinho came that would make it a lot more appealing to him. He knows that Mourinho will be his best chance to win the CL before he retires. 

Robben? Robben would start, so long as he is healthy. He would fit perfectly on the right side of our team. He can run as good as anyone, and he also has amazing playmaking ability, so he can play on the counterattack or in possession equally as well (unlike Adam Johnson or Sinclair). 

Mourinho? Why go to United where he would have to coach for 30 years and he still may not eclipse SAF? Does that seem like him? What seems like him is coming to SAF's arch rival and try to beat him. SAF, I think, still has a lot of years left in him. I just don't see him at United, at all. What a story that would be. 

At City he would have all the transfer budget he wanted, great facilities, and also give him the chance to live a semi-normal life.

Look at his options. He has said that his next job will be in the Premier League. Assuming he wants a big club, you have the option of United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, and us. Arsenal and Liverpool are probably not attractive situations to him. 

Chelsea -- the last tenure there ended badly for him, with Abramovich forcing Schevchenko on him and meddling in a lot of other ways. Mourinho hates that. Here, we have a rich owner, but he's not a dictator. He prefers to delegate, unlike Abramovich. Mourinho can be confident he'll have autonomy here. And this recent merry-go-round certainly didn't help to convince him that anything has changed. 

United -- this is the conventional wisdom but like I said, he would have big shoes to fill and he's not the kind to walk in anyone's shadow. I don't see SAF retiring any time soon, either. 

So, as you eliminate the options, we become more and more attractive. And I think if there is any possibility he is available, we should at least make a hard sell to him. Or we could keep Mancini and hope we do well in the CL, even though one of his teams has never done well in the CL. Of course you remember what happened when Mourinho took over at Inter.

Stalemate for most of first half, with United having some good chances with RVP. RVP gets one in between 40-45th minute. We come out in the second half trying to go all guns blazing, they hit us on the counter, we go 2-0 down by the 60th minute. If we're lucky, we get one back by the 70th minute. 

We lose 2-1. Sorry, I'm calling it like I'm seeing it. 

I'm pretty sure there's going to be some defensive lapses, I get the genuine feeling RVP will slip through the defense with ease.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; some programs agreed by Labour were pointless and money-sinks. Quangos, for example, are a good place to save money.

Quangos run everything these days, mate - they're not just some foolish money pit, they're just a way to structure public spending.

""Quango"" might sound like a silly word, and I know they made jokes about them in *Yes, Minister*. Quangos are probably still blamed for everything by the likes of the *Daily Mail* and the *Sun*, but they'd be better termed ""Seemingly-autonomous NGO"", if that would help you understand their purpose. ""Quasi"" is just another word for ""seemingly"", but we could call them AANGO, ""apparently autonomous"" instead, if you prefer.

Yes, governments like quangos (or SANGOs or Aangos or whatever we call them) because it allows them more flexibility with how they spend money, and it makes it harder for the public and the papers to stick their noses in. Quangos are like independent companies which carry out the government's bidding. 

If there's a fuck up at the passport office or the DVLA then some member of parliament will be held responsible - some minister will have to resign. Making a body ""quasi autonomous"" means that they can be given funding and told ""go off and do this"" and they'll be expected to act independently; if there's a cock-up then the government can wash its hands of things and say ""it wasn't us"". 

However quangos are still beholden to the government because they'll be coming back at the end of the year, cap in hand for next year's funding - that's when the appropriate Department of Health, Education or Agriculture will say ""ok, show us what you've done this year, and what you plan to do next year, and we'll see how it fits with government policy and veto it"". 

The international body for ISO standards is a quango, so is the Forestry Commission. There are housing associations that are quangos, and care homes that are managed by them. I'll bet all those anti-smoking campaigns are funded as quangos (and reddit wouldn't hear criticism of that, last time I tried) - I certainly met a former-nurse last year who spent half her working hours on the board of directors for some anti-obesity and fitness quango for the NHS. 

When you say ""quangos are a waste of money"" you're effectively just saying ""public expenditure is a waste of money"". Sure, I probably disapprove of some public spending, too, but it's looking to me like there are probably more ""good"" quangos than ""bad"" ones.

The word ""quango"" is probably only ever rolled out when people want to portray something in a negative light, when something's gone wrong. We don't use the word ""quango"" when we're talking about the work of the Arts Council, the Royal Parks Agency or the Advisory Council on Libraries. When English Heritage puts out a press release, the Sunday Supplements will write about what wonderful work they're doing at Apethorpe Hall. 

The assumption of ""quangos"" is that they're doing something we disapprove of - that our hard earned taxes are spent on gay parenting lessons or on lesbian yoga. I searched [this list](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdG00RHhvbzBRdERyRU9FQzFGQUp1VWc#gid=0), and I don't find ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" or ""feminist"" represented - the nearest I can find are the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Womens' National Commission. Well, I don't suppose we know what they get up to when the lights are off, do we?

Robben is selfish and would not be nearly as critical to Man City's offense as Silva is. Nasri's under performance this season is not Mancini's fault.

I don't think I properly expressed my point, however this is incorrect. Benitez had a net spend of £78,340,000, but is still very respectable, given his six year reign. 

I love Rafa, even if he had his moments of ego which I believe hurt the club. However, what I meant by financial constraints is not solely based on transfers, but on wages, which is where the real costs lie. Rodgers has offloaded several of our highest wage earners in his first year, something Rafa was never forced to do (he did, however, have to sell to buy). 

Under Rodgers we lost Bellamy, Cole, Adam, Maxi, Kuyt, Aquilani and Carroll. I would guess that those seven players were amongst our top 12 earners on the club, and over half of them are gone. 

It is a completely different approach for the club and one that I am not certain Benitiez would be the first choice for. I get your admiration, he deserves it, but the financial system imposed by FSG would have been less than ideal for him.",0,1362900418,null,0,false,0,c8sz9uh,t3_19ywcy,t1_c8sz9uh,t1_c8stmg2,null,1431538892,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,MatthewMatic,cnty-expat,Expat East Anglian,"I wonder how much the isolation of Muslim communities has increased since 9/11. Since then we've had Islamophobes telling Muslims that they are too segregated, which just gives them an excuse not to put in the effort and try to integrate more. They've also been told that their religion is incompatible with British culture, which makes them less likely to try and understand how to bridge the gap, and more likely to be radicalized. So it seems to me that Islamophobia is causing the very problem that it is complaining about.

That's not to say that Muslims were perfect at integration before 9/11, or that radical Islam hand no power before it, but I suspect that both problems have got worse since.

Also, it's worth pointing out that Islam encourages different races of Muslims to live together and not isolate themselves. So, in a country like this where the Muslim population comes from many countries, it should result in many different races mixing together. These will need a common language, and no-one really bothers with Arabic, so this wil turn out to be English. Islam therefore actively encourages immigrants not to commune solely with their own countrymen and learn the language of their new home. So, even though it doesn't directly encourage mixing with the non-muslim population, this should greatly help in terms of integration. If you find, say, Pakistanis living only around Pakistanis and speaking Urdu, that's their own culture rather than Islam.",1,1362904254,null,0,false,0,c8szvto,t3_19zqkr,t1_c8szvto,t1_c8ss671,null,1431539146,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I'm not fearful because of the media, or from the instinctual distrust britons have of other people, I'm fearful because of the situations I have seen, heard about and experienced from close friends and family.

It worries me to think that due to overwhelming numbers of immigrant Muslims my culture could be hunted down and brutalised due to my non belief in their deity.

I don't want my GF wearing a burka, or having to live under threat of her being stoned if we aren't married and choose to have a relationship.
Nor do I want to stunt the culturally accepting nature of this country with some kind of ancient oppressive doctrine.
I hate to say it, because its potential to be offensive but its hardly a religion of peace.
Yet that's what's spouted whenever there's opposition to it.
Maybe if everybody was a Muslim it'd be peaceful, but that's not what our country stands for and I refuse absolutely to be forced into believing in something scientifically and logically flawed.

It's very rare to see Muslims in the media who aren't preaching some kind of hatred against the country that gave them a home, you cannot deny that.
That may be due to peaceful Muslims being quieter, but then that's a problem in itself, they need to speak out against the extremists to say that the Quran has been interpreted wrong, but I rarely see that.
The most I see is somebody going ""hey guys, ahhh, ok, listen, these views aren't what we all think, these guys are just dicks"". 

I don't wish them to ""fuck off back to where they came from."" but I'd be happy to say that to a muslim who arrives in the country, takes advantage of the benefit and NHS system, takes a council flat, pops out 10 kids who grow up to take the neighbourhood houses, treats his wife as a lesser human being, and preaches hatred on my culture for not believing in their fairy tale.

The worst I've heard is the idea that because there is a large community of Muslims, they put the area under sharia law and ignore the UK law.
That they can govern themselves.

It's difficult to really know how to feel, I've been raised in a family that has always promoted fairness and acceptance, but when faced with some sort of silent invasion by many who wish us a barbaric form of punishment for not thinking their way it's very difficult to see their perspective.
I feel that if our culture and country is hated so much, or is so unacceptable to them, they should go elsewhere.

true,Cawkii,null,null,"This is my personal opinion. Here's the issues that bug me...

One problem I find with Islam is the rules and the way they treat their women, and kids in some rare cases (not sure if you saw the news story about the mother who beat her son to death for not learning the Quaran.) The burka should never have been allowed into any country besides where it orginated from (Think about it, anyone could buy a burka, kill someone, and what's going to happen then? (London Police officer: ""Someone's been killed, the person was wearing a burka, get everyone you can wearing one in! Other officer: But it will take weeks to process XXXXXX people sir!""))

The other thing that bugs me is the fact that they come to the UK (which is fine with me) but they do not get along with society, but just build their own little places, which pretty much forces out all other people. It happens a lot here in Bristol. Eventually there are shops opening up purely for the Islam people. I'm sure some of them are really nice people, and I have met a few. Oh and they do drive like idiots in Bristol too.


The other thing that really bugs me about the UK is the immigration laws, we don't want terrorists (extremists) coming to the UK and we want to deport those who are straight back to where they originated from. But I see all too often stories about how someone who is to be deported say ""Oh if I get sent back to my country they (never specified who will) kill me because they think I'm blah blah blah"" And we offer them sanctuary? The one I can remember is one of the X-factor contestants a couple of years ago..



I think most people that have major problems with Islam don't educate themselves about the religion and therefore are just pure racists. I'm not sure if anyone would define me as a racist for my issues with Islam, but I'm just an 18 year old student who's got debt and shit to do..

true,Owa1n,eng-Cornwall,DPRK,"Having lived in Auckland for a time and having grown up near Liverpool I feel qualified to talk here. 

I would say that the culture and nightlife of the Liverpool is much better than Auckland, you have to bear in mind the houses will be a lot smaller than typical NZ houses and the city centre would be busier than Auckland's CBD IMO. A lot of Liverpool's outskirts would be similar in terms of crime and poverty to South Auckland. Although Liverpool is by the sea you wouldn't want to go in it and there are no beaches nearby although the [North-Wales mountains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia) and the [Lake District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District) aren't far away. Public transport will be a lot better than you are used to, there are more buses and Merseyrail is really good IMO so you don't necessarily need a car. I find that Liverpudlians are really friendly in general although they get a lot of stick from outsiders.

My favourite thing in Liverpool would probably be the art galleries, museums, restaurants and nightlife, IMO all of these are better than Auckland's although they'd just started building that new museum when I left.

Bear in mind that you will probably experience a decrease in your standard of living, I don't know how well teachers get paid in NZ but in the UK I don't believe it's brilliant, still you get the holidays though. Cities in the UK are more compact than they are in NZ there are a greater number of terraced houses.

I doubt you'd be living and teaching near the centre and the outskirts would be pretty rough places to teach I imagine so you might want to consider somewhere on the [Wirral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wirral) or places in Sefton like [Formby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formby) or [Southport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport) which would be more similar to places like Ponsonby or Remuera or somewhere like that, detached from the city but still with excellent public transport links and they have beaches. Formby nature reserve is quite good, similar to a west coast beach in Northland and with a pine forest right next to it.The town of [Ormskirk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormskirk) is also within easy reach of Liverpool and has more rural surroundings.

Everybody seems to be talking about rankings and grades. In my humble opinion, what will determine how successful you are in life is how good you are, not how good your educational establishment is. Your qualifications can only help you get a start. After that, or maybe during that,  it is up to you.

If you think that the years spent at uni might be better spent doing the groundwork in establishing yourself in whatever area you wish to pursue then I say go for it. You must be prepared to work hard but I am convinced that you can pull ahead of your uni bound peers in that time. 

Don't forget, once they finish uni they still have to find a job while you may have established a reputation for ourself, gotten yourself onto the rungs of management or even be running your own small business. 

Nobody but yourself knows what you are really capable of or how determined you are. Be honest in your assessment, be realistic in your goals and if needs be, be brave in your decisions.

A little over 100 years ago, at the end of the 19th Century, anti-Semitic persecution in Tsarist Russia (which at that time included much of modern Poland and the Baltic States) increased immensely. There were pogroms authorised at the highest levels of the state and non-Jewish villages were encouraged to turn on their Jewish neighbours. Anyone who's seen the film Fiddler on the Roof will have some idea about this.

Unsurprisingly large numbers of Jews decided to flee this persecution and started heading west. Like most poor Europeans of the time, many wanted to start a new life in the USA, and many did go there. But many also stayed in Europe and considerable numbers headed for the UK. Often being quite literally penniless peasants they tended to end up in the poorest, most run-down areas, especially the East End of London, and with their strange religion, unfamiliar language and alphabet, unusual food and unfathomable culture, caused a lot of resentment amongst the populations already living there. Sound familiar?

At the beginning of the 20th Century tensions between the communities had grown so much that there were attacks on Jewish homes and synagogues and riots in the streets. In fact the number of Russian Jews coming into the UK caused such concern that Parliament introduced the [first ever immigration law in the entire world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_Act_1905) just to restrict them.

Of course today the descendants of those foreigners who caused such concern at the time are still in the country, now fully integrated into British society and many of them have achieved great success in their lives -- just like the Catholics in America that Tolosan mentioned.

In fact the rights of the individual are well enough protected in this country that no woman, muslim or not, can be forced to wear a burka -- although she might have to make the painful choice to break with her family to do so.

So it means nothing and also does not contain any language in regards to protecting LGBT people in the commonwealth in case it causes offense to the country's involved. Its sickening because Uganda are still looking to pass a bill that would bring about a genocide of an estimated 2%ish of the population (500,000 people of the 31 million are gay according to wiki) and the main reason this and other laws exist in these types of country's is that they are left overs from the British empire.

By the way, they're both about the same age though you'd never guess by looking at them. 

Liverpool has the most fantastic cultural life. You can see orchestras, choirs, opera, ballet and theatre at a number of different venues in the city from the Philharmonic Hall, the Empire Theatre, the Everyman Theatre (my favourite - have a meal in the Bistro in the basement) or the Palace theatre, or you can see live bands, open mic comedy, dance. There are more museums than I can count. You name any kind of entertainment and you can find what you're looking for in Liverpool. 

It's a unique city and punches well above its class in terms of size. A lot of mid-size cities in the UK have become very bland and lookalike, with nothing in particular to mark them out from anywhere else. Liverpool is not like that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yer sure. In Pakistani societies in the UK young adolescent men, lads under quite high levels of stress, expected to honor their families and be able to juggle other types of social pressures - looking different - sounding different- worshiping a different god- the kind of pressures anyone would feel under those circumstances, if not nurtured in the right way can react in an insular way and rebel against society. Young Pakistani girls tend to deal with it slightly differently. 

You might say any other group of people has individuals who fall victim to this- which is true- but if the communities this happens in tend to already be very concentrated geographically- and very conservative socially- these kids end up being isolated from the inside and embittered by the outside.

That's where integration failed. Ensuring this kind of isolationist situation cannot so easily occur. Don't get me wrong, I have seen countries do it much worse. But lets not pretend there isn't a disconnect between what Pakistani Migrants got and what they deserved, they came in almost exclusively to work, In conditions I imagine one step up from Dickensian and provided tax revenues that helped us build all the institutions that we now cherish.They deserved better- lets not make the same mistakes again.

He treated Anelka and Alex poorly, banning them from the dressing room and have them train separately on their own. We had recently won the youth cup and the reserve league. We had the best youth set up in the country. I think the final straw was when the first team were short for players, he used to use members of his staff to fill in instead of calling up young players and giving them first team experience in training. One day we were walking in from training and the conditioner was training with the first team as oppose to giving a young player vital experience. That said it all really.

I've lived in Malaysia which is a muslim country and they don't seem to have the same issues. In most modern cities the women go out in their heels on Friday and come Sunday put their scarf on to visit the grand parents - not that unlike Catholicism in Ireland.

I had a malay friend out there who said she didn't like living in London as men would shout at her to put her scarf on in the street. 

Islam is a touchy subject because some people use it to hide their thinly disguised racism and other people seek to be critical of a religion which is deeply oppressive, designed to segregate patriarchal system but get lumped in with the racists. 

My opinion of Islam is that it's a disgusting religion in which British muslims are advocating female genital mutilation (source - http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jul/25/female-circumcision-children-british-law) in London and have ghetto-ised themselves from the rest of the population. 

islam is no different to the Christianity or Catholoicism however it's followers are far more orthodox than followers of other faiths.

The rest of us - those of us who know about these things, by which I mean the UN, the Constitution of the United States of America, the European Court of Human Rights and, it seems, senior members of the British judiciary - recognise that human rights are something that all humans get by default. One doesn't have to earn them, they're owed, not just to every citizen, but to every human being. Essential human rights are something that can't (rightly) be taken away.

I know jack shit about music. I think an octave is about 7 notes, and then after that the notes start again at the beginning again. I know there's an A and an E and a G in there, but that's about it. I mean, I could be wrong and you're laughing about what a wally I am, getting it wrong about something so basic. I know so little about music that I don't even know if I'm wrong or I'm right.

I wouldn't, therefore, try to tell you about music. If I wanted to talk about music composition, and hold an opinion about that subject, I'd get an education in music first. I'd read a book about it, and I recognise that I'd need lessons and stuff, too. 

There's a psychologist (D J Bem?) who has observed that people don't like talking about things they don't know about. People tend, usually, to recognise their lack of expertise in things they're unfamiliar with. But he also observed that there are certain matters - things like politics, justice, psychology and ""rights"" amongst them - to which this reticence doesn't extend. ""That's not fair, he got a bigger slice of the pie than me"" and ""I'm having to work extra hard because he's slacking off"" - these things look so convincingly like daily life that ordinary people feel qualified to talk about what's ""fair"" or ""right"".

If you had read books on political philosophy and stuff, you wouldn't need to ask me the question you did. You wouldn't posit that ""to Have Human Rights you must accept your responsibilities"" and you wouldn't ask ""if you fail to accept your responsibilities then why should you have Rights?"". If you had, you'd know the answers already. You'd know, for example, how your *responsibilities-which-earn-rights* apply to the mentally handicapped and to the insane - those would be matters fully considered and resolved within your philosophy. You'd have a pretty comfortable grasp on things like the [social contact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) and a bunch of other stuff I'm too tired to enumerate right now. 

This sort of stuff has been done to death by people far wiser and more famous than the likes of you and I.

There are 3 good points about it which you notice when you move elsewhere:

- Relatively cheap housing, for a city

- Parks. Parks everywhere. Seriously, go to google maps and look at south Liverpool. Compare the amount of greenery in Liverpool to any other city and it just doesn't compare.

- Liverpool's Chinese-ran chip shops. They're indescribable to an outsider. Other places have ""Chinese takeaways"", and they look quite similar, but there is a MASSIVE difference. If you go to Liverpool go to a chippy and get something like char sui chow mein, special fried rice or salt and pepper chicken+chips. Mmmmm.

He can't move on because he hasn't won anything.  It was a bad performance - with some poor decisions by Moyes - but I just can't see replacing him. No one available to us will be able to match him, I fear.

Every time we have a bad result there's a huge reactionary 'Fuck off Moyes'.  Then we're always just one top 4 scalp away from singing his praises again.

I could easily harbour a similar attitude towards dog owners, as I really don't like dogs very much and I absolutely detest the fact that I have to spend an inordinate amount of my time dodging dog-shit while I'm out walking.

One of the people in the office had the idea of labeling the tapes with the anagram ""Torchwood"" rather than ""Doctor Who"", as a security measure to disguise the tapes when they were delivered from Cardiff to London.

It says that the French and Spanish ""briefly laid claim"" to the Falkland Islands, but that these claims ""never superceded the British."" That's not entirely true. 


The French were the first to settle the Islands on 5 April 1764 when Antoine de Bougainville formally claimed them in the name of Louis XV. De Bougainville built a small settlement on East Falkland called Port Louis. The British arrived on West Falkland one year later, planting a small vegetable patch and sailing away. They returned in 1766 to consolidate this landing, at which point they discovered the French and the first arguments over the Islands' sovereignty began.


Spain was outraged at what it saw as a violation of its right to the sovereignty of the Falklands, a claim it based on a 1493 Papal Bull which split the New World between Spain and Portugal. They also saw the settlements as a violation of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which had guaranteed the limits of the Spanish Empire in the Americas. 


The validity of these arguments aside, the French ceded their colony to Spain in return for monetary compensation. If one were to argue that sovereignty belongs to the first occupier of the islands, the sovereignty of the Falklands - in the 1700s, at least - belonged to the Spanish. 


The video also fails to mention Britain's evacuation of the Islands in 1774. From 1774 until 1833, there was no British settlement on the Islands. The Spanish administered the Falklands out of Buenos Aires until 1811, when they evacuated, and the Argentines returned in 1820 to claim the Islands for themselves. The British did not register a formal protest at Spain's administration or Argentina's claim until the appointment of a new Argentinian Governor of the Falklands in 1829.

Actually, we haven't run a budgetary surplus so, by definition they have still spent ""all the governments money"" and our economy is far from unfucked. 

Also, remember project Merlin where the banks promised to lend more money to businesses? They actually lent less money out last year than before. The benefit to agreeing to project Merlin for banks was that new regulations would be postponed. 

So, basically, Cameron has failed to regulate investment and high street banking after they played their part in a major economic crisis.

I agree with you that in many respects it's oppressive and repressive, and I'd never want to live under a system where the laws are written to be compatible with **any** holy book. That includes Christian countries which prevent raped women from having abortions just as much as Muslim countries which force raped women to marry their rapists.

I'm also under no illusions about how strong the coercion can be. I spent several months last year providing moral and financial support to a 17-year-old British Muslim girl who was petrified her parents were about to ship her out to Pakistan for a forced marriage. She could have gone to the police but it's very, very hard for anyone to do that to their parents -- but with the help of plenty of people she was able to leave home and start a new life for herself. And again, Islam doesn't have a monopoly on being cruel to young women, look at Ireland's church-run Magdalene Laundries, or the 150,000 British children forcibly sent into near-slavery in Australia in the first half of the 20th Century.

But the point I was trying to make is that Sharia Law is not, never has been, and almost certainly never will be a thing in Britain, except in the case where there is a disagreement amongst Muslims and they choose by (hopefully mutual) consent to settle their differences using those rules. The law as made by Parliament always, *always* trumps any religious law in this country (except for a few very obscure and ancient bits of Church law, but we'll ignore that!)

I've long since got past needing to chew gum for this reason, but I still use it regularly because it helps to keep my breath fresh – if only for a short while – and I feel it helps me to concentrate on my work.

""It's going to destroy it all. I use what I call my bathroom metaphor. If two people live in an apartment, and there are two bathrooms, then both have what I call freedom of the bathroom, go to the bathroom any time you want, and stay as long as you want to for whatever you need. And this to my way is ideal. And everyone believes in the freedom of the bathroom. It should be right there in the Constitution. But if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears. It doesn't matter if someone dies. - Isaac Asimov

Book to the analogies. The crazy laws in the Book of Leviticus are well-known: amongst many other rules they say that a witch should be stoned to death, that shellfish are an abomination, and that it's a sin to work on the Sabbath.

Any truly religious Jew (and even some religious Christians) would say they must try to live their lives according to these rules, for they are also ""the infallible law of God"". But whenever the infallible law of God conflicts with the enforceable law of the Land, God loses out. Parliament won't stop you eating shellfish, it might have something to say about working on a Sunday, and it certainly won't let you get away with stoning someone to death because you believe she's a witch.

Throughout most of Europe, in recent decades we have won major battles against our native conservatives in the fight for freedom and equality for all. Most European Christians have thrown in the towel, in some countries they are still standing their ground on gay marriage but that isn't going to last very long.

Opportunities have passed him because he's trying to open up a better position for himself...... but we all know the quality of defoe and where he can score from, SO JUST SHOOT MATE! Hopefully he can find some scoring form soon. Not to mention ade, who I think has been a donkey recently. Come summer I hope Levy spends some proper P on a world class striker.

Pretty dejected after today considering I thought we were good enough for the win. But on to the next game!

Though we had some good individual performances it was that pure grit we showed over 90 min against an opponent that i thought was playing better that was the real stand out for me.

MOTM: Probably Downing. Calm finish and provided some real attacking and defensive prowess in that second half. 

Gerrard was absolutely immense after we leveled. Just bossing every ball in the air and not giving their midfield time on the ball. If we had called it at half time I would of said Coutinho. Great skill and i was really happy seeing him try so hard in defence but his positioning is far from perfect (i attribute that bale cross for the 1st goal to Coutinho's error). He can work at it though.

Suarez was clinical, Sturridge was not but he still looks dangerous and gets to the ball more often then not when it comes forward. Makes a huge difference in these games against top quality defences who would otherwise just have Suarez to worry about it.

He will ignore a pass to someone who could be through on goal, in order to heroically kick a ball against a couple of defenders, before spinning around dazed and confused about where the ball went.

I honestly think he cannot stand the fact that Bale is the big scorer on the team. He acts like he is some sort of football prince, and that the goals are his by birthright and that he isn't going to let some left-winger come goalscorer take his glory.

I'm sick of seeing him half arsed running around, missing shots, ignoring passes (he can clearly see the pass is on) and then crying like a petulant cunt when someone fails to pass to him while he was stood marked by a defender who is goal side.

If we get offers for him in the summer, they should be accepted and he should be allowed to leave.

As for Walker. It's been a long time since he has pulled a Walker and fucked up like that. I put it down to overconfidence and lack of concentration.

Some thoughts:

- Defoe. Playing the long ball over the defense to Defoe is something we need to remove from the game plan.  It doesn't work and when Defoe, in frustration, finally gets a touch...it's going to be shot, no matter what.  I can understand too to get it and want to make an impact. Defoe looks defeated and doesn't even attempt to win the long ball.  Although that touch back into the box, wtf?

- Walker.  Well, you gotta take the good with the bad and attempting to clear back to the keeper *from just inside your own half* is a bit audacious.  I think he was full of confidence and thought he could make that pass for whatever reason.  Obviously it was not the best decision.

- Loris.could have made a better touch, but frankly, he and everybody else was surprised at that ball.  Poor touch, but poor ball received.

- LOL. Well you bumped him, in the box.  It's the chance you take that late in the game with the Reds pushing HARD.  It worked against us.  

- Lennon. Was sorely missed today.  His happy feet runs would have been nice on the right side.

- Parker.  I was expecting him to whip out a Sten and go to town.  Like to see the fire in his play.

&gt;In 1765, Capt. John Byron, who was unaware the French had established Port Saint Louis on East Falkland (France landed 1764/65), explored Saunders Island around West Falkland. After discovering a natural harbour, he named the area Port Egmont and claimed the islands for Britain on the grounds of prior discovery. The next year Captain John MacBride established a permanent British settlement at Port Egmont.

There was the Falklands Crisis in 1770 between Britain and Spain. Spain believed the Islands were there's, Britain disagreed. Nothing changed.

On 20 May 1776 the British forces under the command of Royal Naval Lieutenant Clayton formally left Port Egmont, while leaving a plaque asserting Britain's continuing sovereignty over the islands.

Part of the problem lies with Argentina's independence from Spain. Prior to this, Spain claimed the Falkland Islands. Once Argentina gained independence, I can only presume that they believed that the Falklands would transfer to them, I guess primarily due to geography.

&gt;1850: Britain and Argentina sign the “Convention between Great Britain and the Argentine Confederation, for the Settlement of existing Differences and the re-establishment of Friendship”. Several historians (Argentine, British and Latin American) consider this has a negative impact upon Argentina's modern sovereignty claim.

Last time I tried this was a good few years back when 10mb was the biggest and best and the v+ HD box was new out. We had 2 v+ boxes with a normal package (no sports or movies) and 4mb Internet, was about £40-£50 per month iirc. We couldn't actually get sky (no dishes allowed) but tried that trick, we ended up paying £35 with 10mb broadband and the full works including movies on tv.

While I know other lawyers, and people from other subjects too, from other college, nearly everyone's close group of friends are in college.  But don't worry at all about the Tompkins Table, this really doesn't matter. If you don't know, I didn't before I came down, you are lectured with all the fresher lawyers in Cambridge, around 150, and lectures are every morning Monday-Friday, around two to three a day. On top of this you are supervised four times every two weeks. There is a two week cycle and you get one supervision per your four subjects every cycle. The best way this can work out seems to be two a week, although this term I've had three and one, and this seems to make my week two much more laid back. This is where colleges come in, as you are mainly supervised in groups of people from your college, normally in groups of two or three. But this doesn't mean you will be supervised in Hughes. I only have one supervision in Jesus, and go to other colleges for all my others. Supervisions are a lot of work. A lot. The best advice I can give, if you still remember this come October, is that not everything matters. You will think you need to know every case inside out, and every article on the reading lists. But its simply not possible. There are some supervisions with 60 cases and a few hundred pages of textbook reading. They are daunting, but as long as you know important cases, what the modern law is, then you can work out what matters and what doesn't in your supervision and lectures. 

Seriously, don't worry about your college. Hughes has a good rep from other students. Its a little like Jesus how it is just about in the center of things, but enough out of the way that it isn't full of tourists. 

Yeah, got one week left, and a football cuppers final to enjoy tomorrow, then back home for Easter. It really has flown by. Been brilliant though, enjoyed every minute.

Personally, I think if the matter drags on over the next decade it might be better to start looking at full independence for the Falklands. Because, in that twisted 21st century logic, it is somehow okay for a colony to vote to become independent of a former colonial power... but it isn't okay for them to vote to keep the status quo.

&gt; He studied Modern History at Oxford University.

Not sure what this has to do with Economics?

&gt;He worked as Political Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition before being elected as the Member of Parliament for Tatton, Cheshire, in June 2001. He entered Parliament as the youngest Conservative MP in the House of Commons. In May 2010 he increased his majority to 14,487.

So Political Secretary for 9 years..

Lets Look at Vince Cable then...

http://vincentcable.org.uk/en/page/about-vince-cable

&gt;Vincent Cable read Natural Science and Economics at Cambridge University, where he was President of the Union, followed by a PhD at Glasgow University.

Ok guy knows Economics..

&gt;Vince worked as Treasury Finance Officer for the Kenya Government between 1966 and 1968. After lecturing at Glasgow University in economics he worked as a first Secretary in the Diplomatic Service in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1974-1976). He was then Deputy Director of the Overseas Development Institute, which included a period working for the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, John Smith MP, as a Special Advisor. From 1983 to 1990 Vince worked as Special Advisor on Economic Affairs for the Commonwealth Secretary General, Sir Sonny Ramphal.

lot of experience in Economics and Industry...

Sure, white english people can and will be rude, but nothing compares to how shit people who are clearly first or second generation immigrants from the middle east will treat you. It is atrocious. It's not ""oh, they're so rude because they want to pray 5 times a day"" it's they're so rude full stop.

And you know what the sad thing is? You start to equate it with skin colour. Because that's recognisable. If I see someone who's middle eastern and see them with any sale items (sales are the worst for this sort of behaviour) I inwardly groan. That sucks. I don't want to look at someone and instantly think they're going to treat me badly from the way they look, but it happens so often that it's starting to become instinct. And it makes me really sad. I'm trying to force myself out of it and approach everyone as an individual, but then I keep getting slapped down again.

true,ianrush88,null,null,"funny that for such a great game 4 of the 5 goals came from either terrible defending (spurs) or mix-ups in possession (our second two).

Interesting clash of set ups too, spurs packing the central areas and holding a high line, while we defended deeper and looked to use width.

First 30-40 minutes we totally dominated in and out of possession. They kept the ball a bit but we choked them off as soon as they looked to get close to our defence, and were springing their high line constantly. Lloris made the mistake later on but without his speed off his line we would have had several one-on-ones early on. The goal was brilliant, one of our best of the season.

I think AVB worked out that Lucas was tracking Bale, so got him to drop deep, pulling Lucas with him. With only Gerrard now in central midfield we lost organisation and there was tons of room for Dembele and Siggurdson to break into, so Spurs were able to take control.

The game changed back our way with the Allen sub. Not that Joe played great on the ball but we now had a solid enough midfield to neutralise Spurs. The goal came from good team pressing and great anticipation by Downing.

I think the penalty was probably the 37th foul by Assou-Ekotto, but the first that the ref noticed.


Man of the match: Gerrard. Awesome physical true cemtral midfielder performance, when spurs outnumbered us in CM 5-2.

Lucas was great defensively too but made a lot of passing errors.  Suarez was tireless. Coutinho cut them open several times early on but did get tired.

&gt; QUESTION: (In Spanish)
Interpreter: The journalist was just asking how the U.S. intends to negotiate to get the United Kingdom to sit at the table and address the Malvinas issue.
&gt;
&gt; SECRETARY CLINTON: As to the first point, we want very much to encourage both countries to sit down. Now, we cannot make either one do so, but we think it is the right way to proceed. So we will be saying this publicly, as I have been, and we will continue to encourage exactly the kind of discussion across the table that needs to take place.
Hillary Clinton’s statements at this press conference are highly significant, as they demonstrate a clear shift in US policy from neutrality (last week’s position) towards siding with the Argentine position of pressing for negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands at the United Nations.
&gt;
&gt; The Secretary of State, a highly skilled political operator, knows exactly what she is doing here. She is giving her full support for the official stance of Buenos Aires, despite the fact that Great Britain has made it clear that the sovereignty of the Falklands is non-negotiable. She makes no reference at all to the fact that Argentina recently threatened a blockade of the Falklands, or that its close ally Venezuela has been threatening war against Britain.
&gt;
&gt; Hillary Clinton’s dire performance in Buenos Aires was not only an appalling display of appeasement towards a corrupt and authoritarian anti-American regime, which barely has the support of 20 percent of the Argentinian people. It was also an astonishing betrayal of the United Kingdom by her closest ally, and yet another slap in the face for Britain from the Obama administration.

Alexander Haig, the US Secretary of State at the time, wanted to let Argentina know about the UK plans to retake South Georgia [source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-28/haig-wanted-to-tell-argentina-u-k-s-falklands-plans.html).

Alexander Haig was basically pro-Argentina behind the scenes. Others in the US government were definitely pro-Britain and provided significant support, but they stayed neutral publicly. France also provided really significant support. I don't really think that Argentina will resort to war over the Falklands again, for one, their military is even more outdated than it was in the 80s, and the Falkland islands are so well defended now that they might as well be a citadel. 

The Falklands issue is usually brought up in Argentina when the government is fucking up and there is widespread discontent. It was the same in the 80s with the Junta and it's the same now with Kirchner. They're using it as a distraction from their economic problems. 

I really don't like the way the Heritage Foundation is clutching onto this issue in order to use it to further the narrative of Obama ""betraying"" America's allies abroad.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"&gt;Any system in which my vote can be used by a person I did not choose is not representative by definition.

This is clearly a strawman. In FPTP, your candidate will almost always be part of a larger party. They are whipped to vote in the interests of the party - these interests having been decided by the members of the party, leaders of the party, perhaps lobbyists and so on. You didn't vote for these people.

In my opinion, this is almost as bad as the ridiculous argument I've heard against AV:

&gt;I wouldn't want a second-choice candidate to get into power

(Which is clearly absurd, please don't make me start an argument about this)

In a representative system, exactly the same caveat applies. Your vote will go towards a party or a selection of parties of your choice. If they are successful, several of their candidates will act on your behalf. Depending on the exact system, there may not be someone who is directly connected to your vote - which may be a good or bad thing, depending on the issues at hand.


The difference in a representative system is that the voting more fairly reflects the opinion of the entire country. In FPTP, opposition voters in a 'safe' seat have no impact on the election and their interests can be ignored by all parties without any harm to the number of seats they win. The result is, realistically, decided by a small number of swing voters in select seats. By contrast, in a representative system, each party must try to appeal to all voters, as every vote goes directly into determining the number of MPs they get.",0,1362949514,null,0,false,0,c8t8gon,t3_1a16gn,t1_c8t8gon,t1_c8t7ylt,null,1431543253,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Yes AV would almost certainly mean the Lib dems would now lose more seats, as their share of the vote has declined signifiacntly. Unfortunately though, in the areas where they won seats they will probably retain enough of a majority to retain those seats... and thus their influence in the commons. This is because liberals tend to be clustered in communities (such as the case in Eastleigh).

Imagine you had 3 main candidates - two conservative (Tory and UKIP) and one liberal. The two conservatives both have 30% of the vote each. But the liberal has 31% (the other 9% is held by independants).  

The way FPTP works is that the candidate with more votes wins (in this case the liberal - even though 60% of people voted for right-leaning candidates). In AV the least objectionable party wins, so the likelyhood is that 60% of voters would put a right leaning candidate in 1st or 2nd place, meaning they would probably win the seat.

The irony is, for years the lib dems complained that they got 25% of the vote, but only 15% of the seats in the house of commons. In 2015 it is likely they will probably get 15% of the vote... and still hang on to 15% of the seats. The conservatives will probably poll around 35% of the vote... but may only get ~30% of the seats if their vote gets split very badly by UKIP. The swing towards labour then probably won't be enough to give them an overall majority... forcing us into a labour-lib dem coalition even though the two conservative parties (UKIP and the Torys) got the majority of the vote.

Spurs were the better team when you look at the game in it's entirety. We seemed to focus too much on cutting out Bale and ended up giving space to other ""less effective"" players. Despite that, we took advantage of two defensive lapses the same way Spurs took advantage of our two ""less dramatic"" defensive lapses. It seemed to be a throwback to the old Spurs where they shoot themselves in the foot.

I still question the two free kick decisions (that first one was a fantastic header by Gerrard) but that's no excuse for our defending of them.

The problem with joint sovereignty (even in an ideal world) is that it begins from a point of sharing responsibility for the administration of a territory. Since the Falkland Islands are essentially self governing, that only leaves two real points of administration for the ""parent country"" of the UK - Defence and Foreign Policy, it's laughable to think that Argentina could contribute to those things in any sort of positive way.

So what is there beyond that? Well, two things, the first being economical in the form of industry, business, import/export, oil/mineral exploitation etc and the second being immigration in the form of allowing Argentinian's to immigrate into the Falklands again and live alongside the Islanders peacefully which could enrich both sides.

The problem with the first is that Argentina has already shown that it won't entertain anything less than 100% of the benefits from those things and the problem with the latter is that given the chance, Argentina would simply airlift 5000 nationalists onto the islands and hold another referendum.

These impasses, coupled with the war basically make it impossible to negotiate on the basis of any sort of change in sovereignty. All that leaves is practical negotiation on issues of mutual benefit, something which again the Argentinian's aren't interested in discussing.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force

The same thing would apply now - if the US sent an aircraft carrier to retake the islands that would definitely need an AUMF. Just sailing a carrier between Argentina and the Falklands would not require an AUMF of course. But look at Hilary's comments - the US doesn't want to take a side in this. 

Incidentally it's funny how Obama simply ignored the War Powers Resolution (perhaps this is what you were referring to)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution

&gt; After the 1991 Gulf War, the use of force to obtain Iraqi compliance with United Nations resolutions, particularly through enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones, remained a war powers issue. In October 2002 Congress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Pub.L. 107–243 which authorized President George W. Bush to use force as necessary to defend the United States against Iraq and enforce relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions.
&gt;
&gt; May 20, 2011, marked the 60th day of US combat in Libya (as part of the UN resolution) but the deadline arrived without President Obama seeking specific authorization from the US Congress. President Obama, however, notified Congress that no authorization was needed, since the US leadership was transferred to NATO, and since US involvement is somewhat limited. On Friday, June 3, 2011, the US House of Representatives voted to rebuke President Obama for maintaining an American presence in the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution

So Bush followed US law and Obama just did a dubious end run around it. Funny how the anti war movement criticized Bush but it evaporated as soon as Obama was in power and so no one criticized him.

The problem we have with the Falklands is that it is clear that Obama doesn't give a shit about the special relationship. And it's not like anyone in Congress cares enough to do act on their own. No, they'd all sit on their hands. The Argies would load the islanders onto military transport aircraft (or shoot them) and since the UK has no aircraft carrier we'd just have to suck it up.

Incidentally the Reagan Administration could have smarmed its way past an AUMF too

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Iwo_Jima_(LPH-2)#Potential_role_in_1982_Falklands_War

&gt; In the July 2012 newsletter of the United States Naval Institute, which was reprinted online at the Institute's web site, it was revealed that the Reagan Administration actively offered the use of the Iwo Jima as a replacement in case either of the two British carriers, the Hermes and the Invincible, had been damaged or destroyed during the 1982 Falklands War. This top-secret contigency plan was revealed to the staff of the Naval Institute by John Lehman, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy at the time of the Falklands War, from a speech provided to the Naval Institute that Lehman made in Portsmouth, U.K., on 26 June 2012. Lehman stated that the loan of the Iwo Jima was made in response to a request from the Royal Navy, and it had the endorsement of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. The actual planning for the Iwo Jima loan-out was done by the staff of the U.S. Second Fleet under the direction of Vice Admiral James Lyons who confirmed Lehman's revelations with the Naval Institute staff. **Contigency planning envisioned American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of the Iwo Jima's systems, assisting the British in manning the U.S. helicopter carrier during the loan-out.** Naval analyst Eric Wertheim compared this arrangement to the Flying Tigers. Significantly, except for U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the U.S. Department of State was not included in the loan-out negotiations.[3] This revelation made headlines in the United Kingdom, but except for the U.S. Naval Institute, not in the United States

It isn't true. While Islamic Societies host a massively disproportionate number of the bigots who speak at British universities, most Muslim students are not members of those societies.

I tend to find that when I raise this issue with people in student government it isn't the people with the Muslim names I have to watch out for, it's middle-class posh kids who try to use accusations of Islamophobia to make themselves feel righteous.

true,cucumbermelee,null,null,"Bale is linked with Madrid. I cannot see where they'd play him and they don't actually need him. But Perez has an election to contest and he may well use that in his campaign. 

The Suarez to Munich link I think is bollocks too cos they're pretty nailed on to get Lewandowski from Dortmund. But I think that it is far more likely that Luis could be tempted to go than Bale. They are an emerging force. Lets not delude ourselves, we were lucky to get level. At 1-2, it was all Spurs and I couldn't see us getting a way back into the game. They have a great team, their only problem is that their strike force could be stronger but Bale has meant that they haven't felt that problem. Daniel Levy is a very astute business and footballing man, he has really built them up well these past few years and with AVB everyone can see they are pretty close to being able to mount a title challenge. That is why I think Bale is far more likely to stay than Suarez.

But in saying that, I can't see either leaving this summer. I think one more season from Luis minimum. As for Bale, I can't imagine him leaving until he's 26. He will do a Rooney and try to get a massive bumper deal by courting a major side but eventually will sign. But then I hope he leaves, I would love to see him playing in Spain or Germany. British players tend not to leave but he has never hid the fact that the idea is tempting to him. 

Ultimately, Bale is playing for a better team and has years on his side on Suarez and also he's a media darling to Luis' pantomime villain. I think Suarez does love that but he would be far more appreciated in Spain. I can't imagine him staying if Real or Barca came knocking. I hope to god we get at least one more season. We seem to be coming on so well as a team, obviously Luis can see that just as much as we can.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"I think the word representative refers to the idea that the number of seats allocated to each party is much more closely linked to the number of people who voted for them. As a result, the proportions of seats are 'representative' of the proportions of votes. 

There are certainly problems with 'representative' systems - how do you fairly represent poorer regions, or regions from which there are fewer politicians, for example? 

However, I think it is somewhat disingenuous to claim that FPTP solves all of these problems. Your candidate represents 70,000 or so people, not just you. He or she will likely hold lots of views that you do not hold. If you do vote for an anti-war candidate, then you might well be voting just because they 'share one [...] affiliation'. It is certainly not irrelevant that all candidates have a number of affiliations.

It also seems unfair to suggest politicians elected in a representative system are 'stealing' your vote so that they can push their own policies. In a FPTP system that still happens. 

Say, for example, someone in Devon Central or somewhere voted Conservative because they hold mildly centre-right views. They helped the Conservatives gain a majority in parliament, and indirectly they also helped insane people like Nadine Dorries into power. That is - they have helped people who do *not* share their views into power. Exactly the same. It is just the nature of a representative system.

The only systems I can see where this wouldn't happen would either be:

* Everything is subject to popular referendum
* Political parties are banned, all politicians are independent

&gt;Then it's not fucking representative. Stop using that word.

I am happy to use the word 'representative' because it is commonly used to refer to these types of systems. I think maybe 'proportional' is a better choice. 

In something of an ironic twist, 'first past the post' is also a terrible name. It's more like 'the one who has the most votes when they're all counted'. FPTP would actually describe AV better than it does FPTP - as in AV you keep counting rounds of votes until one candidate passes the 50% 'post'.

It's our midfields job to defend and break up that momentum, but neither Lampard nor Ramires are really great at that. When that happens the only way to counter it is to have one or two of our attacking midfielders come back and defend, otherwise they just over power our defense. We saw all three of our attacking mids doing this in the first half as damage control, but the problem is, with them all pulled back, it leaves the striker up front, alone. This was only when we had someone strong like Drogba up front, as he could hold off defenders while everyone else moves up the pitch, but neither Ba or Torres can do that effectively.

Bringing on Mikel gives us a stronger defense and midfield, meaning the CAMs don't have to track back as much. Instead of 2 or 3 of them defending, it can be 1 or even none, which in turn puts more men up front, which means we can hold onto attacking possession better.

Anyway, I'll just shit out what I was about to write in that thread here:

There's two different viewpoints here. I work in IT as a desk jockey and often get to work with educated Muslims and see the moderate, likeable side of Islam; guys who don't drink, they believe in education and have strong family values but pray all the time and have wacky dualist beliefs similar to those oddball Christians. I'd guess that my experience is similar to that of a lot of Reddit, which is why your comments get so heavily moderated.

As you said though, you're working class and from a rough Northern town with a large Muslim immigrant population. I've seen this shit too, incompatible cultures have led to an us-vs-them mentality, we ended up with permanent segregation of the native and immigrant communities and hostilities between them. The root of the problem is that they think we're drunken, blasphemous atheists to which nothing is sacred, and we think they're uptight slimeballs who will believe anything said by a man with a beard. They think our women are gobshite slags because they wear fuck all and go out without a chaperone, we think their men are sexually immature misogynistic slimeballs.

I don't know the solution to this problem, but I'm pretty sure it's not hatred and segregation. We need to get the good bits of their culture and the good bits of ours and merge them together, throw out the bad and form the culture of tomorrow.

**Britain did not expel the Argentine population from the Falklands in 1833. In fact, Britain did its best to persuade genuine residents to stay**

The British were ordered to remove any foreign force from the islands, but were commanded to allow inhabitants to remain.

The British expelled a 26-man Argentine garrison that had been on the islands for less than 3 months. The British ambassador in Buenos Aires made an official diplomatic protest to Argentina when he heard of their departure for the Falklands. These gentlemen ended up murdering their own commanding officer, plundering the settlements and terrorising the civilian population.

1) That Spain made an express reservation of its sovereignty in the treaty of 22 January 1771 which ended the crisis caused by Spain’s peacetime attack on the British establishment at Port Egmont in 1770; 

**Spain did not make an express reservation of its sovereignty in the treaty of 22 January 1771 which ended the crisis caused by Spain’s peacetime attack on Port Egmont in 1770. Both Britain and Spain reserved their sovereignty in that treaty.**
 
2) That Argentina put a governor in the Falklands in 1823; 

**Argentina did not put a governor in the Falklands 
in 1823.**

3) That Britain expelled the Argentine population from the 
Falklands in 1833;

**Britain did not expel the Argentine population from the Falklands in 1833. In fact Britain did its best to persuade genuine residents to stay.**

4) That the Argentine inhabitants resisted the British “invaders”;

**Spanish-speaking British colonel, Belford Hinton Wilson, who had played a notable part in the South American independence movement wrote after visiting the islands*

*These Gauchos would cheerfully remain on the Island under any Englishman whom the Government may please to appoint…*

5) That Britain replaced the Argentine inhabitants with 
British subjects;

**This is false. Britain did not replace the Argentine inhabitants with British subjects.**

6) That there has been no international agreement to confirm Britain’s possession of the Falklands;

**There has been an international agreement to confirm Britain’s possession of the Falklands.**

7) That Argentina has never accepted Britain’s possession 
of the Falklands; 

**Argentina did accept Britain’s possession of the 
Falklands. After the Convention of Settlement, several Argentine  presidents and vice-presidents made official statements that confirmed that there was no dispute with Britain over the Falklands.**
 
8) That Argentina has never ceased to protest at Britain’s 
possession of the Falklands; (6) 

**Argentina did cease to protest at Britain’s possession of the Falklands.**

**Argentina protested every year without exception for 17 years from 1833 to 1849 against the possession of the Falklands by Britain.**

**The last protest was on 27 December 1849; after the ratification of the Convention of Settlement on 15 May 1850 there were no more protests for 38 years till 1888, and for over a third of a century (1850 to 1884) Argentina did not even mention the Falklands to Britain at all, let alone make a protest.**
 
9) That Argentina’s claim is imprescriptible, i.e. eternal unless freely given up;

**Argentina’s claim is not imprescriptible**

10) That the present Falkland Islanders are a temporary 
population;

**The present Falkland Islanders are not a “temporary population”. The Falkland Islanders are the oldest community in the world so far south (apart from a few Patagonian Indians)**

11) That Britain’s possession of the Falklands violates the 
territorial integrity of Argentina;

**Britain’s possession of the Falklands does not violate the territorial integrity of Argentina. Britain is not “disrupting” or “violating” 
Argentine territory.**

12) That Britain seized South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands by force from Argentina.

**Britain did not seize South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands by force from Argentina.**

I did about 4 months at the cancer research store in my town.

Last time I was in a review they made me phone a company about ""puppy walking"" for guide dogs witch turned out to be actually adopting a dog for a year.. Not possible in a second floor flat with a cat! That pretty much sums up our interview , nothing else come out of it.

The worst part is when I do sign on now days as I am on the work program they do not even read my book. They check it and make sure something is actually written in there but thats about it. They do not search for jobs for me and our job center is actually seperated into two parts. Recently they decided to send all the work program people (I.E the ones out of work for the longest) to there second building that do not even have job points.

Honestly it is like they do not care about the work program people or they just write them off and send them on these stupid courses.

Perhaps Defoe did some stupid things today (especially his terrible touch that basically lead to a penalty).  But hes been back for 3 games since his injury.  Ive watched every game since our draw vs Man U.  I will say that while he can be detrimental, its more often that he actually leads to chances. 

Im sorry but Adebayor is more of a detriment than defoe...hands down.  Ade has a great header...thats all ive seen him do. (and even that is questionable considering ive seen him head the ball straight at the keeper from point blank range)  I think Defoe has creates chances more often than not since ive seen him play.  For example, Siggurdson doesnt score against Inter without Defoe's well placed shot.  

He has an ability to keep defenders at bay with pretty good control and he has a pretty good shot.

Fair enough. Unless, you know, you want infrastructure to run your car on.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;What she doesn't say is as much a comment on politics as what she does say

No, not at all. That's the point of not being political. Should we take the fact that Justin Bieber hasn't spoken out against austerity measures in the Eurozone to mean he agrees with them? Clearly not, we assume he doesn't care. In the same way the fact that the Queen doesn't comment **because she is not supposed to comment** means he is trying not to be political. You reading far too much into it because of your prejudice about what your mind thinks she might be up to. In the same vein, 'my government' is official language, it means nothing, the speech is written by the PM. He is literally writing 'my government' for her to say, I mean how transparently meaningless do you need her language to be before you tone down the conspiracy?

&gt;invokes Jesus every Christmas

Yeah because the birth of Jesus and a huge nominally religious festival is such an odd time for a very religious person to bring up the God-squad shit! 

That authoritarian feeling you get when you hear 'to serve not to be served', that's just religion. It's inherently arrogant and masochistic. Millions of people sing that hymn every year, some rich, some poor and none of them extrapolating some authoritarian political message. It's a cultural reference not a political statement. Her reference is boringly standard for any mildly religious person at Christmas. 

&gt;What right has she to rule over man...originally acquired through violence?

Basic constitutional scholarship point here, she reigns, she doesn't rule. Ruling implies power of which she has none (although I bet you'll tell me she's secretly controlling all our lives behind closed doors with a magic sceptre or something, that's normally how these conversations end; 'I have no evidence but listen to my baseless assertion on what I think is probably the case').

Secondly, your conflating her with monarchs of the past. Those monarchs justified themselves by divine right and retained land by violence. Fortunately, that is no longer the case (we forced one to sign Magna Carta and beheaded another) but persecuting their descendants who live in an entirely different age with laws constraining them because you think that if they're related they must be threat is shit-tier logic of the worst kind. The only reason she in the job is the fact that she was born into the royal family, no other reason. I doubt she considers herself to have any right to reign as that would imply parliament was not able to abolish the monarchy which would violate the fundamental constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Judges and politicians certainly do not think she has any such right and if you studied the law you would understand that she in fact does not have such a right. 

She's there because the people don't want her gone yet mainly because they haven't quite reached your level of confirmation bias, to paraphrase XKCD. Your certainty that the Queen is evil or somehow controlling everything is completely uncorrelated with the amount of evidence. You've 'cut context away from facts and arguments and assemble[d] them into reassuring litanies.' Stop basing your opinion on what could be happening and base them on what is happening.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"Adebayor is not detrimental. He isn't exactly a shining asset for the team at the moment, but he can contribute meaningfully. Adebayor is capable of holding the ball up, he can outmuscle defenders and wait for support, he can also pick a pass when he has to.

Defoe is unable to perform hold up play. It's not his fault, he is a small striker and a light breeze can blow him off the ball. He also has the ability to pick a pass, considering his previous shooting accuracy that should be apparent. However he chooses not to play the passes and instead prefers to dawdle on the ball and loses it, or boot it at an advancing defender.

Siggurdson may not have scored without Defoe's shot in the Milan game, but he should have done. If you removed Defoe from the situation and everything else played out the same. Siggy arrives right on cue to blast the ball into the net.

He does have a pretty good shot, but it's been woefully inaccurate unless you count hitting other players. He cannot keep defenders at bay at all though, but again there is little he can do about this.

The thing I find weird is, as a new supporter Defoe should theoretically look more useless to you than anyone else. As a long term spurs fan, I remember a Defoe who could make a goal from nothing, and could pick a gap between 4 players and a keeper and find it perfectly. He could outrun defences and was utterly deadly and ready to pounce on any loose ball.

In reality the problem is Defoe has always been defined by his marksman like qualities when shooting, and I don't think even he can see past this. He is frequently in the right position with the right spaces to play incredible balls for other players but chooses not to.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm wondering what your understanding of politics is, if you think it is restricted to words like ""I should"" or the utterances of elected proxies that would be naive. The established definition of politics is the mechanism of governance and the established wider definition is the science of power over people. Let's put aside the well documented ""conspiracy"" [of her family's explicit meddling in politics](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jan/14/secret-papers-royals-veto-bills), and prove that one can be political without commenting.

In the workplace you see a colleague being bullied repeatedly, everyone knows you know, but you say and do nothing, you just don't react at all. The implications of that is that you don't care for the victim and you don't care that there is aggressor, so you have weakened one and potentially strengthen the other. You have through inaction created a social standard.

You seem to be confusing ""being political"" with ""expressing an opinion publicly"", that's just incorrect, and basic honesty.

&gt; In the same vein, 'my government' is official language, it means nothing, the speech is written by the PM. 

You've contradicted yourself: first you said that ""those words are not chosen lightly"", now you are saying they mean nothing. You chose to have them be important to prove your point, but now you are having them be unimportant to disprove my point. Which is it?

&gt; Yeah because the birth of Jesus and a huge nominally religious festival is such an odd time for a very religious person to bring up the God-squad shit!

Because she isn't invoking Muhammed or Jewishness she is emboldening the power of Christianity, that has undeniable political currency. Don't you think it is a bit offensive that one of the richest families in the world who will have dozens of servants is telling the poor people that they are here to ""serve not be served""?

&gt; It's inherently arrogant and masochistic.

Are you saying the queen is inherently arrogant and masochistic because she subscribes to a religion that is inherently arrogant and masochistic? She either believes in the what she says or she is a lying deceitful con-artist. Which is it?

&gt; Should we take the fact that Justin Bieber hasn't spoken out against austerity measures in the Eurozone to mean he agrees with them?

You are presenting a false equivalency. Justin Bieber isn't the Queen, and only one of those thinks her family is special enough to be preserved for all time, but yes, there is such a thing as consciously political and unconsciously political. He has the choice of singing about poverty but he doesn't care.

&gt; Your certainty that the Queen is evil or somehow controlling everything is completely uncorrelated with the amount of evidence. You've 'cut context away from facts and arguments and assemble[d] them into reassuring litanies.' Stop basing your opinion on what could be happening and base them on what is happening.

Was that my argument? I never said evil nor that she controlled everything, you are being dishonest or incompetent. I'll be explicit: **the queen is not a neutral player**. Can you understand that? Please explain how the following do not grant power above a commoner:

* The power to not pay inheritance tax.
* The power to not pay proper income tax.
* The power of being the head of the military.
* The power to now all state secrets and create new ones.
* The power to actually appoint various positions in government including the Lord's, like **~26 Church of England Bishops.**
* The power for her company to have various monopoly rights across Britain and the Common Wealth.
* The power to use the Royal pe
* The power to declare war.
* The power to speak with the Prime Minister every week.
* The power ""the Sovereign has, under a constitutional monarchy [of] three rights—the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn."" (Basic constitutional scholarship will tell you where that is from.)
* The power to have amassed so much land and wealth through previous violence, yet not be called out on the immorality especially in a time of austerity. I have to presume she thinks that is her right, after all she could be housing the homeless in one of her hundreds or thousands of rooms.
* This is not a complete list.

Let's run through the implications of what you said though. Your claims:

1. She is powerless.
* What she says is meaningless or a lie.
* She exists in office.

And implications:

1. If she is powerless then what she says doesn't matter.
* If she is a known liar* then what she says cannot be trusted.
* Because she doesn't matter or cannot be trusted her role as head of state is a tax on the efficiencies of government. Why waste time every week with pointless activity?
* If she is impotent, meaningless, unimportant, and potentially deceitful, uncaring, apathetic to poverty, or ignorant to poverty, then doesn't she make a terrible head of state and therefore can be removed?",0,1362980512,null,0,1363019247,0,c8thdyy,t3_1a0nqy,t1_c8thdyy,t1_c8tfj8v,null,1431547754,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Verochio,null,null,"Find another bank. NatWest are not showing you any loyalty, so why are you showing them some? Walk along your local high street, walk into some bank branches, and try your luck, see what they offer. Alternatively, try one of the online banks. But, I fear, you will struggle to find anyone to give you a free bank account with full services given your temporary immigration status.

Also, check if there are any banks from your home country that have “ex-pat” offshore accounts denominated in GBP. Many British banks offer this service abroad for UK ex-pats. 

To give a bit of background on why this has happened: generally speaking many banks are unwilling to take credit risk on people who – as a category – are able to leave the county, leaving their debts behind them (unless I misunderstand your visa this applies to you?). Even providing an unauthorised overdraft service (i.e. paying rather than bouncing a Direct Debit when you don’t have enough cash in your account) to people here on temporary visas is a gamble for banks, and they are increasingly being told to stay away from “casino banking”. With quantitative easing, and other government schemes, banks are currently flushed with cash – even if not profits – so there is no incentive for them to take risks trying to attract deposits. This is the main reason why savings rates are so low compared to a few years ago.

Bear in mind that banking is not a public service. Being able to pay for things using a piece of plastic in your pocket, or being able to withdraw cash from a network of cash machines throughout the country or  automatically pay your bills via direct debits are all services with a cost that are provided by a company trying to make a profit from offering these services. It is not just about “holding your money”. In most countries of the world everyone pays for their banking. In the UK the general consensus over the last few decades has been that we can bank for free, but that in return we don’t expect particularly high interest rates on our in-credit balances. As you’re here on a student visa, the bank doesn’t expect you to have huge in credit balances, in fact likely the opposite with most students. 

Generally speaking, giving bank accounts to students costs banks a LOT of money in the short term. The reason they do so is they know that banking is a very “sticky” product. Most people will stay with the bank they had as a student for the rest of their lives and for most of their financial products. As far as your visa is concerned, you are only here temporarily, so it just isn't worth investing all those losses in you in the short term. Banks are under no obligation to accept you as a customer, and have absolutely no desire to show you any loyalty if they consider you in a risky category.

My wife's disabled, we were on the council waiting list for a disabled friendly house for just over four years despite being in the high-need group.  One of our daughters moved out last year leaving us with a spare room so we'll need to find an extra £60 a month come April.  

I've no problem moving to a smaller house, the problem is there aren't any vacant that meet my wife's needs (downstairs shower/bath/toilet and downstairs bedroom).  So we've got to find £15 a week from a budget so tight that we've not had heating for several weeks this winter.  Even if we had the spare £1000 to meet the deposit+first months rent - which we don't, so would need to take a loan to cover it - for a private let, it likely wouldn't be suitable and a three bedroom private let would cost almost exactly the same as a four bed social let saving the government nothing.

So my choices are; stay here and try and find the extra money from somewhere whilst waiting for another social let that's suitable, or move to an unsuitable private let whilst having to take out a loan to to cover the deposit and moving expenses that will likely cost that same as what I'm losing from my housing benefit.  Or in other words no choice at all.
