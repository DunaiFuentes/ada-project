&gt; Q. It seems as if women complain about feeling cold more than men do. Is there a gender disparity when it comes to temperature’s effects?

&gt;A. Women do tend to feel colder in air-conditioned offices — **for reasons of physiology and fashion, said Alan Hedge, an ergonomics professor at Cornell University**.

&gt;The muscles of the body generate about a third of its heat, he explained, and women tend to have less muscle mass than men. In addition, women are often freer to wear clothing that leaves their arms, legs and the neck area exposed. (The ankles, he said, are particularly vulnerable to cold.)

&gt;Traditionally, women in offices have held more sedentary positions than men, he added, and the less you move around, the less heat you generate.

http://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/health+healing/news+features/why+women+feel+the+cold+more+than+men,13259

&gt; According to many researchers, women feel the cold more than males, but their bodies are better at conserving heat when the weather turns colder. They are able to do this by shutting off blood flow to the skin and extremities to maintain their core temperature at 37 degrees. 

Hence woman *feel* colder more often.  

It's a common thing in offices that woman tend to want the temperature a bit higher than most men.  Often some of these woman are dressed inappropriately for the temperature.  This can cause people dressed in suits to feel uncomfortable as those people demand the temperature is increased.

For that reason UKIP will always attract a degree of racists towards them.

Personally my opinion on the immigration conversation is that both sides largely argue based on anecdotal evidence (like this one) rather than any large studies, have differing end points depending on the side they're on and one side misinterprets the other sides arguments (similarly to what we say about UKIP - suggestions to stop immigration tend to be the sorts of things that racist people would also say).",0,1358426157,null,0,false,0,c7yipe6,t3_16qukw,t1_c7yipe6,t1_c7yifp3,null,1430990968,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The difference however is that these (two - possibly more) young men arent having a drunk scrap with their mates that will be forgotten the next day, or 'that time when you headbutted me because i said i'd wollop your mum everywhere like Tyson fighting a child'. 

They are going around the streets trying to implement Sharia law. Since being children, they'll have received a parallel education in the mosque. This is an efficient system of indoctrination when it leads to situations such as this.

 Other members of mosque may feel as if they are obliged to join these young men, then the extremist mentality can spread more easily as it grows larger. A couple of influential preachers may be behind this, providing a notion of 'western culture is wrong', 'not so great britain', it doesnt take a lot more to then push this to 'kill the none-believers, as the koran says to'.

I can understand the causes of this being down to the paralleled education as i mentioned before and culture of the communities that have a lot of muslims in them. 

Islam is becoming a hell of a lot more common in the UK. Picking up these lads for disturbing the peace, questioning them in the effort to find who exactly is influencing them could save lives.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Thorntons always used to market themselves as a luxury brand. 

The whole point of a chocolate shop separate to a supermarket is a small luxury treat - something you might get as a treat for yourself because you've been on your feet all day - so this makes some sense.

Problem is, it was never luxury chocolate - it was cheap stuff in luxury packaging.

Which is all very well, until Sainsbury's and Tesco's start to get own-brand stuff in that really is good and companies like Hotel Chocolat open more stores on the high street. Suddenly, Thorntons' stores start to look somewhat dated and paying £4 for a small bag of poor-quality chocolates doesn't look like a very good deal. Especially not when you can pay £4 in Hotel Chocolat and - yeah, you might not get as much, but the store positively oozes class and the chocolate is a lot better. 

It gets better: Thorntons is a franchise. So many of the stores are - at least nominally - somewhat independent. Yes, there's a contract they have to follow in order to keep the franchise, but there's always a certain amount of negotiation. If Head Office demand their franchisees all pay an arm and a leg for the store to be rebranded, there's no reason the franchisee can't turn around and say ""You know what? This isn't working. Have your franchise back"" - and suddenly 500 stores selling Thorntons chocolate nationwide become 450 stores.

This means Thorntons can't simply issue an edict from Head Office and rebrand every store in the space of six months.",0,1358426882,null,0,false,0,c7yit01,t3_16p9k5,t1_c7yit01,t1_c7ybdam,null,1430991014,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,lucasfuturecaptn,lfc12,,"'World class' is a term which is banded around so frequently in football discussion that it's meaning has become increasingly obfuscated.  I'm sure you will get at least ten variations of definition in this thread but i'll add my own.

A world class player is somebody who could play in the first team for almost any team in the world.  I say 'almost' because it would be hard to cram any more stars into the Real or Barca sides unless they were truly in the top two or three players in the world.

Your view of 'world class', to me, is a flair player and I think this expectation is resonant in the UK and US where we tend to appreciate 40-yard balls and 20-yard volleys over composure and neat skill a lot more.

If you asked an Italian what world class is, he'd probably say Pirlo now.  Which is fair enough.  But asked a few years ago he'd almost certainly have said Cannavaro, or Maldini.

Similarly, in Spain, you might hear Iker Casillas.

I don't think a player has to be in the top 3 Ballon D'Or nominees to be 'world class' - although that almost certainly means he is.  I agree with you that you need players willing to graft and do the dirty work so that flair players can flourish.  In that regard, for me, Lucas is world class.",0,1358427620,null,0,false,0,c7yiwyo,t3_16qy2t,t1_c7yiwyo,t3_16qy2t,null,1430991065,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

It goes on your predicted marks, and if they are high enough you can be offered a conditional place (on the condition you get the required marks) unless you have already got your results, then you can be offered an unconditional place. 

You have to write a personal statement that goes to the unis, normally you talk about your love for the subject and things like that. There are lots of examples online. This is the time consuming part, but its not difficult really. Some unis require an interview but not many do, it's normally only Oxford and Cambridge or if you're doing medicine iirc. 

You normally apply to 5 courses unless your applying to Oxford or Cambridge, when you have fewer application spaces, but as you didn't say you are then you should be able to apply for five. You can choose different unis or different courses within the same uni or a mix of both. Then they tell you if you've been accepted, and you choose a firm and an insurance uni, usually the insurance has lower acceptance marks so if you don't get what you expected and so can't go to your first choice you still have a uni to go to. Then if you fail both you can go through clearing which offers spare places to people on the day that the results are out.

You need to look at what the entry requirements are for your course and what their US equivalent is. [This](http://www.studyacrossthepond.com/am-i-qualified-for-uk-study.asp) might help.

The UCAS website is pretty self-explanatory. If you're only interested in going to Sheffield you can just apply to one place, or you can have up to 5 choices if you just want to study in England in general. 

You will need to tell them some personal details, contact details etc, and which university courses you want to apply for. You will also need to enter your qualifications or predicted grades. Your personal statement is you selling yourself to the university - why do you want to do that course, what personal attributes do you have which would make you the ideal candidate etc. They will also be looking for extra curricular stuff so if you don't do anything extra curricular now is the time to start, don't put things like ""I intend to volunteer at the puppy rescue centre"" because they will see right through that bullshit. Just do the stuff first so you can then write about it. 

I don't know what course you are doing but there are lots of sample personal statements which are subject specific online. If you can't find one let me know and I will find one for you.

In your personal statement, avoid starting it like this ""I have been deeply passionate about [subject] from a young age"" - I must see this at least 400 times during the UCAS application period.

The BBC news (the flagship of the entire news department) is not based around what is cheap to produce - it is based around what it considers news worthy by the editors. Newsnight often has deeper stories that compare the facts and reality as presented, and radio 4 regularly delves into the details too. Its just not a dedicated entity - and ultimately it has to be seen to keep news accessible to the population at large. I seriously doubt that the average BBC journalist or editor is in fear of government interference - despite how much it is played up. 

Journalism is not dead - but it is under a huge amount of financial pressure because people are less &amp; less willing to pay for news. 

&gt; Essentially news media is dead because news media forgot what it's function was

A pithy sentence that has no substance - news organisations spend ALL of their time trying to meet the demands of the world in 2013. It admittedly is a huge problem to do it - and has often amounted to examples of poor journalism. 

&gt; It turned into a glorified news-feed that adds almost no actual ""value"" over its sources, and then it bitches that nobody uses it any more because they can go straight to the real source.

This is a great example of the bind that news organisations are in. The *real* source of news is... witnesses? inside info?

When Moussa was down we looked frustrated and slow moving the ball forward, we just didn't have anyone who had any creativity, bringing in Holtby gives us some coverage in this role.

As for covering for Sandro in truth, i see it as PArker and no one else.  I like Jake but i don't think he is ready to be the muscle for us during any type of stretch.  In a way Jake reminds me a bit of Sandro 2 years ago in that 2 years ago we could see that Sandro was talented but really any time he was on the field you could more or less figure you would get little to no offesnsive contribution and expect at least 1 ""What the hell was that?"" challenge (which seemed to result in a card) over the past 2 years those challenges have become cleaner and we seem to get 1 ""damn, he's good"" offensive moment from Sandro be it a quick pass or a 360 dribble in a crowd.  Jake is at the early stage of where Sandro was 2 years ago, he is big and tough and prone to head scratching challenges and doesn't offer much in terms of moving us up the field, i really think he would benefit more from being on loan and playing regularly. 

Hudd, i like Hudd....but he isn't the answer to covering for Sandro or Parker, he doesn't have the defensive instincts and he seems slower.  He just doesn't seem to fit with the team around him so far this season, it seems like we keep trying to wedge him into a DM role that he isn't comfortable playing and it works as a detriment to us.

I think an actual realistic ideal for us would be to bring in Holtby now as coverage for Moussa and assuming that Sandro is out for awhile sending out Hudd and Jake and bringing in someone like Moussa Sissoko as a cheap cover to Parker with a solid amount of upside down the line.",0,1358433483,null,0,false,0,c7yk0q1,t3_16q0sa,t1_c7yk0q1,t3_16q0sa,null,1430991587,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

The initial and midnight airing is uncut. For rebroadcasting, the show is edited by a few minutes to allow for commercial breaks. If you do happen to miss the most recent episode, BBC America almost always shows the last week's episode before the premiere of the new one. 

There are also marathons for holidays, or for when the new season starts. In that case, they'll show the whole of last season leading up to the new season premiere, but instead of the finale before the new episode, they'll have a special of some sort.

&gt;Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 only applies in England and Wales.
This Act provides means whereby intentional harassment, alarm or distress is a criminal offence. This makes all forms of harassment illegal,[citation needed] punishable on conviction by a six month jail term or a £5,000 fine. It is necessary to prove that the harasser's actions were intentional, and that someone was actually harmed by their actions.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment_in_the_United_Kingdom

&gt;The offence is created by section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, which was inserted by section 154 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994:

&gt;(1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress, he: 
(a) uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or
(b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting
thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress.
(2) An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place, except that no offence is committed where the words or behaviour are used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation is displayed, by a person inside a dwelling and the person who is harassed, alarmed or distressed is also inside that or another dwelling.
(3) It is a defence for the accused to prove: 
(a) that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed, would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or
(b) that his conduct was reasonable.
[edit] Mode of trial and sentenceThis is a summary offence. It is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both.[1]

Things like taxing as much as possible whilst returning it in the form of tax credits. Generally making a mockery of our foreign policy. IT fiascos, data losses.

I disagree with this, it was a limp criticism then and i don't think it is validated by an 'increased expansiveness' now. When JM had Robben and Duff we played some fantastic stuff with that 433, frequently putting teams away 3-0 and 4-0. We were quite tactical and didn't always chase 'hockey scores' as JM said, but it was mostly a few cagey set ups against liverpool in the CL and some 1-0's (again largely after CL games) that gave us the 'dull' or 'boring' title that was sardonically chanted then and still is.

I'm not saying I begrudge the opinion because he certainly isn't always cavalier, but when he has had the players to do so at Chelsea, Inter, and RM he has mostly played a quite attacking game... albeit with some considered tactical adjustments when he feels it is warranted. Personally I crave that kind of balance and hope it returns.

That said I also wouldn't have a problem with Steve Clarke, I think he's certainly paid his dues and was probably a bit unlucky not to get a shot at interim back when JM left.

Is there really a problem with any of this?  No.

If you consider a dive as *anytime a player doesn't do everything physically possible to remain on their feet* then I think you have to be willing to admit that **every person to play the game has dived before.**

Everyone at one time or another has gone down easy, embellished a bump, maybe even went to ground without contact whatsoever.  Some people do it to gain an advantage.  Some people do it to avoid getting hurt.  Some people just trip and fall over.  But the fact is, everyone dives.

The fact that Suarez admits he will do almost anything to win should not be news.  He has always been this player.  In fact, there are a lot more players out there like this, they just don't say these things to the media.



For anyone who missed it, this is always my go to reference on diving: [Gary Neville on Sky Sports](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNx5ok60U6A).

Edit: For those who don't remember, [here is the incident from October](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwAtPfdp0Fc).  In this slowed down replay it does look like the Stoke defender clips Suarez' foot.  Is it enough to knock him over?  Absolutely not.  Does Suarez proceed to embellish the hell out of it?  Of course.  I think most people would consider this a dive.  However, the fact that Suarez is admitting to something for which there is clear video evidence should not be big news. 

Double Edit: When I take a step back I am a little blown away at how a player being honest about his game is such big news.  I think it would be different if he was admitting to throwing matches or betting on the game, but he is admitting to doing something that everyone has done at least once in their career.",0,1358436580,null,0,1358437073,0,c7ykt9h,t3_16r49q,t1_c7ykt9h,t3_16r49q,null,1430991959,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

I find it interesting you say that about being one of the best in their position.  As good as Suarez is, there are a lot of players considered 'world class' in that position.  So is he one of the best?  Maybe, in the top 10 certainly.  Similarly with Gerrard.

Whilst obviously not a definitive list, and it's based on a very quick and dirty approximation, I can count 11 forwards and 6 midfielders (primarily attacking midfielders) in the 23 Ballon D'Or candidates.

When in the Roman era have we had a long-term manager? Never. So why would that change now? Let's embrace a manager who can be effective now and who can prove themselves to be a long-term fit.

I think Mou would be perfect right now. We need someone who can motivate our players to perform week in and week out and also someone who can organize us to keep a lead, which Mou is both very good at.

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but perhaps you don't understand what legal tender is exactly and when the term is applicable. It is for paying a debt. When you buy something in a shop, nearly every time no debt is created. You swap money for goods. Legal tender doesn't enter the equation here. You can't demand to buy something in any denomination of currency if the shop chooses not to sell to you. In the same way, you can pay for goods using things that are not legal tender (Scottish bank notes, gold, foreign currency or anything that the seller chooses to accept - for example).

Legal tender is only applicable when you are settling a debt - so if you had a plumber come around, and do some work in your house a debt has been created, and laws around payment through legal tender come into play. Or, if you are eating at a restaurant (one where you pay after you eat, anyway). Or if you are paying a court debt, etc. etc. But, when you buy a packet of potatoes, a new watch or a car a debt is generally not created.

true,chels-guevara,1986,"CHELSEA F.C.    ","theres a multitude of points i disagree within this article  
 
* Mourinho left behind teams in a mess  
  
False. The successive manager brought in to carry on was of NO comparison to his expertise, and i think its safe to say that the squads were mildly successful even when he had left. the chemistry he had created was potent enough to see them through for a season or 2. Not his fault if the following caretaker couldn't manage the squad. I think people ask way too much of him. ""we want trophies now, and you have to leave a barca like academy capable of a dynasty lasting decades! in the space of 3 years!"" not gonna happen. When SAF and Wegner leave, lets see how their squads turn out in a few seasons.
  
* Mourinho was questionable in Transfers  
  
This guy's gonna have the audacity to put all the Sheva blame on Mourinho? I think a certain Russian wanted a player to instill his mark on the team.. and the fact he was European player of the year and a demi-god @ Milan, who wouldn't of taken him. I'm not even going to start on how many players he brought in and turned them into stars during his time, the only problem i see he has is intergrating youth players.   
  
* we need a builder  
  
well, as i see it, the squad is about 70-80% built for the future, what Chelsea REALLY need is an attacking philosophy and a DEFENSIVE plan, something Mou excels at and has made him the most successful coach across the board. Roman has to make a decision, he either sacrifices instant success for re-building or just carries on buying the hottest stars and hoping for a title.  
  
He has a big ego, and thats what draws and unites players around him. they feed off his persona, and will run through brick walls for him, given they don't have ego's to match.  
  
in a different angle, i don't think Mourinho managing the club will be as easy as it seems, he could feel a disconnection to the squad he has had almost zero input on creating, roman might need to spend a little bit more. But given the diversity of players on loan, i'm hoping Mou can make the best of it, **IF** he comes.

Wikipedia generally keeps a fairly neutral tone, albeit through rigorous policing ([citation needed]). So if it was to be crowd-sourced fact checking, there would have to be some method of checking the fact-checking.

That might be fairly easy to achieve, by stating that answers can only state referenced data/studies, assess the reliability of the sources referenced, and then discuss how the politician's claim (or implication) agrees or disagrees with the facts.

Now if I could have 2 minutes of your time, because you're the first member of this 'middle ground' I've witnessed give an articulate and honest response capable of seeing at least some of the difficulties being faced.

I agree with the general thrust of your argument. The trouble is, the outspoken 'middle ground' are selective in where they chose to highlight intolerance - an affliction they share with their/your political representatives in Alliance.

Now, if we concentrate exclusively on the 'swinging voters' between these two specific groups of prods - loyalist protesters on one side, anti-protest protesters on the other - there is the wide sea of people who were against the removal of the flag but don't support the protests in neither peaceful nor violent form. 

They see all three of their strands of common identity - political outlook, culture and religion - being made the subject of ridicule by both protester and vociferous 'middle ground' alike.  

They aren't likely to warm to one or the other.

Moreover, a 'middle ground' whose inability to see that it is never visible unless to highlight the deficiencies of loyalism exclusively is one that will continue to drive support for an extreme, isolated strand of loyalism. Whether that strand is a coherent argument makes little difference to people fed up having open season declared on them regularly in the media. 

They know they aren't perfect, but they also know neither is 'themmuns' on the other side and the inability of the 'middle ground' and mainstream media to be equally nitpicking when republicans commit acts of terror is what resonates in their heads longest. 

To indulge the 'troublesome' part of loyalism for a second - even the murals will tell you this message of incredulity. There are many openly quoting Republican dogma and contrasting it with the reality of the terrorist acts. Unlike their republican equivalent, Loyalist murals were never meant as a message to 'outsiders'. 

These political murals are a call to their own community as they see it, to wake up and challenge them over political doublespeak. Doublespeak that they see the self-declared middle ground swallow hook, line and sinker time and again. The same 'middle ground' whose political reps make it their business to defend convicted terrorists in their daily business at Stormont rather than help out the victims of said terrorist. This is the type of moral duplicity that these 'swing voters' despise. 

Until this 'middle ground' realise they are being played just as much as the loyalist sheep and display the same kind of leadership they accuse others of lacking the same mistakes will be repeated ad nauseum. And the issues don't just end there.

Elsewhere, I've seen many instances over the past month where mainstream media have stepped beyond the boundaries of their supposed editorial stance/embellished half truths and reported them as (unverified) fact. As I keep pointing out, people aren't stupid and know when those with narrow agendas inside the media start pushing them. 

In the same way the 'intolerant fundamentalists' of the middle ground weren't too intolerant in the days after the shooting of David Black. If this is really about not returning to the dark days and not just a case of guilt-fed snobbery or angst at being inconvenienced on the way home then where were the peace pickets in Lurgan town centre or better yet Kilwilkie? Where was the Alliance pressure on their voting partners the SDLP in putting to bed the playpark issue in Newry?

When the cheap, breathless insults and badly disguised propaganda settle down, this is what the swing vote will remember.

The result? In east Belfast certainly, a rallying around a 'traditional' unionist candidate. In that specific case, whoever the DUP put forward. While it won't be lost on those voters that the inability of the traditional main unionist parties to conduct a campaign is largely to blame *internally*, they'll overcome any such misgivings when the 'middle ground' have singularly failed to be trusted with any form of real compromise, delivering once again the dated and untrue message that 'compromise = something for unionists to swallow and little else'.

I agree whole-heartedly about this. It takes time to shift the minds of players, especially athlets who are so reliant on muscle memory. Pardon my generalization, but for years Gerrard (for exmaple) was ""trained"" to look for Torres. This becomes muscle memory. Now he is in a somewhat different position and instead of always looking to find number 9, he is asked to go to a midfielder or winger first. This shift takes time.

&gt;...but look at United this season always conceding cheap goals with their shite defending and somehow managing to make a comeback in the 2nd half, they're the same way.

The difference for them (or at least one of them) is the fact that usually they have already scored and they are working for a win, not a draw. Also, look at GD. Utd is +27 over 22 games. That's an average win of 1.27 goals. When you are usually ahead by more than 1 goal, you can stand to give up a few cheap ones.

The never had any prospect of deciding the main thrust of policy and they are getting vilified by the hard of thinking for Tory policies.

And fwiw, there are no polar opposites with these monolithic parties. There are people in the LibDems who you would always be able to classify as either socially aware Tories and others who are the natural bedfellows of New Labour. Similarly the Tories have people who would fit better as LibDems and so do Labour. These are broad church parties, and without proportional representation they will always remain that way.

Look at the examples of scare stories about the EU being inefficient in some way or passing a stupid law. Many of them are completely false but once a newspaper publishes them, the public gets enrages about how terrible the EU is and this pushes public opinion against the EU.

The newspaper gets a letter from the EU or some educated member of the public and it turns out they completely misunderstood the law/situation. By this point, even if the newspaper prints a tiny correction on their back page, the damage is already done and people will continue using this completely false story to back up their opposition to the EU.

This should apply to *anything* they assert in public.

Ombudsman would need a series of guidelines &amp; some staff to sift out the inevitable large number of reported lies. Abuses could be graded from serious to moderate. Anybody found guilty more than once of a severe abuse gets kicked out of parliament and either a byelection or the seat goes to the runner up...

Even if it weren't perfect, the ombudsman could catch the worst excesses and - over time - build up a pattern of the worst abusers of truth.

It would be horrible if someone buys it and then doesn't keep it as HMV.

I went in again today and bought some things! Now I bought a boxset of a TV series, separately though. It would've cost me £30 if I bought both series together, or £28.50 if I bought them separately (get the same). I hope you don't mind, but being a student I thought I should try and save as much as I can xD I loved the guy that served me, we had a little chat [then he put this underneath the sticker and into the bag, making me not realise until I got home!](http://i.imgur.com/a1VlG.jpg) Part of a band he's in ;)

Another thing I've noticed is that in general, the stores here have been much busier. Whether it's because of the blue cross sale, or that people just want to support HMV in their time of need, it's all good nonetheless!

So I guess someone who's pro-gun is going to use that to argue in the favour of self-defence.

Nevertheless, /u/holohedron's link is bad because it's a British news channel asking ""what can the Americans learn from us?"". If Fox News write an article, aimed at Americans, asking ""what can the British learn from America about tea?"", we'd tell them to fuck off, too. So why should the Americans listen to us?

Admittedly gun crime is a more of a problem than tea, but it's also a uniquely American problem, and it won't be solved in a vacuum, or by following other countries, which have totally different cultures and circumstances.

""The Girl Who Waited"" and ""The God Complex"" are also really good episodes for feels.

If there's anything close to a weak episode in the entire season, it's probably ""The Rebel Flesh""/""The Almost People"" in my opinion. They are somewhat boring, but even then, there are some wonderful moments.

The biggest issue with minority groups is poor integration which every party can take some blame for. I'd say it's slowly getting better but there are people on both sides holding things back. Whether it's a declining group of skinheads or a party of xenophobes who's horribly poor understanding of the economy and global politics lead them to believe that the EU is bad for us.

Perhaps if we had changed formation to 4-2-3-1 Sahin would have fit right in, but changing our entire formation because of one player that is on *loan* would not be the smartest thing to do.

Newspapers weren't established as journals for the public administration of information, but as vehicles of personal expression in the public sphere; they have come to have a valuable function in the formation of public opinion, but they are not official bodies and have no requirement, beyond limits set for public order, to be truthful. They can and do present information in the way that will sell the most, not in the way that is most honest and good for public information.

I read recently of the efforts made in the 1890s, I think, to make journalism respectable - establishing the Pulitzer Prize was one method. It has a phantom standing, now, a presumed place in the public and political discourse that that has come to be seen as vital, yet it has no other reason to be there than that it is strongly opinionated and can gather a crowd in support of its rallying cry. Politicians use them as a gauge of public opinion, and the news media milk that proximity to power and responsibility without having any actual responsibilities to the public beyond what sells papers. 

I don't disagree with you on how useful having factually-clear newspapers/media would be, and this is surely something that Levison should legislate on. I hope he does, and along the lines you suggest, but I have lost faith in those who dominate the public sphere at the moment; those who are not ineffective are just corrupt and will not help us reform the public sphere so that people have a clearer vision of what is happening, and more power to change it.

Newspapers are as happy at the top table, representing the public without real checks or controls, as are the politicians, and both parties support each other in the status-quo that they, literally, enjoy to the full. While we complain that they should be honest, they take up the cry and throw it around willy-knilly till the public don't know what's what anymore and leave them to carry on.

true,mab92,null,null,"Think about it this way: when you vote in the general election, you cast a vote for an MP in your constituency. You trust that person to represent your region nationally. When it comes to the HoC, it's advantageous to be the majority party as an MP within the majority party will most likely vote in the party's favour.

We've had minority governments before and it's harder to get stuff done as the majority of the house is against you. By entering into coalition, you come to a compromise that means your party will get as much through as it can most effectively. You trust that the MP you elected will still be acting in your region's best interests as a member of that party, so such coalitions are advantageous as your MP's party will be able to get as much done as it can.

You shouldn't force parties into coalition as they'll be no longer acting in their best interest as effectively as they would have been outside that rule. A Lab-Con coalition needs to come naturally for you to still be able to argue that your MP (and their party) has been acting in your best interest. A forced coalition would mean parties that are potentially vastly different having to make huge compromises to make things work.

It's a bit like taking a vote to see where you should go in the evening. 3 people vote pub, 2 people vote cinema and 1 person votes bar. Pub and bar would make an effective coalition, so it makes sense for them to get together and agree on a joint policy for the evening. A pub-cinema coalition probably wouldn't work, but if we were *forcing* them into coalition we would probably end out with drinking outside a cinema or something.

Ford always seems that way, but he managed to clearly deliver some points (on the leafleting and the collection of signatures etc) though he knew Jeffrey wouldn't take them under his notice. There's often long pauses between a question and an answer with Ford which can make it seem like he's stumped - but he seems to engage brain before speaking, which is rare in legoland.

This is common and I see it all the time.

It publishes this crap all the time but barely ever gets any criticism, despite the fact that it is essentially the media arm of the Barclay brothers who use it to promote their own agenda. Its just manipulative, basically.

People from intensely theocratic regions like Pakistan bring their religious doctrine with them, which is great for the most part, But radicalization does happens within these communities. Many of the rules of Islam (depending on how closely it is followed) run counter to the rules of the united kingdom. Thus, you get idiots like the two in the video trying to encourage others to follow their rule. There is not enough resistance to this attitude from the wider Islamic community in the UK. I believe there should be, because the absolute majority of people who follow Islam are peace-loving, ordinary people.

This is by no means exhaustive and is very simplistic, but shows the scope of the problem/
----

My personal preference is towards less bureaucracy when administering taxes. I know it's not the most popular but I'm an advocate of a Flat Tax. Furthermore, I would only begin administering tax at between 18-20k. Depending on the region. This would eliminate tax credits, child benefit etc etc etc. Rather than take and give, you just let people get on with it. Welfare becomes payments for those in genuine need and a safety net. 

Other areas of major spending reduction? Make sure councils freeze council tax. Follow Fulham and Hammersmiths' example of REDUCING council tax every year for the past 7.  Reduce spending on genuinely unnecessary things (i.e. town hall pravdas) and force councils to specialise in things they were originally created for (bin collections, local libraries, road maintenance, social care - to name a few) Furthermore, you could restore a semblance of normality and don't force them to spend all grants in one year in order to receive more. Things like re-tarmacking roads for the sake of spending is just ridiculous when you have a school that needs a new roof.

Pensions? Jesus where to start. First of all, admit they are unsustainable. That's a good start. End blanket pensions. My dad gets a state pension, he is in absolutely no need of it and still works. Perfect example. Whilst you're there -why not get rid of free TV licenses too. 

Defence? Scrap trident. Use half savings to invest in special forces/rapid reaction/airforce. Bank rest.

Health? Fire 90% of managers. My friend who is a doctor reliably informs me that the major hospital she works in has more managers than beds.

PFI? - Never, ever sign another PFI deal. Honour the existing ones and get Government lawyers seeking outs. Never use Capita/Serco/G4S again. Actually begin to honour government pledges to use small and medium sized outsources enterprises which have more reason to deliver.

IT - Outsource, outsource, outsource. DEMAND results in contracts.

Immigration - encourage it. They pay taxes and tend to be young (i.e. not require a pension)

Europe - Stay in it, stop faffing.

Bailouts - Stop doing them. We're a capitalist country. Things fail, get over it.

Debt - Use as much saving to pay it off ASAP. Saving up to 30bn/year.

UKBA - Would be dissolved and reformed. 

Senior Civil Servants - would stop swapping jobs every 7 months. Cease to reward failure. (Google Lin Homer).


Sweeping changes? God yes. Will it happen? God no.  Is this even possible? Given the pace of Government. No.

Would it work? It might.


What would I leave in place?

Education, transport, social care, policing.

1. Weekends aren't really a thing here, they're days you won't have lectures and probably won't have tutorials but most people work just as much on weekends as weekdays and your days off tend to fall around your timetable (for example my ""weekend"" is Thursday afternoon and Friday, because that's just after my weekly deadlines).

2. I like living here, it's a beautiful place and there's heaps to do in your free time since there's a society for virtually everything. 

3. A bit of both, I really really like London, but Oxford does seem more relaxed (at least at times you don't have work).

4. I do like the 8 week terms, it means terms don't drag on too long and there's plenty of time in the vacation to go out and do things, whether that's going abroad, internships, charity work, whatever you're into.

5. Again, I don't do engineering but I find the 8 weeks very intense, most people are exhausted by about halfway through 8th week and everyone pretty much sleeps for the first week of the vacation. I mostly doss around in the vacation, we're supposed to work and revise (we have exams first week back after every vacation) some people do, some people don't, there's no one to make you.

6. This depends greatly on your college, some colleges let you live on site all three years, some lets you live in college owned accommodation all three years, some make you move out in second year and you can live back in college third year, some keep you in second year and kick you out third year.

Part of the problem with the 'no true muslim/christian/whatever' argument is that that argument is entirely baseless. No interpretation of any religion can be proven to be more valid than another. Just look at how many different denominations of Christianity there are. Many of those individual groups make the claim that every other group has got the faith wrong and that they aren't true Christians. Many say, 'only our group will be blessed with the grace of god in heaven; all others are doomed to hell'. There are no objective interpretations available and in my view they all seem equally invalid and untrue.

The dangerous thing about religions, particularly Islam is that they claim to be all you need. They claim to be the one and only truth. Actually Islam claims to be the final revelation - there's nothing else you need to know. We all know how this absolutist view can manifest itself. But please note the important distinction here - this is criticism of the religion itself, not it's believers. Though I may find their religion contemptuous, I don't care what they believe so long as they keep it to themselves and don't force it onto anybody else. But of course many religions mandate the religion to be forced onto others. We should not stand for it, and we should have the moral courage to resist it against ridiculous accusations of 'Islamophobia'. There's nothing wrong with hating a religion so long as you afford the same rights and treat all people equally regardless of their belief. We expect the same in return. I hate Christianity as a religion, but don't get called 'Christophobic'.

Turns out Only Newcastle have more players than Chelsea in that list. 

Arsenal and Tottenham are behind Chelsea with the number of most iconic goal scorers in the history of the league and English football and if you exclude Michael Owen who has done fuck all at United, Chelsea are ahead of United too instead of being tied with them at second as the only clubs to have 4 top scorers in history to have played a vital spell at the club. 

And all 4 were bought for low transfer fees and before all of this money business. Heck the guy who is untouchable as the most iconic goal scorer in English football started his career in the Chelsea youth team and in the Chelsea first team. Guess why Chelsea had to sell him? Because we were on the other end of the money scale and had to sell a reluctant Jimmy Greaves who it was quite clear was going to be one of the best players ever. He went on to be one of the most expensive players in football by the same club who mocks us for our money, the scum of Tottenham. Just because that figure was 100,000 pounds and not 50mil doesn't mean you were not out spending everyone you idiots, you were spending more than everyone else and so much that teams had to sell their Ronaldo's and Messi's to you, that is no where close to what Chelsea still does.

true,RedOilSaints,lfc99,,"Well Tony Barrett of the Times has said Rodgers is an admirer or Sneijder, but wants him to take a paycut. The Times article mentions to offer something that is a 3rd of what he makes now, which would put him at 67K/wk, but I think that's not possible. I'd imagine we could offer something close to 90-95k/wk and hope the rest is payed by Inter as some sort of severance. 

To me the biggest issue is if he's another Joe Cole. Guy who in the past was quality, but comes here based of his last name. Lets be honest, we're finally free of almost every disgusting wage this club had coming into this season. Going back and signing another, even though he was world class 2 seasons ago, doesn't make sense. 

If he has the motivation to work, and he hasn't lost his fitness/technical ability and still can play, then I guess I am OK with getting him. It's just a big risk imo. Especially with his perceived lack of market. I mean, Gala is the only team with a concrete offer for him? If he's world class, then you'd assume a bigger market. 

On the flip side, a motivated Wesley Sneijder could be dangerous. Playing with a chip on your shoulder is a great motivator. Who knows. ",0,1358465678,null,0,false,0,c7yuo86,t3_16s3ka,t1_c7yuo86,t3_16s3ka,null,1430996813,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22

If you wanted to build one that was 10 feet or meters or whatever unit you prefer tall. You would take the total height of the TARDIS, which I added as 147.626 units, and make that equal to 10 of your form of measurement. Then you would derive the size of every part from that. 

Lets say I wanted to make a 1 foot tall model. The easiest way to do this is to make fractions. You would have (ignore the dots)

147.626u  .......... 11.635

_________  X ____________ 

12"" .................. (x)


Then you solve for X which should be equal to ~0.945 inches.

You then do this for the rest of your measurements, and you have yourself the shell of a TARDIS. As for the inside,  you will need more mathematics and physics then us humans understand.

3. I now live and work in London, which is nice, but doesn't compare to being a student in Oxford. Personally, I preferred the atmosphere and people in Oxford.

14. The course is obviously very academic, but you do specialise in your third and fourth years so can choose to do some mech or aero or whatever. Some of the best departments are actually in biomedical engineering and information engineering (robots and stuff), which you may not be attracted to before starting the course.

6. You should know that at least half of the class does not go on to practise engineering. In my year of 8, only 2 are now working for engineering firms. The rest of us have ended up at investment banks, management consultancies, and other such companies. The big firms recruit quite heavily on campus, drawing people in with the offer of working in London and earning lots of money. And an engineering degree gives a lot of flexibility in terms of the kind of role available (e.g. trading/IBD/technology at a bank).

Anyway, I would highly recommend the degree and the experience. Best of luck!

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"As I said above, Christianity has (for the most part) got over it's witch burning and inquisition stage ... sure there are going to be exceptions, but the most you can expect from Christians these days is a muted ""tut tut"" and perhaps you don't get invited to their Bring-and-Buy sale.

Islam on the other hand is right in the middle of it's raping, burning and pillaging phase - in fact some would argue it's been like that ever since it's inception, as Muhammed was nothing more than a warlord anyway, and the words he ""heard from Allah"" were of course inspired by his own warlike tendencies.

More and more Christianity is just something you write on a bit of paper to identify yourself when you're not brave enough to write Atheist or perhaps scared of being accused as a devil worshipper - there are still plenty of societies where it's better to admit to being Christian, even though you haven't been to church in 30 years. So saying Anders Brevik is Christian is kind of irrelevant - in fact he was a proponent of Zionism, fiercely Islamaphobic and perhaps just pushed too far over the edge by the rise of Islam in the West. However, most likely he was just batshit crazy.

While crazies don't always need religion to do bad things, it's often the defense used by their lawyers - along with insanity, funny how those two go hand in hand - to try and justify shit behaviour. These two punks were abusing people ""because of Islamic law"". I see a huge difference between the two cases.

I should clarify however, that personally I'd like religion removed from schools and public life, and kept strictly in the home.

And so this is where you decide to either follow a carefully crafted plan to let BR get his shit together this season and compete next, or grab an opportunity.

I'm not drooling over his potential signing as others, if he comes good, it shows ambition for this season which is never a bad thing. However a summer signing for AM with whatever money we get from Carroll, spearing, lower wages etc. is much better deal. Not only will we be able to focus on getting one big player for decent money, they will get used to the team pre-season rather than jumping into the middle of a season. Also why is he so keen to drop wages elsewhere when he doesn't want to drop wages in the club he has been at for years?

Do so and you won't be of the same opinion, but somehow I think challenging your bullshit opinions is something you want to do. You're not worthy of a rebuttal, but I have nothing better do so I will say this on Man Utd (it's all said better in the linked article):

Every team (at least since the 19th century) that has ever won the league has done so by investing in the team. Every. Single. One. Get off your high horse.

Football, since the creation of the Premier League and Champions League in 1992, has become big money - and this money is not distributed in a 'fair' way, so the top clubs, the ones finishing top and qualifying for the Champions League have a massive financial advantage. Man Utd lucked out as the advent of this new era coincided with them having a good team. Thanks to more income from the new system, Man Utd  could afford to spend big year in year out - as they did, breaking transfer records to poach the best players from lower teams and cement their top status. United have not always been the best around - from 1967-93 they won no titles. Not one. 

Because of the top teams getting so much money, from both the Premier League and Champions League, it became impossible for clubs to grow 'organically' and challenge the big teams. You can do quite well - think Everton - but not well enough to challenge for the title (indeed looking at Everton Man Utd and Man City raid all their best players). Arsenal challenged by investing in the team - Tony Adams said 90% of the reason for their victories in the league was a £50m investment in the club, which in today's market is more like £100m if not more.

Chelsea and City's way is the only way to win the league from a lower position. FFP destroys competition and cements the status quo. It is not fair that in a game where the top clubs get so much more money than the little ones, the smaller clubs are not allowed to spend big to get to a level where they can challenge. Football clubs are businesses and if an owner wants to pump money into his money into his business that is his prerogative.

FFP will mean Man Utd will be able to spend far, far more money than any other club as they make so much more, and they will totally and utterly dominate the league. It will be even more boring and predictable than La Liga, and will be more akin to the SPL, which is now a one team league.

There's nothing fair about FFP. FFP is designed to cement the top teams in place and harm any upstarts like City or Chelsea who try and bring a little competition, a little excitement to the show. If they wanted more fairness, more competition, which they claim, money would be shared more fairly so smaller clubs could be more competitive.

* we have similar freedom of speech under EU human rights legislation. We do draw the line at an earlier point for ""harmful speech"", too early in many people's opinion. America does has many similar restrictions, brought about through numerous supreme court judgements. Google ""fire in a theatre"" for more info, ""free speech"" doesn't exist anywhere, there are always restrictions. Once the UK repeals ""Section 5"" we'll be pretty much on the same level as the USA
* gambling, from casinos to racing, in the US you need to go to a handful of select places. Online games are completely banned, you cannot even use one hosted abroad. This is quite a big one, the only reason to ban it is from religious morality
* freedom of international travel; there are some nations that the US government bans citizens from travelling to e.g. Cuba. These nations know never to stamp a US citizen's passport, should they fly via a third country, this is because of the very real problems it causes the traveller later
* freedom of domestic travel, we have ""[right to roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Right_to_roam_in_Britain)"". In some US states you can be shot dead, no questions asked, on someone else's property, even if all you were doing was peacefully passing through and the boundary was unmarked. Hillwalking etc are basically limited to the national parks. Scotland has always had this right, England &amp; Wales got it quite recently.
* free trade; American's cannot trade with various nations due to complete embargoes. Yet trying to promote those same embargoes against certain select friends is illegal!
* freedom from race-specific laws. Too much to go into here, but throughout the last 200 years to the present day there have been laws specifically targeting minority races in the US. This [goes into it in more detail](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pzz69) but it's quite long. When slavery was banned they created laws to arrest minorities to create fodder for the prison-based industry, [turning former slaves into chain gangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_lease). Even today they have laws stating that certain US government contracts [_must_ be offered to prison labour providers first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Prison_Industries#Criticism), and only go out to wider tender if they are not interested!

I'm reaching a bit for these last ones:

* freedom to not be tortured; state sanctioned rape and violence are endemic in US jails. A quarter of inmates are raped at some point during their incarceration. A very disproportionate amount of abuse takes place at their young-offenders equivalents
* freedom to have property; in the US police can sieze any possessions *for themselves* if they ""suspect"" it is used in crime. There is no trial and no recourse, cars and money being the most commonly taken items.

How do we know the Doctor identifies as male? Just because he's been male for each incarnation? How do we even know if Time Lords view male/female the same way as humans do? What if they don't have gender (which is different than biological sex)?

And if gender has no influence on personality, then why does gender even matter to the Doctor? There's no reason the Doctor *should* be female. And the only argument that he should be male is because he's always been male- and that's only because it was *that* decade and century. Well actually, this century too because transgenderism (as a sex-change regen could be seen as) is still controversial. Keeping with ""consistency"", though not canon or even continuity, is the only reason the Doctor shouldn't genderswap.

And really, it only needs people to bring forward their regular shopping a few days or buy an extra item or two just in case and the shelves will empty pretty quick.

Sure, it's stupid collectively, but it's rational individually - it's proven rational by the empty shelves, and by those who didn't panic quick enough being unable to buy what they need. It would be irrational to trust thousands of people who don't know each other to trust each other not to panic.

true,TheCorsair,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The idea of gender carries on from the biological history of the species. The fact is, before Gallifreyans reproduced by looming (See Lungbarrow), they used good old fashion sex, which produced cultural a split between men and women. This formed gender identities that would be maintained even in a sufficiently advanced society. This is something that an individual wouldn't be changing on a whim. We also have proof that the Doctor identifies as a male because he seeks female companionship, both sexually and not. So unless you're saying that the Doctor is a lesbian trapped in a man's body, who can change their body at whim but doesn't for no reason, then your point is nullified. The idea of the Doctor changing sex purely based on the idea that him being male is contributing to women's suffrage is beyond stupid. It would add nothing to the story, and would be a major continuity error. It would be jumping the shark, and would signal the decline of the show.

Also, the entire show Elementary is a horrible knock off of Sherlock. They changed Watson to being female to differentiate themselves from the source material and the British version, as well as creating possible sexual tension between Holmes and Watson without taking any risks of implied homosexuality. James Bond would be a horrible gender-swap because half his character is based off being a suave womanizer. This isn't about a woman having the lead role of the show, it's about a preexisting character that is NOT a woman. Just because he can technically turn into a woman by no means means he should.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"&gt;This formed gender identities that would be maintained even in a sufficiently advanced society. This is something that an individual wouldn't be changing on a whim. We also have proof that the Doctor identifies as a male because he seeks female companionship, both sexually and not.

I've read Lungbarrow and nowhere did it talk about the particular gender roles of men and women. All it said is that biological sex and birth of babies is possible. It also never talked about how controversial or big a decision a gender change was in Lungbarrow. That book doesn't even address those issues.

&gt;We also have proof that the Doctor identifies as a male because he seeks female companionship, both sexually and not.

No. Just because someone seeks female companionship sexually and not isn't some kind of proof of male-ness. You could easily argue that the other way around if the Doctor hung out and dated men. Gender isn't some guarantee of who you like to have sex with or who you like to hang out with. The most we can say about the Doctor is that he likes women. So if he changed genders maybe he would start to like men, *or* he would keep an interest in women and be a lesbian. *Or* thirdly, he could like both genders. Or neither. It's all up for grabs.

&gt;The idea of the Doctor changing sex purely based on the idea that him being male is contributing to women's suffrage is beyond stupid.

Um, what? When did women's suffrage even come into this?

&gt;It would add nothing to the story, and would be a major continuity error.

No, it wouldn't. Remember the Corsair line.

As for Elementary, it's not a ""horrible knock-off of Sherlock"". It's a good show and technically, Elementary *and* Sherlock are just remakes of previous versions. Sherlock Holmes has been reinvented so many times that nothing is a ""knock-off"" just a reinvention.

Jane Bond would be a suave seductress.

&gt;Just because he can technically turn into a woman by no means means he should.

I already said that. But I don't see why people should be so hostile towards the idea in theory.

IIRC, violence during that controversy was condemned by almost all the Muslim organizations. We just weren't kept as up to date on that as we were about places like Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan (Normally very peaceful and totally not at war /s) were doing.

&gt;If a bunch of Christians stood outside a specific church intimidating non-Christians and telling them they had to leave the area, you can bet that the Church would attempt to distance themselves from these actions.

And if the Church did not do it, they would not be under any social burden or be threatened with protests and riots.

&gt;The difference is that this doesn't happen.

The EDL and BNP do it regularly. They are Christian organizations. They themselves admit to this.

&gt;Google 'Christian Gang', 'Buddhist Gang', 'Jewish Gang' and 'Muslim Gang' and look at the results. 

Because apparently people only care when Muslims do these things. When non-Muslims get into a gang and commit crimes, they are just labelled gangs. However, when a gang has Muslim members, suddenly we are talking about the problem of Muslim gangs and whathaveyou. That is why Muslim gangs get reported on more and associated with Islam at every turn. Or are you saying that the only gangs operating in the UK are Muslim gangs?

&gt;I'm not for a second saying that people like this represent all or even anywhere near the majority of Muslims

Why beat around the bush. That is exactly what you are implying.

&gt;Moderate Muslims may not have an obligation to speak out, but sitting in silence helps nobody and frankly only helps fuel the flames for the intolerant and ignorant.

Again, you demand that Muslims condemn Muslim dickheads just because they are Muslim. That is the problem here. And you do not want to see it. This is the result of our media consistently associating Islam and Muslims with crime and violence when reporting. It's been done before:

&gt;“I would give you numbers regarding what is happening with Muslims in Europe,” said Zisser. “It is much more painful than with the Jews, and for this they killed six million Jews, so for the other things they will kill 60 million too.”

&gt;“The new demon in Europe is the Muslims,” he went on. “It is being built up just like the Jewish demon was built up at the start of the previous century. This new demon is being built in the way that Europe knows how to build and annihilate something when it is defending itself against it.”

It's nothing new to people with interest in European history.

&gt;Repeating what I said above, the EDL is about defending what they consider traditional British 'Christian' values (values I don't personally agree with). They aren't exclusively a Christian organization, they aren't claiming to be enforcing the word of God as these idiots are with Sharia law.

A 4-5-1. I think we're going to need 5 in the middle to handle the threat of Manchester United's midfield, and given that Ade isn't available, I'd like to see Dempsey start instead of Sigurdsson because this is a game where we can't take Siggy's gamble.

I think Dembele and Parker will be able to dictate the play in midfield, Carrick and Cleverley with Kagawa and Rooney in midfield for United is a strong one to compete against, but I think at the Lane we have the class to do so.

I just hope that in the event we pick up a lead, we don't sit on it.

true,TheCorsair,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;I've read Lungbarrow and nowhere did it talk about the particular gender roles of men and women. All it said is that biological sex and birth of babies is possible. It also never talked about how controversial or big a decision a gender change was in Lungbarrow. That book doesn't even address those issues.

Lungborrow introduced the idea of looming, which I was siting my source on because it is not a part of the TV series. It has nothing to do with the rest of the statement I made which was in regard to how genders roles are formed, and maintained through society.
&gt;No. Just because someone seeks female companionship sexually and not isn't some kind of proof of male-ness. You could easily argue that the other way around if the Doctor hung out and dated men. Gender isn't some guarantee of who you like to have sex with or who you like to hang out with. The most we can say about the Doctor is that he likes women. So if he changed genders maybe he would start to like men, or he would keep an interest in women and be a lesbian. Or thirdly, he could like both genders. Or neither. It's all up for grabs.

Why should a preexisting character trait be changed? Regeneration doesn't change who you are, it changes minor character quirks and appearance. He would still be the same Doctor on the inside, and to change his preference of companion's gender would be against established canon. If you want a transgendered timelord, use the Corsair. If you want a male timelord, use the Doctor. If you want a female timelord, use Romana. There's no need to change them. Even if two of them are dead.
&gt;Um, what? When did women's suffrage even come into this?

It was an exaggeration, I admit. I got the vibe you were thinking that women actresses were being suppressed by being denied the role.

&gt;No, it wouldn't. Remember the Corsair line.

The Doctor's story, not the show's. The Doctor's continuity, not the show's.

And Elementary is a knock off. It came up right after the success of the British version was noticed. Prove to me it was in the works before the first episode of Sherlock aired, and I'll reconsider. As for Jane, the idea of a James Bond like female spy does work, but it would not have anything to do with the pre-established James Bond character/movies. 

The rest of your response is just you quoting the conclusions of my statements without picking up on the rest of the data.

Also, if we want to play with the extended canon, in Death Comes to Time (The first Doctor Who Audio adventure after the 1996 movie, produced by the BBC) it is stated that **"" A “Sex Change Regeneration” is forbidden and is considered to be a worse crime then stealing a TARDIS and interfering in other time zones. The standard punishment is for the Time Lord to be locked inside their TARDIS forever. Their only escape is to activate the de-materialization switch with will remove them from History turning them into a neverperson.

Let's say he does come in and gets back to a bit of his past form; what top-rated winger wouldn't love to play along with him and Suarez with Gerrard and Lucas backing them up.  Finding a true #10 is the big cog missing in BR's system and to have the opportunity to go from a transitioning stage for the future to seriously pushing forward today is invaluable after the years of mediocrity we've had.  He'll make up a few weeks wages in shirt sales anyway, sign him up guys.  Gerrard-Lucas  Stirling/Borini-Sneijder-Suarez with Sturridge up front makes my mouth water.

Edit:  Just saw Gerrard was on $120K.  I'd go as high as $110-120K for Sneijder which pips Galatasaray and still keeps SG as the highest earner.

true,thewaitaround,k9,K-9,"The ""the Doctor is speaking Gallifreyan"" theory is, in my opinion, kind of silly. He has said many times that he speaks everything (including baby and horse), so why wouldn't he be speaking actual English to his companions or others who he knows speak English, rather than letting the TARDIS translate it? It's inconceivable that he doesn't know English, so I'm not sure why he wouldn't just speak that. I suppose what the Doctor is actually ""speaking"" is relative to the listener; take, for example, the Sycorax, from ""The Christmas Invasion"". Both they and Rose understand what the Doctor is saying, which means, presumably, he sounds like he's speaking English to Rose (and the viewers) and speaking the Sycorax language to the Sycorax. Technically, he's the only one who knows what words are actually coming out of his mouth, but I don't know why he wouldn't be speaking english, especially when on Earth.

There's also the fact that one of the Doctor's catch-phrases, ""allons-y"", and another phrase he uses often, ""molto bene"", are not English at all. If the Doctor were speaking gallifreyan, wouldn't these phrases presumably sound English to an English-speaking listener? To me, it makes more sense that he would be speaking English to an English speaker who understands it with no help from the TARDIS, therefore when he says things such as ""allons-y"", they come out how he intends them to.

I apologize for this extremely long, totally irrelevant post, but it's something I've thought quite a bit about, and so I figured I'd share. 

As far as the OP's question, I remember reading in some sort of interview or something (I'm not sure when, or with whom, or anything really) that the Doctor really has no clue how old he really is. It's actually a very complicated question: presumably the Doctor spends a good amount of time off-screen in the TARDIS. What defines time while in the TARDIS? There's no ""day"" or ""night"", no way to measure a year. While he seems to believe that he's over 1000 ""years"" old (which I'm sure is likely accurate) , there really isn't a logical way to tell. It's one of the things that comes with time travel.

In ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"", Amy says that she believes about 10 years have passed for her and Rory since they've been with the Doctor, but not 10 years for Earth or for the rest of her friends. It's never explained where they got this figure from, but it simply hints at the complicated nature of the concept of age in relation to time travel.

The TARDIS, clearly, has many ways of blurring the lines of language, age, and time.",0,1358478269,null,0,1358478664,0,c7yygbd,t3_16jngg,t1_c7yygbd,t1_c7wu0i9,null,1430998597,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt; And if the Church did not do it, they would not be under any social burden or be threatened with protests and riots.

Apart from these fringe groups you keep referring to, who is threating protests and riots exactly? They would be expected to condemn the actions certainly.

&gt; The EDL and BNP do it regularly. They are Christian organizations. They themselves admit to this.

[The BNP is a political party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_National_Party), the [EDL is a protest movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League). Neither are religious organizations, they just associate Christian values with their ideologies.

&gt; Because apparently people only care when Muslims do these things. When non-Muslims get into a gang and commit crimes, they are just labelled gangs. However, when a gang has Muslim members, suddenly we are talking about the problem of Muslim gangs and whathaveyou. That is why Muslim gangs get reported on more and associated with Islam at every turn. Or are you saying that the only gangs operating in the UK are Muslim gangs?

If Jewish people formed a gang and targeted non-Jewish people, they would certainly be labelled as a Jewish gang and people would consider it a problem. I can't find any examples of this though. Any gang whose actions are associated with religion (like the guys in this video), regardless of what religion, are labelled as such because of the nature of their justification for said actions.

And even if it was, then we could still have the Doctor be hetero or we could still have her like females. If you're just referring to the Doctor's male-ness, gender isn't a character trait. You yourself said in an above post that gender had no influence on personality.

The Doctor's continuity? That he obviously has no issue with kissing and flirting with males. And if you're going to bring up a highly apocryphal (canon-wise) story then we can pretty much bring up all the other expanded universe stuff and I can say that the 8th Doctor did have a relationship with his male companion Fitz. So yeah, his sexuality is now not a fixed thing. And as you say yourself, it's a diverging timeline. The Doctor is a renegade of Gallifrey and its society. Many of the things he does goes against Gallifreyan standards, so a gender change could be done anyways. He breaks the laws of time a lot. Furthermore, debate of canon aside, the tv show runners are not going to take into account expanded universe material when they cast the next Doctor.

Just because Elementary came after Sherlock doesn't mean its a knock-off. You could call Sherlock a knock-off of the Robert Downey Jr. version. And key thing- it's not bad.

The fact that he has a hetro preference would indicate his dominate sexual identification.

true,tlisia,null,null,"You've got a lot of good advice. Just a couple of things to remember:

* There are often multiple universities a city: Sheffield for instance has the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam. These are not in any way the same. As a general rule, 'University of...' institutions are better.

* You can apply to multiple courses at the same university, but they count as separate applications.

* University of Sheffield is in the Russell Group - it's essentially the UK equivalent of the Ivy League, give or take. There are 20 of these universities. Be aware that, whilst they aren't quite as competitive as Oxbridge, Durham or UCL, some courses used to have upwards of 30 applicants per place. Applications are down with the higher fees, so I'm not as sure of the figures this year. Just to bear in mind that Cambridge and Oxford aren't the only 'elite' institutions.

* 'Low' expectations can be wide. The old polytechnics, like Nottingham Trent or Sheffield Hallam will often require BCC at A-level, which is lower end (I'm sorry I have no idea how this related to US grading), whereas University of ...s will often require AAA, (or did when I went) which were the top grades achievable. As has been said, read the online University Guides. Depending on your course, the 'elite' universities might not require these grades - check the course pages on the university's website.

* Finally! When you are applying for UCAS, make sure you spell everything right and capitalise everything correctly. I know it sounds simple and a little offensive but it happens a lot. At my school, of about 80 applicants, 4 were not in need of correction. From my work in an admissions department, it happens so often and it just looks bad. Shouldn't affect your application, but it probably would in a tight spot.

true,[deleted],null,null,"They way I always think of it (with TV shows as reference)-

Working Class- Bare min of education, council house, low-pay/low-skill job. Think the Royal Family or, Shameless

Students- Largely Self Explanatory, in education, usually unemployed youth. Low income and low living (but happy). Nights out and experimental drugs and sex. The source of much of society's activism and wild ideas. Think Fresh Meat or the Inbetweeners if they are in university 

Professionals- Usually young and out of education and/or training in a ""respectable"" field- Engineering, Banking, even Plumbing or trades. Climbing the ladder. Holiday once a year if finances are right, may have a car. Modest house, usually inner-city apartment rent. Think the IT Crowd or Peep Show

Middle Class- Usually a class transcended from successful professionals. Good income (though they will deny this at every opportunity due to a slight self-delusion), car(s), holiday twice a year to forein locations, owns home, might have kids they will pay through university. This class is the ""goal"" for many British. Think Outnumbered

Upper Class- Rare and often merge into an ""upper-middle"" class category. Very High income with a lifestyle to match. Any children are certainly privately educated. Refined tastes a slightly elitist perspective on society. Think Yes Minister.

That is a pretty standard outlook apart from Professionals and Students. I think students are such a large demographic now they deserve to be considered their own class. Albeit a temporary state drawing from many different backgrounds. Of course some students life a very privileged student life but most have a very similar experience. . Professionals I feel is necessary. It's a ""Not quite middle class"" territory. They'd hate to be called Middle class.

Besides the reason I like the EU is not the single market, though were I a businessman that would be my first thought. The thing I like most is the fact that, for example, when I go skiing in France in April, everywhere I go, any service I use, any place I stay, whatever I can dream of doing in France while there, I can never ever be treated any differently than a French citizen. Equally, my many French and German friends who came to the UK to go to university have every right I have while in the UK. Not to mention the amount of social law and employment rights I now enjoy because of the EU that would all go if we left. Frankly it is ridiculous. It's ridiculously good value for money. Of course if UKIP members value those rights so lowly that they don't consider them worth 1/100th of our budget then I respectfully disagree. I use my rights on the continent a lot and value them very highly even if UKIP doesn't.

true,summatclever,null,null,"Liverpool won the first League championship after the war, but then didn't win a trophy for 17 years, a period in which they were relegated, spending 8 years in the 2nd Division, and attendances dropped below 30,000. This less glamorous part of their history is always ignored by Liverpool fans, just as Man Utd fans like to ignore the 25 year period from 1967-92 when went without a league title and were at one point relegated.

It was only when the majority shareholder, John Moores, owner of Littlewoods, brought in a new chairman with the specific brief to start spending more cash (which they did, breaking club records), that Liverpool started to become a good team again, winning the league in 1963-64 and their first ever FA Cup in 1965 (only 5 years before our first FA Cup). That investment was sustained, allowing them to establish dominance until 1990, when they won the last of their 18 league titles.

Everton, who won two league titles in the mid '80s, also had investment from the owner of Littlewoods - the Moores family was involved in both clubs. It was his millions which 'bought' them their titles. Meanwhile Nottingham Forest were the first club to spend £1 million on a player; that player, Trevor Francis, helped them win 2 European Cups.

Having a quality manager, a good academy and a good scouting system will get you only so far. Investment is and always has been necessary. True the sums are far inflated these days but that's because the top teams take such a great deal of money, so if smaller clubs want to play them at their own game (United broke several records in buying players in the '90s and even later, think Rio and Rooney). 

If we taker away the ability of owners to invest in their clubs then we take away the ability of clubs not already at the top to compete. In the case of England, even the next few clubs after Man Utd will have a very tough time. Even with their trophyless season last year and our victory in the Champions League we turned over £65m less than Man Utd and only just broke even. They'd have a huge advantage in the transfer market, as well as being able to afford far higher wages, especially once the debt has gone, which it no doubt within a few years.

Caulker is heavy though, difficult to push off the ball or get physical against, but then Dawson isn't a pushover either.

The thing is, Dawson's a no-nonsense defender. He either puts in a tackle and gets the ball out of the danger area, or he thumps it up the field. If it's in the danger area, get it out, doesn't matter how or where. That's his policy and I think against a team like Man United, it could be useful. Dawson also likes them crossfield balls to Bale and is sturdier than Caulker on the ball who always likes to take a single touch and play it to Jan (nothing wrong with that, but just saying).

So yeah, Dawson will probably be better to have. If we get a lead and are leading by 2 goals by the 65th or 70th minute, we can take off a forward player and have Caulker come on and play 5 at the back as well.

Everyone has been talking about bringing in a #10. Yes, Sneidjer wears the number 10, but we are talking about a traditional 10, an Attacking Mid. I was always confused with the Sneidjer gossip because i've never thought of him as a traditional 10. As you can see in the video, he is most comfortable pulling strings from the half (he's really good at it, too) currently the role that Gerrard plays. I think Sneidjer would be better at it than stevie, but the point is, he's not the midfielder we need. He'd be great to have, but it would be just like putting sahin in the most advanced role. Not his best position. 

We a midfielder who is willing to plop himself in the final third surrounded by defenders. Hendo has shown this on occasion, Shelvey does it often when playing mid, Stevie is past it, Allen is unproven here, Suso lacks the experience, and Suarez will most likely not get the chance.

Fill the planter with compost, and hang from a wall bracket.  Water and feed from a hole at the top, and watch as, literally over the space of a week, all the leaves turn themselves 'up' to face the sun.

The theory is that because gravity is 'pulling' at the plant, it is able to focus its strength into producing fruit, rather than being strong enough to stay vertical.  I like the theory, plus it allows me to free up some ground space for something else.

The first year was quite a success, by my own standards.  Plenty of fruit from just one plant.  Last year, however, was something of a disaster, and I think my plant developed a blight, and the fruit went a horrible brown/green colour.

Something I'm going to be trying this year is to keep a log of what I'm doing - when, variety type, etc. so I can keep a track of what's going on.

true,Chive,canada,Norn Irn-&gt;Yorkshire-&gt;Essex-&gt;Alberta,"That's not what [the Mission Statement on their site says.](http://englishdefenceleague.org/about-us) That's actually well worth reading as it seems completely at odds with the actions of many of its members.

They describe themselves as a human rights organisation which is very much not the impression I get of them. I'm left wondering whether the Mission Statement is the philosophy behind an organisation which was later hijacked by people who failed the BNP Membership IQ test, or whether it has been a smokescreen all along.

&gt;The EDL promotes the understanding of Islam and the implications for non-Muslims forced to live alongside it. Islam is not just a religious system, but a political and social ideology that seeks to dominate all non-believers and impose a harsh legal system that rejects democratic accountability and human rights. It runs counter to all that we hold dear within our British liberal democracy, and it must be prepared to change, to conform to secular, liberal ideals and laws, and to contribute to social harmony, rather than causing divisions.

The words ""Christ"" and ""Christian"" don't appear anywhere within the statement.

&gt;The EDL is therefore keen to draw its support from people of all races, all faiths, all political persuasions, and all lifestyle choices. Under its umbrella, all people in England, whatever their background, or origin, can stand united in a desire to stop the imposition of the rules of Islam on non-believers. In order to ensure the continuity of our culture and its institutions, the EDL stands opposed to the creeping Islamisation of our country, because intimately related to the spread of Islamic religion is the political desire to implement an undemocratic alternative to our cherished way of life: the sharia.

I wonder who actually wrote their mission statement. I have a very hard time believing it was any of their high-profile members or leaders.

&gt;British Muslims should be able to safely demand reform of their religion, in order to make it more relevant to the needs of the modern world and more respectful of other groups in society. It is important that they completely reject the views of those who believe that Islam should be taken in its ‘original’, 7th century form, because these interpretations are the antithesis of Western democracy. The onus should be on British Muslims to overcome the problems that blight their religion and achieve nothing short of an Islamic reformation. In line with this, we should do all that we can to empower those who are willing to take this path. We must also ensure that they do not fear reprisals from those who, in line with these 7th century interpretations, would force sharia law upon them.

More to the point, I wonder how many of their members have actually read it.",0,1358501934,null,0,false,0,c7z3sd5,t3_16s0jr,t1_c7z3sd5,t1_c7yvzfs,null,1431001296,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Then there's the conservative movement, who still observe most of the religious laws but are less hardcore about it, and then there's reform Judaism, which is more secular, progressive and socially very modern. Most of the Jews I know belong to Reform communities and are as likely to be found in the pub as in synagogue. In other words, it's possible within Judaism to be a good Jew, who is accepted in synagogue and still be completely progressive when it comes to social issues.

At the moment there isn't an equivalent movement in Islam. There are plenty of gay/left-wing/trans Muslims but there doesn't seem to be any Muslim community that accepts them.

And no Mosque should ever have to distance from the actions of a Muslim country. No one expects religious institutions to have to defend the actions of countries across the world that have nothing to do with them. 

The problem arises when you have divisive institutions such as the Muslim Council of Great Britain, which sees fit to comment on every single action in Gaza but which ignores the actions of Muslims in Britain - the very people they are supposed to represent.

true,myimportantthoughts,null,I AM A HUGE FISH,"This is a novel idea, but I can see a few problems: First, how would ministers be picked from the MPs? I would imagine that someone with experience in healthcare (eg. a doctor or nurse) would be a good candidate for Minister for Health. Similarly, an economist would seem an obvious choice for chancellor of the exchequer. However, there are not that many doctors or economists, which would mean that some random person with no knowledge of economics could be chancellor. This (to me) seems crazy. However, we have had many chancellors with no economic knowledge under the current system, so this may not be a major drawback.

However, I do think that putting (say) 12 random adults into the house of commons (without their own constituency) would be a great idea. When the commons is made up of 3 tightly run parties, it is common for popular views to go unheard, simply because the 3 party leaders do not support the idea. Even if these 12 people had no power at all, they might at least bring up ideas that would otherwise go unheard in parliament. This might prevent parliament from announcing a new policy, then realising after a week that it is unpopular and reversing it. Maybe 'pastygate' would not have happened if some random truck driver shouted 'leave the pasties alone Cameron or I'll cut you' mid announcement. 

So I do not think that this idea is as ridiculous as it sounds at first, I do think that replacing the lords spiritual (bishops in the house of lords) with 12 random people would be a good idea. This would also be good for getting more young people in the house of parliament / lords, which is terribly underrepresented. While feminist groups decry (rightly) the lack of women in government, the House of Lords is entirely made up of people aged 35 or older (link: http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-members/). This is really outrageous, a ful 1/3 or so of the population has no representation in the upper house of our legislature. It is hardly surprising that young people are not interested in politics when it is entirely made up of people of a different generation.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"The qualification for each country varies; European countries are ranked based on how well clubs from their national leagues have performed in European competitions in the past 5 years - similar to how tennis players are ranked/seeded based on recent performances. The higher your country ranks, the more spots it gets in the Champions/Europa League.

England are one of the top ranked nations in Europe, and I'll explain the basic qualification guide for English clubs for European competitions below.

For English clubs, the teams that finish **1st, 2nd or 3rd in the league** automatically qualify for the **group stages of next season's Champions League**. The team that finishes **4th in the league** goes into a **Champions League qualification round** that comes before the group stages, where it needs to play a two-legged knockout tie against another European team that made the qualification round from its league (say, the team that came 4th in Spain).

The team that finishes **5th in the league** automatically qualifies for the **group stages of next season's Europa League**, as does the team that **wins the FA Cup**. The team that **wins the Capital One Cup** goes into a **Europa League pre-group stage qualification round**, similar to the one for the Champions League; except it has to play two two-legged knockout ties.

That's what happened to Liverpool this season - we won the Capital One Cup (which was then the Carling Cup) last season, so we played a two-legged knockout tie against FC Gomel, and after winning that we played another two-legged knockout tie against Hearts, and upon winning that we reached the group stages of the Europa League.

But remember, all that is because England are ranked so highly in Europe. Italy, for example, only have guaranteed group spots for the teams that finish 1st &amp; 2nd in the league; 3rd place goes into the qualification round, and 4th into the Europa League group stages. Somewhere like Hungary obviously has even fewer qualification spots.

That's the basic outline - there's other rules, e.g. what happens if a team that finishes in the top 3 also wins a cup, etc., but it gets messy and I forget how it works half the time.

In terms of knowing what match is on when you visit, fixtures are generally released around June. Having said that, fixtures can change due to European commitments (oh dear) or cup replays. 

Buying a ticket will then depend on what match is scheduled for when you visit. Realistically, without at the very least a membership, getting a ticket for a home premier league match is unlikely. Your options are Viagogo and the premium they exact for using their services, but even this is not guaranteed if the match is a biggie such as Arsenal/Liverpool/Man Utd, as returns will be hard to come by.

Tickets go on general sale 4 weeks in advance, however at this point they may have sold out - indeed if it's a big match like a London derby or the Mancs or Scousers are coming it will not go on general sale. 

There are touts like Viagogo where you can also go to to get tickets. For the smaller name matches it's reasonable, but if we're playing a big team it's cost a fair bit, more than face value. There's also a guy on here who I've had a ticket from before (season ticket holder) and might be able to get you one (or more, how many do you want?). 

Prices range from £47 to £82 depending on where you are sitting, whether you are a member and what category match it is. Hopefully for you it's a category B match. Prices [here](http://www.chelseafc.com/tickets-article/article/2640813/title/ticket-prices-2012-13).

every league in england is part of the FA Cup. that means much lower league teams (like Mansfield) compete too. if those teams do well, they progress and play against much higher ranked teams. it's amazing that a league 3 or 4 team can play against a premier league team. as someone mentioned when we played Mansfield, players like Suarez probably earn more than their entire team. What we paid for Suarez is more than their entire club's value. that's not to say Mansfield is a shitty team, it's to illustrate the huge gap (90 odd places) between the two teams ... and they get to play us! i can only imagine how exciting it would be for their players to go toe to toe with the likes of gerrard and suarez.

every now and then you get huge upsets. small teams knocking off championship or premier league teams. burnley springs to mind, they've had a few incredible runs in the FA cup.

true,Malachite6,null,null,"Think about it this way: Oxford gets a lot of applications and the academics are faced with the task of deciding who they want, from amongst applicants who all have really good grades/predicted grades in their exams and strong personal  recommendations.  Their goal in the interview is to try and find out whether the person they are interviewing is going to get a lot out of the course they applied for.  

The interview might last for 20 minutes, or more. You may well have 2 or more interviews.

The exact questions, and style of questions, will depend on the interviewer, but they are trying to find out how your mind grapples with issues concerned with the subject you've applied for.  They might ask you some questions to find out whether you've been reading in the subject area, or carrying out other activities, and they want to know whether you are genuinely interested in the subject.  

But then, more importantly, they will ask something that allows them to see how you think in the context of the subject you applied for, not brain-teasers necessarily, but more something thought-provoking.  They're aware that people come from wildly differing backgrounds, so they aren't going to be questions that require too much background knowledge, and you aren't expected to know the answer. (When I was interviewing, if someone had said ""Oh I know this one, the answer is ..."" that would have been no use to me, I would have had to try another question that they hadn't seen before.) They want to see *how* you tackle the question. And they may well prompt/help you a bit - they want to hear what your thinking is like, and whether you can think in a way that would suit the course.
 
To see the kind of thing, I suggest search for ""Oxbridge interview questions"" - if Google isn't any help then go look at the websites of British newspapers, they have certainly published several articles with sample questions, over the years.

Also, very important to remember: they are interested in finding people who will be good students at the university. They are **not** trying to trip you up. Their demeanours may vary, but essentially they are trying to be kind and give you an opportunity to show you what you can do.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Statistics can easily be manipulated to say what you want to say. The famous saying 'Anybody with two legs has more than the average number of legs' comes about by the skew caused by those with one or no legs. However, there are different forms of 'average'. Do we simply take the mean number of legs (how many legs per person if they're evenly distibuted) or do we take the modal (most occuring) number or even the median (the number of legs the middle person has assuming they're ordered from least to most).

Likewise, if you look at a population, one can make the statistical prediction that say, 0.07 people out of 100,000 will be a victim of gun crime. You take the entire population into account and make an estimste based on rates in a population - this is what insurance companies do (and also why they need to be so big to make it work). If you, however, look at an individual, its not the same. You cant say that this person has a 0.00000007 percent chance of being shot.

Look at it this way. An unstable nucleus of an atom has an x percent chance of decaying. Needless to say, this atom could outlive the universe, or decay tomorrow. Take a large enough sample though, and you can say with confidence that x percent of those atoms will decay.

What you're doing with the claim that people are 5 times more likely to be shot is saying that the statistical chance of a person to be shot is the same type of data as the probability that someone wins the lottery. We all know its more likely that someone involved in violent gangs is more likely to be shot than your granny, so the claim is based off a false statistic.

Its a bit like telling a white couple they have a 1 in 7 chance of their child becoming Chinese because statistically one in 7 children born are Chinese.

*Edit:* in case that didnt help, let me explain one more way.

My friend Mike wins the lottery. Hurray for him, he's beaten the odds and is now a multimillionaire. However, being the miser he is, he decides its not enough and keeps buying lotto tickets. What are the chances he wins again?

Statistically, only a handful of people have won the lottery twice. So he is almost certainly not going to win it again.

However, the probability of him winning again is in fact exactly the same as the probability of someone who has never won.

I wasn't telling anyone how to worship but if you're a Christian you pretty much have to believe the entire thing. If God didn't write the Bible through men then you're acknowledging that it was made up. If you're acknowledging that it was made up or embelished then you're basically casting a whole lot of doubt over the story of Christ which is what the entire religion is based on.

And throughout the time church has made concession after concession to moderate believers AS WELL AS non-believers with regards to the genesis of the universe, Earth's place in it, age of the Earth yada-yada-yada.

I RESPECT moderate Christians so much more. They're equals to me and their belief in God gives them strength and that's fine by me. I wouldn't WANT them to be fanatics, I'm merely pointing out that the fanatics are the true believers because they don't cherry pick.

True believers, however, are a danger and should be dealt with if they become a problem like these two young gentlemen have.

People can worship however or whatever they want so long as they aren't hurting anyone or interfering with the politics of this country.

however if you happened to be that very depressed 50 year old man I apologize. Why would you want to be confined to a concrete cell for the rest of your life? You have little contact with anybody. The correctional officers don't give a shit whether you die, vomit blood everywhere, or overdose on drugs you somehow got into your hellhole. The food, although available, is trash. Did you fuck up your relationship with the guard? that sucks cause now he'll piss in your food and you won't be able to do anything about getting a fresher meal. Good climate? depends on where you live. You'd pretty much be cold and wet everywhere you went except Socal, and we can use some of your ample rain to help out with our drought. the Northeast (humidity, Blizzards), East Coast (hurricanes and storms), south (more hurricanes and storms plus humidity and BP), Midwest (Tornadoes) and the Northwest (rain and no sun). Fuck even California has it's fair share of shitholes. Once you spend ten minutes locked up in a cell in Northern Nevada hours North of Las Vegas you'd wish you were dead. I don't know where the thought of staying in a cell surrounded by murderers and rapists would be more pleasant than eating shitty British food.

so here is what I'm suggesting you do. contact a mental health agency that is closest to you and talk to them about your problems. It's nice having somebody to talk to, even if you're just bitching about your problems. Find a hobby that can potentially make you money. Take me for example. I take clothing, usually jeans or shorts, and attach hidden pockets into them so kids can sneak in joints or whatever into a concert. On any given week I can make a few hundred dollars or so. Not bad for a half-ass job. you're 50 so I'm guessing you're not in the best shape physically. I would contact a health professional seeing as you lucky Euros have free access to health care and whatnot. See what they suggest for someone in your condition. Confined to your house? well that's nobodies fault but your own. Get outside. Even if it means sitting at a park bench and reading a book. Learn another language. Get a fifty dollar guitar from the internet and learn to play. Write to your local parliament member and tell him to fix shit around your neighborhood. need something to watch other than British people examining our fine American penitentiaries, go to movie2k.to and find a movie you've always wanted to see. Read a Russian epic or Kafka. Hate all of the above? Save some money and go to France or somewhere. Buy some tools and fix up your flat.

* Underclass: Chronically unemployed, no skills, often criminal (aka ""chavs"", ""scallies"", etc. See Shameless)
* Working Class: Manual labourers, admin staff, e.g. plumbers, builders, call centre staff, secretaries, etc. Will usually have vocational qualifications or occasionally a degree.
* Middle Class: Professionals such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, etc. Degree qualified.
* Upper Class: Landed gentry, e.g. Lords, Barons, etc. You get into the upper class by being born into it. 

Note that the classes actually have little to do with money. You can be very wealthy and be working class (e.g. Wayne Rooney, Posh Spice, etc.). Likewise you can be a Duke and not have a penny to your name but still be upper class by virtue of breeding. The other thing to remember is that one class is not necessarily ""better"" than another. The working class are often enormously proud of being working class, for example, and there is no shame in it. However no one wants to be called a chav!

I was signing on one day in 2001, it was one of those irksome 'between contracts' points and I just wanted the NI stamp.  Inside where two staff talking about a third (who wasn't present) and the suspension with pay they'd just been handed. 

For signing on FIVE times. 

Both of the staff agreed that signing on THREE times was perfectly acceptable and everyone does that but FIVE was just too damn much.  Intimating that their is a generally attitude in a lot of DWP staff that they can top up their wages by finding an unused NINO and claiming JSA on it until the system starts to notice and then move on to another. 

My understanding is that NINO's are recycled so it's perfectly possible that these people have not only defrauded the state but also totally screwed over peoples tax records in the process.

A state of mind is a very complex thing, and given my short, context free rant, you can be forgiven for thinking I might be depressed.  I don't think I am.  Not seriously anyway.  Perhaps a little blue.  But given the state of the current job market, that's understandable.  I've always worked professional jobs, and I'm now coming up on 2 years without one.  That's the longest save ever been unemployed, and I see no light at the end of this economic eurotunnel yet.

It's not just the economy.  It's this whole profession.  I've been working in IT for 25 years +.  I used to find it exciting.  No longer.  Perhaps it's my age. Perhaps it's the maturity of the profession.  Perhaps I'm finding it hard to compete with new graduates.  Most likely, it's a complex combination of the above plus many other things.  Also, I'm totally sick of worrying about money.  It's a new experience for me.

stitching in pockets for stoners and the like isn't a living, it serves to supplement me as a fulltime student. I have connections to the cannabis industry so it helps and it introduces me to many interesting characters. also I'd like to imagine I can prevent someone using a controlled substance from an unnecessary prison term. also, the weed is free and goes as far as the eye can see. I love California.

Unemployed for 2 years huh? Unfortunately I'm unskilled and unwise to the ways of IT. Also as a non-UK resident I can't help you find loans or money to go back to school. You're only 50 so a fresh start isn't impossible, but your door is closing. I would see what other careers your experience in IT can get you. Can you teach programming to students or an online course? It might not be much but it's something to put your energy into. What I honestly suggest is learning a language, most likely French. Get proficient enough that you can help tutor kids trying to grasp the language. That's just me speaking as a linguist though. 

If you play in a band, I suggest you learn songs you can play in a park or city center.
_________  
and yes it's center and not centre. Color doesn't have a ""u"" in it. you don't pronounce it col-OUR or hon-OUR. And how come you guys end sentences in periods but separate your whole numbers from decimals by comma?  
_________  
It'll help you earn some cash and helps get outside. It doesn't sound like you got a significant other, so playing an instrument helps getting a woman or a man depending on what you're into. Check out a dating site or two or have a friend or bandmate introduce you to a nice girl. if you already have a nice girl, save for a trip. I know that plane tickets aren't that expensive between Euro countries. 

Why not join a big brother program or something? You know help a kid in trouble by providing an example as a role model. Or volunteer cleaning up trash in your neighborhood. Or support your local non-league club. Just something to get all this angst out of you. I'm assuming you're not part of the tribe so there is no reason you should be kvetshing to the point of shvitzing, that's our job.

On reflection, I can form some idea of the justification of this move. Judging by comments made by Nigel at various points in time (most notably after gaining promotion against Coventry) it seems that his remit was to get us to the Premier League and that soon after that happened, the plan was always for him to be replaced and for us to bring in someone to take us to the 'next level'. Given Adkins' track record prior to this, it makes sense. Regardless of how well Adkins has done this season, if Cortese believed him to be nearing his full ability, then he would need replacing to ensure the club progresses as quickly as they can.

Pochettino has some pedigree. La Liga Manager of the Year 2011, ahead of Pep/Mourinho. Finished 8th soon after. Poor start to this season, but by all accounts was financially handicapped relative to other clubs. Such a problem will not hold him back at Saints in the near future. Spanish press seem to hold him as having lots of potential and claiming that he is a talented manager. I think this could be a shrewd appointment, in the sense that he appears to have the tools to take us further. The issues for me are whether he can win over the dressing room quickly enough (let's face it, they must be shocked and we were a strong team unit with Adkins at the helm) and whether or not his English is good enough. He has a translator with him, which is not a great sign. If he wins over the dressing room, we won't be in immediate danger this season.

The decision appears to make sense, the big issue is timing. The effect upon team morale, fan morale and managing the fan backlash to Adkins' dismissal. I don't feel Adkins saw it as a surprise and the replacement looks as though he could be a shrewd appointment. If the fans and players pull together and get behind Pochettino, it could prove to be the catalyst to greater success, but it's a massive risk considering we're in good form, given Nigel's familiarity with the squad and popularity with the fans. Cortese hasn't got a big call wrong yet, though. Bit of faith will get us a long way.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's pretty common in the Grand Tours. Well, the Tour and the Giro anyway. In the Vuelta d'Espana (the best of the three in my not-particularly humble opinion) it's a relatively new development. 

The first time the tour started outside France was 1954, in Amsterdam. In terms of the number of tours there have been that's more than half its history ago. It's been a thing on and off since then. The Giro D'Italia started in Denmark last year. 

One of the major facts about TV coverage of the Tour in particular is that half the people who watch the daytime coverage aren't that interested in the cycling. Many are watching for the scenery, and towns and villages all over France compete for the right for it to come through their town. And then when it does they spend millions on tidying the road surfaces, fixing the village up and so on. And then the whole lot has passed through, usually in under ten minutes.

Besides the bike race itself the Tour is a moneymaking machine. The number of people who see it live and in the flesh each year is in the several millions. The various regions are competing for some of that, and they're competing for the tourism advertising implicit in having a scene like this happen in your area and on international TV:

Tends to be younger people that eat pork. In recent years the more Islamist Turkish government has tried to block pork production in Turkey, but there's a longstanding Turkish tradition of pork production, not to mention the national drink, Raki and of course beer like Efes. Not all muslims are the same. I have muslim friends from Bosnia who eat various types of spiced pork sausage meat.

Also bear in mind that Pork is prohibited in Leviticus 11:7-8 and Deuteronomy 14:8. 7th day adventists and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church are against the idea of eating pork.

In actual fact, bans on pork precede Abrahamic religions like Islam and Judaism. We know that pork was banned in ancient Syria long before Islam or Christianity. It's believed that the reason for this is because people didn't know how to treat pork meat to keep it fresh and pigs are susceptible to parasites that if ingested can make you really, really ill.

Islam specifically says that you can eat pork or non-halal meat if you don't have an alternative (i.e. you're hungry and there isn't a non-pork option, which would be surprisingly common in parts of Italy and Spain for example).",0,1358519517,null,0,false,0,c7z69ec,t3_16s0jr,t1_c7z69ec,t1_c7z5qi1,null,1431002495,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

It's important to note that the bystander effect happens even if we're not talking about drunks; it is caused by the fact that nobody wants to be the first to act; it's actually not a selfish thing, it's simply that we don't want to impose ourselves were we are not wanted.  Once one person acts, you see that instantly five more gather round.  Bizarrely, the bystander effect increases the more bystanders there are.  None of them wants to stand out from the others.

It's worth being aware of and preconditioning yourself to not being embarassed about ""being the first"".  If you think that someone is freezing to death, and they're not, the worst that happens is you look a bit foolish.  If you ignore someone who's freezing to death because you're embarassed then the worst that happens is someone dies.

true,loveandmoney,1986,,"The words in this title do not belong together. He had maybe 10 good games in his whole Chelsea career. Yes he played in the Nou Camp and the final and I'm grateful he didn't fuck it up, but if Ivanovic wasn't suspended then he wouldn't have been on the pitch. He always struck me as an isolated and prickly customer, remember his comments about Tom Hening Ovrebo after the semi final against Barca which he was banned for? I found it funny and agreed at the time, but he always seemed like an unpleasant guy and this article certainly suggests the same.

But I would look past all of this if it wasn't for his antics during the trophy lifting. It's already been mentioned here but it's been eating at me since as well and I wanna vent. Lamps and Terry were meant to lift the trophy together as had become customary, they asked Drogba to lift it with them because they knew what a role he had played and that he could well be on his way out of Chelsea. And then, just when they were about to lift it, that little Portugese cunt decides it is going to be his big moment, not Terry who had the anguish of Moscow and all the others, or Lamps who had just captained us through the final, or Didier, the hero of the night, but Jose fucking Bosingwa, the fucking average right back who made no contribution of note throughout the competition, had been at the club a fraction of the time they all had, he was going to be the star. 

He robbed us Chelsea fans of the defining image of that team, the pinnacle of this Chelsea era is forever stained with his ugly mono-brow and shit eating smile. I just don't know where he found the balls to do that, I can't believe JT didn't push him away, Lampard is squashed awkwardly, unceremoniously, Drogba and Terry completely obscured. Even Joey Barton said on twitter something about how Chelsea had messed up the trophy lift. All the posters, the front of the DVD etc, all had Bosingwa and not the others centre stage because there simply isn't a good photo without him in it.

Considering the narrative is that British muslims are made extreme through seeing British forces invading and occupying Muslim countries, I think the global zeitgeist is highly relevant. Also your ""indonesia"" argument is a false equivalency. Muslim organisations in the UK have no or no significant official support network with the Indonesian government, where as Britain and Israel have direct financial and military ties to dubious operations in various countries. The BBC consistently covers for Israel's crimes as do most of the media and political class. It's a complex situation with micro and macro level inputs.

On the one hand, Doctor Who is a show that frequently (not always, but frequently) reaches really impressive heights and depths of emotional resonance. It explores really fascinating themes about humanity, about storytelling, about love, death, curiosity, childhood, the joy and wonder of the universe and the universal struggle of good vs evil. It creates and explores complex and engaging characters, and it breaks open, mixes up, recombines and breaks open again the boundaries of conventional narrative and genre.

On the other hand, the ""b-movie"" feel, the often rather camp sensibility, the melodramatic, often hammy performances, and the low production values are all really part of the show's aesthetic. They're in the series' DNA, and it does all of the above within that kind of style.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The point is you can't use a general statistic and apply it to an individual. And by telling one person they have a higher probability of being stabbed, that's what you are doing.

If you addressed 100,000 people, and told them that 0.07 of them are going to be a victim of gun crime, you'd be statistically correct. That is, given a random sample of 100,000 people, there would indeed be 0.07 cases of gun crime victim. But if you take a random individual, the same chance no longer applies. The statistic will apply to a large sample, but given the number of different factors affecting an individual case, there 'noise' masks the underlying distribution.

Its the diffrrence between a probability and a statistic that's key. A probability is a prediction whilst a statistic is simply a nice way of viewing data. You can apply a statistic to a large sample but you still wouldnt be able to tell an individual within that sample what their chances are with any certainty.

In couple x's case, they have roughly 50 percent chance of having a male child. But when that child is born, the fact that they are male is a statistic not a probability. The data says that one person is male. Its no longer a probability.

In an offshoot of shroedinger's cat experiment, you can see the case explained. Ignoring quantum physics, if there is a cat inside a box with a radioactive substance that may or may not release a poison, that cat is both dead and alive until you observe whats inside.

It jars me that the hard work fallacy is raised every time someone wants to take a snipe at the rich. The jobs market is just that - a market. The reason cleaners/bartenders/waiters are paid naff-all is because their job requires no prior experience and there is always a surplus of people willing to take the job if you don't want it. A top league footballer may have an easier job but he also has skills that companies are willing to pay top dollar for. Of course the salaries of some bankers/footballers/executives are ridiculous, but that's only because the corporations have allowed it to get out of hand by perpetually outbidding one another.

Dollhouse is another great sci-fi from Whedon. You have to stick with it though, the first 7 episodes or so are a bit 'meh'.

Stargate; film and all of the different TV series. 

Film wise, for less action orientated stuff, I would recommend Gattaca, Moon and Sunshine (last act is a bit... strange). 

A great British sci-fi comedy film with Chris O'Dowd is FAQ about time travel. It's a light-hearted little thing. Good fun.

If anything else comes to mind, I'll give you a shout!

Others:

* Farscape (telly)
* In Time (film, made by the same chap in charge of Gattaca)
* Monsters (a low budget independent film. Great watch)
* John Carter (a light-hearted romp, I enjoyed it, as much as the critics panned it)

Excellent method of argument, I can see you aren't really here for discourse so for any else who is watching:

&gt; As Israel’s ‘Operation Pillar of Defense’ was beginning on 14-15 November a man called Jonathan Sacerdoti [**...the director of an innocuously named organisation called the Institute for Middle Eastern Democracy...**] appeared four times as a guest on different BBC television news programmes, asked to comment on Israel’s actions in Gaza. [...] 

&gt; Each of his appearances was unchallenged. On one occasion he was joined by another commentator, Shashank Joshi of the military oriented think thank the Royal United Services Institute, but Joshi offered an almost identical perspective. [...]

&gt; But Sacerdoti is exactly the opposite of a disinterested ‘expert’ voice on the ongoing violence. **Just two years ago he was Director of Public Affairs for the Zionist Federation, perhaps the loudest and most shrill pro-Israel lobby group in the UK.** [[link]](http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/who_is_jonathan_sacerdoti_the_bbcs_go_to_man_on_gaza)

The Qu'ran is meant to be taken literally. There are metaphors and things of that nature in the Quran, but the rulings &amp; rules that Muslims are supposed to live by are meant to be understood literally by a true Muslim, hence why countries like Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan etc are so oppressive; these countries are merely being good Muslims.


And let two men from among you bear witness to all such documents [contracts of loans without interest]. But if two men be not available, there should be one man and two women to bear witness so that if one of the women forgets (anything), the other may remind her. (Maududi, vol. 1, p. 205).

AKA a woman's testimony is half that of a man's


4:34 . . . If you fear highhandedness from your wives, remind them [of the teaching of God], then ignore them when you go to bed, then hit them. If they obey you, you have no right to act against them. God is most high and great. (Haleem, emphasis added)

Well, I see the Qu'ran advocates domestic abuse as well!


65:1 O Prophet, when you [and the believers] divorce women, divorce them for their prescribed waiting—period and count the waiting—period accurately . . . 4 And if you are in doubt about those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, (you should know that) their waiting period is three months, and the same applies to those who have not menstruated as yet. As for pregnant women, their period ends when they have delivered their burden. (Maududi, vol. 5, pp. 599 and 617, emphasis added)

Let's not forget the fact that the Prophet Muhammed is a pedophile (inb4 fatwa on me) 

""Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do they prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, nor follow the religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of subjection.""

Well, these lads are doing a good job then.
