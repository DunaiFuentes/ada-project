Also, others will disagree, but I reckon Qualisea does the best fish and chips in Eastbourne. Head up Terminus Road (the main shopping Street) towards the seafront, and as you get out of the pedestrianised bit it's on the left hand corner across the road.

Moreover, the clothes helps to support it and the general attitude of 9 can guide one to think so too.  A theory I read once said the various regenerations gain an emotional identity based on how they lived and what they experienced in their last form.

To think that the police can be made to drop their pet theory simply by you answering their questions is a bit naive. If the police think that you are guilty of something, every answer you give to their questions will simply make them even more convinced of your guilt. Confirmation bias.

Sometimes, refusing to answer questions is the best course of action when dealing with the police.

[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik), as NibblyPig points out above, is very American in tone, but it does demonstrate why you need to be careful when dealing with the police, even when you have nothing to hide.

And whilst they're the sons of the rich and powerful and the rich and powerful control this system then it's never going to change. 

And also whilst these people are placed at the top of our government then it's never going to be a government remotely concerned with the needs of the many. 

That's why they don't give a fuck about stepping on the poor and disadvantaged . To them the poor and disadvantaged are irrelevant, the working class something to be used as a cash cow, the middle class something to be used to control the working class. 

They probably balk at the mere thought of social security for the lower classes, especially if they're in any way responsible for paying for it. 



In contrast the Northern comprehensive school I attended trained us for nothing more than working in the local factories. University was never mentioned. 

Trying to climb from my system up to their system is pretty much an impossibility. The system is basically designed from the top down so it can't be done.

Considering that his meddling was/ is against the laws of his own race ""vigilante"" is a pretty good discription. But although he has been on trial on Gallifray (twice) the time lords tolerated his misbehavior. The main reason for this is that they realized that they can use him to dircumvent their own rules when they ""needed"" to. And because of gratitude because he saved them a few times as well. 
And after the Time War, the laws of the Time Lords can hardly be enforced any more. I think he tries to become a guardian and protector of the Universe then but that is more than a bit too much to handle even for him. Putting that on top of what his role in the time war it is understandable that he has more an more reason to see darkness in himself. 

The Doctor always does what he believes to be the right thing. Most of the time that works out but somtimes he is wrong. He is motivated by curiosity as well and if he would not be able to enjoy excitement and danger he hardly would not have lived his life for so long in this way.

But this also depends heavily on which incarnation we are talking about.

Freedom of speech is the freedom to state *your opinions* about whatever you want to anyone who will listen. Freedom of speech is *not* about the right to smear someone's reputation based on a series of lies.

Or rather you're allowed to say it, but then you must accept the consequences. 

Unbridled rights without responsibilities actually diminishes the meaning of the rights in the first place and is partly why we're in this situation. 

If freedom of speech was held as sacrosanct and the press took their responsibilities to make sure they didn't misrepresent fact seriously, then we'd never be in a position where we are considering regulating the press. Instead people like you use freedom of speech to protect themselves from the consequences of spreading lies and slander about people.

I'm a great believer in freedom of speech when it comes to people's *opinions* which they should be able to write and publish whatever they want, even if I disagree with it entirely.

If you look at say the Daily Mail though, they investigated Ed Milliband's father after he mention him in his speeches.

Should they be entitled to investigate the history and political views of the father of the leader of the opposition? Yes

Should they be entitled to publish the results of their investigation in their paper? Yes

Should they be allowed to publish, without consequence, the accusation that Ed Milliband's father ""hated"" Britain as if it were fact?

I think not. The thing that I disliked most about that story was that if you read the headline and the sub-header the article implied they had found a diary entry which read ""Dear diary, I hate Britain and all that it stands for ahahahaha"".

They even acknowledged that the headline was deliberately provocative, and justified that newspapers do this all the time. Why do we live in a country where newspapers are able to present opinion as fact without consequence?

If they had published an article detailing how Ed Milliband's father was a socialist and stood against a lot of British traditions etc. and then wanted to explain that, in their view, Britain shouldn't elect a man who stood against everything that (in their opinion) Britain is about... that's fine.

&gt;  I wonder where the best place for these town would be. I imagine here in the south east … 

I don't know about [all of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom) but Milton Keynes, Crawley, Welwyn Garden City, Stevenage, Bracknell and Hemel Hempstead - these are all on motorways, 45 - 60 minutes from London and well served (I'm sure) by railway, too.

&gt; …  how you get people to live in the new town. There must be incentives given to businesses, right? Without jobs, no one will live there.

The first building in Milton Keynes was cheap terraces for the construction workers who were (I think) guaranteed a council house (pre-Thatcher) if they had a job there.

They laid down the grid-roads and I guess employers were attracted by the promise of a brand new corporate headquarters 5 minutes walk from the train station, without much difficulty hunting around for vacant premises. Likewise industrial units and warehouses were modern and purpose-designed, 5 or 10 minutes from the motorway.

I guess it's like the development of any city, except rapidly accelerated because the development corporation had these huge resources from buying land at agricultural prices and selling it with planning permission.

Personally I believe that a more rehab based system would allow prisoners the right to vote because they would then care a little more on how society is run, the society that they ~~will~~ may soon be released back into. By keeping them from voting, we are emphasising that they are no longer welcome into our society. 'They have forfeited that right' means to me that they are no longer welcome.

I fail to see how a justice system based on not rehabilitation but punishment and retribution is a good one.

*Late for a speaking appointment he set off from his office at 7.30pm and cycled towards the main Downing Street gates leading onto Whitehall.*

*Mr Mitchell confirmed that he had been prevented from passing through the main gates on a number of previous occasions but decided to try again that evening as he was in a rush.*

*He claimed he said to the officer at the bottom of Downing Street: “Please open the gates.”*

*According to him the officer responded: “No, please get off your bike and leave by the pedestrian exit.”*

*Mr Mitchell then said: “Please open the gates I am the Chief Whip; I work here at Number 9.”*

*But the officer again responded: “No, you have to get off your bike and wheel it out.”*

*Mr Mitchell continued: “Look, I have already been in and out several times today. Please open the gates.”*

*But the police officer again replied: “No.”*

*Mr Mitchell said he then dismounted his bicycle and wheeled it across to the pedestrian side exit but in doing so muttered: “I thought you guys were supposed to ❊❊❊❊❊❊❊ help us.”*

The major issue is the headline gives the impression that this fall is a ""good thing"" but we are still at the same level of unemployment we were at in the depths of the recession:

~~1) The period covered includes the traditional hiring times when companies take in new staff as people graduate~~
****ETA - The numbers are supposed to be seasonally adjusted so I'm wrong on point 1. I don't agree with the seasonal adjustment being totally accurate mind you (and that's not something I trot out now that I have cocked up on this, I have always held that view of ONS seasonal adjustment having problems though I've never dug into the maths before) but it's hard to know what the effect will be (under or overestimation) without loads of digging****

2) Evidence of this is the total fell by 17,000 but the percentage stayed the same because more people are looking for work over this period - this is bad news!

3) The part time issue is central to this issue at the moment as we hit a record high of part time workers total, total as a percentage of job force (I think) and growth in part-time jobs.

With the growth of other forms of communications, the amount of traditional addressed mail has shrunk dramatically so the PO now undertakes large scale commercial distribution to maintain it's income. 

Partly due to this change, and partly for political reasons, it was felt, (rightly or wrongly), that the PO should be privatised.

As part of the preparation for privatisation there have been changes in working practices and working conditions to make the organisation more attractive to the market place. One of these changes was to the pension rights of PO workers.

When the shares in the PO were sold, the allocation favoured small investors and employees over large institutions. The lack of availability for institutions has forced the price up - leading to accusations it was undersold.

The PO unions object to :-

- The adverse change in their working conditions
- The principal of the sale of the PO
- The price at which the shares were sold 

Where does that leave us?

- The shares have been sold and many PO workers will make a profit selling the shares at current market rates.
- A strike will damage the commercial viability of the PO leading to a contraction of the business.
- Strikers will lose pay during the strike but will be unable to reverse what has already happened.
- Many people will not care about a strike because snailmail is not the essential service it once was.
- Many PO workers will loose their job completely rather than just some of their previous benefits.

Edit: As has been pointed out to me - the term PO should really be Royal Mail as that is the part that was involved in this privatisation

I'd like to see John Hurt as the 8th Doctor grown old.  He started as the cool, fun Paul McGann version of the Doctor... but lived so long and through so many horrors that he lost track of who he was.  Timelords age slowly, right?  So he'd have had to live through centuries of war to grow as old as Hurt (from McGann's age).  It's just more tragic of a story this way.  That a good man was physically and mentally molded into a completely different and far harsher man through years of pain and hardship... rather than simply regenerating into a new person and skipping that development.  It also leaves some room for a McGann cameo and some incredible acting work from him showing the beginning of his decline.

Lastly, I'd love to see Hurt regenerate into 9 at the end of the episode.  The old war-hardened Doctor finds his humanity in his last few minutes of life (a bit of McGann left in him).  Perhaps he sacrifices himself to save the others.  Not only this, but he welcomes his imminent regeneration.  The 8th doctor (John Hurt) is old and tired after living such a long life of war and horrors.  He wants to be freed of all those thoughts and memories, and just begin again as an entirely new man.

11, Clara, 10, and Rose all make their escape as 8 (John Hurt) meets his end and regenerates into 9.  Rose turns around, for only a moment, just in time to see Eccleston's face just as the regeneration-light clears.  They make eye contact.  The [9th Doctor's theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyIP5nrJ8gY) is heard.  But Rose is yanked away by 10, still escaping with the rest of them, before she can say anything.  

Eccleston's cameo could be filmed in **one** simple shot.  But if he didn't want to film anything even this simple, as he previously stated, the shot could be just as easily accomplished with old footage of him digitally added into the scene (as they've done in the past).  We know they have the rights to his likeness as they've shown footage of him many times before.  We get a 9 cameo, Eccleston doesn't have to come anywhere near set.  Everyone wins.

This is what I hope to see in the 50th.  Something like this.  Though I know, no matter what, that the *Doctor Who* writers will do a great job.  They always do.  So I'm not worried.  I'm incredibly excited.

---

EDIT:  Yes, I completely understand that John Hurt's character doesn't refer to *himself* as The Doctor... [even though the makers of the show really seemed to make it clear that *they* refer to him as such](http://doctorandcompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130531-103009-pm.jpg).

No matter what he is calling himself, he would be the ninth incarnation of ""*the Time Lord we know as The Doctor*"".  Even if he doesn't play along with his more popular self-proclaimed alias.

One can certainly argue that he would technically not be the ""9th Doctor"" because he doesn't ever refer *himself* as ""The Doctor"", [even though the show refers to him as such](http://doctorandcompanions.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130531-103009-pm.jpg), but he will still be the 9th version of *that Time Lord* who is known as The Doctor.  

He would be the 9th form of the Time Lord that we know as The Doctor.  That's all I'm saying.  I referred to that Time Lord as The Doctor because that's the only name I have for him.  I completely understand what you're saying though.

I'm sure, if he really is an entirely new regeneration, they'll play it off as you've suggested.  The writers will make sure that he technically isn't a Doctor (*he'll never call himself ""Doctor"" or he'll somehow erase himself from history*) so that it will be clear that the numbers aren't affected and everything can go back to *exactly* how it was before the 50th Anniversary Special.

true,Shuhnaynay,eng-essex,Essex,"Some thoughts:

Despite the rhetoric around this (David Cameron talking about this being ""common sense"" and that the idea of allowing prisoners a vote made him feel ""sick"") we in the UK are surprising isolated amongst our peers (that is, other European nations and countries we share a cultural history with) on the world stage on this. France, Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Sweden all allow at least some prisoners to vote. Also, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia... even Zimbabwe allows some degree of prisoner voting. Amongst our peers, it really is pretty much just us and the USA (although, with some States' lifetime disenfranchisement for felons, we're not quite as bad as them!).

Also, there's a pretty compelling philosophical argument for allowing prisoners to vote. It comes from the idea of the social contract: the idea that citizens and the state are both contracting parties to a social contract, wherein citizens vote a government to enact laws which they promise to follow and which the state promises to enforce. Old thinking went that ""breaching"" that contract by breaking that law meant that the state could punish citizens by removing them of any involvement in that contract (i.e. by separating them from society and removing all their civil rights). But these days we see that not just as antiquated, but also contradicting. The state only has the right to enforce laws because people voted them in. Therefore, what authority does the state have to keep people locked away (and still keep them subject to laws of the land) if they remove their right to vote? If the state takes away criminals' right to vote as a punishment, they actually erode the entire basis of its right to punish at all. Also, when viewed as a traditional contract, it seems massively unfair. In contract law, a contract is invalid if terms of it are so unfair as to make it unconscionable. The idea being that a minor breach of contract (late payment for goods, for example) cannot be used as justification to forfeit all the rights one of the parties had in the contract. The same could be said of a low-level drugs offender having one of his most important rights taken away.

As well, the fact that these guys applied for the electoral roll may indicate they weren't aware that they couldn't vote. That would make sense because at no point is this made aware to prisoners: it's not mentioned in the statute book and it's not mentioned when the offender is sentenced. A key part of human rights law is that if you want to limit a right, it has to pursue a legitimate aim and be prescribed by law. You can't take away a human right without even telling the person you're doing it.

What it comes down to really is whether you think the right to vote is a human right. While that's an open discussion amongst us, it's not really for the UK government as they signed, ratified and acceded to Protocol 1 to the ECHR, section 3 of which includes the right to free elections (since interpreted by the Court to include the right of prisoners to vote). So we signed the thing and now moan that it's being applied.

Outcome needs to be a relevant part of ethical judgements. Otherwise we end up with all manner of naive do gooders screwing things up for everyone.

Unions need direct democracy to be legitimate in my view. Any wider alliance between unions should be loose confederation rather than strictly hierarchical.

As it is this topic has confirmed my suspicions that the people in favour of the unions are precisely the people I would not want to be in a union with.

1) How do we determine motive?  If I fire into a crowd and don't hit anybody is that because of blind luck, or because I actually aimed very carefully to miss everybody?  Or even because subconsciously I didn't want to injure anybody and so fired into a ""safer"" area.  Judging outcomes is relatively easy - somebody is hurt or not, they die or they recover - it's binary.  Judging intentions and motives is incredibly complex and difficult.  It wouldn't work with a system of legal precedent, and would instead necessitate incredibly reflective and introspective juries.  Moreover, the justice system would then become incredibly subjective, multivalent and generally opaque.
 
2) If it was implemented in a justice system, it would simultaneously require far harsher penalties for current ""minor"" offences where nobody is hurt or injured due to chance, while equally resulting in more lenient sentences in tragedies where (for example) a small child is killed due to misfortune and a poor decision.

*But*, we already knew this and there was clear case law on it, so the prisoners didn't have any remedy - both are serving life sentences and the ECtHR case law makes it clear that denying them the vote (through a specific set of rules) would be fine. Had they been serving shorter sentences (say someone serving just a few weeks in prison, which happened to be over an election) their ruling might have been different.

The second argument they raised was that there was a separate right to vote under EU law, but that didn't get anywhere.

For instance this is really quite meaningless.  What is the data that you can't find a comparable set during the last period of significant inflation?  I'd suggest one of two things, one they are too lazy too go back fair enough.  The other, is just plane bias.  I'm guessing its that.

My point is, surely we should compare against a similar background.  It's obvious that things aren't going to be as nice today as they were in 2007.  Why compare the performance against a period when base rates were practically ten times higher and the economies of most of our trading partners booming, whilst major commodities being cheaper.

This was asked a few weeks ago and it's got some really good pointers in. 

I doubt there'll be *too* many ways to make an ass of yourself - we're quite familiar with American tourists, and any blunders you might make will just be brushed off as 'silly foreigner'. You'll probably get some gentle mocking for it, but we don't really mean anything by it. Britons are very good at never taking anything too seriously, so we do get quite puzzled by America's enthusiasm for absolutely *anything*. 

The most obvious things that stand out to me are pub etiquette, I suppose. We've got a *much* bigger drinking culture than Americans, and it's perfectly normal for people to go and have a pub lunch or meet in the pub for a drink after work without being thought of as borderline alcoholics. If you're invited out for a drink with people, take advantage of it! 

Tips aren't anywhere near as necessary or large as they are in the US. If you go to Scotland or Wales, make sure you know that you'll be among the Scots and Welsh, not the English. Most people will be reasonably acquainted with the States, whether through holidays or just the huge amount of American TV programming we recieve. We will talk about the weather just as much as you expect us to. And drink as much tea as you'll expect us to, too.

Oh, and never call your bum a fanny. ",0,1381930602,null,0,false,0,ccstukc,t3_1okjg5,t1_ccstukc,t3_1okjg5,null,1429112118,24,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,24
true,vishbar,null,null,"I'm an American living in the UK. Honestly, if you're a nice person back home, you're almost definitely going to be fine here. One thing to avoid: when you're making the number 2 with your fingers in a V shape, have the palm of your hand facing outwards. If the back of your hand is facing someone, it's a bit like a less intense version of the middle finger. It won't offend anyone when they hear your accent, but it can help to avoid looking foolish.

Also, and this probably won't be a problem, but know the difference between British, Welsh, Scottish, and English :) If you need clarity, this is a great video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10

People, in general, won't be bothered about you being American. If you're in London, people won't give a shit (they wouldn't give a shit if you had green hair and were from Mars; it's like New York). In smaller towns, it'll often be a conversation starter. You'll have people tell you about their trips to the States; it's actually a good way to get to know someone. Very, very few people may have a knee-jerk anti-American response (I've only heard of this from other Americans and have *never* experienced anything like it), but if you encounter someone like that, *they're* the asshole, so don't worry too much about it.

People will tell you ""keep quiet!"" and ""don't talk to strangers on public transit!"", but a lot of those are overly stereotypical ;)

Have a great time! Where will you be going (other than London, of course)? I'd suggest Winchester if you're looking for places to stop.

Although like I've said there is no licence you will need to operate as a letting agent, you **must** have a fairly decent grasp of tenancy law if you're going to start getting involved in evictions etc. Again if you're not wanting to do this I would suggest a basic tenant find service but bear in mind the more you take on, for example the creation and signing of agreements, the more knowledge you will need - a tenancy agreement is a contract, after all. You will need to take on more because in your first few years of business you aren't going to be able to live off of £50 here or there. I would start having a casual browse of http://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/ and maybe the forums over at http://www.landlordzone.co.uk/ which have a number of tenancy law experts posting regularly.

I don't know what students are looking for having not been one for a great deal of time now, however I know that the city I work in has a very large university with a fantastic reputation and (at a guess) 90% of the student lets in the area are either converted HMO, 2 up 2 down terraced houses or converted ex-council housing. Students are not looking at £750/week studio flats in the city centre as far as I am aware. Then again if you are sure there's a group of students out there looking for higher end flats I wouldn't let my closed mindedness stop you from going ahead :)

It serves as one of the last stages in their prison system and focuses on reintegrating offenders into society. It might give you an idea of the kind of people they deal with and the way they deal with them. For example, there's a guy who killed two people with a chainsaw working as a lumberjack, with a chainsaw, as part of his rehabilitation.

You are right about them being seasonally adjusted. There are still issues with the seasonal adjustment mind you in that the algorithm the ONS uses (the X-11 seasonal adjustment) forecasts long term economic trends to normalise against so whenever the ONS figures are wrong, the job estimates are hit as well. In general seasonal adjustment will understate the effect of emerging trends so if we think the ONS are being too optimistic about growth then the seasonally adjusted figure would be out by a bit as well.

“The Police Federation of England and Wales welcome the conclusions of the IPCC-supervised investigation into the actions of three Police Federation representatives, which found no evidence of misconduct. The IPCC had the choice at the outset of this investigation either to conduct an independent, managed or supervised investigation, and it chose to supervise. The investigation team has reached its conclusion and in accordance with statutory regulations, a decision has been made by the appropriate authority that there is no case to answer.

“Against this factual background, we are therefore shocked that the IPCC Commissioner, Deborah Glass, would then appoint herself judge and jury by releasing her personal view that she disagrees with the findings and asks the public to decide. This is done with the full knowledge that her status and title will naturally undermine the considered findings of the investigation in the eyes of the public, whereas in fact those investigating and deciding the case are the proper arbiters in this matter.

“Either the IPCC are capable of supervising investigations or they are not. If they feel that they are capable of doing so, having had the opportunity to monitor and provide input into the process, the proper and responsible course must be to accept the investigation findings . The public are seeing more of this type of personal outburst from an individual within a supposedly regulated and process driven body.

What I was saying is that people shouldn't be complaining about the companies themselves for taking the opportunity to use the loopholes. They should be complaining to the government for allowing the loopholes,  it's their fault not the companies. 

I'll just use an example. Company 1 and company 2 are competing. Both earn 3billion a year,  they should both be paying 1 billion in taxes. Company 1 pays all their tax whereas company 2 pays almost nothing. This allows  C2 to have a huge amount of extra money than C1 for no reason. C2 can use this money to get ahead of C1 by advertising and researching a whole lot more. That's obviously not fair on C1 so they decide to not pay tax too. Should we be mad at C1 for deciding not to pay tax anymore? We shouldn't, because the government let C2 get away with it and forced C1 to use the loopholes too.

&gt; The RSPB worked with the University of Essex to develop a clear description of children’s connection to nature in our modern world. We could then begin to measure reliably the level of connection and how this changes.

&gt; As a result of this work, we have chosen four descriptions of children’s feelings towards nature, based on previous research. We have used these as our over-arching framework for defining connection to nature. They are: enjoyment of nature; having empathy for creatures; having a sense of oneness with nature; and having a sense of responsibility for the environment.

&gt; In this way, connection to nature is about long-held attitudes and beliefs, rather than the kind of short-term, warm feeling we experience after a day outdoors.  
The University of Essex report of their study is available from [rspb.org.uk/connectionmeasure][uniofe]

[uniofe]: http://rspb.org.uk/connectionmeasure

They also say that their four descriptions are adapted from the research paper: ""[Connection to Nature: children’s affective attitude toward nature.][respaper]""

I don't agree with blindly believing the security services. But I also don't agree with only accepting the Guardian position on things. However, since the Guardian are the only ones with the information, we don't really have any choice but to believe that they are telling the whole truth.

GCHQ could be doing an amazing job, stopping all sorts of terrorism and doing things that the public would agree with, but the Guardian would definitely choose not to tell us because it doesn't suit their narrative.

I have had to park like this before myself. I don't like doing it, but it was a case of having to otherwise I'd have to park several streets away with heavy shopping and a small child in tow.

&gt;We are getting at the entitlement of drivers. Drivers are legally entitled to park in the cycle lanes for the most part. Take all that luxury entitlement away, all the ways society is subsidising home owners, developers, drivers, manufacturers and related interests by providing carriageways (and pavements) as ""socialised"" parking, and the car as a paradigm fails, and fails quickly and severely.

As we know from the first episode, Rose, he sounds Northern. That's because he was born in the Manchester area. Northern England. A very proud, working class area of the country where people don't think highly of the snobs that live ""down South"". Being successful made him think he'd have to eschew his upbringing... he grew up in a council terraced house, what Americans would call a Section 8 row home, and was inspired to go into acting by watching TV shows like ""Boys from the Blackstuff"". A drama series the British Film Institute called ""TV's most complete dramatic response to the Thatcher era and as a lament to the end of a male, working class British culture.""

He had nothing against the show or the fans... it was the Southern atmosphere, if you like: ""I loved playing him. I loved connecting with that audience. Because I’ve always acted for adults and then suddenly you’re acting for children, who are far more tasteful; they will not be bullshitted. It’s either good, or it’s bad. **They don’t schmooze at after-show parties, with cocktails.**""

Schmoozing with cocktails. The most damning thing a Northerner can call a Soft Southern Shite. 

Morrissey, the former lead singer of The Smiths and also from the city of Manchester, summed it all up perfectly in [his 1992 song ""We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful"".](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PshpA-XRztM) Look at the grimness of the video ...that's what Eccleston grew up with and loves to this day. The camaraderie of the school of hard knocks. The lyrics tell of the spite hurled at fellow Northerners that sell out and leave that working-class life behind, softening their accent and their mannerisms... ""*We hate it when our friends become successful. And if they're Northern, that makes it even worse And if we can destroy them, You bet your life we will destroy them. If we can hurt them, Well, we may as well, it's really laughable.*""

As a man born in Leeds in Yorkshire, having lived a lot of my life in the South (Hertfordshire) and in America (Pennsylvania, in an area that reminds me of Leeds a lot), I still feel the same way... my wife and I have a 15 year mortgage on a $250,000 house, we're earning over $75k a year with no kids, yet I still call myself working class.

Christopher just has to understand he's a hero to people like me too.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; Besides the European court is not saying we can't take a prisoner right to vote away it's simply saying that we shouldn't do it automatically and indiscriminately to all prisoners. 

I understand that perfectly well, the contention though is whether it's really as indiscriminate as is made out. By the time someone is incarcerated there has been a huge amount of careful discrimination on a case by case basis to determine whether or not they deserve a prison sentence. Given our tradition of civic death it's entirely consistent to say that if you go to prison you lose your right to vote whilst you're there. I can see the ECHR's point but it's an extremely fine one and they could easily have argued that it is within the margin of appreciation for the UK to adopt its position and that the relatively high standards of our court system means it is not discriminatory to use imprisonment as the standards for deciding who also loses the vote.

&gt;The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show.

Fucking *awful*. Let's go through the logic again, shall we? What was the number of unemployed *before*?

Was it 2.5**04** million? 'cause 2.504 million minus 18,000 is... 2.48**6** million, which you'd round **up** to the value of 2.49 they've put in the article. Great? No.

What if it was 2.5**12** million? When you minus the 18,000 you'd get 2.49**4**... which you'd round **down** to 2.49 million.

...so what was unemployment **before**? Anyone? The error is half as big as the number it's fallen by. **Significant figures are important for accurate representation of statistics.**

What's worse is that this is **at least** the third fucking time the BBC has screwed up; it's like their writers just don't know how to handle numbers at all.

There are apparently 8 criteria one must meet to be considered a country: http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm

Based on these criteria, Scotland is a ""nation"" but not a country:
http://geography.about.com/od/politicalgeography/a/scotlandnot.htm

While the people of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all feel that we are in fact countries who have agreed to be part of the United Kingdom, in the eyes of the rest of the world, we are nations within the UK.  This is why none of us have embassies and none are [member states of the UN](http://www.un.org/en/members/) or signatories to international treaties and conventions.

Look - I'm not trying to be insulting here just practical.  None of the UK ""countries"" rank in the top 10 of international football. England is currently near its historical low at 17th, Wales is 52nd, Scotland 63rd, &amp; Northern Ireland is 86th.  While England's ranking will might improve slightly, we're not a top contender.  Together, we could be world champions (maybe).

edit: It's not like there's no precedent here.  We all compete as Great Britain in the Olympics.  We field a team that is the best of Great Britain in Olympic soccer but split into regional teams for the World Cup.  Seem kind of self-defeating.

edit2: Actually - it turns out that the GB team is equally [messed up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_Olympic_football_team) - while 2012 had players drawn from all four regions, each of the respective FAs have decided not to allow this again and, because all of us compete independently, there is no way for a GB team to qualify for any future Olympics not held in the UK

Oh that's right... Baby fell over, banged her head, took her to hospital to be safe, Paeds call SS (or Child Support) who then not only denied them access to their own child in hospital but then removed her for 48 hours until a Senior Paeds intervened and told them the bruises were not being caused by Abuse but simply by a clumsy child....

**Physical** - Some, but marginal (depends on how much physical therapy one completes after surgery). I regained 90-95% of my range of motion and strength is all back.

After completing physical therapy, I was cleared by my surgeon to resume riding my bike. I was commuting everyday to work on my bike at the time. It was a little nerve racking the first week, but after that, the anxiety while biking subsided.

Now, sports involving physical contact are a whole different matter. Ligaments will never be as structurally strong after the surgery, they don't heal all that well, compared to bones or skin because they are avascular (no blood flow).

After a 3 or 4 year hiatus, I have resumed playing football regularly. The anxiety of re-injury was far greater before I stepped back onto a pitch. After the first 5 minutes I had completely forgotten about the injury.

The ticket sales generally go by pretty quickly, but for me I was able to get seats in the Kop very easily / really any location.


My one HUGE TIP for going to Anfield for this match is to find a head usher and ask them where your seats are.

This all also happened to arise at the time when the coalition were both looking at curbing police pensions and reforming the police force, which provides clear motive- and by the way a hugely dangerous precedent when the police try to intimidate elected officials.

What we do know is that the police lied about the events, with documentary evidence proving that Mitchell was correct in his assertion and that there was no magical witness. We also know that a police officer posed as a member of the public to make a complaint. We also know that the police lied about what Andrew Mitchell said in an interview with them regarding the events, with a recording of the interview to corroborate Mitchell again.

Therefore after all of this there is no reason to presume Mitchell said anything other than ""you're meant to fucking help us"". What you're saying is like somebody else saying 'Well Gareth's from Canvey Island, where I imagine they use the words ""gommo"" and ""cunthead"" a lot,  and his mates look like dickheads so he probably did spit in that woman's face and say ""'Ere bitch you look like a right gommo cunthead'.

Secondly, the government can turn anything into an act which could damage national security, and often politicians link national security and their parties security. For example, you could argue that allowing people to have mobile phones is a national security threat, as criminals, terrorists and paedophiles could use them to plan crimes. This government committee would probably exaggerate these leaks. Personally, I think public knowledge of the spying GCHQ and the NSA committed/continue to commit is much more important than national security, but I know the government don't take the same view.

   That's what Moffat was meaning when he said that Capaldi isn't necessarily the Doctor's final regen. He will still have one left after Capaldi. at least until Moffat, or whoever's running the show at that point, figures out how they're going to get rid of the twelve regen limit.

If the 10th and the 11th were involved in the events that caused the 9th's regeneration, then the 9th Doctor would *remember* the 10th and the 11th. He would know what they looked like, what they talked like, what they acted like before he regenerated into them.

Except of course what we've seen in the show is that the Doctor is always surprised when he regenerates, never knows what he looks like, and picks a different set of clothes immediately afterwards. Putting that side, remember that the 11th Doctor was *surprised* to find the Hurt-Doctor in the *Name of the Doctor* episode. If the 11th was really involved in the 9th's regeneration, then he would remember himself as the Hurt-Doctor coming face to face with a future 11th. He doesn't. He seems as shocked as anyone to find the Hurt-Doctor there.

The only way to justify that is to assume that the Hurt-Doctor's is an alternate Doctor who made different choices than the 8th and therefore never regenerated to the 9th. His timeline diverged completely from the Doctors we've been watching. He exists on a parallel but separate path, where he has no knowledge of the 9th, 10th and 11th, and vice versa.

Clara tumbling through the Doctor's past could have caused Hurt-Doctor's timeline to momentarily merge with the 11th's, the two meeting for the first time ever.

To use an example. The Guardian made a big fuss about how poorly the UK is doing compared to the best countries in Europe (read: Germany) and how we should emulate their model. What they don't say is that Germany has no minimum wage and has kept its economy going off of the backs of incredibly low paid workers. 

Now, things are looking much better for the UK, growth is returning, people are getting jobs. Now they can ignore the fact that the UKs figures compare favourably to most of the larger European countries and focus on the low pay (which they ignored when looking at Germany).

The other issue is that we've been with the 10th from his beginning to his end, and an event of this magnitude would have been a thing in the show. They could side-step that too if they stick to the whole ""Hurt-Doctor will never be spoken of ever again, and will forever be buried into the deepest darkest depths of our memories"" angle. Still a little shaky though. There's too many band-aids on that to make it work.

Perhaps a better way to handle it would be for the 10th and the 11th to eventually bring Hurt-Doctor to *their side* and all-together fight to correct the singular moment that caused Hurt-Doctor's timeline to separate from the rest. If corrected, then everything happens exactly as it's supposed to in the shows, and they ""contain"" what could otherwise be a catastrophe into a self-fulfilling loop within time (with Hurt's future 10th and 11th going back to correct the same mistake, over and over and over across generations).

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"&gt;In common with previous years, the 
majority of attacks occurred in France (125) and Spain (54). 
Most of these were related to separatist terrorism

To call a separatist terrorist necessarily right or left wing is often a bit difficult. Take the IRA for instance which is not separatist in the same way as others but it attacks the ruling country in NI. It originated as a fundamentally socialist organisation but most people nowadays would not consider it to be doing what it's doing because it doesn't like capitalism or whatever. The actions flow from their republicanism not from their socialism even though those two positions often compliment each other. In the same way most separatists, despite being left wing organisations act out of anger about sovereignty not about left wing politics. They also lump anarchists together with left wing terrorism which is not entirely fair, in the US anarchists tend to have a right wing bent - anarchism is not at heart left wing or right wing as it rejects these constructs by definition so it inflates the left wing side unnecessarily.

Besides right and left wing are normally insufficient definitions when talking about things like this. The gulf between radicals and moderates on each side is often much greater than between left moderates and right moderates. As a left wing moderate you often have much more in common with a right wing moderate that with a left wing radical.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; you can only bring a libel case against someone if you can prove it has harmed your standing in the eyes of the public.
&gt; I don't think you fully understand the concept of libel.

This is incorrect. From Law for Journalists by Frances Quinn:

&gt; Old cases have suggested that a statement will be defamatory if it ""tends to lower the person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society""...The person defamed does not have to prove that the words actually had any of these effects on any particular person or the public in general, only that the statement could *tend* to have that effect on an ordinary, reasonable listener or reader.

And from the Defamation Act 2013:

&gt; A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or **is likely to cause serious harm** to the reputation of the claimant.

In theory the new act should make the barrier for suing higher, though there is ambiguity as to what causes serious harm. For serious investigative journalism it is very likely the claims in contention will constitute serious harm.

&gt; You are free to make that statement and someone is equally free to sue you for libel if they think it is untrue.

This is like saying I'm free to murder somebody if I accept I'll be sent to jail if I'm caught. It's certainly true, but it misses the point: a libel dispute is initially one persons word against another's, and currently we place the burden of proof on the person making the assertion. There is no reason to presume that the plaintiff's word is any more reliable than the defendant's, and the burden should at least be evenly distributed.

This comes up with the 2 Amys when the older Amy is left to die, because the Tardis would not have been able to absorb the paradox ripples from two Amys.  
Now consider that the Time Lord civilization probably would have had the ability to maintain humungous paradox buffers.  Effectively, they would have the ability to do almost anything they wanted to, because they could dampen out the paradox ripples and have it not destroy the universe.

&gt;I doubt Cameron and the government would be looking to stop the release of information which is truly vital to national security, rather any information which could bring the government under criticism or disrepute from its own citizens. 

Truthfully, I think they would do a bit of both. But consider this - a handful of people at a newspaper are now essentially controlling foreign policy and diplomatic relations of the entire UK. They weren't elected by anybody. They don't have any expertise in the area. They don't have full access to the information they would need to fully understand the material. That is what makes me nervous, and that is why I think it's fair to investigate their behaviour and the legality of their actions.

For instance, they kick up a shitstorm about us bugging Belgian politicians. But they have no idea what events might have precipitated that, or what the Belgians might have been doing to our politicians.

&gt;So, I feel this committee would say that the Guardian broke the law, even if they hadn't, in order to set a precident so that other papers don't try to release something the government don't want them to.

I disagree. I still have faith that we can have independent inquiries and that overall our legal system functions pretty well.

&gt;Secondly, the government can turn anything into an act which could damage national security, and often politicians link national security and their parties security.

I agree that the ""national security"" card is very overplayed and used for political purposes. And I also don't think the PRISM/Tempora programs are a suitable method of improving national security. They are too broad and certainly violate freedom of normal people. But as for us bugging other countries, spying on them, hacking their stuff and the other leaks that have come out... well, that pretty much IS national security. It's what our security services are supposed to be doing, so exposing them causes damage and isn't really relevant to the public interest, IMO anyway.

What I really want to know is whether prism/tempora have actually stopped any crimes from being committed. I still think they are over-reaching, but wouldn't it be interesting to know if they have actually stopped any terrorist plots because of them.

&gt;Personally, I think public knowledge of the spying GCHQ and the NSA committed/continue to commit is much more important than national security, but I know the government don't take the same view.

Agreed. But they aren't the only leaks. The thing that bothers me the most if this - ask yourself why a very rich newspaper editor, an American fugitive and an American who lives in Brazil should have so much influence over the foreign policy and the government of the UK. They haven't been elected by anybody in this country. They haven't been given any sort of authority to act by the people of this country. Our politicians may be scumbags but at least we elected them.

https://www.gov.uk/join-trade-union/trade-union-membership-your-employment-rights

&gt; You have the right to:

&gt; * choose to join or not join a union 
&gt; * decide to leave or remain a member of a union
&gt; * belong to the union you choose, even if it’s not the one your employer negotiates with on pay, terms and conditions
&gt; * belong to more than one union

&gt; Your employer isn’t allowed to:

&gt; * offer you a benefit to leave a trade union
&gt; * threaten to treat you unfairly if you don’t leave a union

So when Fineus says: ""I have rights"", Fineus also has rights to be able to join and work in a union. If Fineus doesn't want to, then Fineus waivers that right voluntarily by default. If Fineus wants to work and negotiate with a particular company without a union, it's Fineus' choice as there are other legal ways that Fineus could do so.

If you abstain from using all of your rights, that is fine. If someone else wants to use their legal rights, that is also fine.

Next,

&gt; What I don't have is a separate group of people who can interfere with the privately owned company I work for when they feel like doing so. 

Fineus or any other member of the privately owned company, could create a union recognised by law. Fineus could also join it.
If Fineus does not want to exercise this right which has been available to Fineus for a very long time, again, so be it.

It is similar to ""taking the fifth"" in the USA. You have the right to it. If you choose to waiver the right, so be it.

From https://www.gov.uk/industrial-action-strikes :

&gt; Calling industrial action

&gt; Industrial action happens when trade union members are in a dispute with their employers that can’t be solved through negotiations.

&gt; A trade union can only call for industrial action if a majority of its members involved support it in a properly organised postal vote - called a ‘ballot’.

&gt; Before organising a ballot, a union must decide which members affected by a dispute it wants to ask to take industrial action. It must tell all members entitled to vote and the employer what the ballot results were.

&gt; A trade union calls industrial action by telling members and the employer when and how this action will be taken. This should be done by a trade union official or committee that has the legal right to do so. Your voting paper must have said who this is.

&gt; Taking part in industrial action - your rights

&gt; If you’re a trade union member, you have the right to vote before your union asks you to take industrial action. You don’t have to take part in industrial action and can’t be disciplined by your union if you don’t.

The Royal Mail did this. So what is Fineus' issue?

I would reword Fineus' first line to be, imo:

Things like education and social services, local (and strategic) planning, environmental health, libraries, leisure centres, economic development, a huge range of civic services, road maintenance, road cleaning, parking enforcement, trading standards (and every other type of licensing you can imagine), police and fire get top-up funding (I think). Making sure all this shit runs efficiently on a daily basis requires tonnes of admin staff, accountants, I.T services, maintenance staff, cleaners.

Everyone always blabs on about waste collection, but that's a tiny fraction of councils budget (around 4% I think). 

Probably worth having a read where you money goes and you might not feel so bitter about it. Sure there is waste in every council, but it's hardly daylight robbery.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; But consider this - a handful of people at a newspaper are now essentially controlling foreign policy and diplomatic relations of the entire UK

That's a bit of a hyperbole. If the Guardian, or one of their writers, wanted to essentially hold the nation hostage, surely they would have done so already. Plus, there are plenty of people outside the Guardian and the UK who have this information, as well as probably all the other spying agencies in the world (they probably had similar information beforehand). 

&gt; I disagree. I still have faith that we can have independent inquiries and that overall our legal system functions pretty well.

After the underhand things the government have done around this whole case, including smashing up the computers at The Guardian, and holding David Miranda for the maximum amount of time for nothing to do with terrorism, I have no doubt the government would try something underhand again.

&gt; It's what our security services are supposed to be doing, so exposing them causes damage and isn't really relevant to the public interest, IMO anyway.

These leaks weren't just stuff to do with the UK, it was global. It was the Guardian that released stuff about the NSA, for example. Plus, who chooses what is and isn't in the public interest. It is different from person to person, and of cause to the government it would be 'as much as possible'. This is what it all comes down to, as the government have shown they can't be trusted to tell people about the stuff they're doing which is in the public interest, so we have to rely on sources like Snowdon and The Guardian in order to tell us.

&gt;  The thing that bothers me the most if this - ask yourself why a very rich newspaper editor, an American fugitive and an American who lives in Brazil should have so much influence over the foreign policy and the government of the UK.

This isn't about holding the UK hostage, or dictating the foreign policy, it is about revealing the things in our interest which the country have kept hidden from us. As I said before, our politicians were never going to reveal this stuff, so it takes people like this to do something.

After it is taken, the vein [i.e., hypobranchial gland] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [about 20 fl. oz.] about to every hundred pounds of juice.

About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil.

Let's recap some of the events in the last few seasons, shall we?  

* Amy's parents are literally aborted from time, essentially meaning that they never existed. And yet somehow, their daughter still exists.  

* The Doctor encounters a religious cult/army whose sole purpose is to destroy him. They're perfectly willing and capable to kidnap his friends and loved ones in order to get to him.  Rather than actually do anything about this, he goes on a series of pointless little trips.

* The Doctor's death at the start of series 6 is supposed to be a fixed point in time.  As far as the rest of the universe is concerned, that was when the Doctor died.  The Doctor figures this out, says ""Fuck that noise,"" and decides to go into hiding, which basically means doing all the same shit he did before.  And then at the end of series 7, we find out that the doctor ""died"" twice.  

* The Daleks, who in pretty much every other appearance have been shown to be a xenophobic hive-mind that believe themselves to be the single most superior race in all of time and space.  The first time we see a Dalek in the new run, it actually chose to commit suicide because it had been contaminated by human DNA.  However, in the very first episode of series 7, we find out that not only do they have a friggin' Parliament of all things, but that they also converted a human into a Dalek because she was a genius.  

* A weeping angel replaced the Statue of Liberty.  Weeping Angels turn to stone when someone is looking at them.  However, somehow, this gigantic angel was able to walk from Liberty Island to the middle of Manhattan.  Implying that somehow, this 46 meter tall statue traveled that entire distance without anyone ever laying eyes on it.  In the middle of New York City.  The fucking city that never sleeps.  

And that's just the shit off the top of my head.

A snippet from wikia:

&gt;The mindbending contest at the end of part four proves conclusively that the Doctor regenerated multiple times prior to William Hartnell's Doctor. While this was apparently what the production team intended to imply, the overwhelming weight of evidence offered throughout the rest of the series contradicts this. For instance, Time Lord dialogue in The Three Doctors specifically establishes that the Doctor as portrayed by William Hartnell is ""the earliest Doctor""; further evidence provided in Mawdryn Undead, The Five Doctors, the 1996 TV movie, The Next Doctor, and The Lodger (among others) establishes that all of the Doctor's incarnations are accounted for in his televised adventures. 

Perhaps the ""Doctor"" is the name/persona, not the man. I've thought Hurt could be a 0, not an 8-9 or Valeyard.

As for the shit that comes from Moffats mouth, who the fuck knows. ""The fall of the eleventh"" now means something entirely different that what its implied to be?

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Oxycodone is an opiate painkiller, and in the UK falls into a group of medicines called controlled drugs. You'll find that even with appropriate paperwork most British doctors are going to be **very** reluctant to prescribe it to someone under the age of 50, let alone on a regular basiss... not least because like all opiate painkillers it a) has a massive tolerance effect limiting its usefullness and leading to side effects and b) because it can be easily taken accidentally or on purpose as an overdose with lethal consequences.

I suspect you'll find just about every doctor you see to get the prescription renewed will try to talk you over to an alternative that is more suitable like paracetamol, ibuprofen + omeprazole, gabapentin -- even as far as regular steroids. The only exception will probably be if your back condition is caused by something like Ankylosing Spondylitis.

If they do try to talk you out of using oxycodone as I suspect they will, don't write them off... listen to what they have to say. After all in the UK they aren't being paid to dope you up. Oxycodone is infinately cheaper to the NHS than a drug like gabapentin for example, but if they genuinely felt you would benefit from it they'd be more likely to switch you over. This could be a valuable oppourtunity to have a proper doctor who isn't motivated by money perhaps provide a different perspective on your back problems. 

Just my 2-pence.

edit: Also, heads up, I couldn't find a link but i'm fairly sure that if you turn up at Heathrow with more than a couple of opiate painkillers **you're going to have a really bad time**.

edit edit: Also to answer your second question I don't think you will find much difference with a private GP. Their mentality will still be that opiate painkillers are rarely appropriate on a regular basis, even more so amongst young adults with back pain.

Err... its a controlled drug. You need a prescription for it and virtually no doctor would write up a renewable long-term prescription for a drug like that.

Most GPs will flip out at the thought of giving someone under the age of 50 a regular strong-opiate painkiller like oxycodone. In the British doctors eyes oxycodone is for **post-operative pain**... i.e. pain caused by having your abdomen cut open. Not pain from a *hurty-back*. They will be far more likely to prescribe paracetamol, ibuprofen tablets and topical gels. At the extreme end they might push to low doses of the weaker opiate codeine.

You need to move the ball around the flanks, switch the play, and keep the ball moving around the outside of the box to tease the defence open and give someone space. Against WH our focus was so much on the right that they just boxed the area in because there was nobody on the left.

Yeah, but they would do all of those things immediately. Also, say goodbye to Anfield and hello to Red Bull Stadium. From the article:

&gt;A takeover from the company would involve a complete re-branding for the club involved. The name ‘Red Bull’ would ensue on their current name, and they would take on the traditional jerseys used by other clubs owned by Red Bull. For the traditionalists, these massive changes to their club would be difficult to take. This occurred in Salzburg when Red Bull took over SV Austria Salzburg, where traditional fans of the club set up their own movement in resistance to the changes made by Red Bull. The move ultimately paved the way for two fan groups: the ‘Red-Whites’ who stuck by Red Bull Salzburg in support of the re-branded club, and the ‘Violets,’ who broke away to create a new SV Austria Salzburg.",0,1381969626,null,0,1381969896,0,cct8u5j,t3_1olt9u,t1_cct8u5j,t1_cct7red,null,1429105037,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

That said, Capaldi wouldn't be [~]'s last regeneration, Matt Smith would be.  10 performed the act of regeneration twice, but after saving his life with it disposed of the rest of the process and used the DNA of his hand to keep from rewriting his entire persona.  It allowed him to regenerate into the same essential incarnation, but it was a regeneration (thus Moffet recently stating that we need to go rewatch all the regenerations that have happened and recount).  Smith was the final regeneration until the River situation.  Smith knew this.  He halfheartedly asked the TARDIS console if he should regenerate as a last ditch effort but the TARDIS informed him ""Regeneration is disabled"".  We assumed at the time that it was the poison that did it, but I don't really accept that now.

River could have targeted any incarnation of [~].  She specifically went for 11.  The reason (I assume) is because he was the one who couldn't simply regenerate out of it.  She could have sought out any other incarnation, if her poison could disable regeneration.  Additionally, I see no logical reason why her poison prevented his regenerative ability but not her own.  This is a being that survived regenerating from a massive dose of radiation.  This is a being that survived regenerating from containing the entire Time Vortex.  The poison was killing him because he couldn't regenerate another time.

That entire season was used as a way to address the regeneration limit and have River give him a new set that he could use going forth in the show.  Capaldi will be the first incarnation in a new set (or remaining, accounting for River's used regenerations).  Thus the marketing of ""New Mouth, New Rules"".  The 50th will launch him into a new direction so that 12 will be a new story, new set of regenerations, new personality, and possibly a new philosophy of being a more direct Doctor with an approach to life that holds elements of River's character, but maybe not.

For one thing, he makes the usual fiscal conservative mistake of assuming sovereign debt is anything like credit card debt and that national budgets are anything like household budgets.  This completely overlooks that for nations with control over their own money supply, this is nonsense.  Naturally, they don't have complete control - printing money can be inflationary for example, but it's not the stupidly simple cause-effect relationship some goldbugs present.  And nations which don't have such control are pretty screwed (think 2nd order Eurozone nations).  He completely neglects the manner in which [public spending is directly related to private saving](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/untitled-32.png), eliminating the former eliminates the latter, and countries running surpluses get into deep trouble.

He's not wrong that the period of neo-liberalism has been disastrous in many ways, with unsustainable borrowing, but he doesn't even consider the primary cause of this (the devastating and increasing imbalance of power between bosses and workers), which has allowed sources of unearned income (rents, profits, interest) to ramp up ridiculously with respect to sources of earned income (salaries, wages, tips, fees, etc.), such that borrowing has become a way of life for most ordinary people just to tread water, or the massive wealth transfers from public to private (i.e the siccing of the speculation-fuelled financial collapse onto governments and thereby ordinary taxpayers now and in the future).  Our sovereign debt isn't just money which has vanished in a puff of smoke, it's money which has been purloined by corporations, bankers, property speculators and the like and is currently residing in tax havens across the world.

If you tried speaking to someone in modern English 700 years ago you would not be able to understand it.  Scots exists, yet there's so few galic speakers there's nothing really to be jealous about any promotion.

Coupla things here;

a.) To your first point, I dispute that. [Here's an example of Chaucer's Middlle English.](http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWuA1S6XYDVDnW3lOwVBqMZAvH94zf_uqxf_LARpbUAmq8Yk12hw) It's not that hard. Not even as hard as a different germanic language from English, let alone Irish. 

b.) If you're going to discuss and contrast the languages/dialects, please show a little respect and refer to Irish by it's proper name, which is Irish or Gaelige, not ""galic"" (which isn't how you spell gaelic).

I'm just going to c&amp;p my post from the other thread about this, for the attention of anybody who thinks there's a realistic chance they'd buy us and then not change the name/crest/colours:

Look at all the other clubs Red Bull bought:

**New York Red Bulls**: changed name, logo &amp; colours  
**Red Bull Salzburg**: changed name, logo &amp; colours  
**RB Leipzig**: ostensibly a 'new club', but they bought the playing license of the nearby SSV Markranstädt and retained their first team squad/coach/etc., i.e. they bought Markranstädt's first team setup then changed the name, logo &amp; colours 

OK, Everton have more brand recognition than the others, but we're not exactly Manchester United or Real Madrid in that sense. Austria Salzburg were an established top flight club in Austria before Red Bull had anything to do with them and they still changed everything there and declared it was a new club. I don't see any reason to think they'd treat us differently. If this happens, we'll be Red Bull Everton (or even, dare I say it, Liverpool?), play in white &amp; red and have exactly the same logo as all their other teams.

Basically the connotations: In the West, ""tribal"" often implies ""savage."" When the general image of tribal timelessness is applied to situations of social conflict between Africans, a particularly destructive myth results. Stereotypes of primitiveness and conservative backwardness are also linked to images of irrationality and superstition. The combination leads to portrayal of violence and conflict in Africa as primordial, savage and unchanging.
