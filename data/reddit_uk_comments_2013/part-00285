true,[deleted],null,null,"Who cares. The story is being told by Dennis Skinner and there's nothing wrong with what he said. By the way, people should love Dennis Skinner here. Working class man with some good views and stances.

**Skinner takes a liberal stance regarding social issues. He voted in favour of equalisation of the age of consent, civil partnerships, adoption rights for same-sex couples, and to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Furthermore, throughout his career he has maintained a strongly pro-choice stance on abortion. On several occasions he has enabled the defeat of moves to reduce the number of weeks at which termination of a pregnancy can be legally performed in Britain by ""talking out the measure"" (filibustering), as on 20 January 1989, when he held up proceedings by trying to move a writ for a by-election in the constituency of Richmond. He had previously used this filibuster technique on 7 June 1985, when preventing a bill by Enoch Powell, which would have banned stem cell research, from being debated. He held up proceedings by moving a writ for a by-election in Brecon and Radnor. Skinner regards his defeat of Powell's bill as his proudest political achievement.**

**In 2003, he was one of a large number of Labour MPs who voted against the Iraq War; he later rebelled against the party line when he voted against government policy to allow terror suspects to be detained without trial for 90 days. In March 2007, Skinner and 88 other Labour MPs voted against government policy to renew the Trident Nuclear Missile System.**

This might not be everyone's opinion but I feel we can't properly gauge how well Aspas can do without giving him minutes. Look at Sterling this season, first couple of games he wasn't great (some people talking about him ""not being good enough"", he's 19 for god's sake! Who can say how he'll develop) and right now he's playing really well. Needed minutes. Assaidi is doing pretty well at Stoke with some minutes under his belt. Very unfair to write off players before giving them a chance. 

The reason I haven't put Moses in should be clear for all, I just feel his contribution and effort hasn't quite justified the minutes that he's gotten and would rather give a full player a chance over a loanee who hasn't really performed. 

PLUS, its Hull City at home. We should really be giving him some game time.

Obviously you feel that there's something about British culture that means even if there were the finest bike paths in the world, it's a pipe dream to see people using them. May I ask why that is?

I point to the Netherlands. They have the best bicycle route planning in the world - and 70% of all adults regularly make practical journeys this way. This is largely because it's so safe - a result of conscious political choices to reallocate some space from cars to bicycles, on really well-designed paths. This has taken vast amounts of traffic out of their cities and make residential streets safer. You can still drive if you like! - In fact, it's easier because there's less congestion. (Something that electric cars will not solve.)

- First point you made doesn't  make sense sorry. will start at the second.

&gt;it's usually easier for Brits to go higher

Yes it is, but first they need to get the job. And not every Brit will get promoted, some people are only capable of staying at the bottom but will happily work.

&gt; Brit plumber employee becomes employer *(as an example of your previous quote)*

ermm No, it's just as easy( or difficult)  for anyone to become self employed. You only have to look at all the local plumbers, builders, corner shops, restaurants etc. I personally think this is great.

&gt; not lazy Brit will always be a better employee than an immigrant

No, you only have to ask employers. unskilled employers' prefer immigrants. They have more on the line, so they won't complain. They have likely experienced harsher conditions back home and are used to a lower standard of living.

&gt;What about good old competition?

same as the previous point I made. People are rational. They are used to a certain standard of living and do not want to work harder for less money. Who would want to do that??!! If people from an even poorer country went to an Eastern European country lowering wages because they are prepared to work harder for less would the Europeans be happy? Hell no.

**Being rational does not mean being lazy** It's easy for the middle class who benefit from the cheaper labour force to tell people to stop being lazy while they enjoy a bigger paycheck because those at the bottom earn less.

&gt;""Sudden influx""? 1.5% max of total UK population increase in the period of 10 years. Is this such sudden from Eastern Europe?

I said sudden influx for Slough. I was discussing how the 1.5% figure doesn't measure the concentrations of immigration to certain communities. I can guarantee Slough is not 1.5%.

&gt;Build more schools, build more clinics 

With what money. They pretty much have to be built on credit. And you can't build schools overnight. And where are they going to put the school. Is there room? can the roads cope?

&gt;Black market - you think that Brits will ALWAYS report?

They will report it if you pay them Â£5/hr and treat them like shit.

 &gt;Brits do benefits fraud 

Well obviously they are not going to report pretending to be disabled. It's them that are scamming the system, not someone that is exploiting them.

People doing fraud is highly exaggerated. The governments own figures estimated it's under 1% of people on Disabled allowance. They exaggerate and sensationalise the handful of 'did a marathon' stories to distract the masses and win an election.  Apparently we are all suffering because a few people on wheel chairs are paying too much, not the rising wage inequality, the money spent on wars, multinationals paying tax abroad, developers sitting on land and energy firms making ridiculous profits.


The main point you are not getting is if there are more unskilled people then a firm can get away with paying each employee less. The labour market loses it's bargaining power.

Imagine, you raise the salary to Â£6, and people say ''nahhh, That is not worth it. Bills and life costs this much.'' So then the employer has to raise the salary to Â£7 for everyone! Now you add an influx of unskilled workers (because a higher proportion of them are unskilled), the employer can happily charge Â£5.80. 

So we have more unemployed people and the workers they do have are paid less. 

Over time this will be rectified because more people are in our economy working/contributing and 2nd generation immigrants will be used to the same standard of living as everyone else... But guess what will happen then....we will suddenly need more immigrants to keep the working class down. And then it will be you complaining...unless you're earning 28K.

I would like to add this is not the fault of Eastern Europeans. Don't take it personally. It's the government that opened the door but didn't adjust min. wage, address income inequality, the rising costs of energy, not planning and building those schools and houses in advance. To this day developers are sitting on land and not building because it's ever so slightly less profitable. The point is these issues have to be addressed before more workers enter the country and exasperate the situation

If your wife can't get a repeat prescription that's a bit fucked up... in my surgery you just have to walk in, fill out a form, drop it in the box and come back in a couple of days when the prescription is ready. Seeing a doctor is not necessary if it's just a repeat prescription.

One time at my surgery I phoned up and said I needed an appointment. I explained it was for an ear infection. I would've had to have waited over a week to visit a doctor, but because I knew I just needed a prescription for antibiotics the receptionist booked me an appointment with a nurse practitioner the next day. I have a history of being prone to ear infections but I'm not sure if the receptionist was privy to that information or not. Either way I was glad that I brought that up.

I also got my repeat prescription for Citalopram brought forward a couple of weeks early because I explained that I was going to be going abroad for a few weeks and didn't want to run out. Citalopram isn't the sort of drug you want to have sudden withdrawals from since it's an SSRI.

That's all purely anecdotal of course and it's just my personal experience, but if you need to see a doctor urgently you can - my local surgery makes room for these emergency appointments. Routine appointments are expected to be a long wait. ",0,1388430713,null,0,false,0,cedibbu,t3_1u0fd2,t1_cedibbu,t1_cedan5r,null,1427929001,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Sterling has been okay recently but Coutinho (as much as this phrase is recycled in here) is the absolute link between the font runners and the midfield. It becomes entirely disjointed without him. He plays a part in almost every attack/goal and it won't even cross Rodgers mind who to drop.

I hate to sound condescending about it (and I do) but it just won't happen. Coutinho is probably the second or third name on the team sheet every week. Sterlings contributions have been seriously exaggerated in here too. He's provided a threat yes, but the main thing that threat has done is suck players away from the middle so Coutinho can drift in and pull the strings for you know who - Best seen against Spurs where he sucked Sandro and Dembele out wide on dozens of occasions.

He is in no way pivotal to the way we play though, especially against stronger teams, whereas Coutinho is. To be honest I think Sterling has been okay, but that's it. He's doing better than he had been and I thought he was very good against Spurs but the lads are in a different class, even when Sterling is on form - not that I'm saying Coutinho is off the boil, because he's not.

I'm pretty sure plenty of people (including you) quite exaggerate Eastern Europe as being extremely poor and which only has low skilled workers to offer. You should be looking at India, Pakistan and most of Africa - then it does make a very valid point!

Eastern Europeans are very often even better educated than local people. Yes, they do work at lower positions but for how long for someone who is keen on going up the ladder? (certainly not whole generation!). Also, being a builder and having good skills on doing it is a skilled job or unskilled? So are we now talking about totally unskilled or what? I bet plenty of immigrants are well skilled people but in lower types of industry (which doesn't necessarily mean it's less paid).

Having lived in UK for more than 10 years I got to know some people and their expectations. Believe me when I say that very often they want things which are just not possible to get. I understand raising wages from Â£6 to Â£7 for low paid jobs (nearly 20% raise) but that is not enough. Some people expect Â£12 and they just won't do that job unless they get paid enough. They also very often want to live above the living standard, counting every day partying and pub drinking as social norm (this is wrong!).

Frankly speaking, I would like for UK to try a scenario. Stop immigration fully but at the same time stop giving benefits. I am more than sure that wages wouldn't suddenly go up by 100% and only changes would be small. It would be people moving their asses and going to work and I don't mean slave work, just something which is expected from normal employee (for example coming on time, no silly excuses, doing everything what they are supposed to do). This is common sense but because of laziness (mostly caused by benefits) people prefer blaming everything else around.

I also don't think economy can work like some people suggest. Raising wages for certain job means raising wages at ALL other types jobs. Would you expect working for the same amount stacking shelves in Tesco and doing some highly responsible and skilled job? Obviously not, meaning there always have to be differences within wages.

This all simply means that if rich society wants to be lazy and live above level and do nothing it needs to rely on cheap immigrants doing certain jobs or expect themselves to do those jobs for wages which are offered - fruit picker can't suddenly earn Â£15 but you need fruit pickers in UK!!!

P.S. Free flow of workers within EU is a norm. UK should accept it in any scenario but if UK has to much immigration then do something about immigration from outside of EU (which was and is all the time higher than from within). Quitting EU just because immigration from EU which supposedly harms UK but at the same time allowing thousands from outside of EU is just incredible hypocrisy and don't tell me those are students and similar.

""automatic membership"" would be saying; ""we are in already so we're staying, tough shit"", there is only one real legal avenue to attempt such a thing (citizenship law), but nobody is seriously talking about that. The debate (if there is one) is around whether or not Scotland can apply during the negotiation period, which is provisionally 18 months long [""realistic timeframe""; according to UK government legal advisor](http://archive.is/H39gJ). Scotland already meets all the criteria, and that is before you consider the implications of already being in the EU for 40 years like trade, movement of people, funding, legal rights, all of which would need to be temporarily rewritten if Scotland was to fall outside the EU apparatus. There is just no good reason to expect that anyone would want that, its just so much unneeded work. 

You should also consider that the UK government has the ability to petition the EU commission for a legal position on this issue. Only they can as they control the UK representative on the council.

&gt;[Scenarios such as the separation of one part of a Member State or the creation of a new state would not be neutral as regards the EU Treaties.

They could, within weeks, completely clear this issue up, remove all the mud from the water and set both sides of the debate straight. But they won't, so please think why it benefits the No campaign to keep this uncertain.


For currency; the site I posted goes into it in the detail so I'm not going to regurgitate all of the stuff, but simply the government has said it won't pre-negotiate, which means there is no hypothetical independence, only No. You have to consider what will happen if there was a Yes.

true,eberts,null,null,"Boy, this article kind of nails it for me.  One of the greatest traits of RTD's writing was his understanding of sacrifice.  He knew that he couldn't kill off the Doctor, so instead, he made us care about the guest stars and companions...right before he killed them.  It was a devastating contrast to the Doctor's humor and antics through each episode.  It reminded us that there are consequences, prices to pay to save the universe, and they are in human, relatable terms.  In some ways, RTD was composing tragedies; you often knew who was going to die, and the Doctor - the most powerful man in the universe - could do nothing to stop it.

With Moffat, everything is reversible.  Huge plot points are explained away with Star Trek level technobabble and Deus Ex Machina's that are not earned.  People may still die, but we have much less of an emotional connection because we don't understand the logic behind it.  I'm still not 100% sure why the Doctor couldn't just come up with a ""Timey-wimey"" explanation to save Amy and Rory.  He's broken every other rule in the show, why not that one?

I will also agree that Matt Smith has really grown on me.  He's a damn fine actor that pivoted to every demand called on him.  His work in ""The Day of the Doctor"" was some of his finest and he stood toe to toe with the best Doctor Who actors and availed himself wonderfully.

I'm looking forward to Peter Capaldi's Doctor.  Despite my issues with Moffat's showrunning, I'm a DW fan until the end.  I just hope that a new Doctor brings a return to form.  ",0,1388436289,null,0,false,0,cedktvj,t3_1u0za4,t1_cedktvj,t3_1u0za4,null,1427927828,43,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,43

Again, taken from the article.  This is totally irrelevant to the point you're making, and the point the article is intended to appear to make.

Rakitic would offer goals from midfield which we lack and also justify continuing to play Hendo in a more forward position because he offers so much defensively.

More edits: I was sort of expecting it to auto-suggest locations as I typed. The Google Autocomplete API might be useful. If you're using that server-side as a geo-location service, you can give it bounds to work within (so that you don't geocode somewhere outside of the UK). For example, I resorted to using a post code ""B5 6DQ"" after it wouldn't recognise ""Birmingham"" and it thought I meant ""B5, Kenya""!

You surely can't be that obtuse.   

I'm saying that Muslim persecution in neighbouring Muslim countries for being Muslim isn't as much as a problem as the rising Christian persecution in Muslim countries.  As it is there are refugee camps in neighbouring countries funded with UK money which UKIP called for!   If anything we should do even more, but I certainly don't begrudge helping them.  But that's the policy: help fund refugee camps regardless of race, gender, faith based purely on the individual.  When there's evidence of further regional persecution of a minority within the refugees then to go a little further still.

They're saying they can take some of the tension out of the region  by Western countries offering to take in some of the refugees that continue facing the threat of persecution after they've fled,  until some point when the tension dies down.

&gt;I wouldn't be surprised if they haven't actually recruited people to use Ukip propaganda on the Internet.

Not to mention the awful portrayal of the Master.  John Simm did some great work with what he was given, but it was a terrible characterisation.

Finally, RTD seemed incapable of writing story that wasn't 'the entire world knows what's going on' (see any of his Christmas specials, stolen planet/journey's end, Smith &amp; Jones and others) and don't even get me started on him using 'regeneration energy' to solve every problem the sonic screwdriver couldn't.

A lot of Moffat's early work was explicitly targeted at reigning back what RTD did to make the Doctor less of a celebrity.

RTD wrote some great characters and some wonderful dialogue, but his big story ideas really weren't that great.  

All of which is to say, the way we organise series writing in the UK is awful - it's like a successful author's 5th book, the editors don't really reign them in anymore 'cause they know any crap they write will sell.  Similarly, when RTD or Moffat write an episode, there's no one to tell them it's actually pretty crap as they're the last word.

It doesn't require a positive act of ""kicking out"" because that's not how the treaties are worded - they explicitly refer to the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"" by name.

true,Dirkinator,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I dont see why not. It'd be a change from the Doctor simply stringing along some lovesick human girls until circumstances eventually pull them away, which we've seen with three women so far, and clara eventually a fourth. He can't actually make himself truly be with any of them because of how long he lives, that he must watch them grow old and die while he just keeps going on and on, he cant do that to them or himself, but he's so lonely that he cant be alone, so he does what he always does and keeps finding new companions...

Romana as a character could change all that. The last of the female Time Lords, a companion who can join him on his quest [to](#s ""find Gallifrey""). Here is a woman of his own kind, one who can relate to him on levels that a human can't even come close to, a kind of relationship only hinted at in the back and forth between The Doctor and River Song.

Maybe its starts as a tense relationship. She hates the Doctor, blames him for his role in the time war. For a while she may actively be trying to get revenge. As the Doctor realises who is sabotaging his every move he must win her over. She learns to forgive him, respect him as he proves his heroic worth and eventually romance blooms. Maybe they team up against greater threats that inhabit the universe. She could even have her own Tardis, giving the writers a chance to show what the advanced models are like. The jealousy Romana inspires from other female characters could be explored, maybe the ghost of River Song escapes the Library and they have some kind of Timey Wimey cat fight. The character would have the same benefits as the Doctor, in that if an actress wanted to leave the role Romana can be played by someone else. It could be a recurring character or a permanent cast member.

&gt;In discussions about the rate of cycling in different countries, people often make remarks along the lines that ""the Dutch cycle because the Netherlands is flat"". It's just an excuse, of course. They're either trying to excuse the low cycling rate of their country or sometimes it's an attempt to disregard the effect of the infrastructure which the Netherlands has used to achieve its high cycling rate.

&gt;I think this is a much overemphasized difference between the Netherlands and other places. Many settled areas in many countries are also flat, or nearly flat. They don't all have a high cycling rate. An example which I've used on this blog is Lincolnshire in the UK. The area has many residents descended from Dutch immigrants who drained the low and flat landscape, despite being so much like the Netherlands, Lincolnshire consistently does the wrong things to encourage cycling and there is very little cycling there.  
What's more, the Southern Dutch province of Limburg is actually rather hilly. Limburg hosts the Amstel Gold Cycle Race which is known for its particularly vicious hills. The capital of the province is Maastricht.

&gt;I covered Maastricht a few weeks back. They already have a cycling rate of around 30% of journeys, higher than anywhere outside the Netherlands, and are working hard to increase this.

&gt;Putting aside demographics, the only thing which seems directly related to cycling rate is the quality of infrastructure.

&gt;The Netherlands spends more per head than any other country on cycling infrastructure, Dutch infrastructure is the best in the world for cycling and this country has the highest rate of cycling as a result.

[Taken from ""A view from the cycle path""](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/hills) - a charitable campaign for the UK to emulate Netherlands urban planning

On the other hand, what about headwinds? - These are much stronger:
&gt;###The downside of cycling in a flat country

&gt;I've noticed a tendency for people living in other countries to be dismissive of the rate of how much cycling there is in the Netherlands on the grounds that ""it's a flat country, so easy to cycle"".

&gt;In fact, living in a flat country means living with headwinds. Strong headwinds.

&gt;I've cycled both in places with hills and in flat areas with strong headwinds. It's easier with hills. Hills don't go on for ever - after climbing a hill you get to ride back down the other side. If you're lucky enough to have rolling hills you can get part way up the next one with the speed you gain on the previous downhill. Excellent fun. On the other hand, once you start into a headwind you're generally stuck with it.

Only Gloria really fits that description nicely. And possibly Robin.

I would hugely disagree that Moffat likes writing strong female characters. All the females are devoid of any personality outside their singular role. I mean, I love Doctor Who (hence why I'm here) but I have no idea of what Clara as a person is actually like. For one thing, we've met her 3 separate times. Do they all have the same personality? Surely they shouldn't. She only really served as a plot device in season 7, and in the 50th &amp; Xmas special seemed to have a minimalist role with regards to the plot, content to standing at the sidelines. We've discovered very little actually about her and what she is about, other than blurting out that she fancies the Doctor in the Xmas special. 

My idea of a strong female character is someone like Lisa Cuddy, in House. A character whose sole purpose isn't to just interact with male characters in some archetypal role like ""love interest"". A character who has other motivations, other desires and other story lines than following a male blindly.

I certainly don't think he's a bad player, nor do I think Chelsea couldn't use him, as the Chelsea-turned-Liverpool bell end below suggests. In fact, since our strikers specifically have a problem scoring against inferior opposition, he'd be very handy to have (though I still don't want him, the biting, cheating, disloyal mong that he is).

What I do think it shows is firstly what everybody already knew or should have known, which is that Sergio Aguero, not Suarez, continues to be the best striker in the league by some distance.  Secondly it shows that good teams can mark Suarez out of the game, which frustrates him and makes him ineffective. Chelsea and City just did that to perfection.

Thirdly it puts his prolific scoring season in proper contest. Right now he's a flat track bully who pads his numbers against inferior opposition.  3 in 8 against top 13 clubs is really not that impressive.

No, because what are you comparing it to? Languages are in a constant state of flux. Instead, the best you can do is describe language as it is and compare it to whatever you compared it to earlier. There is no such thing as a *complete* grammar of a language.

&gt;Language evolves because people use words in different ways, yes, and common usage often changes what is considered formally correct. But there are formal standardised 'rules', and you can't deny they exist.

But which ""rules""? Because there aren't just one set. Usually, prescriptivist rules favor one particular dialect over others, leading people to think that somehow the other dialects are ""wrong"" when this most certainly isn't the case.

One that the opposition needs to be cognizant of and account for. 

That being said, I want Rodgers to bring in a more dynamic DM with Lucas as our closer that can be brought on for a Coutinho, Gerrard, etc. This way his game time is managed properly and he can help close the game out during tight games and when we have poor second halves.

But I immediately got hooked, and I ran through the contemporary Doctor Who episodes pretty fast, until I became current with the show.

true,Darknezz,tennant,Tennant,"""Fanfic"" became a dirty word because literally anyone with a pen or keyboard can write fanfiction, and most people are awful writers, so most fanfiction you'll see is awful. It's the same way ""Newgrounds"" became a running joke among video game enthusiasts, or how ""DeviantArt"" is a hilarious punchline when you talk about artistry. Yes, there are quality submissions on both those sites, and yes, there's good fanfiction out there, but let's be honest, a lot of it is awful.

You're right, though, that separation should be between good writing and bad writing, and not ""officially endorsed"" versus ""fanfiction."" That's a shitty line, and one that, as we see with Doctor Who, doesn't actually matter. Plenty of people hate Moffat's showrunning, but it isn't fanfiction *because he actually runs the canon*.

Hell, my favorite example of that line is Sherlock Holmes. Most Sherlock Holmes stories, and especially the most popular interpretations that spring into the non-enthusiast's mind when they hear the name, are all stories that were penned by people who aren't Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Plays, television and movie rewrites and reimaginings of Doyle's stories, ""fanfiction"" novels, practically nothing most people know as Sherlock Holmes has anything to do with Doyle's writing.

But you know what? Doyle fucking hated Holmes, and at a certain point, he only kept writing Holmes stories because they brought him a paycheck. A lot of those stories Doyle didn't write were eventually accepted into the canon. A lot of those are *better* than Doyle ever wrote, even in the eyes of hardcore Holmes fans.

The line that exists between fanfiction and official, original fiction is a stupid fucking line.",0,1388443891,null,0,false,0,cedo771,t3_1u0za4,t1_cedo771,t1_cedj78o,null,1427926239,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

No. Gold instead loses its value because everyone has it.  It's worth nothing.

Rent for example does not remain the same price it was once everyone's getting a free cheque. Rent will always be the price people are willing to pay and as everyone gets a free cheque, people are willing to pay more and then everyone has to follow.

true,TheNames_Meicroft,null,null,"**TL;DR** - All of the Doctor's companions need to be the stubborn, strong-willed, key-to-the-lock characters that they are written to be because without them, The Doctor would not make it and the show would not be as exciting.

After reading all of the current comments, everyone seems to believe the same few things about the female companions with the only differing thing being whether they like it or not. Since we're analyzing already, I'm going to take it a step further and analyze the words that have been used here and explain to the best of my ability why these words, whether negative or not, have a very good reason for being consistently present.

Firstly, I have not seen all of the Doctor Who movies or seasons before the relaunch, but I have seen many and I have seen everything since, so I'm not just firing blindly.

Female Companions, based on what has been said here, are the following: stubborn, bossy, loud, strong, a sidekick, and eventually become (if not beginning as) a key piece in the Doctor's success puzzles.

Looking at each of the companions I have seen and know quite well (Rose (&amp; Mickey), Martha, Donna, Amy &amp; Rory, and Clara), all of them are those words listed above. But at the same time, they are the synonyms of those words as well, the positive syn.s for the negative words and the negative syn.s for the positive words.

If you call a woman stubborn, and it's true that she is, likely she and the people in her life consider her things like strong willed, consistent, true to her word, and so on. Not saying that stubborn is always positive, nor am I saying that it is negative, but psychologically if you're going to get into a debate about any topic, your opponent sees you as stubborn and you see yourself as strong willed and standing on your beliefs and values. The same goes from the opposing side of the debate.

Bossy/loud is a tough one to counter, as bossy never looks or sounds good. Though, if you were to call a Drill Sergeant bossy, you would technically be correct but you would be so terribly wrong. It is one thing to be all about control, being in charge, telling people what to do, yet it is something totally different to be someone who is at heart a true leader. These two things often come across the same way when someone who is looking for something to be unhappy about looks at this type of person.

Strong fits very well into both of the above categories, but I would like to look at this one alone. Strong women make for good stories. That's the simple fact of life. The women you think of that make you proud to be human, that encourage you to do what it is you do, that make you strive for greatness, NONE of these women could ever be described as weak women, be it their personality or their heart/soul/mind. A strong person is a strong person and that is what you want to depict when you're telling a story of success, excitement, and adventure. A weak person would make any of those things seem like failures, because a weak person would fail. A strong lead role does not need to be accompanied by a strong side role, but it certainly makes for a better plot, especially when the two strong spirits clash with each other.

Sidekick/key piece...these two things, though seeming so different, are in actuality quite similar. A hero has a sidekick, when the hero is not unconquerable. A sidekick is someone who brings the best out of their ""hero"". This is how the human mind works (yes, I know Who is a Timelord, but he is written with the inner logical workings of humans because humans created him), one very strong person eventually will fail. They will eventually take on too much, and they will need someone there to either finish the fight or make them get up. Because a sidekick is required to be able to make their hero the best they can be, the sidekick is almost more important than the hero. Without a sidekick, the hero would get too worn, they would break down, and they would cease to succeed. The sidekick is and always will be the key piece to every puzzle the hero begins to put together, and the Doctor will always need a sidekick because the Doctor has taken on so much in his ~1500~ years of living that he has begun to break down and show his age.

Now, since I have taken a very obvious one sided stance at all of this, I would like to go ahead and say that I really don't like any of the companions. Each of them I find annoying, needy, and too much like a child to keep themselves out of trouble. This is where the Doctor comes in; The Doctor takes these humans, generally female, who are not yet very strong willed or successful on their own, as our current world is only beginning to come close to women being as successful as men, and he brings out their full potential. He makes the worthy of being his sidekick, of being anyones sidekick. He makes them capable of picking up a situation, a person, a society, and helping it succeed. But I still find them all bothersome. Clara is the least annoying to me, and I'm sure I'll get tired of her soon enough.",0,1388444142,null,0,false,0,cedob2k,t3_1u0hmz,t1_cedob2k,t3_1u0hmz,null,1427926188,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

By this logic, sounds like your personal hell, right? - Not exactly: 

&gt;[Do people cycle in the Netherlands because it's bad to drive here ?](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/2010/07/do-people-cycle-in-netherlands-because.html)

People want to make short journeys on foot or by bike. With the UK roads as they are at the moment, they don't feel safe. Therefore, everybody drives short distances.  
Create protected safe space and you take a substantial number of cars off the road. Especially at rush hour. How much traffic is caused by the school run because parents don't feel their children would be safe riding to school?

What I'm trying to say is **this can be very good news for drivers too.** There's something called induced traffic; building additional lane capacity is futile on city roads, because as soon as it opens and journey times improve, additional cars quickly use it until journey times are just as slow and congested as before.  
Good bike paths could give us the opposite effect. When a substantial number of people feel safe riding to work, it'll cut rush-hour jams like nothing else.

The Dutch already enjoy this. And all because they reduced *some* space for cars. Driving isn't banned - it's actually less stressful.",0,1388444705,null,0,false,0,cedojoc,t3_1u0kw7,t1_cedojoc,t1_cedn4wx,null,1427926078,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The dropping of these slots around 2000 was seen by many as the final admission that regional Eurostar services would not ever operate... although Eurostar still owns the rights to reinstate several paths in the future if desired.

Interestingly, GNER actually attempted to revive the regional Eurostars (albeit running domestic only services using them) - running at first York - Kings Cross, then Leeds - Kings Cross after clearance for that route was given.

Eh, this isn't entirely true. The ""filmish"" processing was only used on Series 1 and, to a lesser extent, Series 2, which is why the Series 1 DVD looks like shit (MPEG-2 compression can't really handle the ""softness"" they gave it, which is why the Blu-Ray upscale is actually worth it - h.264 does a much better job than MPEG-2).

But all of DW from 2005 through 2008 was shot in 720x576 standard definition. They didn't start shooting in 1920x1080 high definition until 2009, but the 2009 specials were shot in such a way (lighting, color, props, etc.) that they don't look *that* much better than Series 1-4 did.

The show didn't really embrace high definition until Series 5, which is when the lighting and art direction really stepped it up to make it feel more modern and, I'd argue, more film-like than it had prior to 2009.",0,1388445841,null,0,false,0,cedp1cp,t3_1u0kur,t1_cedp1cp,t1_cednd2f,null,1427925848,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

2) If not 1), then turn the sonic into the Sonic Cane. It'd be elegant, and provide a rather good running semi-visual gag of the Doctor insisting that ""it's just a tool, I'm not THAT old"".

4) Bit darker, bit more serious. As the War Doctor says: ""'Timey-Wimey'?""
5) Keep the current TARDIS. It's awesome. If it must change, add a few more lights to make it a little less dim, maybe make it a little more steampunk with some brass and wooden paneling.

Check out the [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/178245312192320/) group too as you might get more response on there. 

Have you looked at prices at all already for places locally on rightmove/zoopla? Might be worth it just to give you an idea of what to work with. I can give  you a top of my head run down if you want though. 

Honestly, I'd suggest trying to get something in hospitality in the short term as there's a lot of hotels, bars, nightclubs and restaurants around here! Much more so than office work but if you have experience I'd take a look around - again gumtree is quite good for small office work, but BUPA and AMEX are the two main employers locally. Not really sure who else as I've only just got an office job but quite a small place. 

Also it might be worth looking at selling the car. I know it sounds pretty crazy but I moved down 2 years ago, worried not having a car would hinder me and there's been about 3 times I've actually needed it.

In retaliation for this ultimately unsuccessful mission, the Daleks attempt to infiltrate the High Council of the Time Lords with duplicates of the Fifth Doctor in Resurrection of the Daleks (1984), followed by an open declaration of hostilities by one of the Dalek Emperors in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988).",0,1388448532,null,0,false,0,cedq6u0,t3_1toyc9,t1_cedq6u0,t1_ced8k8e,null,1427925311,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Little did we know the 4-0 defeat to Everton would become a trend at the Etihad with us putting 6 past big spenders Tottenham, 7 past Norwich, 4 past the defending title holders and 6 past the, ahem, league leaders. Despite only signing one player over the summer period, granted it was one Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid, they are leading the league by one point. A draw or more against Chelsea at Stamford bridge - the loss being due to a Joe Hart error which sparked massive controversy over the talent of the English keeper - would put Manchester City top of the league. But if we're going to look back at all the what ifs then surely the 3-2 loss to Cardiff would be a huge talking point. What no city fan realised at this point was our away form would be completely different to the perfect home winning streak at the city of manchester stadium. Win, win, win, followed by a win, win, another win, was the pattern at the Etihad and this included Arsenal, United (who it's worth noting have the second best away record in the league), Liverpool, Tottenham, Everton. But don't smile too quickly, this means in the second - heated - half of the season we must face all the top teams away and host Chelsea, second favourites to the title. Let's not forget City are favourites but this also raises questions; the blues are competing in 4 competitions, play a very intense game, are looking to break through youth talent and have some and have suffered with endless injuries to key players. Will the citizens bring in more players during January to reinforce the already deep and talented squad? Can manchester city win the league? Yes, most definitely. Will it be easy? Most definitely not.

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","Waiting on the platform at Southampton Central station, you'll frequently see huge container freight trains rumble past to and from the adjacent Southampton Docks - [among other things, the UK's second-largest container port](http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/Port_Information/) (meaning that if you take a look around the room you're in now, a substantial proportion of the contents probably arrived in the UK here).

This never fails to make me silly happy. Each train is a great deal of HGVs off of our congested roads, with much less pollution, a far better safety record, and far less noise and traffic blight on our cities and towns. Also, large lorries are responsible for the vast majority of road surface damage such as potholes, and [cause approximately three times expense to the public purse than their tax recoups](http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/system/files/heavy_lorries_MTRU_research.pdf) (PDF warning). 

I cannot understand why the government doesn't improve road conditions by subsidising rail freight at the expense of making HGVs bear their true costs. OK, some trucks are totally necessary to access every part of the UK, but at the very least the road journeys that are duplicates of existing rail freight routes could have a small economic penalty attached to discourage their use for regular transport by large companies.

I hope there will be room on Britain's ageing railways for a boom in not just passenger numbers but also freight. It seems that when one succeeds, the other has to suffer.

Ten was always going on about how amazing humans were, how noble, inventive, creative, loving, how they reach further and farther than any other species. Ten often acted like a time traveling tourist, enjoying watching the ever amazing humans and what they were up to in this place or that.

Eleven, in contrast, was always talking about himself and his own abilities. Humans weren't there to be marveled at - they were there to be an audience to his grandeur.

And that was a creative choice made by Moffat. Also, it spills into a lot of other choices he made. Moffat  trotted out the ""classic"" Who monsters far too often (which version of slow-moving, robotic-sounding enemy will it be *this* week?). 

Moffat also tended to build up mysteries over a period of a season or more, only to resolve them with a last-minute deus ex machina (not that Ten didn't have these from time to time, but they were fewer, further between, and not tied to longer story arcs).

Brighton is a pretty good cycling town if you're not scared of traffic (drivers are used to bikes, congestion means traffic is often slow, and the roads aren't that big) but it has HILLS. When you're looking up locations, don't forget to use a map with topography.

Moulsecoomb is one of the ""rough"" areas but doesn't seem scary to me (lived nearby for years, boyfriend lives there now).

true,mcctaggart,null,null,"You are right, there will be less demand for certain jobs as technology replaces workers but there will always be a need for workers. Anytime someone has surplus money, somebody invents a service to acquire that money. But what we don't need is a society where it is a race and struggle to acquire the wealth just to pay for basic necessities. You are right here too.

But instead of giving people free money (which has net gain of 0), it would be better to say limit how many hours everyone is allowed to work or limit how much they are allowed to spend on rent. That way people can't double job to pay higher price for rent which just forces everyone else to double job too. We have a system currently where people spend too much of their income on rent because everyone else is but the end result is, they end up saving nothing which just means they need to rely on social services down the line when they can no longer work or want to retire.  

In the future society you envision, somebody still needs to program the computers at least, so the problem is how should the work be divided up? We do need a stable economy. The country does have finite resources so the current ponzi scheme economy where more and more immigrants are shovelled onto the bottom tier which only makes those at the top of the pyramid wealthier will eventually collapse.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Operating a retail business is a trade for tax purposes.  This is legally the exact same position for Oxfam or the Red Cross as it is if you open a shop.  A company which earns profits from a trade is liable to Corporation Tax on those profits.

My understanding is that the retail arm of a charity and the *charity* arm of a charity will operate as separate companies.  This is fairly common because it puts a financial firewall in place so if, for instance the retail arm becomes insolvent, it doesn't drag the whole thing under.

I'm a little unsure what you mean by this:

&gt;But the curious thing is they're not allowed to make a substantial profit - or for that matter a loss.

They never make a profit because they can claim relief from tax by donating their profits to a registered charity.  Obviously this will be the registered charity they operate alongside.  Oxfam(Retail) has no use or incentive for significant amounts of profit since it doesn't have shareholders in the usual sense clamouring for dividends and the profits that are retained will be liable to tax.

Any losses they make can be group relieved against profits of the same group, carried back against profits of the previous year *(which would be of limited use because the bulk of the profits will be gifted)* or carried forward and set against profits of the same trade for future periods.

Unless I missed something, although it looks like they generate little to no profit that's misleading because the profits are gifted to the charitable arm.  They're not really existing in such a risky state with no cash on hand as it would appear from the balance sheet either.

It is entirely possible and indeed I think we're seeing the beginnings of the situation where a great deal of work will simply be automated away. 

Now the point about gold falling from the sky tackles a different issue. There's a difference between work done, that is the material output of society, and the nominal value of that output, i.e. how much you pay for it. As more work is done, the nominal value of the work drops (supply and demand), to the point we have in the UK where much manual labour simply isn't worth doing because the nominal value of it is so small compared to the costs of living.

In a society not too far in the future from our own, where much more is automated, including intellectual jobs as already pointed out, the middle class will suffer as the traditional working class have. The work is still being done, the services still being provided but there's essentially very little left for humans to do except in very specialised roles. 

Population control, also known as Eugenics, and let's not obfuscate the language on this issue, is not required because the work is still being done to produce the commodities necessary for society. What becomes necessary is giving people a living wage with which to purchase those commodities. They're then purchasing the work of the robots and computers.

Enough demand to employ an entire adult population? Demand is only going to fall for non-skilled labor, basic income addresses this.

&gt; instead of giving people free money (which has net gain of 0), it would be better to say limit how many hours everyone is allowed to work or limit how much they are allowed to spend on rent

That doesn't solve anything. If I want to work 90 hours a week, why shouldn't I work 90 hours a week? You should give people the ability to better themselves as much as they want, but you should also give people the security they need to live properly. Basic income addresses the *real* problem (the need for security), making work illegal doesn't solve anything.

&gt; We have a system currently where people spend too much of their income on rent because

People spend too much on rent because there isn't available housing. The solution is to build more houses, this is a widely accepted fact. The recent government(s) have failed by not building more houses, a cursory glance at how few houses we're building will show you this. The solution is to build more houses (increase supply to meet demand), not restrict how much people can spend. There was an article in this subreddit a few days ago that covered just how fucked we are (even with no basic income!) when it comes to housing, which we can fix if we build more houses. [edit: [found the article](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n01/james-meek/where-will-we-live)]

&gt; In the future society you envision, somebody still needs to program the computers at least, so the problem is how should the work be divided up?

Are you suggesting that every tesco cashier is going to become a computer programmer? What about a world where basic income guarantees people can pay for their necessities, and then if they want they can get a job (as a computer programmer), or they can train to become a computer programmer if they don't have the skills *or* they can do something else that they enjoy, like better their local community, or work in a shop, or paint. 

The days of everyone being employed are numbered, we can either embrace this by looking at solutions like basic income, or we can deny it and fight it and push even more people into poverty with awful ""benefits"" like job seekers allowance... until eventually we have no choice but to have a basic income.

My opinion is: I don't think Moffat is good at writing female characters, which is something common amongst male writers. His women are ""strong"" in the sense of being assertive, physically and sexually confident - but I don't get much sense that they have a rich inner life.

Some Moffat episodes are amongst my favourites, not just of Doctor Who, but favourite hours of television in general. I've been a Doctor Who fan for as long as I can remember and I'm certainly not watching for something to complain about. 

All writers have strengths and weaknesses, and the advantage of a writing team on a television show is a diverse team balances the strengths and weaknesses of it's members. Diversity is something rather lacking in the Doctor Who writing team though: since 2005 only one woman has written any episodes, and no woman has written for 11 during his TV run, and barring future re-union shows no woman ever will...

But there's an extremely important **however** that has to go with that:

A lot of attention was drawn to that the last time ROI had a bank bail-out from the EU.  The EU demanded that the CT rate was corrected because ROI is operating as a tax haven.  After playing chicken for a bit they got their bail-out because no one was willing to let the Irish banks go under, because the bank debts are so interconnected.

In effect they got to play tax have **and** a bail-out because they owed too much money for anyone to let them go under.

A freshly independent Scotland will have a much more complicated situation to deal with.  I'm not convinced that an independent Scotland would be financially viable outside the EU.  *(That's not a uniquely anti-Scotland issue.  I'm not convinced the UK (with or without Scotland) is viable outside the EU.)*

Presumably Scotland will inherit some fraction of the UK's national debt.  I know this is a highly contentious point in terms of how Scotland's share of the debt would be calculated.  

Scotland will have to apply for entry into the EU.  On the one hand it would be highly unlikely that the EU would refuse.  On the other I would be surprised if they don't make some pretty hefty demands.  The obvious ones being use of the Euro and restrictions on the upper and lower limits tax rates can be set at.

But he was overrun, because Allen struggles physically and Hendo seemed to lose a lot of his usual energy (maybe from Eto'o's challenge). Having someone like Fernando, would be a great option.

Yes, you may expect your average Waitrose customers to look a certain way i.e. well dressed etc. but there is certainly nothing especially 'quality' about the customers once you start interacting with them.

I'm not saying that all the customers are terrible but while serving them you just get the feeling that a significant portion of them are absolutely full of themselves and without going into detail an equal portion are just plain selfish.

In fact, I could almost guarantee that a guy who has obviously popped into the store to pickup some food while on his lunchbreak from his building site will be more pleasant than the middle-aged man in his expensive suit.

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"Either because Fox doesn't want to/can't give the BBC/Restoration Team the original NTSC tapes/reels of film to restore, or because the BBC/RT doesn't have the funds to properly restore it.

The version that's available is a restoration (if you can call it that) of the PAL master tape the BBC has had for years, which is a 24&gt;25fps conversion that was done very poorly. Some of the interlacing artefacts have been fixed, most haven't.

But just taking the PAL master from 25 back to 24 looks absolutely horrible and requires a LOT of work to get it to look presentable (some interlacing artefacts are at 480i, others at 576i, so it pretty much requires a frame-by-frame patch-up), and it looks pretty much fine if you do the same PAL-to-NTSC 50i-to-60i conversion that all other DW DVDs do, which preserves the speed, thus making all copies run 4% faster than they should.

Which is why the DVD is 1h25m instead of 1h30m, which is what it should be. And why everything is slightly higher in pitch.

I've tried fixing it, and I hope to eventually succeed, but it's a huge mess. Doesn't help that all effects were originally 30i, but all non-effects scenes were 24p, and they're all 25i now...",0,1388459783,null,0,false,0,cedsz83,t3_1u0kur,t1_cedsz83,t1_cedshyr,null,1427923940,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"The only thing Flamini does better than him is run.  He's able to cover more ground but Lucas is a much more intelligent player who is far better in the tackle as well.

It's hard to call Toure a DM really because the guy runs the entire pitch and is basically a threat from anywhere.  He's probably the best example of an all action box to box midfielder in the world.  And now with Fernandinho in the middle with him he has even more freedom to rampage.  He's one of the best midfielders in the world and he can play anywhere through the middle really well.

Fernandinho is a fucking beast.  I can't believe people thought/think he wasn't/isn't worth the money.

Sandro is more physical for sure, a better athlete.  He doesn't have the kind of footballing brain Lucas has though and I don't think his ball retention ability is as good either.

Scheiderlin is only a better athlete, Lucas is better in every other category.  I really love Scheiderlin too, I wish we'd try to buy him, but Lucas is better as a DM.  I actually think they'd be really good paired together in the middle as Scheiderlin really covers Lucas's deficiencies well and he is able to get forward a bit.

I hate saying this but Carrick is brilliant.  The guy understands the game so well.  He reads play brilliantly and always makes the smart pass.  Lucas is a better defender though.  This is pretty even for me since they both bring different strengths to bear.

Of those players the only ones I'd rate as clearly better than Lucas are Fernandinho and Toure.  Sandro is a close call and Carrick is a bit tough to compare, but they're on a very similar level.  We're seeing Lucas get exposed a lot this season because his biggest weakness is mobility and we haven't had someone with him who covers ground to help him out save the past few matches with Allen alongside him.  Everyone struggled against Chelsea but against City, Cardiff, and Spurs Lucas was fantastic.  If we have a player sitting in there with him who can compliment his abilities and help cover his weaknesses we'll see the very best from him.  He's a hell of a player and we're not seeing the best of him because we don't have a good player to put alongside him at the moment.  Synergy among players goes a very, very long way to bringing out their best.  Lucas is obviously not amazing at everything but if you confine him to his best role and give him someone alongside him to work with, he's a monster of a DM.

true,billnyethephysicsguy,null,null,"Note on the motivations: a companion of the Doctor is exploring a universe that they haven't figured and the only recognizable things in any given place are the Doctor and a phone box. As a companion, their presence is a direct result if the Doctor. The Doctor chooses companions to, well, accompany him. Regardless of gender, their motivation is mostly centered around the doctor.

The show has female characters with power, but that is not the focus. It's a show about the Doctor traveling the universe with his companion(s) and encountering other people, threats, and wonders. The name of the show is Doctor Who, and it's about the Doctor. The fact that sitcom characters are being discussed makes no sense, because this is an entirely different genre and format. Sitcoms are the misadventures of a group of people with unique motivation. The unique characterization of each character in those shows is a function of format. Here, it's a show about one man, so motivation of every character is going to relate to the Doctor in some way. The whole debate about sexism, from what I've seen, is centered on the female reliance on the Doctor, but this is necessary.

Now, gender dynamics: the Doctor is a male character. He is established as a male character, and the majority of the community is most comfortable with him as a male character. Changing genders without the community rallying for it is a risky move, and at its core, Doctor Who is a business. It's practically suicide to change genders, and even when the community settles, they're likely to lose a chunk of viewers who believe it to be too radical of a change. At the moment, the Doctor has to be a male. Still, to appeal to an a wider audience and to balance gender, they have to include a female, and the companion is the one who gets the second-most screentime. She has to be female for gender equality, otherwise the critics would accuse the show if sexism... Oh wait...

**TLDR: The Doctor is anchored as a guy due to paradigm/prior writing, and the companion has to be  female for gender name. The debate about sexism is stupid, and the comparison to sitcoms is pointless, because the show is formatted to be based around just one person rather than the development of the cast as a whole, so the nature of the show demands that motivation be based on the Doctor regardless of gender.**",0,1388461606,null,0,false,0,cedtpyo,t3_1u0hmz,t1_cedtpyo,t1_cednol2,null,1427923592,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Same thing with 11, 10 went through so much emotional pain and was so hung up on losing people that when he regenerated he became someone who was almost never fixating on things and who was constantly dashing around and always focusing on the positives in his life and the universe.

When we complain it's a victim complex, when they complain it's all Barcelona's fault. What a bunch of fucking twats.

Of course, there are outliers. If you're Leon Osman or Naismith you'll be lucky to score a solid 6.5 for a positive game, most people don't think much of Lukaku if he doesn't score, and a defenseman scoring warrants an immediate 8.3 or so at the least, and definitely MOTM.

Even if we're not perfectly reflecting each player's performance, I do think it's an interesting look at the expectations this sub has of each player, and how those expectations evolve over the course of the season.

My comment still stands. She thought that she was tackling the sense of entitlement that u/Honey-Badger described. In fact she was encouraging it.

Essentially, she was encouraging people to be selfish and her ideological descendants now criticise those that are and use this as an excuse to remove protections for those at the bottom of society.

Conviction rates are horrendously low because of a number of reasons... Firstly it is a crime usually committed behind closed doors; without independent evidence the threshold of ""beyond all reasonable doubt"" is hard to meet.
Secondly, in a lot of cases I deal with many women don't want to get their partners in trouble, so consequently don't support complaints.
Ok, protective measures are put in place but it seems that today's yardstick is conviction rates.

You then have to factor in that there is already sufficient legislation in place; this new offence would require two convictions... If you have a 6% chance of getting one home, you surely have a 3% chance of getting two. They'd be better off amending sentencing ability where Domestic Abuse is an aggravating factor.

Secondly these orders to prevent contact are also already in place. You have a choice of non-molestation orders, restraining orders and domestic violence prevention orders already; all of which do the same thing.

It's a shame to say it, but the whole sorry lot is a load of hot air. The focus should be on protective measures, educating perpetrators and educating those who have potential to grow into them. There should be funding for DV charities that offer counselling or advice; there should also be independents that work with victims to encourage them to remove themselves from these situations.

Age may change, a voice may get a bit deeper, a bit more resonant, but vocal patterns seem to stay the same. This is particularly noticeable in America. The vocal rhythms and patterns of the WWII generation are very different from the vocal patterns of millenials and even from baby boomers. Watch any old black and white movies and one would find vocal patterns similar to what Americans would consider to be the ""old people voice."" I'm sure its much the same in Britain.

There's also the fact that the older generations smoked more than younger generations or were around those who smoked more often. That can age a voice more than anything.

There will *always* be someone better-qualified willing to work as hard or harder for a lower price than you.

I'm not saying there isn't a problem, but the classic knee-jerk reaction is to pin all the blame on immigration statistics instead of looking at the bigger picture - Employers aren't sufficiently encouraged to favour local workers over immigration, and the immigrants may well be better educated and qualified than the Brits applying for the same job.

To be fair, I may also be showing my bias here, as the only Romanians I've met were at my last job. They were all *university and college students* on seasonal work visas who spoke good English, and some of whom already had degrees. They were happy working menial jobs as it both counted towards work experience required for their respective courses, and the wage they were being paid was higher than the average working wage in Romania, even if it was pennies for us. They could have had much more respected jobs with higher wages, but were simply not considered by employers due to their immigration status.

true,this_guy_says,lfc92,,"Amongst Liverpool supporters there is much, much more love for Lucas than any unfathomable hate. I'm sure he's a great personality off the pitch, and he's a great footballer too, however I DO think our judgement is clouded and we overrate him, in terms of his skills. 

These stats just prove what we know; Lucas is uncreative (although he is good at getting the ball up the pitch), he's not the best tackler, and he's very important to us as our defensive mid since we don't really have anyone else.

And like most football stats, this fails to attribute many key factors that read in between the lines, such as the different styles each club plays. Liverpool have Lucas to break down attacks and provide the first step in to working the ball back up the pitch. He's given a simple role in a more complex overall team strategy that enables him to rank up these stats easily, such as total number of passes or interceptions.  Put any other decent defensive mid in his spot and they will also have a good chance at shining. 

My problem with Lucas is that despite his more simple role and less responsibilities I feel I've seen him in the box, in very close vicinity to, most of the goals I've seen scored against Liverpool in the past month, failing to do anything productive- be it marking people in the box or breaking up counters and watching players dribble into our box.

The Master finally went under cover on Earth following the 22nd century Dalek invasion and killed David Campbell, the husband of the Doctor's granddaughter Susan. After being defeated by the Eighth Doctor, he fled in his TARDIS, taking Susan with him as a hostage, unaware of her Gallifreyan heritage. As his TARDIS materialised on Terserus she used his TARDIS' telepathic circuits to attack him, forcing him out onto the surface of Terserus. She used his own Tissue Compression Eliminator against him while he was holding the Dalek's transmuter. The blast severly deformed and nearly killed him. Susan departed in his TARDIS; this brief materialisation, however, alerted the Time Lords to the Master's presence on Terserus. (PROSE: Legacy of the Daleks)

*Some* Syrians are fighting for democracy. Some are fighting for the institution of Sharia law according to a strict Sunni interpretation. Some are fighting for the establishment of a separate Kurdish state in the NE of the country. I think you might be attributing a grand narrative (fighting for democracy) to an extremely complex, multipolar conflict.

A just war:

1) According to the principle of right intention, the aim of war must not be to pursue narrowly defined national interests, ***but rather to re-establish a just peace. This state of peace should be preferable to the conditions that would have prevailed had the war not occurred.***

2) Just wars must have ***a reasonable chance of success***. According to the principle of reasonable hope, there must be good grounds for believing that the desired outcome can be achieved.

3) The principle of proportionality stipulates that the violence used in the war must be proportional to the attack suffered.

4) The principle of last resort stipulates that all non-violent options must first be exhausted before the use of force can be justified.

a) Syria is emphatically not at peace and chemical weapons were used. 
b) I'm not worried about our odds.

**But**... I don't think it was obvious David was leaving yet.

So I think the idea was that River would continue to meet the 10th Doctor on screen. The goof here is Moffat jumping the gun a bit and introducing River Song at the end of David's time as the Doctor.

The Guardian has very high levels of bias; everything that is bad is bad because of the Tories (blaming the Tottenham riots of the Conservatives sticks in my mind as one of the worst examples) and a lot of their regular columns are pure tabloid garbage, peddling either incredibly narrow one sided articles or sensationalist rubbish (the cycling and feminism columns are among the worst).

The Guardian gets statistics but picks and chooses elements that support its views like any other paper. It gets notable people to write its columns but only those that share its editorial stance.

Comparing with the Sun, Daily Mail etc. isn't terribly apt, what is more apt is comparing it to the Times, Independent, Telegraph etc. and personally, I'm not really convinced it elevates itself notably above those papers.

Syria is surrounded by countries that will take on Muslim refugees. For Christians though these countries are less welcoming, that's in addition to their persecution being far worse than a typical Syrian. Life as a Christian in an area held by the Islamist rebels would be pretty terrible.

true,DrProfCapt,null,null,"I'm just upset that Moffat NEVER kills a character, and let's them stay dead. I mean, look at his most famous episodes from Davie's era:

1. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: famous for the ""everybody lives!"" ending. In my opinion, that's one of the most powerful scenes in the series, but only because we'd seen Nine go through a LOT. He really gave off the feeling that death followed him everywhere, and his other stories showed as much.

2. Blink. This may be controversial, but I don't count what the Weeping Angels do to you as ""killing"" you. Their general premise is pretty scary, but I don't think I'd mind being caught by one, especially if I had to choose a monster to catch me. If you have a vague knowledge of history, you can just be like Biff in BTTF 2 and get rich gambling. And not only do they not ""kill"" you, but Moffat always goes out of his way to have them write a letter, or be seen alive in the hospital for their last moments, as if to go ""in case it wasn't enough telling you, LOOK HOW MUCH THEY DIDN'T GET KILLED!""

4. Silence in the Library/ Forest of the Dead: This one always gets me mad just thinking about it. With how important River has become to the series, and how interesting her ""backwards love story"" with the Doctor is, it is SO important that we have an introductory episode where she dies. But we don't. At the last minute, she gets uploaded into a computer. It's the stupidest damn thing, and it leaves her effectively dead, but Moffat didn't have the balls to kill off a character we had just met. 

Now let's look at some characters from when he took over as showrunner:

1. Jenny. That's her name, right? Honestly, I don't know Moffats era half as well as I know Davies. I still generally enjoy the show, but have little to no motivation to ""follow"" it. Anyway, I'm talking about the lesbian who's dating the green chick. What a brilliant character to kill off. The green chick has always been a badass, and killing off her SO would motivate her to be even more awesome. Correct me if I'm wrong, but part of their characters points seems to be teaching kids that ""gay is okay!"", and what better way to do that than to show that a woman can grieve a dead girlfriend just as much as a man can? ""I know!"", says Moffat. ""How about I kill her, and then bring her back five minutes later, despite the fact that she has so littler personality that I could easily introduce a new character to replace her."" Brilliant Steven. Brilliant. Also, slightly unreleated, there's an episode where Strax asks them if he's ""the male one"", right? Aren't Sontarans genderless? Anyway...

2. Amy and Rory. Without going too in depth, what I said about the Weeping Angels still stands. Their ""deaths"" are extra insulting because not only did their death IMMEDIATELY follow a scene that could have given them an epic and memorable depth (jumping off the roof to save the world), but it relies entirely on one rogue angel surviving what none of the other angels could survive, somehow, with no explanation. Also, the Doctor can never visit them for some reason. Don't ask why. Time travel.

3. The eighth Doctor: okay, I might have lied a bit. Moffat killed off one character, kind of. The eighth Doctor has been ""dead"" since 1996, we just never got to see it. I guess this counts, though.

4. The War Doctor: Again, this is debatable, but when I say ""kill"" a character, I mean have them ""killed"", not just die. You can't ""kill"" someone of old age, no matter how much of a reference it is to the first Doctor.

5. The eleventh Doctor: See: above. Seriously though, this character is so reckless. There are a million ways to kill him off, and you choose death by retirement? Way to go, Moffat.

6. All other Time Lords ever: The Time War was an awesome piece of character development that definitively separated the new series from the classic one. It was dark, but it showed the Doctor was flawed. It ""humanized"" him, for lack of a better term. Better do away with that, because haven't you heard? The Doctor is Jesus, and every situation is actually the Kobayashi Maru. The worst part about this is that they weren't even Stevens characters to kill. He literally just had to leave them dead, and he couldn't even do that.

Bonus outrage: the Doctors name! Remember when we used to care about the Doctors name? It used to be an awesome little secret that not only did we want to know, but we wanted to know why it was so secret. Every time it was brought up, we'd get excited about it. Just a little tease, and we'd lose our minds. It was awesome. Well Moffat made sure to get rid of that. Not only did he make it WAY bigger of an issue than it needed to be, but he kept throwing it in our faces. If you don't have the balls to kill off a character, you certainly don't have the balls to reveal his name. But Steven keeps treating the Doctor like a God. He doesn't treat him like an actual character, he treats him like an icon everyone should just know the worship. I don't care when they bring up his name, because I KNOW they won't reveal it. I don't care when the Daleks show up, because I KNOW they won't exterminate anyone. I don't care when all hope seems lost, because I KNOW the Doctor can intimidate the entire universe just by saying ""I'm the Doctor!"", so there's no reason to care. 

TL;DR: Fuck Moffat. I hope he dies, then comes back to life, and finds out he's immortal. Shortly after, he falls into a hole for thousands of years, until he gets old and becomes the Face of Bo.",0,1388492819,null,0,false,0,cee1h8c,t3_1u0za4,t1_cee1h8c,t1_cedu0by,null,1427919041,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"&gt;The conflict initially began as a civil uprising, evolved from initially minor protests, beginning as early as January 2011, as a response to the regional Arab Spring, government corruption, and human rights abuses. Large-scale unrest began on 15 March in the southern city of Daraa, sometimes called the ""Cradle of the Revolution"", and later spread nation-wide.[128] The government responded to the protests with large arrests, torture of prisoners, police brutality, censorship of events, and some concessions. However, the protests continued to grow. In late-April, Assad began launching large-scale military operations against restive towns and cities. The operations involved the use of tanks, infantry carriers, and artillery, leading to a large number of civilian deaths.
&gt;***Following military crackdowns, many soldiers defected to protect protesters. Many protesters also began to take up arms. The first instance of armed insurrection occurred on 4 June 2011 in Jisr ash-Shugur, a city near the Turkish border in Idlib Governorate. Angry protesters set fire to a building where security forces had fired on a funeral. Eight security officers died in the fire as demonstrators took control of a police station, seizing weapons. Clashes between protesters and security forces continued in the following days. Some security officers defected after secret police and intelligence agents executed soldiers who refused to shoot civilians.***

true,JuanCarlosBatman,null,null,"&gt; The fan-fic complaint also confuses me. 

I don't think it has to do with Moffat's ""adoration for the show"". What I think the author meant is that the Doctor is quickly sinking into [Mary Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue) territory. And, to be fair, he has a point about it.

Now, the Doctor has always bordered on being a Mary Sue, what with being a nigh immortal time-traveling alien almost always accompanied by a beautiful young women. The thing that kept him from falling off the deep end was that he still had some flaws and he couldn't always prevail. 

Fast forward to Moffat's seasons, and how does the Doctor solve problems? He *announces who he is*, and that's apparently enough. He goes around being the smartest guy in the room regardless of where he is, has random women flinging at him for no good reason, and is so important that the entire universe literally revolves around his name (and the name of the show, in what has to be one of the lamest, most cringe-worthy fourth wall nods ever put to screen).

That's what the ""fan-fic complaint"" is about. The problem is not that Moffat has a ""much higher adoration for the show"", the problem is that said adoration translates into a series that turned the Doctor into a character that is as perfect as it is boring. Like I said in another post, an alliance of *all the evil races* merely managed to inconvenience him for a five-minutes cliffhanger, and even then he could bully them into holding back just by saying ""hey, it's me down here"". If all his enemies put together didn't even faze him, why should he care about just some Daleks or Cybermen? And if the Doctor has no reason to worry, why should we the audience care?

I've actually been looking at a lot of London skyline photos recently, it seems to have developed a far stretching skyline out of nowhere!

To the people who dislike the glass and metal:
Each generation has had disliked the architecture of the past, it takes a good few years for us to value the buildings.
At the same time, even the greatest, most iconic buildings of recent years had their fair share of dislike. That's perfectly normal, just like you might like tea yet I don't, not everyone finds pleasure in the same thing.

But I really can not understand this, 'old buildings are better. Modern ones are cheep and crappy - They all look the same' nonsense.
The most iconic modern buildings do not all look the same, simple as that.

What do look the same are the generic buildings that are built to a budget to serve the needs of the builder. Surely they have been similar throughout relatively modern architecture. Surely the 'old' buildings we see now on our streets were the iconic structures of their day, the cheap and generic buildings of the same period have been torn down and replaced..",0,1388494679,null,0,false,0,cee1ria,t3_1u0e58,t1_cee1ria,t3_1u0e58,null,1427918897,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Galerath,null,null,"Well for one thing we're talking about the difference between reasonably democratic states in the West which at least have some measure of restraint, vs authoritarian states such as Russia and China who are not averse to widespread military crackdowns and forceful repression as well as direct action.

Take for example the Ukraine situation. Russia has attempted to assassinate politicians, cut off gas supplies in the depths of winter, etc. all to try to force Ukraine to turn away from the EU. The actual *people* in Ukraine want to join the EU, but the centralist, authoritarian Russian government uses the tendrils of the state to force Putin's goals on the people.

As for China, need I mention North Korea or Tibet?

Compare that to Egypt, where the present near civil war situation is a result of Western Imperialism. The Cold War West backed government was toppled and the Muslim Brotherhood elected. The democratically elected government in turn being deposed by the military. These weren't the direct result of western state actions, rather it was the autonomy of separate parts of the state following their own interests. I.e. the military in Egypt knows it's best to be aligned with the West, the cosmopolitan Egyptians similarly want to be aligned with the West and both components of the population have acted on those interests without the West having to do much more than establish diplomatic communication.

So, whilst the situation is messier, it is at least in the genuine interests of much of the population to work with the West.

I.e. Western Imperialism, in the modern world, manifests as quiet diplomatic influence and soft power. It becomes within the *interests of a great many people to align themselves with the West, so they do*. Eastern Imperialism (if we can call it that) still manifests itself as 20th century Stalinism - the control clique imposes it's will upon people by direct force and threats in order to glorify the state. 

In other words, I think that Eastern Imperialism is worse because it's action in the interests of a much smaller segment of the population - the Oligarchy in charge - and it is an imposition over the great majority of people. [Modern] Western Imperialism on the other hand, generally manifests not as an imposition but as influence and indirect support for groups which align with the ideals or goals of the West. 

Of course there are exceptions to these. Iraq and Afghanistan in particular, but I suspect they were the last hurrah for old school Western Imperialism. We have found we simply cannot afford to keep doing that sort of thing. We've found we're far more successful by encouraging the people to do what aligns with Western ideals and interests, as in the Arab Spring. 

Perhaps there's still scope for the West to do things the old fashioned way, but so far we've had a decade of doing things in a much softer way, and as we're talking about the future, it's the view going forward which matters.",0,1388495632,null,0,false,0,cee1xdo,t3_1u1tx0,t1_cee1xdo,t1_cee1ayt,null,1427918822,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,fatfook,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;Wasn't a scandal at all.

I think you'll find it was when you consider just a fraction of the land sold off as part of this deal was worth the asking price alone.

The 'city' were allocated most of the shares, of course and as you say what was left was limited. It was simply a carve up among the rich/banking cartels to create a shit load of money from fresh air.

It's wrong because it was massively undervalued and belonged to the people as a public/state service. Where are you and your family's shares having paid into the creation and upkeep of the system for decades? Oh didn't you get any? Oh and look the government made 500 million overnight on their 30% guaranteed stake. They say they kept hedge funders out of it but this was clearly a massive cash cow for those privy to the entire process and for those who ended up with shares that were always going to rise and the ability to liquidate the massive swathes of top dollar land in London for future cash generation. The problem is the majority of the deal was done behind closed doors, without proper independent input, without any kind of referendum since it's state owned and massively undervalued. Lets see where it goes from here. My money is that some major London RM land will be closed and amalgamated before the end of 2014 and this then sold off for a huge profit for some sweet 'executive' housing.

But by far the biggest reason there is a 'problem' is the Â£40 billion pension liability which you ignored in your quote. How can you sell something off without also adding in the nasty, long term costly bit? Oh, it's easy, because when the same people selling it are the ones drawing up the deal and profiting from it, they are going to do it as favourably as possible. Corporate profit is now at the heart of the service as opposed to quality, efficiency and everything else.

EDIT: a lot of people seem to think that this is meant to be a plot hole or something. It isn't. Moffat has used this type of circular storytelling for a long time. For example, the Doctor calls himself that because of what it means, but it means that in large part thanks to his influence, meaning he got his name from himself. River Song (as Mel) kinda got her parents together before she was even born. This type of thing is to be expected, he's a time traveller, and I like it!

short answer is because like british tv there used to only bbc radio stations, commercial stations have only been around too long.

only recently with digital radio did we have stations that were dedicated to rock etc like america has had for years.

radio in the uk used to be like this radio 1 (commercial music for the younger generation),radio 2 (same but for the older generation), radio 3 for classical music,radio 4 for talk programs, radio 5 for sport. they still follow the same format, but that was ALL the radio stations you could receive.

If you wanted to hear something non mainstream you would have to  listen late at night to the (old) radio 1 rock show or john peel at 3am in the morning.

most british househoulds only had 5 channels until freeview was rolled out and more people took up cable/satellite television.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)

Channel 5 is a television network that broadcasts in the United Kingdom. It launched in 1997, and was the fifth and final national terrestrial analogue network to launch.

The British frequency plan had only allowed for four channels to be transmitted over the whole of the UK using analogue terrestrial transmitters, but the ITC identified that UHF channels 35 and 37 could provide coverage of around 70% of the UK population. However, these channels were used by many domestic video recorders for RF connection to television sets. Before the channel could launch, the broadcaster had to provide over-the-phone instructions or visit any home that complained in order to either retune the video recorder or fit a filter to completely block the Channel 5 signal.

and alot of people didn't even get five they got four channels! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_5_(UK)#Broadcasting_and_reception

this wasn't in the 70s this was the late 90s.

unfortunately national lampoon was right, we are a bit behind the rest of the modern world.

&gt; The Berlin-Baghdad Railway begins construction in the years leading up to the First World War. What happens is that Admiral Jackie Fisher converts the British navy from coal-fired to oil-powered ships.

&gt; The German navy follows suit but they donât have any oil-producing colonies, no place in the sun. Thus begins the âDrang Nach Ostenâ, the âdrive to the east.â The spine of this policy is the Berlin-Baghdad Railway.

&gt; But thereâs huge opposition to this plan among all the European powers Russia, France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands of Royal Dutch Shell. Britain has a special reason, over and above all the other allies, for opposing the railway. In engineering terms we cannot compete because we know that people will simply not accept the Sarajevo-to-Basra replacement bus service. And like the other powers we know that once the track is laid, thereâs nothing to stop a Munich businessman alighting at the Baghdad terminus with a Deutschebank chequebook, undercutting our concession and smashing the cartel.

&gt; Because of this the first British regiment to be deployed in the First World War - the Dorset Regiment - goes to Basra 1914. Where it is joined by 51 other Britsh divisions. The Ist Battalion of the Dorsets fought in Mons in August 1914. The 2nd Battalion of the Dorset regiment fought the the grandmother of all battles for Basra, occupying the city from November 22nd 1914.",0,1388501860,null,0,false,0,cee3caq,t3_1u33i7,t1_cee3caq,t1_cee39ne,null,1427917972,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

&gt;Think of it as a sudden shift from one point in your life to another.
Say when you're a child, you have certain interests and as you get older, those interests change, then as you continue on, they change more.
Then imagine that there is no intermediate stage; one day you're a child and you do what you normally do as a child, then there is a sudden transition to adulthood, where your interests and tendencies have changed dramatically in comparison. Then again, when you're older, everything changes suddenly again.
Regeneration is like that transition; instead of gradually changing interests or personality, they all change very suddenly, and it can be a jarring experience.

I posted a [similar comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1t4mps/regeneration_and_the_mind_problem/ce49swp) on a related discussion a couple of weeks ago too:

&gt;The Doctor's personality changes more than some other Time Lords' personalities have. One way to picture it is like a sudden shift from your personality at one point in your life to another discrete point without the stuff in between.
Say you're a child again. You have a certain outlook, certain likes and dislikes and that's normal.
Next, you're a fully grown adult, with a job and an altered outlook and maybe some different likes.
You've grown up and these changes have all been gradual and perfectly normal, but you look at them objectively and you seem quite different. Even most of your body cells have died and been replaced by new ones. You are still the same person you were.
Regeneration can be a lot like this, but without the growing up in between. You have a particular personality and the preferences it brings with it, then you regenerate. You're still the same person inside, but suddenly you might have different likes, different dislikes and even a different mode of behaviour and this has all changed at once, not gradually like it does growing up, but a sudden shift. You've been totally rearranged. You're still the same person at the core, but it takes a while to get used to it.",0,1388501988,null,0,false,0,cee3dnf,t3_1u3aus,t1_cee3dnf,t3_1u3aus,null,1427917953,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

If Britain was so war hungry why did it not use these events to start a war? Why did it play a large part in keeping the peace? Thus German expansionism and agression played a huge role in starting WWI, especially as they were the ones that declared war on Russia and France and then violated Belgian neutrality (which we were bound to uphold).

In the build up to war we were very reluctant to get involved. Over half the cabinet opposed going yo war to start with and France was panicking that we'd abbandon them.

true,am424,lfc12,,"I actually think the exact opposite. At the start of this season, I don't remember Lucas playing strictly as a ""third centre back"". I believe that change came about specifically during the Norwich City game and continued after our successes in the following games. I think Rodgers realized first that we were weak at the back and second that Lucas did not fit into his initial system given his offensive limitations. Rodgers altered it which I think works against mid and lower table teams but not against the the top teams.

With regards to Lucas and an offensive threat, I want someone who can pick out passes (and occasionally run) on counter attacks and effectively recycle possession when we bog teams down in their half for ""death by football"".

Squawka defines Key Pass as a [""pass that leads to a shot on goal that is not converted""](http://www.squawka.com/football-stats-definitions). Lucas has 9. Fernandinho has 20, Ramires has 19 and Barry has 17. To add to that Fernandinho has 2 goals and 2 assists, Ramires has 1 goal and 2 assists, Barry has 2 goals and 3 assists. Lucas has 0 goals and 0 assists. These stats are telling of how little he adds going forward. This ultimately puts more pressure on Henderson, Allen and Coutinho as the opposition essentially knows that they don't have to account for Lucas.

How would you ""of course be dead well before then"" if you graduate age 21 and the loan is written off 30 years later?

Student loans aren't included in bankruptcy and haven't been since 2004.

You're not.

&gt; Something still not right there. Why are the government lending money without the ability to get it all back before there own deadline based on even an above average salary?

The way the student loans system is set up is those that do well repay, those who don't aren't saddled with impossible to repay debts. It was done to remove the barrier to university to those from poor backgrounds.

Isinglass, a fish derivative, is used to clear up/fine real ale, though I've seen at least one study that suggested that those with sensitivity could consume isinglass-fined ales without problems.

The only other major distinction is that real ale has yeast settled at the bottom of the cask, but if it's well-kept neither yeast nor the finings should be much of an issue as they'd settle to the bottom.

&gt; Was surviving on Â£11 a week conducive to a healthy happy life for you?

Shit but the dole isn't supposed to be anything other than enough money to live on. The more attractive you make it the less incentive people have to want to get a job.

&gt; When you lived on Â£11 a week, were you on benefits? Did that include your rent, rates and heating? When was that?

Rent and rates were paid just as they are for claimants now. It was 1988 when a pint of milk cost more than it does today, a pair of the cheapest jeans in real terms was 5 times more expensive....

&gt; Do you think that because you have experienced that in the past, it would be the same as experiencing it now?

No. It would be infinitely better living on the equivalent now because food is cheaper in real terms.

&gt; Do you think that most people on benefits aren't scroungers, aren't there by choice and struggle or do you think that they all have their hands out?

Mixture of both.

true,Kousetsu,eng-lincolnshire,Humberside motherfucker!,"Things have actually gotten more expensive to make and build too.   
We used to have a lot of companies making things like bricks (as an example for what I am trying to explain). There were rules on what types of bricks you can use for what your are building. Before we stopped building houses as much, let's say there were 20 companies, making the right kind of brick that you as a builder need to build a house. 
Everyone stopped building houses. These companies either closed because of that, or stopped making that kind of brick. 
Now, in 2013, you are in the position to start building houses again. Only so is everyone else. And now there are only 3/4 companies that still are making the brick you need. And they have been making them at a very reduced rate for the past 5 years and cannot cope with a sudden increase in demand.
This leads to companies being on waiting lists to get bricks, because they are on a waiting list for the bricks, and they can only get so many at a time (the companies are naturally going to limit the supply to people so they can service as many people as possible) they aren't going to hire builders to build houses a little bit at a time as they get the bricks in.  
No, they are going to wait until they have enough bricks to build the houses without stopping and starting, because it is cheaper.

So currently this problem, that I have massively over simplified, is one of the major barriers to getting houses built, and it will take a couple of years to get rid of it, at least.

At A-Level, the stuff you do is marked by examiners who often barely know the subject. At university, it's marked by the lecturers. They know the material inside-out. There's no ""key words"" bullshit that cost me so dearly at A-level. They don't look for a specific word or phrase and mark you based on how many you can trot out in the correct context, but for a demonstration of understanding.

Yes, primarily that the BoE was freed to set the interest rates. We also had a period of record growth combined with low mortgage interest rates. Throughout the 80's mortgage interest rates were well into double figures so whilst house prices were low, repayments were 3/4 of your take home pay so that limited what you could afford to borrow, not to mention record unemployment far worse than recently. Then literally a couple of years after recovering from the recession of the 80's we were in yet another one as we entered 1990.

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"&gt;Why doesn't 13 remember basic stuff like how to fly the ship-- don't all the doctor regenerations possess consistent memories across lives and the only thing that changes is personality?

Regeneration rearranges all the cells in their bodies, and the process tends to make them erratic and confused sometimes, for a little while.  It would be a little like waking up from a coma, or something.  

&gt;Why did the crack send regeneration energy and why did it close?

The Time Lords on Gallifrey, who were on the other side of the crack in the universe (stuck in a different universe, which the Doctors put there in the anniversary special last month), heard Clara's plea, and agreed with her, that the Doctor needed their help, and they, knowing that he was the only one who could save them, sent him a new set of regenerations (12 more, presumably) which is something they can do (it was debated, but there was precedent, from past stories where the Master was granted a second set of lives for doing something important for the Time Lords).  The crack closed... well... it closed for dramatic effect, as imagined by Moffat, I guess.  

&gt;Since Clara is ""sprinkled along his timeline"" is this the original version of Clara with her family or is there some kind of weird plotty-wotty timey-wimey things at work there?

I'm not quite sure what you're asking here, as there seems to be a missing word or two.  But presumably this story was *current* Clara in her normal/original time line, after she got out of the Doctor's past timeline from Name of the Doctor.  Note, that her dad was supposed to be the guy next to her at the table, but that he wasn't played by the same actor as before.

It shouldn't act like one because the individual countries are two different. Acting as a single country the EU would inevitably make decisions, such as interest rates, which may be best for some areas but worst for others working as individual countries avoids this.

&gt;We should care about reducing social problems because people are affected by them, regardless of where they live. 

You didn't read what I said properly. Why should we care about them more than or as much as those in our own country? We can't handle our domestic problems and we're one of the richest countries in the EU, what happened to eliminating child poverty. We can't reasonably attempt to aid other countries social issues without ailing our own, and we aren't going to get an equal level of support from other EU countries as we would put in.

The point of a country is a group of people all working together to fulfill our collective needs. London can't survive without the rest of the country as it's a money generating power house but is massively deficient in the other things required to keep a country going.

If you wanted you could also place a real wager. Not that I'm involved with the gambling industry or anything (full disclaimer: I was.)

Realistically we should be in a position to fight it out in the top 3. We're lacking depth and quality in key positions which means that we're less likely to win the premiership than say Man City. We've probably got the second best first team and the second best squad in division. 

FA cup, despite our recent success is a crap shoot. Either we'll do well, or we don't. Very draw dependent. 

With regards to the Champion's League, the English sides have all looked like they've been in a period of transition over the last 2 years and therefore they've been broadly a tier below Bayern and the Spanish teams. The quality of football has been much better in the PL this season and the top English side will be able to start investing their new TV money - the deal's been signed and they know how much income they'll be getting - important for FFP and bank finance. More competitive leagues also breed a better international viewship, after all, who wants to see Barcelona predictably stomp Elche and Getafe? 

 We'll probably see a much stronger English presence next year as Man City, Chelsea, Arsenal and who ever's 4th start finding their feet. We should beat Galatasaray over two legs. Gala are probably about the equivalent of Southampton/Newcastle.

true,wredditcrew,null,null,"&gt;badgers haven't been used for sport since the Victorian era.

I think hunting with dogs for anything that you aren't going to eat is generally considered sport, and for anyone to imply people don't hunt badgers with dogs is very ignorant. As we're discussing the BBC, I'll use a [BBC news article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25150341) as an example. Where's the CuntLie statement when it comes to people hunting with dogs? Oh right, they're slagging off the NSPCC for prosecutions.

&gt;Their numbers need to be controlled because they're voracious killers of bees, hedgehogs and other species (having nearly wiped out both in our area)

Interesting, admittedly I'd not heard that, but ""having nearly wiped out [bees and hedgehogs]""? Is there anything to back up that badgers have nearly wiped out bees in your area, given CCD is such a problem in Europe in general?

&gt;One example amongst many is the interview on Countryfile with that hedgehog expert (who is a friend of a friend) in the Christmas Special: when asked about the causes of hedgehog decine, ""badger predation"" was given as ""the most important factor"" - but the BBC cut this out and only left in anything that blamed farmers. Not the cuddly badgers.

That is entirely unacceptable, and I would complain to the BBC, Ofcom, and the BBC Trust on that.

If people want to spin a badger cull as being an effective control required for controlling a predator to bees and hedgehogs, that's one thing and I'd be interested in the arguments if there's science to back it up. But it's been spun repeatedly as the magic cure for bovine TB, and that shit don't fly.",0,1388509436,null,0,false,0,cee5zg1,t3_1tv9ku,t1_cee5zg1,t1_cee3rrj,null,1427916529,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You seem to have no idea how things were in Iraq. The campaign started with ""shock and awe"" and continued that way with extreme use of violence any time our troops felt threatened. How many civilian massacres does it take for us to match ""Eastern Imperialism""?  And the torture? The rape?

&gt;  Russia has attempted to assassinate politicians, cut off gas supplies in the depths of winter, etc. all to try to force Ukraine to turn away from the EU. 

Three points:

* the Ukraine deal was bad for the Ukraine, it wasn't EU membership. It was the worst aspects of EU membership with none of the benefits. The BBC is lying to you again about the nature of the debate.
* America assassinates it's political enemies every single day via drones. Most of these have no interest in America and only want to influence politics in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
* Some of America's first targets in Iraq was the power *and* sanitation systems.

There is a difference between planning before you leap (spend borrowed money) and having a rigid plan, a lot of the time the market will shape your business, what they want from you, and what you think they want may well be different.  However really do try and plan as much as you can in terms of potential costs and how much money you will need.  It is easier to raise Â£15k upfront, than to raise Â£5k once you've got Â£10k debt.  Obviously this goes out the window if you have profitability or good turnover, but for a starting business cash flow is key, you don't want to be left Â£5k short.

true,Turil,k9,K-9,"TIL: Originally, the producer wanted to nix the idea that the Valeyard would really show up in the future:

&gt; Some of the background for the Valeyard was lost due to creative differences between John Nathan-Turner, Doctor Who's producer, and script editor Eric Saward. An earlier draft of The Ultimate Foe made it clear that the Doctor would definitely, at some stage, turn into the Valeyard, desperate to extend his life after his remaining regenerations had run out â a situation not dissimilar to the one earlier faced by the Master. Nathan-Turner did not favour the dark nature of these and other developments in the script, and felt this plot point would allow cancellation of the series for bookending the Doctor's future destiny. This fear was justified by the then-recent hiatus placed on the show by BBC controller Michael Grade.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Obviously you feel that there's something about British culture that means even if there were the finest bike paths in the world, it's a pipe dream to see people using them. May I ask why that is?

Weather, social attitudes, the geographical distribution of housing and the fact generally most people live longer from their workplace than is necessarily the case elsewhere in Europe or Asia where cycling is more common.

&gt; I point to the Netherlands. They have the best bicycle route planning in the world - and 70% of all adults regularly make practical journeys this way

I've been to the Netherlands a great deal, and I would always caution people about using both the Netherlands and Scandinavia as an example of a functioning social utopia... because when you spend any amount of time there you quickly realize they aren't. They might score higher on WHO and OECD ""quality of life"" indicators - but it doesn't translate into a clearly visible better quality of life. People cycle in the NL because of a combination of factors, including social traditions, geographical (most people live relatively close to their workplace and the small size of the nation and the dense nature of the way housing is built there really lends itself to this) and economic factors (the NL has the second highest fuel prices in Europe and take-home wages are generally much lower as taxation is higher).

Basically, the fact the Dutch cycle is more of an anomaly to do with them - than something we should try to replicate, because it won't work here. 

Anyway, the numbers speak for themselves. It's hard when you're a committed adherent to cycling to accept that other people may not take to it the same, but that in itself is part of the social barrier to cycling - that cyclists themselves as perceived as Lycra-short wearing nutters who won't shut up about the moral virtues of cycling.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I disagree that we don't need anyone coming in.  Even with a fully fit squad we're short on options in a few areas.  I think we're in need of:

A midfielder.  At the moment we have 4 senior CMs covering 3 positions.  That's terrible depth as just 1 injury leaves us with no natural midfield substitutions.  And then Gerrard is aging, his game clearly drops off late on in matches this season so we really need another option at least as a sub.  Cover for Lucas would be really nice but he seems to be getting past his injury problems a bit plus Allen can deputize there in a pinch when he's fit.  Some examples of players who fit a midfield role that I like: Rakitic, Cabaye, Fernando, Xabi Alonso

A fullback: Cissokho is still crap, and only here for the season.  With Kelly struggling to find form and fitness, Flanno hurt, Enrique hurt, and Johnson in bad form, we could really use a good player here for either flank.  Once Enrique and Flanno are back it's a huge boon, but I think it's early to place such huge responsibility on Flannagan.  I have doubts he can keep his form going for extended periods of time, though I love his work ethic and desire to succeed.  He's certainly improving a lot but I don't think he's quite reliable yet (which it pains me to say as I've been singing his praises since the Arsenal match) and we're at a time when we need reliability.  Couple of examples of young players that are a bit more developed and ready to take things on that I like: Montoya, Ricardo Rodrigeuz, Shaw

An attacker: 1 injury leaves us pretty devoid of depth here.  We're placing a huge amount of responsibility on a 19 year old kid right now.  He's handling himself reasonably well but it's very unfair to look at him as our top 4 hope.  Sturridge is made of glass too, it's hard to rely on him always being fit.  Whether we look for a winger, a good CAM, extra CF, or someone who can play a variety of positions in the front 3/4 (formation depending) I'm not sure, but we could really do with something to boost us here.  Example players: Tello, Draxler, Mata

The players I've listed are just some samples of ones who could maybe be available that fill these roles.  I tried to stick with ones we're linked with as much as possible, but some of them are just hot prospects who would probably fit in well with the team rather than ones we seem to be after.",0,1388514303,null,0,false,0,cee81zh,t3_1u3jyw,t1_cee81zh,t1_cee5kxv,null,1427915427,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

That said, this would require us to move away from the 4-4-2, which doesn't look like it will happen, even though it should. It's an outdated formation that forces us to play laterally and relies on Adebayor to come get the ball deep and distribute it, which is great to see from him, but Eriksen/Holtby/Sigurdsson are all more suited for that. We've certainly been playing more fluid under it, but I would attribute that to Sherwood's Redknapp-esque mindset than the formation.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; You seem to have no idea how to read. 

And you seem to have no idea what an ""exception"" is. You cannot claim our two largest foreign policy endeavours of the last ten years are an ""exception"". By being the largest and most prominent they become the de-facto ""norm"", particularly when viewed in context of the last 200 years of identical UK history. 

Where is this ""soft diplomacy"" you speak of? Can you cite examples?

&gt; We've found we're far more successful by encouraging the people to do what aligns with Western ideals and interests, as in the Arab Spring.""

And that is just plain wrong. Most of the initial Arab Spring events were people rebelling against western installed/backed dictators e.g. Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait etc. The only ones ""in our favour"" would be Syria &amp; Libya, and the latter wasn't ""Arab Spring"", it was an Al Qaeda insurrection led by people who have been continually rebelling against Gaddafi for decades.

Of these, the only ""success"" was Libya where dropped insane amounts of ordinance on the country. We literally won that war for them, all the rebels were doing was waiting for our fires to go out then advancing to ""capture"" the land. Again, not ""soft diplomacy"", it was plain old war, albeit with only a handful of our guys with boots on the ground. 

&gt; Doesn't really matter. Point being, the people want it. Or would you prefer to force your choices on them?

That's exactly what we are doing! Our media has misled them into supporting an economic policy that will lead to large scale unemployment through the loss of manufacturing capability by being undercut by subsided EU industries. But it ""opens up markets"" for the EU, so fuck them, right?

&gt; And China and Russia assassinate their opponents too. Future isn't looking bright under their Imperialism is it? 

Maybe Russia, China just locks them up, much like us. 


What is ""Chinese  Imperialism"" by the way? Could you describe a few examples of them invading other countries or overthrowing governments? All I can see is a shit ton of projects in Africa where they are throwing money at whatever governments will give them the time of day. If anything this is far more akin to the ""soft diplomacy"" you seem to think we use. 

&gt; No, because mostly that's a hangover from the previous century.

Really? I guess you haven't been paying attention to our new installations in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. Libya has more political prisoners today than it ever had under Gaddafi. ",0,1388516987,null,0,false,0,cee97dt,t3_1u1tx0,t1_cee97dt,t1_cee7ecn,null,1427914890,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Advance tickets are available up to the night before travel. If you have to change trains at any point, see if it's cheaper to buy seperate tickets (this is more likely if the two legs are operated by different companies). There is also the practice of split ticketing at other points but that can get a bit fiddly, so I'll let Google explain that one for you.

Just remember that advance tickets are only valid for that specific train, if you miss it, you'll have to buy another ticket.

This is the second time you've not properly read what I've typed so I'm not going to continue replying after this. I said that the problems don't directly affect us. Solving problems which indirectly affect us almost always have less benefit at greater cost than focussing on the problems which directly affect us.

Aiding poverty in bulgaria would be a good thing to do both for the bulgarians and (indirectly) for our own economy. However reducing poverty here in the UK would help a similar number of people, be cheaper (easier to get involved in domestic issues than international) and aid our economy more. I'd also argue that we have a moral obligation to help those in our own country before those in others.

I agree that if every part of the EU was equally rich we would have near zero net migration however it is not the case that everywhere is rich. If the whole of europe had open boarders and the same economic decisions affecting all the whole region would become more homogenous. However for us this would mean losing our wealth and the worsening of our social problems, so people wouldn't want to come here.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;And you seem to have no idea what an ""exception"" is. You cannot claim our two largest foreign policy endeavours of the last ten years are an ""exception"".

I'm going to stop responding to the insults, CBA. I can make an exception of anything I want, it doesn't have to be a minority. I.e. ""The weather in the UK is lovely, except when it isn't."" perfectly valid statement.

Also the last decade being the operative phrase. The last 10 years have been a bit different. 

&gt;Where is this ""soft diplomacy"" you speak of? Can you cite examples?

The EU (see below RE Ukraine). The recent breakthroughs over the nuclear stand off with Iran. The bilateral agreement with Russia over chemical weapons in Syria. 

&gt;Of these, the only ""success"" was Libya where dropped insane amounts of ordinance on the country. We literally won that war for them, all the rebels were doing was waiting for our fires to go out then advancing to ""capture"" the land. Again, not ""soft diplomacy"", it was plain old war, albeit with only a handful of our guys with boots on the ground. 

But you're missing the point - the population started it, we didn't. We went in once the population had started it and won favour. 

&gt;That's exactly what we are doing! Our media has misled them into supporting an economic policy that will lead to large scale unemployment through the loss of manufacturing capability by being undercut by subsided EU industries. But it ""opens up markets"" for the EU, so fuck them, right?

And there is the soft-imperialism I was talking about. In the 19th century we'd have invaded them to force them to open their markets. 

&gt;What is ""Chinese Imperialism"" by the way? Could you describe a few examples of them invading other countries or overthrowing governments?

No, but then overthrowing governments isn't their style. Which is my point. Instead here's Chinese Imperialism:

* If you haven't noticed there's a massive and militarised stand off with Japan over a bunch of Islands in the Pacific. 
* They've also unilaterally declared military zones of control such as the ongoing dispute in the [South China Sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea).

Since we're getting historical:

* Tibet 
* Korea
* The Sino-Vietnemise War
* Incursions of Maoist groups in northern India, etc.


But the historical examples are mostly a waste of time, let's reign in this debate before it goes totally off to the side. The point I was trying to make was that /u/ruizscar seemed to think that somehow Western Imperialism was worse than the alternative and that the rise of Russia and China would put a stop to it. My retort was that they're just as bad, if not worse. Do you disagree with that assessment?

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"It's supposedly really easy to switch since the industry account switcher went live in Q4. The real barrier to switching is that the trust issue isn't just a Barclays one: people don't really trust banks in general anymore, so switching for that reason doesn't change anything.

If you're going to switch banks you're best doing it on purely pragmatic grounds. Different banks tend to be better in some areas and worse in others. HSBC for instance are a fantastic bank if you travel or do business internationally: their charges for making international payments are low and they have branches in most countries. On the other hand their credit card offerings are mediocre and they don't have UK call centres that are open 24/7.

Pick the bank that is the closest fit to what you need. Or have accounts with multiple banks, which is generally considered sensible to provide a backup source of funds. Some banks are trying to dissuade this practice though by charging fees for standard accounts unless you use them as your main bank.",0,1388519866,null,0,false,0,ceeaf7j,t3_1u323m,t1_ceeaf7j,t1_cee0xr8,null,1427914113,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
