A square mile that is sovereign and has nothing at all to do with the country of England. New Jerusalem has its own government, police force and even its own flag. It also owns a lot of London City stretching outside the square mile including all the major bridges.

All the wars fought by Britain have not been English, Scottish or Welsh wars but they have been New Jerusalem wars using these puppet nations as its veil and slave veiled as British. The definition of Britain is covenant land meaning a promise to pay land or slave land. The definition of British is the same but of man not land. Yes both are slaves to the City of London Corporation fronted by the Lord Mayor of the City of London.

New Jerusalem is the biggest pirate in the World, they have stolen millions and they have even ripped off the Geneva Bible with the King James Bible written by the Mercers and patented by the Crown Corporation. You name it, they have stolen it and forever will do just like they recently stole the Carbon Trading platform from Cantor Fitzgerald on September 11th 2001 for the new carbon trading based economy. A leopard never changes its spots!

The World’s financial system is run by The Worshipful Company of Mercers through TheCityUK run by Stuart Popham of the Royal Institute for International Affairs.

The military intelligence and energy sector is run by The Worshipful Company of Fuellers. This my friends is your military industrial complex often spoken about. These Livery companies continue to this day but veil themselves as now being simple charities. This also aids their tax avoidance like all these elitist foundations created such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

From watching the minisodes, how he cured her wrist in The Angels Take Manhattan and [Spoiler!](#s ""His scene with River in The Name of the Doctor and his avoidance of saying goodbye""), I can't really see how people that would support his *love* with Rose wouldn't see it with River.

It's definitely a different dynamic. But I really do see the Rose thing as a puppy naive love: ""we will be forever and ever and ever together"" (followed by if I can't have you, then can I have a clone please?).

The River relationship seems a bit more mature. There are constant references to spending a lot of time together off-screen and of having a very very *fun* time (if you know what I mean...)

I would be more inclined to think that he really wasn't in love with either of them.


In any case, this is where I am not directly talking to /u/celtic_thistle but airing my general contempt at people's reactions to why River is in a one sided relationship:

* Rose happened first, people have a harder time to let go

* Billie Piper is younger than David Tennant. Alex Kingston is older than Matt Smith. (Fixed. Although it's quite touching when in reference to The Angels Take Manhattan)

* Expectation of love relationships *a la* Rose and 9/10 of *forever and ever and ever*

* We first see River with 10, who had just met her and does not show any attraction. If 10 (**THE** Doctor in many people's heads) didn't show attraction to her, then obviously he could never really love her.

* Chemistry. Not perceiving the right chemistry between both of them. I could agree with this somewhat. But the spoiler moment above really changed it for me (although the change really started for me with the [First Night](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xn34tx_doctor-who-night-and-the-doctor-first-night-vostfr_creation) and [Last Night](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xn354o_doctor-who-night-and-the-doctor-last-night-vostfr_creation) minisodes).

But that decision would necessarily be different for different people, and to some extent arbitrary. Why stop at a personal moral judgement based on a patients previous actions? Why not also throw religion or skin colour into the mix? Sexual orientation? Who decides what's just or not, and based on what criteria?

&gt;Go google ""fire in a theatre"" and read the wikipedia article all about how that argument was used to justify political censorship ;)

Erm, have you actually read the whole article?  Let me quote it for you: ""Despite Schenck being limited, the phrase ""shouting fire in a crowded theater"" has since come to be known as synonymous with an action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes are blatantly obvious.""

B. The Doctor has definitely destroyed planets filled with innocent people. As a result of the Time War (which he started) many planets were effected and destroyed. Remember the Gelth from the unquiet dead? That's completely leaving out The Moment, which caused even more destruction by his own hands. 

C. This was almost completely explained by the Great Intelligence. It is the site of a battle the Future Doctor participated in. At this point the Doctor was very old, and he died during whatever battle was taking place. He said the Battle was small by the Doctors standards. It's most likely the planet became barren and destroyed as a result of this battle. ",0,1369430038,null,0,false,0,ca5dt5a,t3_1exv6z,t1_ca5dt5a,t1_ca58916,null,1431043797,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I haven't watched many Swansea or WBA matches, so i can't really comment on their system that much, but when i watch Dortmund, i see an ideal version of what the past 3 managers have tried to adopt with a 4-2-3-1. I get the feeling that theirs is the type of football that Roman is after, and i read somewhere that Mourinho has taken a strong liking to Jurgen Klopp after their semifinal tie... I want Lukaku to stay too, and i can see him playing a huge role in our future, but i don't think it's too farfetched to see Mourinho letting Lukaku get some time in the German system under Klopp, while he gets the current squad + some summer additions molded into the system that he wants us to play in the long haul. 

what i'm saying is that I don't think Lukaku needs more time adjusting to the Prem, i think he has the PL down pat. i think he would benefit from the technical experience and pressure of CL games in Germany. Then, in 1-2 years' time, when Mou has gotten a general squad system perfected, Lukaku would be brought back and be able to seamlessly transition into our system (that is tailor-made for the style of play he'll develop at Dortmund), and have all the European swagger that players like Lewa, Goetze, and Reus currently have/are gaining. that is the team that i foresee becoming a juggernaut on all fronts, and slaughtering teams in a physical, yet precise, manner, en route to multiple finals and trophies. and Mourinho's name surpasses SAF's in the history books.",0,1369430054,null,0,false,0,ca5dtc5,t3_1ez2pg,t1_ca5dtc5,t1_ca5cuuh,null,1431043798,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Here's the thing.  People protesting against Muslims are demonstrating racist bogotry, because the murderers do not represent the general Muslim population.  Nobody is saying that we shouldn't be angry about the murder, that there isn't a problem with militant Islam, or that we shouldn't be asking questions about certain policies.  All people are saying is that directing this anger at Muslims *as a whole* is completely off the fucking rails.

For hundreds (if not thousands of years) the ruling nobles of European countries bred exclusively with other ruling nobles. They also moved borders regularly within generations - as marrying off children to other nobles elsewhere was a way of doing diplomacy. As a consequence, they are basically their own seperate ethnic group, not unlike European jews who also bred exclusively.

An introduction's purpose is three-fold. The most vital elements are to entice and to explain. The opening sentence, as the author points out here, is very much simply to get the audience curious, to set them in the middle of a little mystery.

But *Blink* does exactly what the author says *not* to do: It leaves you with too many questions unanswered to be a normal introduction. Who's that girl with the Doctor? What is the TARDIS? Why does it look like a police box? What is the Doctor? What is the premise of this show?

All of these major answers are left totally for want, because *Blink* is not intended to be an introduction.

But all this is made moot by an introduction's third purpose: To lead into the story.

Sally Sparrow never returns, and we only see the Weeping Angels make a comeback after many, many other stories reach their conclusion. This story entices, but it doesn't lead into anything. You can't just ""watch onwards"" from *Blink* forward. You'd have to actually go back to a proper starting point (usually *Rose*) and continue from there.

And that's really my point. As far as starting a story off, *Blink*'s rubbish. It doesn't explain what the story is or will be and introduces very little that continues into other stories. But as far as getting the viewer's attention with a bit of teasing mystery, it does splendidly.",0,1369431120,null,0,false,0,ca5e6gs,t3_1ezbt1,t1_ca5e6gs,t1_ca59vj9,null,1431043623,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

true,I_Am_The_Slime,mccoy,McCoy,"I could honestly write an essay on it.  The Master's cringeworthy resurrection and even worse ""turn every human into me plan""; the Naismiths, who were such pointless characters (yeah, we're introduced to the Immortality Gate through them, but they're so one-dimensional and are given literally nothing else to do); the ridiculous build-up of the Time Lords returning which was then resolved in a split second and again ended up being pretty pointless; the far too long and unnecessary farewell tour  etc.  

But worst of all, the episode is one of the single worst character assassinations of the Doctor in the history of the show.  By all means, have him fear death (in fact I'd probably be okay with the episode if for the whole time he thought he was really going to die then at the *last second* regenerated), but the whole ""some new man goes sauntering off"" and the Doctor throwing a childish tantrum at Wilf just rubbed me up the wrong way.  It goes against *everything* the show is about, and those horrendous last words were the final nail in the coffin.  I could have put up with the everything in the episode if, in his final moments, Ten put on a brave face and looked to the future with cautious optimism (if he had said ""Allons-y"" then, it may actually have been perfect)  I was a huge fan of Tennant's Doctor, and I thought he deserved a better ending than that.  

I don't *completely* hate it -there are some really good scenes in there, like Ten and Wilf's conversation on the spaceship, the Doctor's stand-off with the Master and Rassilon, and the line ""Wilfred- it's my honour."" (totes should have been his last words, with him regenerating there in the chamber).  But all the elements I listed earlier incline me to list it very lowly among all the other episodes since 2005.

Of course, I know many people here disagree with me, and they're bloody well entitled to do that.

 Currently we only have Terry, Bertrand, Aké. I don't believe we need a new first choice Lb but having a young guy that could become one should be high on the list so we have a key player in one of these spots. Allowing greater squad variability. Shaw has to be first choice imo. 

I really think that this wishing for random players is wanton idiocy unless we did a whole squad rebuild this season and judging by this subs attachment to the people who would make way they don't want this either.

 A certain decisiveness is needed. We can't just want players willy nilly but have to have a plan. Ok so it can be argued as fans that's not our job but our club doesn't do a great job of it.

You can tax fat, ban food advertising or subsidise gyms but it won't solve obesity. The problem is that many people just don't care about their health, it's not that they don't understand how to stay healthy. The way forward is for every parent to encourage healthy eating and reasonable levels of exercise in their children, the Government has no role in this beyond school guidelines.

true,lonequack,eccleston,Eccleston,"I saw the ninth Doctor as full of rage but not knowing what to do with it, and then the tenth as more contemplative about his position and place in the universe(s), softened by Rose and much more empathetic, yet full of a passionate anguish (maybe it was Tennant's puppy-dog look). With eleven, I feel like the losses that ten and nine suffered built up in him to bring back that rage, and that it sleeps beneath the surface like a mine field. One wrong move and he breaks through, in little ways. Something, I feel, will make him crack... at that point, maybe he will regenerate. For now, the childish fun bubbly doctor seems like a defense mechanism to keep him sane. Or maybe it's just his personality, the personality he would have regardless of circumstance (feel free to refute!).

Or perhaps all of the Doctors have had such unimaginable losses, and with each regeneration, we see a different way of dealing with them, a different perspective! Ten seemed the most sane and accepting of his circumstances, I think, which would explain why he seemed particularly attached to that one. I like how eleven is different from ten and nine, because really, the new personality of each one does make them almost a new person. What makes you *you*- is it not just your past, but also your habits and quirks, your plans, your outlook? 

&gt;he's decided to just make other people's lives better so that he can feel better about himself.

To go along with that, he gets incredibly angry when he seems to fail someone, and he is very attached to his companions. We see that being alone only does him more misery. I agree that he seems to feed off of the attention he gets from all of the others, like a little child running up to their parents saying, ""I did good, right? Right?"".

The way contract deprecetion works is that the value goes down exponentially as time goes on (given agent fees and player value itself increasing at a higher rate than depreciation for young players) so the ideal is to buy when they are a bit older when you want to use them, like Man U did with Zaha or Spurs with Bale who were similar situations to Shaw contractually from what I recall and still cost an excess.

The alternative means that you have to keep renewing to avoid an 'on the books' loss like with Courtois which means extra agent fees etc. But obviously he is really unique, as in once in a generation and homegrown premium, which is the real burden, doesn't apply as with would with Luke Shaw.

true,sacredstones,null,null,"hmm..i think you mistook which player he was at 1:07. he's the one who gets on the end of the looseball and clears it...smart play. If he had waited, the striker would have been able to get control of the ball, that is a much more dangerous situation. By running to the ball after the strikers heavy touch, he is able to make the clearance because the striker has no opportunity to get control of the ball.

at 3:30 he charges out to take advantage of the 2 on 1 situation. If you look around, all opposing strikers are accounted for by his teammates. IMO its a smart decision. Its the kind of decision that seperates a great CB from an average one. He assessed the situation, and made his decision in an instant. I think he had the right to run out because the ball was played so close to him. Coming out allowed him to take advantage of the 2 on 1 situation and increase the chance of winning the ball back. Another smart play, IMO. That was actually one of the plays that caught my eye during that video.

When those maniacs plowed in a jeep full of explosive gas canisters into Glasgow Airport did we fucking ground to a fucking halt? Or 7/7? Did we fuck, most people with half a brain shrugged it off, got sick of seeing it on the news and moved the fuck on determined to learn from it and not let fear rule their damn lives.

I ask you, what in the FUCK is stopping terrorist groups just loading up on easily available explosive materials and driving straight into the front door of an Asda on a Friday night when everyone's doing their weekend shopping and getting bevy?

Absolutely fucking nothing.

The area around Ibrox or any other football ground on matchday? Christ that would be horrific if they hit that.

Even somewhere as obscure as Gilmour Street station could kill dozens if it was peak time. There's no security. Nothing stopping anything there and you could kill a whole host of people on their daily commute to Glasgow and beyond (please don't, I'm still chasing that ballerina dream of mine), as well as sever a major transport artery and there isn't a fucking thing the government could do.

Now that I think about it, Lockerbie and 9/11 are the only major terrorist attacks that affected the British Isles and Europe with death from above. Everything else was either the IRA planking car bombs or bin bombs all over the fucking place, or suitcase bombs in pubs (fucking cowards) or blowing up buses and subway stations.

How could you defend against that without slitting the throat a little deeper than we already have of this country's spirit? Never mind the economic effects it would surely cause.

Safety is a fucking illusion. I'm well aware I'm preaching to the choir here but this is beginning to piss me off - this hysteria has got to stop, it is insane.

The worst thing? All it takes is just ONE out of one hundred false alarms to come true and some paranoid, controlling, scared prat politician or citizen can justify and scare others into believing staggering into the police state pit is in our own interest now.

When the Doctor tells her that they grab something precious and run from beneath the shadow, it is evident that she connects to that notion, probably because it's what she lost when her mother died.

We've seen quite a few companions introduced in the show, and each learned about the Doctor and their role in a slightly different way. I liked the choice to have Clara learn in the field because we've all heard the exposition by this point. Instead, 7b answers all the ""why do you travel with a companion,"" ""how can you value mortal existence,"" etc. on the case.

For me, this worked as Clara development and also as investigation of Clara.

Edit: Note that while most Muslims, according to this research, oppose violence in the name of Islam, a disappointingly large percentage (majorities in most countries) apparently believe that sharia should be made law. Among those, approval for stoning adulterers and killing apostates is still +50% in many countries. Their attitudes towards modern social freedoms (like homosexuality) are even more ridiculous; in most countries, 80% or more of respondents said that homosexuality was morally wrong. In a majority of countries surveyed, a majority of respondents also said that a woman must always obey her husband. A vast majority also believe that converting others to Islam is a moral duty.

At the same time, many Muslims surveyed are concerned about Muslim extremism, and do not sanction the use of suicide attacks.

The overall message from the survey appears to be that, while the average Muslim may be more conservative and traditional (or ""extreme"") than the average Westerner would expect, they don't see themselves as extreme at all.",0,1369448817,null,0,1369449529,0,ca5jhg1,t3_1ew993,t1_ca5jhg1,t1_ca4uci7,null,1431041051,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to suggest you don't (I know better) but i'd pity anyone who would try to tell me that this night was nothing more than a game, nothing more than a great comeback. Football clubs are tribal, every performance is sacred, so to speak. The Night in Istanbul is like folklore you pass down to each generation; it becomes part of the heartbeat of ""the tribe"", to continue the analogy. Just a game, you say? How simple you must see the world: blind to spirits that circumnavigate the globe, possessing strangers and bonding them together in a dependency - sportive, yes, but it is more than sport, it is a ritual and its performance can bequeath elation or sorrow in the chosen faithful. 

Imagine millions of men on their dying breath, their eyes wide, searching for that fading light. Now imagine them all slowly being reborn together. Birth comes screaming, all the primal fears of life manifest at once, but rebirth comes laughing: one comes back into life having felt the ecstasy of transmigration, having touched the ineffable, the boundless, conquering entity that is the human spirit. Feeling fresh and anew in the same old body, there is nothing but joy; there's not a thing one can do but laugh and sing and love. Now imagine this night Istanbul. Millions of men dying by halftime, their brothers singing hymns as pleas for vitality or laments. They may think their prayers are hopeless, the Turkish sky is empty as twilight, but Fowler was listening, Paisley was listening, Shankly was listening; Gerrard answers and the heartbeat returns, quickens, thunders and pulsates more and more with each passing minute, with each pass, tackle, shot and save until the very end when the once-dead Red spirit erupts in a supernal orgasm. Bliss, it's wonderful!

Very relaxing, you get to see a lot of beautiful countryside, canal-side pubs, etc. It's also a great way to visit a city... you can try and arrange to arrive towards a weekend, spend a long weekend moored slap-bang in a city centre (for no extra cost), explore the city on foot for a couple of days while having a 'home' to return to, then head back out to the countryside when you want to get some more peace.


I lived on one for a couple of years, it was great fun and I'd recommend a narrowboat holiday to anyone.

true,Greyfeld,angel,Weeping Angel,"I felt like 10's rant at Wilf and his overall raging against his inevitable death was all part of the previous several episodes, where the weight of a lot of different things just sort of pulled him in every direction at once.  

He was in pain over losing another companion (and probably in the worst way possible, from his point of view) and struggling to decide if he should continue alone.  He let the stress of that problem go to his head, pushing him to break a fixed point in time in Waters of Mars so he could at least save *somebody*.  When his failure slapped him in the face, he immediately got called to approach the time of his own death.  Then after a hopeless and bitter struggle to stave off the leaders of his race, which was a shock in and of itself since he had thought all of that was locked away in the past, a ray of sunshine peaks through the turbulent storm clouds.  That tiny sliver of hope, shining in his eyes, telling him that he doesn't have to die afterall.  He laughs.  A hopeful chuckle, overflowing with relief.

**Knock Knock Knock Knock**

*No...*

**Knock Knock Knock Knock**

*You've got to be kidding me....*

And he looks up.  At Wilf, behind the glass.  And it hits him.  *It was the old man.  It was always the old man.  This old man who had no part of the story, who had no part in saving the world, of turning back the darkness; this is the reason he's here.  The only reason.  He's here to make sure that I die.*

In that moment, the universe has been so unfair that it can only be a conspiracy.  The universe must have some sort of grudge, that this unimportant man - this *useless* man - be the hand of his destruction.  Well, he doesn't have to play by those rules.  He can turn around and walk away.  He can live.  *He's* important.  He can save more worlds, he can save more lives!  There's still so much to do and to see!!  It would be so easy, to just turn and walk away...

But no... that's not who he is.  He is the Doctor.  He is promised to save life, to preserve it.  Even this one useless man.  Even if it's the last life he'll ever save.  Even if it means his death.

And so he walks through the glass and presses the button.  The button the universe has prepared for him.  It's not fair, and it shouldn't end this way.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"I find the opposite tendency more disturbing: The number of stories being told about the Doctor lusting after 18-year-old girls is simply distasteful.

I liked the story of Rose Tyler. The relationship felt well-justified: The Doctor fresh from the Time War. Rose starts as a much-needed reminder of youth and excitement. She grows into being something more than that slowly and ultimately that culminates with her looking into the Heart of the TARDIS and becoming the only person in the entire universe who can fully, completely, and totally understand the Doctor (even if that understanding fades with the sacrifice of the Ninth). In that moment of complete emotional and intellectual equivalence, the Doctor regenerates... and his regeneration is influenced by his circumstance. One can argue that he regenerated specifically to woo Rose.

It can certainly be argued that the fundamental incompatibilities of that relationship would have eventually doomed any long-term relationship. (Even if the whole aging-vs-not-aging thing didn't do so by default.) But the story really made sense on a deep and emotional level. 

The story of Martha also made sense: Martha falling for the Doctor makes sense; the Doctor *not* falling for Martha is fantastic specifically because it not only tells a different story than the story of Rose, but also enriches the story of Rose through its contrast.

But at the beginning of season 4, according to *The Writer's Tale*, Russell T. Davies wanted to write ""the Doctor in Love"" again. (One of many strong indicators poining to the fact that RTD had told all the Doctor Who stories he had to tell.) We lucked out because Catherine Tate fell into his lap and Donna replaced the new love interest he had originally planned for season 4. 

Nevertheless, we still ended up with Astrid (retelling the story of Rose ineffectively in 80 minutes) and Christina. Amy's horny cold feet at least felt like an attempt to deconstruct RTD's excesses.

But ""The Snowmen"" ends up being the worst rendition of the whole thing: The Doctor is completely embittered by the loss of his family (Amy and Rory lost beyond a fixed point; River dead in a computer) to the point where he refuses to help the world... until a hot piece of ass walks by and he follows his erection all the way back to social responsibility.

Rose, Martha, Astrid, Madame de Pompadour, Christina, Amy, River, Clara, and I'm probably forgetting others. It's not just that this ""Doctor and his disturbingly young female companion"" well has been pumped until it's bone dry.

Shelter in London for homeless is hit and miss, if you hit the criteria you can be sheltered in literally minutes. However if you are down on the list, you can spend over a year waiting for a bed to open up somewhere. Also some of the homeless shelters in London are ran like mafia strongholds, with abuse of homeless people rampant, including drug sales, rape, and prostitution.

There is one homeless shelter, that had around 50-80 beds, usually full, with 2 workers overseeing it. A long term 'resident' ran the place like his personal kingdom, new tenants who didn't know were systematically exploited using drugs, alcohol, or just plain old violence.

There is also a 'charity' in London that is a well known religious cult of sorts, I personally turned down a bed for a weekend due to various friends vanishing off the face of the earth. And ones that did come back had stories of forced prayer, hours of listening to sermons, and very wierd procedures (waking you at 3am to pray).

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"Well, this will be an unpopular opinion in this particular comment section, but I adore Clara. I don't just adore Clara because she is adorable (and she really is I mean - those little cheeks!), no - I adore Clara because she is a completely new approach to character-building than we're used to from Moffat. 

It's called SUBTLETY. No longer does a new character swoop in all: ""Look at me, I'm wearing a tight police uniform and I'm so sexy, but WAIT! Let me dramatically take off my hat and allow my crimson mane of hair to slope down my shoulders -swoosh, swoosh- yeah, you like that, don't you, unattractive mortal?"" Now, don't get me wrong, I loved Amy and Rory, but this tendency of Moffat's to make his characters bigger than life sometimes bothered me (and it was the main thing that made me dislike River Song), so Clara to me was like a breath of fresh air.

Here's why I don't think Clara lacks personality or is apathetic: because I paid attention to details. The details are where most of her character development took place. It wasn't by chance that we weren't ALLOWED to see the best of Clara right from the start. It was a storytelling choice, and a good one - we were seeing Clara through the Doctor's eyes, or perhaps from his shoulder would be a better way to put it, and remember - the Doctor didn't trust Clara up until halfway through the season. The Doctor didn't accept Clara right off the bat, he brought her along with the intention to solve her mystery, not necessarily with the intention of her being his Companion. The Doctor didn't dote on her from the very beginning as he did with Amy, for example, and so along with him we didn't do that either. I remember being annoyed with HIM at one point where she said she wasn't happy, meaning she was terrified, and he barely batted an eyelash. If it were Rose, Martha, Donna even, or Amy he would've immediately been all ""give me your hand I'll protect you I swear I'll never let anything happen"". The Doctor just didn't accept Clara at all except as a puzzle, he was practically unconcerned with her as a person. And, again, through him so were we supposed to be.

Is Clara apathetic towards the things and places the Doctor shows her? I suppose you could see it that way, but I took it to be a part of her personality - she's tiny but brave and collected and it's a nice change of pace as well. Yes shock and disbelief is the way MOST people would react but not the way SOME would and Clara just happens to fall under those SOME. It's certainly no bigger stretch than, I don't know, slapping Hitler and shutting him in a cupboard. 

The moment the Doctor went ""You're just Clara, aren't you?"" and poked and pinched her cheeks (thus letting me live my dream of doing so through him), he began to accept her for who she is and not for the mystery of her existence and it was only THEN that her character development really began and we were allowed to start getting attached to her, allowed to see more of her reactions, characteristics and so on.

Oh, crikey, sorry for the monster post, but there it is - I hope this can at least let you see why someone WOULD like Clara (aside from her adorableness) and maybe explain what people might perceive as lack of character for her. I personally think the best of Clara is coming in the next season when she will truly, truly become a full-fledged Companion like all the others, now that her mystery is solved.

Then the census was done, and the counters ONLY counted the main streets, transport terminals, and well known homeless areas.

true,Contemporaryshaman,null,null,"Yes the Doctor s main preoccupation, but he also goes to other worlds too =) The reason he has changed 10 times so far to become the 11th Doctor is because when he is about to die his body releases huge amounts of energy and basically creates new body for him, called regenerating. He still has all of his memories, but every single cell in his body has been replaced, so understandably his personality changes too. He regenerates because that is what his race, the Time Lords do. There is alot of talk on here of limited generations, but having never heard of this in the new series im not too worried about the show ending anytime soon.

I think every season is incredible. Obviously there are a couple episodes that aren't as great as others, but its like a 98% to 2% ratio of 'great' episode to 'alright' episode.

As far as keeping things exciting, the writing is consistently great though out most of the show. I really love this show for rarely having dull moments :p

IMO food manufacturers need to be put under pressure to make their foods a better quality, even if it does affect their profits. Using better quality ingredients means they don't have to add so much salt, sugar and fat to foods just to make them taste better.

1) He's intense and vocal. While this is not something you want in a hothead striker, you need at least one of these guys on defense. Someone who communicates, is aggressive, and takes duels personally. Everything I see about this guy screams tenacity.

2) He wins aerial duels. No need to explain why we need this.

true,Apostasy4ever,smith,Smith,"I don't really have much by way of my own theories but spent a while thinking and researching the ones that have been presented so far.

Incoming wall-of-text. I apologize. 

The doctor started the time war as the 4th Doctor. Quoting the wikipedia article on it ""In Genesis of the Daleks (1975), the Time Lords—having foreseen the possibility of the Daleks conquering the universe—send the Fourth Doctor into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, or affect their development to make them less aggressive.[2]"" So that means John Hurt can't be the Doctor that started the time war.

I had always thought the idea that John Hurt was the original ""Doctor"" was the least logical because you can't break a promise without making it first. Also, because of what's already been said previously. In the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors, the First Doctor refers to himself as the ""original"" and in the 1996 Doctor Who movie, Paul McGann, with Sylvester McCoy on screen, states both ""A Time Lord has thirteen lives and The Master'd used all of his."" and ""In all my travels through space and time, and nearing the end of my seventh life...""

No one said Moffat has to follow every single thing stated in previous episodes, but I would think he'd be trying very hard to follow it unless he had already set it up and it's something fans would want him to change anyway. For example, the Doctor being limited to 13 lives or 12 regenerations. Since River blasted the Doctor with all her remaining lives and we had only seen her use 2 ~~and mention a 3rd~~, it's safe to assume Moffat could say the Doctor has ~~9~~ 10 additional lives. I think all the crazed fans like myself would be okay with that since we don't want the series to end. But changing who is the Original Doctor could potentially upset many fans, especially ones who watched the original series.

But it doesn't seem logical to me to have John Hurt be Doctor 8.5 that ended the Time War, either. He's always owned up to having killed millions by doing that, so how can it be some big secret if he's telling all his companions about it? But that would mean John Hurt did some thing worse than double genocide.

I believe that we've all assumed up until now that Smith, as the 11th Doctor is the 10th time he regenerated. (11th regeneration if you count Tennant having regenerated twice.) But if we do count Tennant and add John Hurt in prior to Smith that would make Smith the 12th regeneration (but still allow him to be considered the 11th Doctor since Tennant didn't change forms and Hurt is not considered to be ""The Doctor"".) Since the Valeyard is said to have come between the 12th and 13th regenerations, wouldn't that mean that once Smith decides to leave the show, the next regeneration must be The Valeyard?

If I was a writer for that show, having to write a season or more of The Valeyard would be a nightmare. How in the world would they do that since he spent a lot of his time back during the era of the 6th Doctor? Most people who are new to the show don't even know who he is or what he tried to do. How would you fix that? Have the first episode after Smith's last season be nothing but clips from the original series? I think it would be much easier on the writers and producers of the show to have Hurt be The Valeyard and only be in the 50th anniversary special. The only thing I can think of that would be worse than the double genocide of the Time War would be what The Great Intelligence was trying to do. Exactly what The Valeyard tried to do, since his intent was to have the 6th Doctor executed. All the worlds the Doctor has saved since the 6th.. hundreds and hundreds of worlds - destroyed. None of the current series Doctors have ever mentioned The Valeyard, which fits with this potentially being the Doctor's biggest secret. We also know that Clara had no idea who John Hurt was because her sole intention of going into The Doctor's time stream was to save The Doctor, and John Hurt is not known as The Doctor. So he must have called himself something else.. which makes it plausible that he could be The Valeyard.

But even John Hurt being The Valeyard doesn't make sense because The Valeyard is inherently evil. He wouldn't do something ""for the sake of peace and sanity"". It's rather insane to try to have yourself executed prior to your own regeneration.. unless it was actually his intention to cause an enormous paradox in the middle of Gallifrey. Which the Time Lords would have been able to repair..... so in effect absolutely nothing at all makes any sense.

I thought Rogers was week last summer and shouldn't have been given the entire budget. Overspent on Borini (grossly) and overspent on Allen when he didn't have other targets to move to when Swansea said no, necessitating the £15M price (you shouldn't be paying a buyout on a player at a small club who wants to leave and will be paid 3x more - we were the desperate party in that deal). Then there was the utter debacle of the last week with Dempsey (who I thought was a terrible buy anyway) and then ending up with one striker for the first half of the season.

I'd actually say that last summer was the worst transfer window the club has had in a decade or more. And I'd say that is down to Rodgers and his inexperience and then also down to Ayre for being a muppet and first giving Rodgers the budget but then approving it all. What is good is that now FSG did a review after that mess and transfers are now with a committee headed by people with experience who know the market and targets. *that* is what I am excited about - our first window with all our resources and with Rodgers having much less of a role.

Muller, or whoever it was, fakes the shot and dribbles past him, just barely though. He actually does that a lot as well and he's pretty good at it. He reacts really quickly to when a player drops his shoulder and is about to shoot. He's usually able to get a foot to ball and block the shot, [like this](http://youtu.be/F1nr_nDOoFI?t=1m12s).

Agreed on the 3:30 situation, I see nothing wrong with what he did. Rodgers wants our CBs to press anyways, so we're going to see more plays like that, if Rodgers is able to get the players he wants.

Honestly though, he's a fucking fantastic CB. His instincts and positional sense are superb, especially when you consider how young he is. All of his mistakes mainly come from decision making, which is to be expected of a young CB, and sometimes cause him to make a rash tackle or come out of position, because he overestimated his ability to get there in time.

All of his strengths massively outweigh his flaws though, barring the injury concerns. It feels like /u/Falc7 is nitpicking a bit as well, no player is going to have a perfect game. If you can only point to one or 2 minor mistakes against Bayern, the best team in Europe this season, then I think that means he had great game.

That being said, of I had to pick an episode to serve as an introduction it would probably be ""Dalek"" from series 1.

My first assumption is that it was a massive, monolithic thing, with dozens of sub-systems tightly bound to each other - nothing would work on its own. Would that be a safe assumption?

Secondly, nobody took APIs seriously, so it would have been difficult to plug additional systems in, e.g. a simple PHP search front-end, meaning that very expensive front ends needed to be developed and integrated in very complex ways. Would that be a fair assumption too?

Is there anything else that you are able and willing to give us in order to understand the architecture of both the project and the product? I'm fascinated by this, both from a technical POV and a by how big companies seem to be able to take other companies for a ride *time and fucking time again*. Pisses me off royally.

Edit: as a bit of background, I'm an API guy. Large systems should be split into smaller systems with open APIs for *everything*. Every system should be useful in its own right and do something well-defined and really well. It's what I've always done, and it damn well works. That is why when you say you could produce something better for three orders of magnitude less cost, I can believe that, because I can see how it would work, and not just focus on how to get as many ""consultants"" on site as possible to milk the cash cow.

Then surely you should have MORE capacity for storage? then you would be storing more resources you purchased at lower prices than being more at mercy to fluctuating prices and market manipulation..

Always amazes me that these companies rake in massive profits every year (always going up never going down) yet fail to ensure they have adequate supply and storage at all time...

It is like the Stanlow Refinery in Cheshire, owned by Shell it bumbled along, Essar brought it out and the first thing they have done? increase production capactity by 20-25% and installed new supply lines for raw resources to be delivered to the refinery...

It will give the refinery unit another 25 years of life.

Certain cases can attract whole-life tariffs, which mean you never get out and you are never eligible for parole, although you generally have to be [a mass murderer or a child killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prisoners_with_life_tariffs) to get that.

But other life cases will have tariffs of 25, 30 years or more, which mean you're not even eligible for parole until that period of time. Even then it's still a life sentence which means you have to convince the parole board you're no longer a danger and even if released you'll be on licence for the rest of your life.

Tinfoil hat on. Beware.

Most UK based users have condemned the media's decision to broadcast the twat's rant after he killed that poor bastard. This is the case because, as Charlie Brooker quite rightly points out, that creating an icon of such a figure is sure to inspire copycats. Furthermore, this man has been given a platform to speak to the world purely because he slaughtered someone in cold blood. Obivously this should not be the case.

However, I am one of several people I know who actually agrees with the brunt of his argument. The UK should not be involved in imperialism accross the middle east. David Cameron is not primarily interested in the population of this country, but instead in making sure the demands of capitalism are made pallatable enough that we swallow them with a smile, so as to pacify the qualms of foreign investors and speculators that we so direly need in order to achieve anything at all.

I'm starting to think that allowing this nutter to express his opinions whilst holding the bloodied knife that removes any legitimacy from his position is an attempt to make the opinions themselves look without merit or logic.

Although I realise that the video appearing in the national press was quite likely the result of it first being instantly available online, so the head of ITN thought it was fair game to slap a watermark over the video, claim it as an exclusive and then attempt to profit from it. This in turn led all the other broadcasters to consider it appropriate to follow suit.

As for the Green Party Leader, she can be accused of opportunism but that doesn't remove validity from her points. They are certainly more valid than Boris' claim that 

London Mayor Boris Johnson said on Thursday morning that it was wrong “to link this murder to the actions of British foreign policy”. 

-------------At this point I was asked to clarify ""What I agree with"" ------


Ok I will clarify. This shit is murky...

What I agree on is the basic tenants of anti-Western Imperialism. The murderer refers to his religion, and his ""people"", who I think its safe to assume is the Ummah, the community of muslims. I'm not a muslim, I don't believe that religion is a force for good or reasonable prism to view the world through.

However, I do believe that the people of the Middle East (specifically large parts of the Muslim world) have been unfairly and cruelly treated for reasons of geopolitics - that there are natural resources within the territories these people inhabit, or that these areas must be bisected by an Oil/Gas pipeline, or that certain governments/ groups of people are preferred as rulers.

The UK, and the USA, and other collaborators, are guilty of war-crimes and of crimes against humanity. ""We"" are in the wrong. The murderer is right to say such. 

I don't believe he should have been given his platform, but that's what my conspiritard argument was about. The fact that these arguments can now be dismissed as the crazed rant of a murderer means that proper debate can be stifled by those who don't want criticism of an unjust foreign policy.

Edit just to clarify for myself - this bloke should not have been given a platform, nor his associates. They talk a load of wank when it comes to lucid debate, perhaps marginally worse than myself. But I do have my special hat on. I'll take it off now. Also I'm making arguments about Cameron that he didn't mention at all - just a frustrated Marxist venting. Nonsense.

By allah, we swear by the almighty allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone. **So what if we want to live by the Sharia in muslim land?** Why does that mean you must follow us and chase us call us extremists and kill us. Rather, you are extreme. You are the ones. When you drop a bomb, do you think it hits one person, or rather, your bomb wipes out a whole family. This is the reality. By [...] if I saw your mother today with a buggy, I would help her up the stairs. This is my nature. But we are forced by the Qu'ran [...]... Many, many [...] the Qu'ran. We must fight them as they fight us. An eye-for-an-eye and tooth-for-a-tooth. I apologise that women had to witness this today but in our land, our women have to see the same. We people will never be safe. Remove your government, they don't care about you. Do you think David Cameron is going to get caught in the street. When we start busting our guns, do you think the politicians are going to die? No, it's going to be the average guy like you, and your children. So get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops backs so we can, so you can all live in peace. Leave our land that's all I have to say.

Compare it to Thameslink whose lifetime budget is 5.6 BILLION...

&gt;The Crossrail programme will deliver a new high-frequency rail service and supporting infrastructure for London and the South East.  A key part of this is the construction of twin tunnels, each 13 miles long, through the heart of central London.  When it opens (in stages from 2018) Crossrail will run from Maidenhead / Heathrow in the west to Shenfield in the east / Abbey Wood in the south east. Crossrail will create; economically-vital new transport infrastructure to support London’s growth, delivering faster journey times and providing a 10% uplift in rail-based transport capacity.  It will put an additional 1.5 million people within 45 minutes of London’s business centres, facilitating employment growth of up to 30,000 jobs by 2026 in Central London.

Bargain at only 14.5 BILLION...... Excluding 

&gt;Currently on budget.  As of March 1st it was announced that the Crossrail fleet and depot will be publicly procured and not rely on PFI. Cost included in the total whole life cost is the expected capital of the Crossrail programme excluding rolling stock and depot contact.

I don't really think that's the case, I think we'd be able to get him for £15 million and he's easily worth that to us providing we get him registered for the start of next season. After that point he's worth a hell of a lot less to us due to the home grown at club rules. (Well he should be worth less if our club has any idea what they're doing, but they probably don't.)

I don't see how the contract would really impact on when we could have him. I mean that Lukaku was signed when he was 18, in August, when his pro contract presumably started in May on his birthday. In contrast we signed Courtois when he was 19. I think it was more random than we'd like to think when these transfers went through. If we actually had this grand plan anywhere, Lukaku probably wouldn't have been loaned out. Anyway, I digress.

My solution to this issue would involve giving parents a significant amount of money if they willingly give their child to the state to raise. Such a scheme would obviously benefit poorer families the most. In order to qualify for this properly, the parents would need to undergo a vasectomy or tubal ligation in order to prevent more kids being born (and the parents misusing the system to get money by having lots of babies).

The state would then offer *qualified* people significant cash benefits if they raise the child on behalf of the state. Obviously people with a bad history (eg child abuse) would not be allowed to participate.

It's not what people expect to be said so they don't want to deal with it. 

Take say the controversial statement: Modern hydroponic weed can be addictive and lead to mental problems.

(I can hear the knee jerk reactionaries steaming already, hear me out though ) 

It's a statement I personally know to be, in some cases, true because being an ex-cocaine addict myself I've attended plenty of drugs sessions where I've seen kids who literally are ""skunk"" addicts with a whole host of mental issues. The centre I attend ( In West London )  holds regular specific groups for this issue alone and, believe me, they're extremely well attended. 

The logical conclusion to the original statement therefore from my own experience is that yes, it must be somewhat true or these groups would not exist.   



However to any young person who smokes weed this statement is absolutely preposterous, can't be possible, ridiculous, this is a lie. Crush this opinion. It's right wing anti marijuana bullshit. I don't want to hear it. 

It's something people involved with themselves can't - or don't want to - think about in an objective manner. 

A lot of people really just don't want to hear an opinion they're uncomfortable with. 

Shame really, I'm a big fan of objective thinking.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;So by your argument Stalin, Hitler and all other tyrants were just 'assholes' as they merely gave the orders rather than carrying them out. So a general who tells his troops to go burn down a village and kill its occupants is not criminally responsible?

Actually you can account for that fairly easily. In the military freedom of speech doesn't exist, and orders must be legally obeyed. It's written into the law so those who give orders maintain responsibility. This is a big part of why we can prosecute war criminals already. That's fine, because those who enter the military willingly give up their rights to free speech.

&gt;Erm, have you actually read the whole article? Let me quote it for you: ""Despite Schenck being limited, the phrase ""shouting fire in a crowded theater"" has since come to be known as synonymous with an action that the speaker believes goes beyond the rights guaranteed by free speech, reckless or malicious speech, or an action whose outcomes are blatantly obvious.""

Right, by people who're either ignorant or lack a sense of irony.

&gt;A nice attempt to avoid the question. Please name these 'alternatives'.

But requirements change due to technological developments. The requirement for the Eurofighter Typhoon was the AST 403 specification, raised in 1972. It took over 30 years before the first aircraft entered service with 11 Squadron RAF in 2007.  During that time there have been numerous advances in material technology, engines, avionics, and stealth.  The Typhoon as delivered is a very different aircraft from the one envisaged in the 1970s.

A lot of the time and cost was due to politics and the overhead of developing a multinational aircraft. We could have saved a lot of money by licence building a comparable aircraft instead of reinventing the wheel.

While it makes a good deal of narrative sense for the Hurt Doctor to simply be the repressed guilt from the Time War and the deeds done at its ending, I think there's something more to it.  My main two reasons are:

1: the Grand Moff is tricksy (very meta, I know, but... if he seems to be leading us towards an obvious conclusion, it's probably the wrong one)

2: The Doctor has previously taken ownership of his known deeds in that period *as* those of the Doctor.  For example, he replied to House in 'The Doctor's Wife' when he said, 'I've killed hundreds of Time Lords' with, '*I* killed them all.'  During the End of Time, he again made reference to ending the Time War -- and doing so as the Doctor.

However, 11's denial that the Hurt doctor had kept 'the promise' implied by the name was pretty unambiguous, suggesting that whatever he did (and I'm willing to believe that it's still Doctor 8.5) it isn't simply a matter of Time War shenanigans -- there's something darker there too.",0,1369484879,null,0,false,0,ca5pwdp,t3_1f0xfm,t1_ca5pwdp,t3_1f0xfm,null,1431038029,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

They are the ones perpetuating fear and hatred with their horrifically out of proportion response to this incident.

They could go outside tomorrow and kill 10 people and it would probably be a footnote, and all the mongs on /r/worldnews would probably be telling everyone how its 'different' and somehow the discussion would still probably turn to how Europe and North America needs a second holocaust towards Muslims and/or non-whites.

true,ahorsenamedbinky,null,null,"You need to think in profit terms and how players are valued as assets to the potential selling clubs based on UK GAAP

The main difference is that there will be much higher profit for Southampton since his book value will be available and decreasing and his real world value will have increased at a high rate since he is English and may get a national team call up which would be a windfall in image right value. Given accounting and financial reporting requirements there is much more incentive to wait a year since it can mean a difference of millions in profit for the same amount of cash received due to the way he has 0 book value right now will have 15 million upon signing pro terms  and it which will not be recalculated for possibly a year from now due to no M2M requirements for contracts. 


The ONLY reason I would imagine it to happen is if other clubs are interested and Chelsea want to secure the player at expense for cash in an auction. But again there is only incentive for Southampton to keep the player unless they are in a terrible need of immediate cash, which is unlikely given increased expected revenue they will have to mortgage against.

Expounding on this gets complicated since you need to know about the way depreciation works. But if the player is newly signed and young it makes sense to wait for both his agent and registration holder particularly if he has the potential to make a World Cup.

I know it's an overused example, but it's a good one: the Jain religion. One of the central premises of the religion is absolute, uncompromising pacifism and not causing any harm whatever to any living thing. The monotheisms all have verses that could be interpreted to be inciting violence. It should not come as a surprise to us that the monotheisms have more violent histories. It just happens at this point in history that it seems to be certain Islamic sects who are violent. It is not naive at all to say that some religions over others have a higher likelihood of being connected with violence.

You seem to have worked backwards from the existence of the word 'islamaphobia' to prove that people who don't like Islam are racists? Yeah, that's why I don't like that word.

The way I see it, Islam is no different from any other set of ideas. It doesn't get to use 'culture' and 'faith' as shields from criticism.

Looking at the wikipedia page for Islamophobia, I have a problem with the reasoning of the very first definition:

&gt;In 1997, the British Runnymede Trust defined Islamophobia as the ""dread or hatred of Islam and **therefore**, [the] fear and dislike of all Muslims,""

Now when people try to say that there are good things in Islam, like literature and language and art - fine, great, but to me these seem to be entirely separable from the idea that we should venerate a dusty old book as a founding principle on which we should view our universe.

Islamic rules of war only allows war for reasons of self-defence or where Islam is prohibited from being practice, and ONLY to restore the proper worship of Allah. Hell, even in the verse YOU quote it specifically says 'those who suppress faith'! This applies to surah 9:14 also. 

Verses 8:11-12 need reading with verses 13-18 where again, it is talking about disbelievers fighting Muslims in armed combat. This was likely referring to the pagan Quraysh, who engaged the Muslims and Medinians in battle at Uhud and Badr among other battles, or to the other enemies of Islam who were plotting to destroy the ummah. 

  Regarding the last verse, verse 9:30, you failed to read the entire section of which this is one verse. The section isn't talking about believers killing non-believers, it's referring to the Hereafter where the only religion accepted by Allah will be Islam (Surah 3:19 if you want a Qur'anic reference). 

  You must understand that often revelations were made which were specific to events that were happening, such as battles or problems within the ummah. Context is key in understanding the Qur'an as much as just reading a verse at face value. Plus I'm willing to guess that whilst I can read Arabic, you are reading from a translation, which cannot possibly begin to convey all the intricacies of the Arabic language accurately.

&gt;Your challenge: find me several cases of Egyptian Muslims being attacked and beheaded throughout the world by Christians angry at what's happening in Egypt. 

This is  stupid challenge, I don't see its relevance at all.  If you want me to list a few instances when ""Christians"" have perpetrated atrocities in history, it not exactly a difficult task - consider [the fucking Phalangists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_and_Shatila_massacre).

Our army is currently deployed in more than 80 countries, if someone cares to provide a list of how many are Muslim nations/regions, please do so.  I'm guessing that more than a few are, and that there might be higher tensions in those regions, which might mean higher casualties.  Certainly, several of the high profile conflicts in recent times have been against Muslim States or countries with many Muslim people.  Add to this that we support dictatorships in many Muslim countries, propping up and arming regimes which are broadly loathed, e.g., despite the hypocrisy when it was toppled, in Tunisia, in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia, in Jordan, in Yemen, in many other places besides - including ironically Iraq; and then undermining or toppling regimes which are popular and democratic as in (historical pre-revolutionary) Iran, at times in Lebanon, in Palestine, etc. etc.  Our Middle Eastern foreign policy has historically been a cluster fuck, and the US Middle Eastern policy is a cluster fuck on steroids.

Fanboy disclaimer: the seventh doctor was 'my doctor' -- his character developed from something of a comical buffoon into a master manipulator.  #7 has a tendency to view people, even his friends, as pieces on a gameboard to be moved when needed and possibly even exploited and sacrificed if required.  For example, he precipitated an entire Dalek civil war (resulting in casualties amongst UNIT) and manipulated Davros's faction into mistakenly destroying Skaro.  While he was always on the side of the angels, his methods had a distinctly ruthless and Machiavellian flavour to them.  This is the Doctor who 10 described to Wilfred as having, ""tricked people into taking their own lives.""

""Muslims want to make out they are a persecuted group in the world, when in fact they are the ones murdering thousands of people per year for the crime of being different to them""

It is not all muslims, and certainly not only muslims that are doing this. How many has America killed in the last twenty years? You can only destroy and occupy someone's country for so long before they will fight back with all of their strength, no matter how limited that might be. However, this is not a case of an oppressed people fighting back to rid their country of oppressing forces, these are cases of western born people with a strong need or desire to feel that they belong to some cause (I say some cause because it is this same desire that drives those to join other hate or extremest groups regardless of religious or political alignment) that can give them a sense of self-righteousness and pride at doing what they perceive to be honorable acts in support of their chosen cause. The problem here is the same as dealing with any form of extremism, certain people are not mentally stable. They get caught up in an emotionally charged issue and lash out in violent and unpredictable ways. Let's say the the religion of Islam was disbanded. No more Islam, anywhere in the world is being practiced. People like this will find something else to latch on to and acts like this would still happen. 

I personally believe that any and all religion is destructive and serves to attract people like this to its banner simply because of the violence of the messages that they are sending out into the public eye, I am simply attempting to point out that there are many many factors that lead to things like this. Simply casting one group of people based on race, religion, gender, or anything else, over simplifies a complex issue, and over simplifying something like that only takes us further away from understanding and preventing acts like this from happening in the first place.

That makes sense from Southampton's perspective and it's what they may want but doesn't Shaw's opinion matter. If he wanted to go then they'd probably let him. Supposedly there are other clubs willing to come in for him but as you've indicated they might as well wait for his value to increase slightly.

I suspect a transfer with the relevant clauses that would include a windfall after international appearances would appease Southampton if Shaw was willing to go to be 2nd choice/rotation. I would still say that the transfer depends on Shaw rather than Southampton because they are still gonna be likely to accept it for a want-away player even if their new owner has repeatedly stated that he wants to stop selling off their good youth.

There are a lot of story arcs that span multiple seasons, and although you can definitely jump in at the current season and figure things out as you go, you'll miss out on a lot of the larger plots and character development.

Alternatively, if you really don't feel like catching up on all those episodes, you could start from the beginning of season 5. A new Doctor was introduced and there aren't a lot of plot arcs that carry over, so it's not a bad place to start, although you're still missing out on the first two Doctors of the new series. I started from season 1 and I'm glad I did.

And then if you like the new series, at some point you can go back and start watching classic Doctor Who.

Because of that night he will always be remembered and loved in Liverpool. The same goes for every player who played a part in that story.

It was something along these lines:

The Timelords were actually winning the war. They were on the verge of victory. So they were already looking on to different things, because yes, the war changed them. They wanted a more active role now. 

Unfortunately the seer saw The Doctor would sabotage them at every step of the way. 

So the Timelords decided the Doctor would need to die. 

The Doctor caught wind of this and...

He knew he couldn't outrun the Timelords. They would be able to find him, pull him back, etc. 

So, the only way he could live, and keep going, was to somehow get rid off them. 

How he acquired the Moment is uncertain, but perhaps he already had it at this point. 

What we do know, is that at this point, the Doctor Timelocks the Time War. So they couldn't kill the Doctor. At least, not directly. 

So they try to get out of the Timelock (cue End of Time) before the Doctor uses the Moment to destroy them all. 

He probably could have just killed the Daleks and be done with it....but he killed the Timelords as well. Because otherwise they'd try and kill him. Instead of running...he slaughtered them.

The Caliphate is **never** going to happen.

The reason it's not going to happen is because it cannot happen. It can't happen for the same reason that global communism didn't happen. For the same reason that the Thousand Year Reich never happened. For the same reason that the original caliphates foundered. 

There are too many different types of Islam in the world and too many players within the Islamic culture all vying for power and a leadership role and to advance their national interests for the caliphate to ever become a reality.

&gt;The outgoing version of the Crest is often misrepresented. You see it being used in the media with the Everton name removed or the ‘1878’ taken away. […]

&gt;""There are also problems reproducing the outgoing Crest below certain sizes, when elements, including text, become invisible or illegible. As people view media on smaller screens that becomes more of an issue.""

If they're so concerned about people seeing the 1878, why the hell have they made it smaller?

If reproduction at a small size is a concern, why not entirely remove the lines across Prince Rupert's tower? Why is the tower in dark blue on a very-slightly-lighter blue background? It still looks a complete mess when reproduced small. 

The features look completely out of place, especially the text. It's not so bad on a sleek, simple, shield like the [Arsenal or LA Galaxy badges](http://www.evertonfc.com/global-brands) (…there are no points for spotting which of those badges looks nothing like the others - I don't think Chelsea, Juve, Arsenal, or LA Galaxy are great badges, but I can see how they succeed as easily recognisable icons - but the two Milan clubs are quite nice and I love the PSG logo), but when the shield is such a traditional shape, text has absolutely no place within it. 

If they'd just put a white tower outline on a blue field, no clutter (remove the brick lines across, just have the outline plus the window, and maybe a line or two marking the edge of the roof), and move the word 'Everton' outside the shield, it might not be so bad.

It depends on what the event is, but arguably you should. If an accident severe enough to cause a loss of life was judged to be likely to happen more than once in 1000 years, you definitely would spend money on it. A facility like an LNG terminal or oil refinery has to demonstrate that they have taken all steps to reduce risk to the public that are 'not grossly disproportionate'. In other words, measures to reduce risk *should be disproportionate*, just not *too* disproportionate. The risk of death of a member of public per anum judged to be 'intolerable' and meriting 'risk reduction regardless of cost' is 10^-4 (one death per 10,000 years).

The same criteria are not applied for the risk resulting from the unavailability of a facility, but being frozen to death isn't *much* better than being roasted by an exploding refinery. For legal purposes it matters a great deal, but on purely utilitarian grounds it might make more sense to consider all risks equally.

true,essjay2009,cnty-wales,Bristol,"As someone who's sat on both sides of the table (although admittedly not for a few years now) I can confirm you're right.

There are a number of issues.  Procurement needs an overhaul, but outsourcing is not the way to do it (in fact, the precise opposite is needed).  For years specialists have been fleeing the civil service.  Technical specialists, legal specialists, contract specialists.  They can triple, or more, their pay elsewhere.  Many (and I saw this happen first hand on more than one occasion) leave to become independent contractors.  They literally walk out on a Friday and leave their £35k/year job and walk back in on the Monday as a contractor earning £100k/year.  This means there's a massive knowledge and talent drain.  If there's anything that needs a technical authority to oversee it, I can guarantee you that it's not being done by a civil servant(with the possible exception of GCHQ.  DSTL is a joke).  And just think about what that means for the things we're procuring.  People with other agendas are overseeing their purchase and design.  We need more in house experts to oversee these things, not fewer.  I understanD DE&amp;S are looking at doing this with procurement professionals, but it's mere lip service at this point.

Furthermore, [despite the UK being one of the biggest spenders on defence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures), we don't spend enough to have any of our own initiatives.  Everything (with the odd exception for small, highly specialised equipment) is done with a partner.  I know for a fact that the MoD have been warned by these partners, especially the US, that they will refuse to work with an outsourced MoD.  And I don't blame them one bit.  Same goes for many of our european allies.

The biggest problem though, is that this won't address most of the major issues.  At the MoD there are army, navy and RAF personnel serving in senior positions.  There's a belief, misguided in my opinion, that they are the right people to have in these positions.  Being able to shoot an insurgent does not qualify you to make strategic decisions regarding defence procurement.  This means that one of two things happen.  Either they get stuck in a position of not being able to decide on requirements (high level, strategic requirements) and therefore projects paralyse, or they change their mind frequently causing lots of back tracking and severe penalties from suppliers.  The americans have the right idea when it comes to this, be agile.  Look at the UK's [Bowman radio project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_\(communications_system\)#Procurement_history), which started in the 80s (just), failed to deliver anything until 2004, cost over £2billion and managed the feat of cramming the technology found in a smartphone in to a Landrover Defender.  Meanwhile, the Americans are doing a better job with [cheap, commodity smartphones tied to existing equipment](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2013/03/27/army-set-to-introduce-smartphones-into-combat.html).  And note what they're saying:
&gt; “Our agile approach includes procuring soldier-evaluated commercial products more frequently,”

[Source](http://defensetech.org/2013/03/28/army-eyes-samsung-smartphones/).

We're going in the opposite direction.  Instead of outsourcing to industry, they should be looking at how industry actually works and mirroring it, in my opinion.  No one could run a company the way the MoD, or any government department (many are actually worse than the Mod, don't get me started on the MET Police, a more backwards organisation does not exist), runs.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;But it doesn't seem logical to me to have John Hurt be Doctor 8.5 that ended the Time War, either. He's always owned up to having killed millions by doing that, so how can it be some big secret if he's telling all his companions about it? But that would mean John Hurt did some thing worse than double genocide.

He owned up only to one thing and that is the double genocide. That's all. 

We know nothing about the rest of the War, the progression, what he did and more importantly, his motivation. Did he have to destroy the Timelords? Surely he could have found another way. I think that's the real thing here. He destroyed them, even though he didn't have to. Just because it was easier. 

Also, I suspect that him Timelocking the Timewar and the genocide are two separate events. It's the only way that the End of Time makes sense anyway. The Doctor timelocks it, and thinks that's that, but in comes John Hurt and he goes ""fuck no, barbecue time"".

Aah, then there's the Tom Baker 'Genesis of the Daleks' story -- there's a classic moment with Baker holding two wires that, when touched, will destroy the Daleks not long after their creation and so stop them ever becoming a threat.  He agonises over it but ultimately decides that the daleks also inspired heroism and loyalty in those who fought them and that he simply didn't have the right to commit genocide.

It's a theme that was touched on in the NuWho run in 'The Waters of Mars' -- attempting to screw with the timeline, even with the best of intentions, puts one on the road to becoming something more like the Master (or, at the least, the Meddling Monk) than the Doctor.  Fighting evil when you encounter it is one thing, but changing the course of history in accordance with your whims (no matter how convinced you are of your own moral rectitude) is ... well, that's dangerous.

There's no demolition of mosques, laws preventing Muslims from wearing appropriate religious dress, Qur'ans being banned from publication/sale etc. Nor is anyone taking up weapons and actively physically fighting Muslims. If these terrorist groups truly believed that they were oppressed or that they did not wish to associate with the 'kuffar', Allah states in the Qur'an that the earth is big enough that they can find another home to live in and practice their faith in peace. 

  Plus it must also be said that no one individual Muslim can proclaim another to be worthy of death, even where they are non-Muslim. Similarly the installation of Islam by force, or the targeting of non-Muslims by Muslims, is quite explicitly banned according to the words of Surah 109 (Al Kafirun) which quite clearly states 'to you your religion, and to me my religion'.

Here's another Qur'an verse or three: 

“God does not forbid you from showing kindness and dealing justly with those who have not fought you about religion and have not driven you out of your homes.  God loves just dealers.” (Quran 60:8)

“…take not life, which God hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom.”
[Al-Qur’an 6:151]

“Lo! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they wronged themselves, (the angels) will ask: ‘In what you were engaged?’ They will way: ‘We were oppressed in the land.’ (The angels) will say: ‘Was not Allah’s earth spacious that you could have migrated therein?‘” (The Holy Quran, 4:97)

And from the hadith: 

The Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, used to prohibit soldiers from killing women and children and he would advise them: “...Do not betray, do not be excessive, do not kill a newborn child.” And he also said: “Whoever has killed a person having a treaty with the Muslims shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise, though its fragrance is found for a span of forty years.”

1000 years ago would they have joined the Chrildren's Crusade?

Is British foreign policy really responsible for their actions, or just responsible for the flavour of the extremism we have now?

My opinion is there are a myriad of reasons why people join hate groups, human nature being the most prominent.

I suspect now that you don't actually want to be informative, because you're just being more of a dick and resorting to ALL CAPITALS when your objections are being addressed. 

I can't learn from you when you're wrong like this, can I?

The whole point was that our requirements would presumably be less prone to change if we only equipped for our actual territories, and not an ever-changing theatre of deserts and shit where we have no defence purposes. 

I probably would rather go for a Swiss model of making ourselves harder to invade and occupy, and a more minimal expeditionary force. But I don't suppose you'll bother to address that in a mature manner.

Now, I wasn't being literal with the 0.1% figure, just merely trying to express the fact that the majority are uninterested in violence, which applies to any other group of people.

Don't phone the receptionist if you can avoid it. She will probably won't be interested in helping and a lot of receptionists are considered ""gate keepers"" - it's their job to stop nuisance calls or distractions that other employees might not want to deal with. If you can - consider visiting the company in person! 

Write out what you'd like to say before you say it. Don't make it too long - you don't want to bore whoever you speak to - but be polite and state exactly and concisely what you're hoping to get out of this. Highlight your strengths (communication, that you're keen on them and have sought them out rather than many other options you could've gone to, that you will work hard for them and value the experience). 

If they don't seem receptive at first, ask if you can forward an email with your details across - that you don't want to waste their time but really would value the opportunity to spend some time with them. Hopefully they'll see that you appreciate that they're busy as well - but will take the time to look over your details. 

Be careful choosing when you call in. A Monday morning is a busy time because all the stuff that backs up over the weekend has to be sorted out.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;And it is believed that it's only Gallifreyan law to have 12 regenerations, meaning that because Gallifrey has been destroyed he can regenerate infinitely.

I don't know why people keep saying this. It was a biological limitation. Even if there were regulations, it was not solely a rule to follow. I'll copy a comment I saved a while ago, posted by /u/L453R:

&gt;In the classic series, though many deny it, it was a physical limit of 12 regenerations = 13 total bodies. Watch *The Deadly Assassin*. If the Master could just ""break the rules"" and regenerate, he would have. I mean, he was a psychopathic killer. Why follow the rules of a society you have nothing but contempt for? Not only that, regardless of how good of a story it makes, it doesn't make sense for the Master to A) spend all that time as a skeletal husk and B) go to all that trouble of laying a trap for the Doctor and then almost tearing the whole planet of Gallifrey apart in a bid to regenerate after his 12th regeneration. If it was ""just a rule"", as many people like to say nowadays, then the classic stories *The Deadly Assassin*, *Keeper of Traken* and *Mawdryn Undead* make NO sense at all. However, it can well be argued that the regeneration energy was regulated by the Eye of Harmony, which is now, at least presumably, solely under the control of the Doctor and not the High Council of Time Lords, and that could give the Doctor many many many lives, possibly never-ending since the power of the Eye of Harmony was said to be limitless, but alas it is never stated whether the Eye is drawn on during regeneration, or if the energy needed for regeneration is simply inbuilt into Time Lord biology. Also, if River had the built-in 13 regenerations and gave up all her regeneration energy to the Doctor after only her 2nd regeneration, then, well, arguably he could have 9 or 10 more right there.",0,1369501548,null,0,false,0,ca5tgvy,t3_1f0ffg,t1_ca5tgvy,t3_1f0ffg,null,1431036274,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It is, however, genocide.  Personally, I'd be happy to describe that as a necessary act -- but I suppose in taking that sort of action you're effectively appointing yourself as the universe's supreme arbiter, able to act without limits in pursuit of your goals.  At his darkest, the seventh doctor only caused his enemies to undo themselves through manipulation rather than explicitly and by his own hand causing their destruction.  It's a subtle difference, but important -- it's a difference between the universe largely self-regulating with a little guiding nudge here and there and setting yourself up as, well, as its Master.  (EDIT: I suppose when you're already as potentially terrifyingly remote as a timeless being of interminable age able to travel throughout time and space, you really need to make sure you don't lose that sort of scruple)

2.) it IS a spectacularly gruesome crime, with the added media benefits of photos and videos aplenty from the event. If there were no pics and videos, it'd have been reported very differently I suspect.

Some have application fees of £100, one I saw required more of a background check than I went through for airport security clearance and nearly all require credit checks. My mother went to an agency to sign for a flat and when she got there was told the deposit was actually 2 months rent not one, so she told them to get fucked. They put off a good tenant because they wanted more money (divorced 61 year old woman looking for long term let with good income and some capital behind her too).

The thing that pisses me off is application fees. They are getting money already from the landlord and now they want money from prospective tenants too, and they seem to do bollocks all but put an ad online and get people to sign a standard agreement, they don't even do viewings a lot of the time, the current tenants show viewers about. I know credit checks cost money but I also know how much they cost and its nowhere close to the amount some charge. I did eventually find an agent that is sensible. No ridiculous checks, a months rent and equivalent deposit and no guarantor as my husband and I both work.

Ah but that's slightly different from what I asked. For example, many stories in the bible are interpreted as allegories by scholars. Would you say that for someone to 'truly' follow the text, they must interpret everything as written, with no attempt to read subtext? What about the clashes between mosaic law and the new covenant?

I can live with that.

&gt;I'm getting at expression that directs negatives at historically persecuted sections of society.

You're essentially talking about Hitler without godwinning the threat, well, nice try but I took the plunge so now you don't have to :)

I guess what I'd say to that is that firstly, if arguments are being had which are faulty they have to be defeated, beaten, not just forbidden and pushed into whispered discussions between people in dark rooms and their homes.

Secondly, people can carry out the sort of speech you're suggesting without breaking any laws. To take the example of Mr. Hitler, he never actually ordered that the jews be gassed. He ordered that there be a final solution, that the jewish question get its answer, lots of euphemisms. There's no way you can legislate against intention, and supression or punishment doesn't cure hate, it just pushes it underground. Our censorship legislation in the UK is primarily focussed around two things: people (mostly minority groups and some social conservatives - generally the same thing) not being offended, and the wealthy being able to enact financial punishment against those who they feel have wronged them.

Not that this really impacts upon my argument because I've already said that I accept that there are costs and that they're worth it, but I guess it might help soothe those who mistakenly believe that what we have now is freedom of speech, and that I'm suggesting is terrifying.",0,1369507933,null,0,false,0,ca5v76m,t3_1eypkn,t1_ca5v76m,t1_ca5v2gf,null,1431035459,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Kerrt,null,null,"This false supposed Queen, the usurper for the Vatican has roots going way back further than Germany and in fact they go all the way back to the stinking sinking Venice with the House of Guelph. She has destroyed England and signed documents through her own will and her testament to this effect. She has counter signed every EU Treaty along with her Prime Ministers. An EU secretly commanded by the Jesuit Order with an official religion of Roman Catholicism. An EU with a Honorary Knight of Malta,Jose Barroso as President of the European Commission. An EU with Jesuit trained Herman Van Rompuy as President of the European Council. The real bosses of the European Union are Adolfo Nicholas S.J. of the Jesuit Order, Pope Francis of the Holy See and Cardinal Grandmaster Matthew Festing of the Order of Malta.

People need to know that from 1689 the British throne secretly was given all its powers back which Oliver Cromwell took away. This was all done at the signing of the English Bill of Rights and it has never been talked about. She has done nothing to protect the faith of the Church of England she fronts as Defender of the Faith. In fact she has ignored the Jesuit infiltration of the Church of England which is now chewing at the Church from within and out. This is creating divisions leading to many moving back to the Harlot Babylonian Catholic Church aka Roman Empire continuum. Rowan Williams prays and kisses the Temporal Power’s ring in Vatican City and even lectured at the Jesuit military’s Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Wake up people to this whore of Babylon.

This Dame of Malta should be arrested for High Treason then placed in a real Lawful English Common Law court by real English Peace Officers working for the land and peoples of England. She should then be found guilty of her crimes of High Treason and sentenced according to the real penalties for this crime. She will not get the 1998 onwards changes to Treason laws which she and Knight of Malta, Tony Blair changed to save them from death.

It’s time the nation got educated and became a Republic under God. We want a real true-Christian Puritan Church with real Christian teachings and no paganism. We want everyone to own a Geneva Bible 1560/1599 and not a King James Bible 1611 or any of the outright false Bibles pushed by the wicked Jesuit Order and the counter-Reformation. We want to be recognized as creations in God’s image that we are, no longer will they think of us as kids of Satan and goyim cattle. The Devil’s Messiah agenda pushing Evolution and Atheism need to be destroyed before humanity gets thrown more into the invisible prison living in cloud cuckoo land. We want our nation back, morals and a true civilized society under God.

We do not want a democracy which tramples on God as well, but a Republic under God. It’s time for the British Constitution Group my friends, it is our nation’s only hope. British police stations have had to put the word ‘treason’ back onto their databases since having thousands of complaints about the false-Queen usurper. Diana Spencer was more true British Monarchy than any of these Vatican usurpers sucking up to the Temporal Power at Vatican City and its bosses at Borgo Santo Spirito, the Curia Generalizia. The only problem with Diana was she had scion blood of the Medici and Sforza in other words a connection to the House of Orsini of the Papal Nobility.

These examples will all be documented, but individually and there seems to be no database that I can find listing murders by religion of the killers to get any sense of accurate numbers.

During RTD's era, they tended to use the word 'die' extremely liberally. At the beginning of Army of Ghosts, Rose says, ""This is the story of how I died."" So it seems like they're sort of referring to what happens to her in Doomsday as sort of a metaphorical death. Which I think is silly and just a cheap way of drumming up hype.

They also did it with Donna in Journey's End. Dalek Caan (I think?) said ""One of them will still die."" And then Donna didn't actually 'die', unless you count getting a memory wipe as death.

So realistically, I think that's all that the beast's prophecy meant.

But completely unrealistically... *ohhh shit...* what if Dalek Caan *was referring to Rose all along*, and the beast was serious, and Rose's death just *hasn't happened yet*? And it will finally happen in the 50th? This is blowing my mind right now. For that to be true, it would have to be Rose and meta-10 in the 50th (instead of past-Rose and 10), but that's still a possibility.

I really, really don't suspect that will be the case because I think the book has been definitively shut on that prophecy.

Clara was not really a companion at all to The Doctor, but a mystery, someone that he must watch at all times.  Of course he would be suspicious of her,  The Doctor has encountered a lot in his centuries traveling through time and the universe.  If I ran into a bunch of Clara's, and I were The Doctor, I would remain suspicious as well. 

Your perspective certainly does explain the lack of anything I saw in Clara this season.  I hope you are right though, and the writers will make Clara an interesting companion.  A companion that is memorable, that people love.  I really hope Clara makes it in season eight.  I commented somewhere here, I really think Clara has the potential to be one of the best companions this show has ever seen.  


I may have gone overboard saying she is as bad as Rose.  I just didn't like her very much, she was not that interesting, and I didn't think she was very likable.  I'd say my favorite companion is Donna, who apparently a lot of people do not like, which surprised me.  I guess it is the same with us two, and how we look at Clara.  We see her from different perspectives, different view points.  Which made a huge difference for me.  I still think they should have gone a little differently with her character in the beginning though.  I think they should have made her a little more accessible at times. 

I wonder if the writers had a discussion like this, debating whether to do what you said, or go a different direction? Basically weighing out the pros and cons. 

edit: You made some fantastic points, and I agree with you on the most of them really.

Read me the history of Europe again? The problem with rationalising Europe top-down is it ignores that history as if it was an inconvenient elderly relative. Today's eurocrats are convinced that they alone can solve what history has taken hundreds of years and thousands of lives to put asunder. They alone are educated, modern and *European* enough to break barriers and rise above. It's all rubbish of course. They are the result of 50 years of peace in Europe: overconfident and soft. Europe will never be united in the way they forsee, if at all. For a millenia progress has come from division in Europe, friendly or unfriendly, the struggle to succeed over one's neighbours drove the European golden age.

As for self-determination, I expect a no vote to the uncalled for plan of European integration ,a Europe led by men and women born to believe it is their generation's task to unify a continent, with no credentials other than the standardisation of olive oil containers, and other such bureaucratic rubbish.

That's a tricky one. How do we know that it is? How do you define 'real' islam? Just because it aligns with what we might regard as honourable behaviour, does it make it an honest or correct reflection of Islam?

I worry about saying something like this because it almost allows just as much justification of evil acts to be described as 'real' islam; i.e. Our value system/predisposition is the deciding factor; if you see the behaviour as good, then you see it as real islam, if you see the behaviour as bad, then you don't see it as real Islam, whereas someone else might feel the exact opposite, and to my mind, would be equally valid in doing so when using such subjective criteria. The difference comes when we accurately and dispassionately study the source material. i.e. What does it actually say, rather than, what do we think it should say?

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"I don't think DW is racist (non-white USA person here). I think that DW is a product of its culture and its culture is mainly a white one. But some of the logic these people are using doesn't work: like sure, the 5th Doctor has roots going back to the racist British Empire, but that doesn't make DW racist. That's like saying that if you wear the clothes of a Victorian Englishman you are sexist because of the views Victorian England had about gender.

Also, interesting about the companions. We've had 3 non-white companions iirc. Mickey, Martha and Chang Lee. Chang Lee was a villain for half the story and originally a gangster. Mickey was the rejected boyfriend, Martha was the friend-zoned companion.

But then Sara Kingdom died, Adric was a little brat (and also died), Harry Sullivan was incompetent and couldn't handle TARDIS life, Jo Gant was patronized constantly, Susan was a screaming damsel and Peri was sexualised and creeped on by various villains. There's no race pattern when it comes to crap happening to you.

There aren't that many people of color in Doctor Who and that's a result of the culture in which DW is made. That's not some kind of racism. Go to China and most characters on tv will be (shockingly) Chinese.

Doctor Who has been racist before though. Using the n-word in The Celestial Toymaker wasn't cool. Nor was the the treatment of PoCs in Tomb of the Cybermen. Funnily enough I would actually excuse the yellowface in Talons of Weng-Chiang (for reasons).

So that's my general opinion about race in relation to Doctor Who.

**edit** Didn't realize there was more in the article. 

Okay, 10's comment about walking around like he owns the place? That was intentional. It was another example of 10 being a dumb-face and brushing Martha off. His comment is obviously one of privilege. The Doctor has racial, gender, ability, and cis privilege. And economic privilege because he doesn't worry about money.

The way the first Doctor looks down on primitive races, especially the ""red Indian"" comment does reflect Western values and ethnocentrism. But that story was in the 1960s and Doctor Who is a different show now. Calling Indians red? Not cool. But the analogy the Doctor uses is apt, if a reflection on Western views.

Time Lords being racist? I don't think so. Time Lords are xenophobic superior high-nosed bureaucrats though. 

Though reading that last line about the BBC being ""color blind"". That's not good. I know lots of people think color blindness is the answer to reducing racism, but it's actually not. Ignoring the problem only works for white people because they don't suffer negatively from racism. Through no conscious effort of any individual, the system is rigged against non-white people so when hiring, white people (or any PoCs who are hiring for that matter) need to be conscious of race.

I acknowledge instances of racism and the Western view from which Doctor Who is often told, but I don't think the show itself is racist.",0,1369520513,null,0,1369521365,0,ca5ynfu,t3_1f1u2c,t1_ca5ynfu,t3_1f1u2c,null,1431033758,29,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,29

When based purely on our own values, or what *we would like* to be true/false, yes. My point is that we tend to appraise behaviour based on our own, modern, values; what we want to be true. As above, if you see something you like, then you can label this as true christianity/islam/judaism, but this is just as valid as someone saying that when they see some thing bad, they can label it as true x, y, z. The key thing is what does the book say.

You say the Quran is explicit about being nice to people, I would say there is also a lot in there about being not so nice people.

The way out I found was by going to agencies- they really don;t seem to give a fuck who they employ, although the work you get is shit and it is mind numbing- it does give you something to put on your cv, tho.  I got a job through that a short while after doing really shitty jobs and being laid off, and I've had a few promotions since then and all that seems a long way back.

Do keep knocking on doors, asking family friends, going to agencies etc (esp the latter).  And don't be discouraged by failures- keep sending out CVs, filling in application forms and all that.  Be clever about how you do it, too- look carefully at the job specs and make sure you talk about how you fit into those.  

PM me if you need help with application forms, there's a sort of knack to it, and I quite like helping mates out with theirs.

Edit: oh, btw, if you really have no qualifications, I really suggest you try to get some.  Not only will it help you find work, it'll be a massive shot in the arm to your self-esteem- you're obviously literate and able to express yourself, so you're probably reasonably bright- from what you say, you don't think so.

No, you don't.  A shortcut or a reference point doesn't help you to understand anything, in fact it does the opposite.  It allows people to have opinions about masses of people they've never met, which are totally unjustified. 

This stems from the desire to think we know what we're talking about, when in fact, we really don't.  For some reason question marks are harder to accept than just making shit up to fill in the blanks.   This lazy thinking leads to people who think they know what they're talking about.

I'm guilty of it too.  I've never been to Poland, for example, but when I think of Poland, I see grey communist buildings and depressed alcoholics.  When I think of Africa, I see desert and jungle and crime-stricken cities.    The fact is, I have no fucking clue about these places or about their cultures.   I am really in no position to pass any kind of judgement, but the fact that stereotypes are acceptable gives me a free pass to just make my own version of how things are based on a ridiculously insufficient amount of data.

It's only when you find yourself surrounded by a culture that you realise how futile it is to try and generalise about it.

As much as i love torres and Ba, i think chelsea needs a truly ""world class"" striker. ""decent"" doesn't cut it if we are looking to improve.

There is a big difference between the two. Someone close to me was beaten up in the street because they were white. They have lived in a predominantly Asian area for years and this once they were a victim of a racist crime. The neighbours, local shopkeepers etc. rallied behind him as this is not in line with how they want their integrated community to work. There are a few mad boys but that doesn't necessarily mean that the majority agree. 

Also, I have to say that is a loaded question. Tended to agree could simply indicate a sympathy to the bombers frustration of Afghanistan/Iraq wars which is not the same as saying they necessarily agreed it was right to murder innocent civilians for that frustration.

But it's how people react to being drunk that is the main problem.  Alcohol exposes character traits that would normally remain hidden in sober people.   Drunks tend to express their feelings in a more dramatic manner than normal, so if they are happy, they will become incredibly friendly, if they are upset about something, they might burst into tears.

And if they have a strong feeling that they have to express their manliness to impress their peers, that will come out in an exaggerated form too.  I believe this is the root of the problem.

I sense that in Germany there is more acceptance of males how they are than in Britain.  In Britain, there seems to be a greater need for people to show their power, be it through fighting, or wearing the best clothes, or being the most wealthy.   Of course that exists in Germany too, but to a lesser extent.

As an american viewer whenever there was a historical episode that also included minority characters I often waited for race or sexual orientation to come up in some way. The times it did it seemed to be glossed over or it would seem to get little more than a shrug even from none important characters. And personally I thought it was great.

I thought it was very mature of the writers to simply make it a non-issue. That in the world(s) of our favorite Doctor everyone is accepted and no one has time to dwell on such issues.

I feel like if the new Doctor Who had been made in america any time these issues came up it quickly would have become the main focus of the episode.

Torchwood is even less controversial given its subject matter and extremely interesting cast of characters, especially Tosh and Rex.

The whole point of Ten making Martha's fear into a non-issue helped immensely to combat a sort of prejudicial underpinning that could have easily derailed the episode had it been in lesser hands. Besides that, the writers regularly pit The Doctor up against villains that routinely want to enslave or EXTERMINATE! the human race, presenting an allegory for most of our own historical villainy anyway. It's like these people never even watched  the show, otherwise they would realize that the Daleks and Cybermen are representations of the Nazis.

true,erisacrat,river,River,"The show has always been a reflection of the times. Each doctor is the doctor of a generation. Were people in the 60s racist? Not all of them but there were societal norms that were accepted. Like when you're speaking to your great grandparents and they call someone ""colored."" Not cool by any means, but when they were growing up, that's what was said. Nowadays Eenie Meenie Miney mo's original lyrics have been forgotten, but at the time of the celestial Toy Maker catching a ""n----r by the toe"" was the norm.  By the time I was a child, we said ""tiger."" See, times changed and we changed along with it. 

In the 60s you have a contakerous old man who is taught about the up in coming generation of smart young, capable people. Barbara for example was the smartest in the bunch. He grows to care for his companions and allows them to teach him a thing or two about the modern world. Like we do with our grandparents.

The second Doctor's shows were more in line with the thinking of saving the planet and environmentalism as well as ""peace and love"". The second Doctor was a bohemian hippie that again reflected the times. 

The third was stuck on earth and explored the spy culture that was created during that time. The man was kick ass and Who's version of James Bond. Women, again, were seen as smart and capable through Dr. Liz Shaw just as feminism was really breaking through.

During the 4ths run they did use a Caucasian man play a Chinese man, but again,this was normal. This is a practice still used today. I remember when miss Saigon came out on Broadway in the 90s, The Engineer who is French/Vietnamese was played by Jonathan Price. There was a lot of flack for it and they almost did not allow him to perform because it was an affront to the Asian community. He did, however, underneath freedom of artistic expression. He was the best man for the job and later won the Tony that year. Was John Bennet truly the best man for the role of  Li H'sen Chang in the Talons of Weng-Chiang? He knew his way around villainous characters and the BBC so apparently they thought so. 

I could go through all the Doctors generational changes but I've run out of steam. One thing is for sure, the modern series has made huge strides for equality in all fronts; gender, race, sexual orientation, none of it is an issue. Martha was insanely smart, extremely brave and saved the doctors ass over and over again. He dumped on her, not because of her race but because he was heartbroken. She was the one that came after he lost his then current love and she couldn't live up to it. Isn't that what equality is? Allowing people from all walks of life to be shat on equally? 

As far as this academic paper, anyone can debate whether or not something is one way or not another. You could call anything racist, antifeminist, anti-semetic, anti this anti that...you just have to nit pick to death until there is nothing but bones left. Like critics, who's jobs it is to critique, these academics had a thesis and was rolling with it. Personally I like to look at Doctor Who as it is, a highly entertaining and often times enlightening television show that will forever be current and ever changing with the times.

Well here's my official theory for now:

We're all basing our theories on John Hurt being one of The Doctors regenerations, but what if he's not? What if he's the embodiment of an idea or collective memories?

Like in The God Complex, when Eleven asked Rory if he remembers the 2000 years he spent protecting the Pandorica. Rory basically said that yes he remembers all of it but he keeps it all behind a closed door in his mind so he doesn't go nuts. Then, when Eleven finds his own door he says ""Of course it would be you.""

What if all the terrible things The Doctor has done for the greater good - killing millions to save billions - have been amassed and put into a collective persona that The Doctor refuses to acknowledge as ""The Doctor"" and leaves him behind a closed door in his own mind so he doesn't go mad?",0,1369545615,null,0,false,0,ca65f58,t3_1f0e6c,t1_ca65f58,t1_ca5nmp5,null,1431030496,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Killybug,eng-devon,Devon,"Lets admit to ourselves some basic things. The imposition of Sharia 'law' is an enemy of a multicultural state and no more right to exist in the UK than any other legal system from any other state on earth. Since when do Chinese, Russian, Napoli migrants or into London demand a change of legal system for the entire nation? That being said, if both parties agree, why couldn't a system be implemented where sharia courts that exist outside the uk (albeit with no direct legal foundation and for not for criminal cases, but rulings are mutually adhered to by British Muslims clients)  pass judgements on case brought to them. Rulings therefore would be advisory, rather than legally binding but the consultation of sharia law is the main aim. If both devout participants accept the ruling then so be it. 

Tldr,replace sharia courts with sharia advisory service for dispute mediation. 

Lets admit that this is not a race issue for once. This is an ideological issue, as Islam is a religion (fundamentally a set of ideas) rather than a race, an ever so important distinction. 

I'd be honest but British patience on this issue is wearing thin, which has been simmering for a while now. It must come to free debate, without the bbc pc brigade which is inclusive of all groups. If its not debated out in the open it will spread into the the streets which will be a loss for us all.

true,Kuroikami,null,null,"Interesting idea!

Let's consider that we know that only when they are observed are the angels cast in stone.  Otherwise they are free to move about.  Further, this perception is the only limiting factor of their existence--in short, by quantum-locking when perceived (or they believe they are being perceived) they in essence become that exact angel inhabiting that exact spot.  Otherwise they are free to move about (because they are quantum UNlocked.)

How's this for your theory then:

From the Angel's POV, their prey would seem as a 1 of 2 things:

1.  The back of some poor target's head appearing instantly at the place the angel wanted to be at that exact moment.
2.  A series of flickering images on the target superimposed in 3D space either coming toward or receding from where the angel considers itself to be at.

Let's dig a bit deeper:

If we call being quantum-unlocked as being the potential of being anywhere in 3d space, but limited to only one point in time, from an Angel's POV, the world is full of places you're stuck (because someone is looking at you) and places you aren't.  ""Feeding"" is merely a question of arranging yourself to be at a place where prey exists as well as there being no ""sticking force"" there to thwart you.  In fact, until it decides to collapse the wave-form and be at a place to interact with another being (hopefully prey) you could make an argument that any one Angel is everywhere simultaneously until it makes a decision.

In that respect then, the Angels could technically move at the speed of light--""Don't blink,"" indeed!  However, they apparently tend to slow down a bit as they approach their intended target, especially if it's food, and double so if it's the Doctor, because they like to play with their food a bit and also are evil (Ref: Bob in ""Time of the Angels"" and ""Flesh and Stone."")  So from that respect, your question really is ""What's the world 'look like' to a photon that can be instantly stopped by being measured/perceived to be at exactly one location at exactly one given time?""  Oh--and is also, self-aware, chronophagic and marginally homicidal?

So you've got a creature that is unbound in three dimensions until forced by perception into being in a discreet location.  Ultimate mobility with the ultimate limitation.  From that creature's point of view, everything might be a series of potential pathways of travel, many of which lead to either stacks of 3D space perceived as a extending to approximately 60 degrees nasally (toward the nose, or inward) from the vertical meridian in each eye, to 100 degrees temporally (away from the nose, or outwards) from the vertical meridian, and approximately 60 degrees above and 75 below the horizontal meridian--the human visual field.  In the pathways without those stacks, it's anything goes, all mobility is open (gravity is immaterial to the Angels.)  

So that's a further wrinkle!  Angels are self-aware quantum fluctuations with a massive Achilles' Heel in that, as soon as anyone  thinks they might be around and looks for them, they'll be forced to actually be there (if they were there in the first place) or they'll be lucky enough to avoid detection (because they weren't ever there to begin with.)  In short, you'll ALWAYS find an Angel when you look for one.

Anytime the supercup is mentioned you see Chelsea fans that you rarely see on /r/ChelseaFC suck off Bayern and say the Chelsea fans are scared etcetera like they were the ones who won last year. I've watched every Bayern game this season and I've been waiting them to win because I know they will come in expecting us to roll over like the other teams.

Seriously shut the fuck up and make it clear when you are making these points that you are speaking for yourself instead of undermining our team and joining the hivemind for karma.

""The better team lost"" is a pathetic statement. You have 4 halves and penalties to prove you were better. The better team is the one which wins in the end unless the referee interferes.

To me, the situation I just described is how social media is. It's incidental exposure to such comments, rather than you being exposed against you will - ok, it's against your will in both cases, but it's different from someone walking up to you and saying it to your face, very very different.

On twitter you either need to be following the person (and thus likely expect the sort of remarks they will come out with, and as such, it's your own fault for following that person really), or it needs to be retweeted by someone you follow. The latter case is purely incidental exposure, you're in the wrong place at the wrong time sort of thing. It's still mean things being said, but if you hadn't read twitter that day, or you hadn't walked past that house, you wouldn't have heard it.

The idea that you can be arrested for using abusive or insulting words is absurd. I think pretty much every person in Britain should be arrested. Who here can honestly say, they have never, ever insulted or said anything abusive to anyone, ever? Even over the internet? This doesn't seem like common sense, when almost on a daily basis half the country must be, technically, committing a crime.

I mean, ""You're a fucking dick"". Technically, by law, I've just insulted someone, and am now a criminal? That's actually retarded. 

Threatening, ok, sure, maybe you could argue, on a case by case basis that there may be something to be investigated, but how many of you have said ""I could kill him/her!"" before now? In the vast majority of cases, that's nothing but a figure of speech, but yet, it could be construed as a threat.
