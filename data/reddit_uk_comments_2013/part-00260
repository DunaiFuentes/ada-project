Moreover, transfers have fuck all to do with the result at Hull, except in the broad sense that better players would be more likely to win.  But that's a useless point because **that is true for literally every single game.**  Our transfer policy is why we lost to Arsenal!  It's why we drew Newcastle!  We need to re-evaluate our transfer strategy in light of our defeat at Hull!

Shut up.  We didn't lose to Arsenal because of our transfer policy; we didn't draw Swansea because of our transfer policy (unless you count selling Shelvey, and even that broke even in the game); and we didn't lose to Hull because of the players we brought in.  No, we lost to Hull because they got their tactics spot on, we couldn't adapt or handle it, and we were playing players in unfamiliar positions.  Also, Moses is lazy and I'm not happy with him.  But the point is, Hull pressed us really well, kept us from transitioning the ball through midfield, and maintained their shape when we were trying to threaten their goal.  Our defense- and our midfield's ability to recover when we lost the ball- were the opposite, and Hull were able to exploit it.

Look at our transfers under Rodgers, really, just look at them with a sensible eye and you will see why this article is completely pointless.  Rodgers inherited a team with a lot of deadwood, and he offloaded it remarkably effectively.  He's brought in talented youth (Yesil, Alberto, Ilori) and some excellent first-teamers for very cheap (Coutinho, Sturridge).  Mignolet and Sakho were buys that were right on the money as well.  Sure, Borini, Aspas, Assaidi, and Allen haven't panned out, but you can't expect every transfer- or even most transfers- to come off well.  Assaidi was very cheap, Borini and Allen are young, and Aspas was brought in to be a squad player and hasn't seen much time.  And really, it's not because we brought them in that we lost to Hull.

**TL;DR:** Article is pointless, our transfer policy is fine, we lost to Hull because they outplayed us.",0,1386045421,null,0,false,0,cdsafdd,t3_1ryx12,t1_cdsafdd,t3_1ryx12,null,1428417842,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

I'm not someone who's had much in his life that he can claim amounted to good; I started off in a children's home, much like him, and from there became cold, angry and bitter. I joined the army, hoping to get lost and even end my life with some meaning - but I'm still here. Still breathing, still looking for some place that I fit in.

I try to control my better nature these days, but sometimes a glimmer comes through, and I'm back to being a firghtened little boy who felt unwanted, unloved and unnoticed; and the gods know that for me, the ""festive season"" is a time that hits home that I have no one to share it with...And it makes me worse in many ways. My point, however, is that I load up on sci fi. I've built my own traditions, and my own happy places to help me control the angry little boy inside. I'll be spending the next month watching old, almost worn out VHS copies of lost in space, the land of giants, buck rogers, Battlestar Galactica (old and new) - and then on christmas day, I pull out the DVDs I have of Tom Baker, Colin Baker and Jon Pertwee, lock the door and watch them because they're very much *my* family.

I egt my sense of humour from Tom Baker. I picked up on the important of thinking and reasoning rationally and clearly (although sometimes I fail), and I exercise daily because growing up, the only thing I wanted to learn was Venusian Aikido to take anyone on. 

There is, however a difference. All the other sci fi I used to watch, I watched because they made me smile; Doctor Who, however, I watched along with the Superman films because for one moment, one *brief* moment, a childhood that required that I depend upon no one but myself let me be a child for a while. I wouldn't be afraid at night because the doctor would chase the demons and the daleks away. I would try to do the right thing (even though I often got beaten up anyway), because in my mind, I would always ask what Kal El, or what the doctor would do. There's never been much room in my life for faith, because I've never especially had a reason to believe that God was love, or was even merciful...I couldn't, because growing up, I've learned that there are people in *so much more* pain than I had ever been - but for a while, there's a respite; a moment of grace that we're all afforded, where we can forget for a moment who we are, and settle in our minds the infinite potential of who we want to, and more importantly *could* be.

The Doctor gave that to me. Superman gave that to me; pretending I was Buck Rogers in the playground gave that to me, and for all the grime that stains the soul that I have...I have Pertwee, and the Bakers for those moments of innocence, of childlike joy.

I think Fulham will be a difficult team to figure out. Of course it is very likely that they will put 10 men behind the ball, but due to the recent sacking of Martin Jol the club also needs to play positive football in order to calm things down a bit.

Starting Fryers would give Vertonghen much needed rest whoever is our LCB will have to get ready to put a shift in tho. I would play Dawson and Kaboul (Chiriches on the bench). Walker starts. I'd start Capoue Dembele Paulinho and sub in Holtby for probably dembele but depends on how we're doing during the game. As far as attacking options go I'd start Lennon and Chadli (both played really well on saturday) and Soldado.

If we play a 4-2-3-1 I'd start Dembele and Capoue as midfield, Lamela plays behind the striker. Honestly wouldnt be surprised to see this.",0,1386049455,null,0,false,0,cdsc07a,t3_1ryrnc,t1_cdsc07a,t3_1ryrnc,null,1428417106,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

I also don't see using 2 AM's together like Willian and Hazard as wingbacks working out to well. They can contribute to a team's defense, but they can't patrol the entire wings by themselves the way wingbacks should. Ramires seems like he might work on the right (stamina, pace, tackling), though the left is more difficult. I would say Cole, though I don't think he has the legs anymore. Bertrand could fit, given that he's played at both LB and LM (and wingback is a sort of intermediate position between those). Perhaps Azpi could contribute too, on the right or the left, given his performances at LB. So my Chelsea 3-5-2 would look like [this](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=1qy5m)

And out of the 3 scenarios I can imagine: (1) /u/rram misunderstood the situation or is wrong (2) /u/rram is being a dick (3) you were previously banned for posting personal information and he is simply enforcing the ban by deleting your new accounts; it's not even in the same ballpark as the political censoring that goes on in the world.

I've never heard of any political or financially driven censoring on Reddit.  Sure, some mods are dicks if they don't like you but a personal vendetta that involves banning accounts is worthy of shaking your head, not lighting the torches and grabbing the pitchforks.

Bitching/story time:

Through a hiring company, i worked for Lloyds Banking Group (they handled the mess for Halifax and HBOS) handling PPI claims, which only added to my disgust for them in general. PPI is a shady business on the sides of the annoying text message spammers as well as the banks themselves. It was added to a lot of customers' loans and mortgages with little explanation of the outcome. The charge for the insurance was between Â£500 and Â£10k usually, and you'd pay interest on top of that through the repayment period. This happened because branches were given commission on how many sales they could get, and part of the culture was and is to upsell the customer, and at times outright lie, or just say 'tick here, here here and here and you get your loan', including the tickbox for PPI. Some people actually needed or could justifiably have a use for PPI, but i did not encounter those cases very often.

The actual function of our job as PPI handlers was to consider the evidence available at the time (generally 3-10 years after the fact) and call up the customer for their recollection of the sale, if there was anything not 100% clear about the case. Obviously, nearly nobody could remember any details about what went on, so cases that were on the fence were denied because there is very rarely a record of what's discussed when signing an agreement and we had a 'robust sales process' which basically meant you can't prove we did anything wrong, even though there are countless cases of customers being lied to or misled. The Financial Ombudsman Service would review denied cases that a customer came to them with and the ~70% denial rate that our banks were providing were nowhere near acceptable compared to the independent investigations that the FOS did.

Big surprise, i know, big banks try to fuck their customers at every chance, but that job really soured me to the finance sector, and i'm sure as fuck not touching a Lloyds Banking Group service if i can help it. It just amazed me that we had office blocks across the country dedicated to making sure the bank didn't lose too much money when they were caught red handed swindling their customers. The pay was good, but your contract signing depended on how many cases you could process, not the quality of your work, and there was fudging going on all over the place. Usual corporate shit you get when you just focus on the raw data.

That's not even getting into things like the Lloyds' arms trade involvement or money laundering for Iran.",0,1386050536,null,0,false,0,cdscd9j,t3_1rxb20,t1_cdscd9j,t3_1rxb20,null,1428416937,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

A good example is occupational therapy services, a service where a person will go into an ill persons home for example and manage to make it that the person can try and lead a normal life with the things they have again. A rehabilitation service in effect. Italy has 1 occupational therapist in the whole country (this is something from a couple of years back, but literally that small a number). The UK has a lot more by comparison, over 34,000 registered. They are bloody important in getting a persons independence back, but Italian families look at it differently.

The other factor is the fact that the Italians tend to get substantially less long term illnesses that affect later life years. Arthritis, CVD, Dementia... They are difficult to manage and cost a lot on a service.

Without having Champions league football to offer Liverpool will likely miss out on those most desirable players.

Take Skrtel out of the firing line after a tough day for him.

""Whilst I disagree with your opinion, I'll defend to the death your right to say it""

I very much hold this mindset. I've been raised to think critically but openly. I've been exposed (and desensitised) to the internet from a very young age (since before the age of 10, and I'm over 20 now.) But as I've got older, I realise an open mind and my ability to self-censor as your describe is because I'm fortunate enough to be raised and exposed to things in a way that breeds this mindset. Not everyone is lucky enough to have that, and it's very sad.

Although I wish everyone could view the world in the way you describe, and the way I try to live my life by, I'm not sure it's possible, at least not within this generation. Some people just aren't raised that way. Some people are raised to judge, get offended, intimidate others into changing their minds and generally as bad, narrow minded and oppressive people. And those people always exist.

What's worse is that there are perfectly nice people out there who don't have this open mind, and probably never will. There are perfectly nice people out there who would take offence to that tweet. It's not through choice, it's a gut reaction, a response that nurtured into a person that it becomes a part of their nature. Some people who I care about greatly, including close family and friends aren't fortunate enough to have this open mind. It's not their fault though, they're a product of their genetics and upbringing.

This to me poses a problem. How do we deal with this? It's all well and good to say ""well we just shouldn't get offended and just move on."" But that comes at a great emotional cost to those that can't do that. But it's not their fault that they can't do that, so they're being exposed to bad experiences through something that's no fault of their own, that they can't change. Why should us open minded people get to say ""everyone else should just stop getting pissed off at this stuff?"" Why should people that don't have this open mind, through no fault of their own, suffer because someone else likes to try piss off other people?

What do people think to this? I'm guessing everyone knows people like this, perfectly nice, kind, caring and loving people who just haven't been exposed to life and it's realities, and behaviour like this does upset them. But at the same time, this guy has his right to freedom of expression also.

tl;dr I'm open minded with this sort of stuff, I think everyone should be and the world would be a better place if so. But not everyone is or can be, through no fault of their own.

true,Raining_Imprecations,null,null,"I don't think we'll be getting any points from Arsenal. I am going to be watching the game at THE Arsenal bar in town with a couple of my Gooner friends, and I fully expect it to be excruciating. Wenger is a top manager, his team has been flying all season, and there is some individual talent in their squad that we can't hope to match. A point away to Arsenal would be a dream. 

Now United on the other hand, I predict at least a point and a victory should not come as a surprise to anyone. Moyes is not a big game manager, and this is a very big game. There's no reason not to expect the type of managerial performance that he always put in against Liverpool- a total crap performance. Getting three at OT would be huge given the table as it stands, the time of year, the momentum going into Arsenal, and the first match against Moyes aspect. I think RM will have the team up for it. 

I don't know if any of you are/have been into college football, but I grew up in Ohio as an OSU Buckeyes fan. When I first started watching John Cooper was their coach. He was well regarded and definitely competent, but he always downplayed the Michigan rivalry and generally got his ass handed to him in that game(2-10-1 in 13 meetings), and to a lesser but still painful degree in bowl games. Moyes reminded me of that- a good coach but never got up for the big ones. After Cooper came Jim Tressel and happy days- OSU thumped Michigan regularly under Tressel, and he never backed away from the big game status. I remember when he was first hired he addressed the crowd at an OSU basketball game... and talked about the upcoming football game against Michigan that wouldn't be played for another eight months or so. Totally up for it. You could tell he relished the intensity of those games. The Moyes/Martinez v Cooper/Tressel comparisons don't extend very far, but the point is RM seems up for it and I get the feeling Moyes would rather not even have to be at the park for it even though he puts on a show of it being just another game.

So yeah, four points from the two games is probably a lot to hope for, but a win at OT is wonderfully possible. ",0,1386061616,null,0,1386148968,0,cdsexbk,t3_1ruoeo,t1_cdsexbk,t3_1ruoeo,null,1428415673,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

""Young forward wants regular first team action""

Barcelona forward Christian Tello has opened the door to a move to Liverpool in the January transfer
window after admitting he may need to move on in order to secure himself more regular first team football,
the Daily Mirror reports.
The 22-year-old has been out of action recently thanks to injury, but has not been able to command a
regular first team spot in the time before he was laid out on the sidelines and Liverpool may look to rescue
him from limbo should Gerrardo Martino continue to not use him.
""You wait and see how the season goes and if by the end I do not play what I want, I will raise out,"" Tello
said.
""Taking that step will be quite difficult but I think we appreciate the role of each.
""As the years pass you want the role change and have more minutes.""

his side's defeat to Hull at the weekend and has made a forward one of his top priorities after it was

true,StormySan,null,null,"&gt; I've skidded on water before but not experienced proper aquaplaning.

That often *is* aquaplaning :)

From what I understand (I read up a lot about it afterwards!), the profile certainly helps to reduce the chance of it happening a hell of a lot, but certainly not to the point where it's impossible, and as an inexperienced rider I took actions that were not sensible in the wet that exacerbated the risks.

My incident was likely not helped by the fact that it was a generic 125c test centre bike, so it was quite light and the tyres may not have been looked after as well as the might have, plus the perfect storm of cornering + acceleration + patch of water.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaplaning#Motorcycles

&gt; Motorcycles benefit from narrow tires with round, canoe-shaped contact patches. Narrow tires are less vulnerable to aquaplaning because vehicle weight is distributed over a smaller area, and rounded tires more easily push water aside. These advantages diminish on lighter motorcycles with naturally wide tires, like those in the supersport class. Further, wet conditions reduce the lateral force that any tire can accommodate before sliding. While a slide in a four-wheeled vehicle may be corrected, the same slide on a motorcycle will generally cause the rider to fall. Thus, despite the relative lack of aquaplaning danger in wet conditions, motorcycle riders must be even more cautious because overall traction is reduced by wet roadways.",0,1386062031,null,0,false,0,cdsezpr,t3_1rwuw2,t1_cdsezpr,t1_cds70wu,null,1428415642,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

As for the midfield, it depends on how its carried out. The roles of the players is highly important. will Coutinho/Alberto be going wide? will they switch flanks? go past suarez? drop deep to push hendo forward? The shape of the middle three is another important factor. Is it two in the back or two in the front? 

Assuming that its mainly focused  on playing through the middle, there is one thought thought. With no width on the pitch, it'd be better to play Allen over Gerrard. Gerrard does well with wingers who can provide an outlet for his longballs. But this formation is narrow which usually means you want the focus of the play to go central and have the fullbacks provide width. this means the midfielders will have to run to find space and also be comfy in that space. Gerrard takes too long on the ball and is not agile enough to play through pressure. Allen could do the job and at the same time cover the backline with Lucas. Also i'd love to finally see him play with Alberto as I think they see the game very similarly.

Then thereâs the Commonwealth/Anglosphere: primarily Australia, New Zealand and Canada, and to a lesser extent the USA and Ireland. These countries speak our language, share much of our media output (TV, music, film etc.), and enjoy very similar cultures to ours in many respects. If we have a natural family, it is they. 

Continental Europe, by comparison, feels very âforeignâ, they are our neighbours, not our family, but somehow we seem to be moving in with them. Back in the 1970âs we agreed to get involved in the local trade agreement, now we seem to be the Cinderella in an ugly step family. Our new step dad seems very controlling, and keeps inviting more kids to join the family when we're struggling to afford to feed ourselves. We wouldn't mind so much, but we keep finding them in our rooms playing with our toys without even asking us.

true,Samtheism,null,null,"The way Funding Circle bidding works is that every chunk of money offered is considered committed, until a lower bid pushes it off. If the loan you mention finished at 13.8% then your money from 14.5% would of been returned to you immediately after the bid that pushed your 14.5% out.

Above your bidding summary there is a button that says ""[  ] Off   Live Updates (beta)"". If you click this on you can watch each bid come in and push off the higher bids. If you don't turn this on you will need to constantly refresh the page if you want to see how your bids are doing.



As for myself, yes whenever possible I will bid in the last few minutes. Prior to this I still make bids. This is important because about a quarter of companies end the listing early (to get their money faster). Ending early also tends to mean higher rates for us, so it hurts to miss them.


My overall strategy is to look at all the new Â£75k and above loans each day and add the ones I like to the watchlist. Then, throughout the day if I am free I will keep checking for any loans that make it to 100% completion or that my previous bids have been pushed out.
On days I am not free to watch it all day I will bid the rate I would be happy to get PLUS a much higher one 'just in case'.



It is well worth in my personal opinion, buying on the secondary market at the moment for solid loans you don't have any exposure to. Remember you need at the very least loans from 25 different companies to spread your risk.

I am with 125 at the moment having deliberately lowered my stake with each business. It hurts my rates a bit but each default is less painful.



Hope some of this may help, always happy to talk about these companies. (I'm not a professional don't necessarily do what I say, I am just a somewhat experienced user. Etc. Etc.)

true,T0PIA,null,null,"&gt; It is up to parents to teach their child about the Internet, the risks, how to keep them from seeing adult related content and deal with the situation if their kid does go where they should not.

Couldn't agree more. But we don't all live in our own sealed metal box. If you don't want society to pick up the slack, you shut the gate before the horse bolts, not whinge about it afterwards because you have to chase the horse around the field.

We live in a society and we all have to live together. That's what society is right? Trying to make a mutually comfortable existence. One thing the internet generation gets wrong is this idea that society is a fixed, integral part of existence. That it will always be the way it is because it seems like it's always been that way. That's not the case. Society is fragile (well, one you'd want to live in is). It requires effort on the part of everyone who lives in it to make it work and there are fine elements that make a society work and fine elements that gradually cause it to crumble and turn into a cluster fuck. Turning your back on morality is like kicking out a foundation stone then expecting the whole thing to stay standing. And these are gradual erosions, not cataclysmic collapses. Censorship is about balancing what is and what isn't degrading to the minds of those who will one day determine and establish what society is. 

So what effects little Billy whose mum doesn't give a fuck about what he watches on the internet effects everyone who lives in the society with Billy. Kids need to be kids. If they're exposed to the horrific realities of life too soon, it affects them. I'm sorry so many people are not aware of this and seem to think the anecdotal 'I watched lesbian strap-on hardcore when I was 4 and I turned out alright' is evidence enough that this is not the case, but it is the case. Children need to play, they need to feel safe and they need to be protected from the harsh realities while they find their feet. You don't throw a 6yr old who can't swim off the side of an ocean liner and yell 'don't worry, this is how my mum taught me to swim and I turned out fine, you'll be a bit uncomfortable for a bit but it won't fuck you up for life.' That's obvious. The stuff that niggles away at a child's mentality, stuff like parents arguing, swearing, excessive drinking, fighting, exposure to porn, exposure to horror films, exposure to age-rated games, is less obvious but no less damaging. It all slowly chips away at the kids sense of well being and makes an irreversible dent in the shape of their mind. When they grow to inherit society, they respond to their environment accordingly. 

And you don't just give up because it's hard man. Being a parent is hard. Stop with this argument that its fighting an impossible battle. No it isn't. You *can* defend your kid's innocence simply by being a decent person, leading by example and applying parental controls *where you can*. If they see stuff away from home then there's nothing you can do about that, but the important thing is you tried your best for your kid, because you look out for people who can't look out for themselves, whether they're your kids or not. That's society.  

The erosion of an adult's understanding of what is right and wrong, what helps society and what messes society up, is learned when we're kids. That you don't see anything morally or socially wrong with exposing children to hardcore porn, death videos, abusive internet-trolls etc because 'that shit won't fuck you up for life' seems to prove my point.

But again, I'm not arguing for this opt-in filter, which I don't think is the answer. I'm not sure what the answer is. I'd be for the opt-in if I trusted the government to censor responsibly, but I don't.

If you really want to save then ~2% in a savings account only equals that of inflation currently. This means in effect your savings wont shrink but they won't grow either.


The least risky way to actually grow savings above inflation would be with someone like ZOPA. You won't be able to get your money back easily without paying a fee so is only worth considering for savings of at least a year. You will also have to pay tax on interest if you have a job.

This is good news. 

Also how about stopping mobile phone companies taking the piss if you're late with your bill. I've just had to pay next months bill as well when they cut me off for late payment ( entirely my own fault, I've had a busy month, just forgot and I refuse to go the direct debit route because of a run in I had with Orange a few years ago where they took Â£300 for my bank by mistake and then took months to re-credit it ) 

I think my whole point though is that if I was genuinely struggling to pay the bill for one month then how the hell would I be able to pay for two months in one go. 

There's absolutely no leeway and I'm rarely late paying my bill too. I'm not a bad customer. 


On a separate note I did a gig for T-mobile once and it took them 5 months and a lot of hassle to get them to pay me. 'We understand that your invoice states 30 days Sir, we however operate a 120 day payment from the date of the received invoice policy.""

This isn't true at all. The 'finding holes' in the person's opinions isn't a happy coincidence - the questions were asked in such a way to find those holes. 

As for ""holding the opposite as true"", I actually regularly argue from the opposite sides. It's just this sub tends to be rather left-leaning so I usually find myself arguing from the right. I do the opposite on something like /r/conservative.

true,marshsmellow,null,null,"&gt; nonsense. 

*Sigh...*

 it's against my better judgement to debate with someone who opens an argument like that, but I'll make one final point... 

&gt;I think the fact you're arguing that it is theoretically ok for a 8 year old to watch a Mexican drug dealer have his head sawed off with a chainsaw leaves me in some doubt.

What's the worst that can happen? (And don't spout that shite about Jamie Bulger's killers doing what they did because of some chuckie movie...) 

I'm not saying put it on the curriculum but 8 year olds will have access to this crap no matter what anyone does. It's a parent's duty to keep it out of the home and to provide reassurance/guidance for when they *do* see it. you can never realistically prevent them from ever seeing it, they will find a way. At 39, you seem to have forgotten what's it's like to be a kid abs how savvy/devious you were at that age. 

I saw the World At War documentary series at about 8 and that contained plenty of horrors. Infinitely worse horrors that the Mexican chainsaw video, I would argue. I had nightmares, sure. I didn't sleep for 2 weeks after I watched a nightmare on Elm Street at the age of 5. That was supposedly restricted to my age group but I still managed to catch a glimpse at a friends house. This stuff scared the crap out of me and upset me. I learned to cope with these emotions as part of my development and I certainly don't look at any of these gore NSFW pics on reddit. I don't need to see that stuff. An 8 year old can make that exact same decision. Some will be fascinated by it, some will hate it and turn away.

I'm not arguing against age restrictions, I'm arguing against censorship. Because censorship affects *us*: adults. Why does the film censor board have power to censor,  for example, an erect penis or open vagina , from
 an over 18s, mainstream film? Who the fuck are they to decide that for *me*? That should be a contract between me and the filmmaker. This is what your are arguing for!

So to be honest I don't have any experience dealing with insurance write offs personally but here goes anyway. With cat D you don't need an inspection to get back on the road. The damage is probably not severe, just not economical. Damage to fairing is pretty much a death sentence for older bikes since they are so expensive (several hundred Â£s just for new panels, possibly over Â£1000).

If you have seen it and are happy then just go with. Especially since it is from a mate. If he is a good friend he won't want to see you crash it and get hurt, right? So if there is something more serious than just cosmetic damage (and that's a very, very big if since it is cat D) he will be honest with you.

A particularly absurd example was the ""catgate"" story.  A man who was legally in the UK applied to stay permanently as he was in a long-term relationship with a British citizen.  The government tried to deport him (even though their own policies said he should be allowed to stay), the courts ruled in his favour, then somehow the newspapers spun the story into an illegal immigrant being allowed to stay in the UK just because he owned a cat, due to European human rights law.  This wildly inaccurate version of events became so widely known that it was repeated by the Home Secretary (who is in charge of immigration, among other things) and the Prime Minister.

then you have two options....Expect cyclists to cycle in the middle of the lane and not to overtake them, or expect cyclists to undertake as cars who overtake them put them in that position by moving ahead of them on the road (effectively jumping the queue)

As for being douchy - Why should a cyclist be inconvenienced if they don't need to be? Filtering is legal. If you think its a douchy move to follow the HC Im not sure what to suggest.

Two years ago Denmark had a bit of a quarrel with the EU because it decided to introduce border control (they would search 1 in 10 cars). That lasted for about a year. 

However, they have pegged their currency to the Euro and are welcoming the wave of students coming here. You get to learn Danish for free and there are great times to be had with Danes once they got to know you as something other than an ""eastern european"".  

I think overall Denmark would have a very bad time without the EU and they have good things to say about it. I think what grinds their gears sometimes is people demanding absurd stuff like no pork in schools (already done, people are annoyed as far as I can tell).

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Consider a similar situation outside of a bus: if you were to see a group of big, crazy men beating up some poor person on the street, would it be wise for you to attempt to intervene? Even if you were not alone, they could be armed or otherwise.

The best advice in that kind of situation is to immediately alert the police but do not get yourself involved in the fight. Perhaps take a video or image of the thugs for evidence later, but don't get yourself beat up too.

It may help to make it clear that the police are already on their way so that the thugs will stop the beating and put their thoughts to escape, removing the danger from the victim.

Once they leave the poor injured person, then the bystanders are now in a position to offer what assistance they can and contact the police again to update them.

I know this seems selfish and cowardly, but you can't reasonably expect every person to have the bravery, *and the ability* to be a hero and beat up all the thugs on the spot. If it were just one attacker, then yes, it is probably worth the risk to save someone from imminent danger, but if it's a group, you haven't got a chance without special training.

The same I think applies to the bus. Without special training and equipment, you can't expect the bus driver or the other passengers to intervene against a group of thugs. I think the *only* thing they could do is to stop the bus, evacuate (remove yourselves as potential hostages to a madman), call the police and perhaps try and scare off the attackers by telling them that the police are already on their way. That way, once they have left, you can concentrate on helping the victim.

This part is important: **It is a much higher priority to stop the violence and help the victim as soon as possible** than to trap the thugs and try to restrain them. If you have to let them go for the time being to release the victim, then that is the right thing to do.",0,1386069515,null,0,false,0,cdsfzgj,t3_1rx33d,t1_cdsfzgj,t1_cdsfkke,null,1428415178,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The NHS is marvelous, I truly think it is one of the finest institutions on the face of the planet, and on the whole it does a wonderful job. As you quite rightly point out though, it has some serious problems, some of which are endemic, and which absolutely need to be addressed.

I don't think any of these problems are big enough or of the type to undermine the value of the NHS entirely, and I don't think any of them can be helped or improved by the introduction of commercial interest and a profit motive. If anything this would probably exacerbate some of the problems you mentioned.

At the moment these problems are only being admitted by people who are using them as an excuse to sell off parts of the NHS to their chums, and the majority of the people who are (quite rightly) against NHS privatisation are in response simply unwilling to admit or contemplate any of the problems that obviously exist..

yeah they have mate. /u/multijoy started off this little exchange saying
 
&gt;The point of red lights are that they stop all traffic so that someone proceeding on a green light can be 95% certain someone isn't going to travel into their path.

then he said

&gt;The stop time on a set of pedestrian lights is so low that unless you're proposing to travel at speed, by the time you've approached, slowed, checked that nobody is going to suddenly dart out (and they've right of way, so there's no need for them to consider whether you've seen them), and crossed at a slow controlled speed then you may as well have stopped for them in the first place for all the time you've made up.

you left out the start of this paragraph about skipping a red light when you quoted this to nonsensically comment 

&gt;You clearly don't ride a bike.

I think that covers where I get the red lights from(as well as the context of that being what the article is about of course)

now 

&gt;We're talking about starting and stopping, effective use of inertia when cycling and the problems of coming to a complete foot-on-the-floor standstill and why cyclists don't do it. Even the difference between stopping with both feet on the pedals and stopping with one foot on the ground is huge when it comes to getting started again. Particularly if it's a hill start.

I cycle, and I can stop and start anywhere. it's not rocket science you put your foot on the floor. If theres a red light you stop, even if that means you then need to dismount and walk to get to the top of the hill you're on (you could always get some muscle and just hill start like normal people you big jessie)

&gt;Look, either you believe that every cyclist out there â from the cycle courier to the 10yo to the priest's wife on the way to the post office â becomes an adrenaline junkie looking for the thrill of riding across fast traffic â¦ or you concede that every cyclist out there discovers on their own how to conserve energy and make efficient use of their mode of transport. And the identical behaviour they all adopt is down to the fact that this is how you effectively ride a bike.

efficiency is irrelevant in the face of safety, red means stop even if you think you should be a special case. The fact that starting again is inefficient doesnt give motorists the right to go anyway and bicycles are no different.

true,glguru,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"This is the typical corporate bullshit that is not true at all. While public sector is inefficient, the efficiency of the corporate sector is not designed to benefit the customers. It is designed with the sole purpose of profiting the shareholders. Within this assumption lies the fallacy that competition will drive prices lower which couldn't be further from truth. Look at the railway system and the energy sector in UK. These are some good examples of systems that were supposed to work under the said assumptions but fail miserably. They do not benefit the customers, provide poor service and, on average cost much more than what they did under the government. Just wait and see what's going to happen with Royal mail. As if mail prices in UK weren't preposterous enough, you'll soon have a drive from the shareholders to increase profits. 

The secondly misunderstanding is that there are no commercial entities within NHS. There are plenty of commercial entities associated with NHS and that is something which cannot be avoided. NHS provides a lot of jobs in the private sector as well. 

To be honest I do not want the NHS or any part of it to end up in the private sector. I would rather pay for the inefficiencies than get blackmailed out of pocket by some greedy investors.

So you can ask for proof of this, but there isn't any. 

American research however says that 75% of all wives of alcoholics have been threatened and 45% have been assaulted by their partners. 

So at the end of the day, it's not exactly a secret. Where there's hardship there's drink. Where's there's drink, there's abuse. 

Yet the government seems to think there's somehow a case for reduced funding when it comes to tackling this. 

They literally do not give a shit about the communities they supposedly represent. 

What can you even say about that. 

My solution would be a small tax on drinks manufactures which isn't recoupable from their customers to be set aside for victim support and whilst I know they are not the cause of this, they are definitely in some ways the enabler and therefore some responsibility should fall their way.

true,clicker191,null,null,"It looks like you don't have 'bad credit' per se. Instead, you just don't look profitable to the Co-op. Banks are just after your money and getting students to bank with them is a highly profitable way of obtaining customers as most stay for the long term. Your current difficulty is likely to be because of a lack of credit history. There is a small chance that you might be the victim of identity fraud but this is easily checked through Equifax or Experian if you sign up for a free trial and cancel before the end of the month. Remember, there is no such thing as a simple 'credit rating'. Different companies will rate you according to their own criteria so if you aren't successful at the Co-op then you might (or might not) be successful somewhere else. Repeated attempts to apply could slightly damage your chances but perhaps I can give you some positive or constructive advice...

Firstly, it sounds like they will give you a student account if you provide three months of statements. I would do this pronto. It might be this simple. Out of interest though, why do you want a student account? Does it fit your needs? Are you getting one for the 0% overdraft? If so, remember that the interest rates are typically re-introduced on these a year or so after you graduate. If you do have bad spending habits then I would think hard about this as it's likely that you will use this account and get into ~Â£1000 of debt instead of getting a more consistent job at uni that will also help build your CV etc. I don't mean to sound like a patronising a-hole, it's just this is exactly what I did when I was at uni and it took me nearly three years to pay off that student overdraft once I left. For what it's worth, the best thing to do with these 0% overdrafts is to place the money into an investment or savings account with an interest rate that beats inflation and then place the money back into the overdraft account just before the 0% interest rate ends. 

Secondly, build your credit history. I don't know how good with money you are but from your post you say that you have bad spending habits. An easy way to build your history is to get a credit card. Don't do this if you can't trust yourself, and if you do get one then pay it off in full every month. I would get a credit card (check the moneysavingexpert website for the best deals) and pay for just one or two things a month on it. Then setup a direct debit to pay it off in full every month. This way you start building a history. Credit cards are really debt cards and you are borrowing from your future self if you do not pay them back on time. If you can trust yourself then they're great otherwise think twice. Remember though that once you leave uni you may want to get a mortgage or something and a credit history will be very useful.

You're missing the point. 

If a business - any business - were to lose 30% of its revenue, it would face massive problems. Even for a (relatively) well-run club like Arsenal, where the wage bill is not more than half of their income, after wages you've effectively halved their operating funds. 

By no means am I saying that your point isn't valid. There are plenty of anecdotal examples to support the claim that fans are not treated as well. But the numbers don't bear your wider claim out. You can't say it's ""only"" 30%, or that clubs don't ""depend"" on it. Yes, they may very well survive in the sense that they wouldn't go bust. But losing that amount of money means money being moved around the business elsewhere, which means less to spend on wages, which means worse players, which means - to follow the argument to its logical conclusion - relegation, with all the extra financial penalties that come with that. 

Seriously, this is elementary finance. Survival in the absolute sense is by no means the same thing as survival in the sense of being a reasonably stable top division club. ",0,1386073852,null,0,false,0,cdsgncl,t3_1rwku9,t1_cdsgncl,t1_cdrrhkx,null,1428414869,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The care given would be of greater focus though the independence given with occupational therapists is still greater as they can still remain in their own homes, have more specially trained staff and can move more freely and the like simply due to the fact that they HAVE less focus. Care and independence tend to work in in inverse ratio to each other. Not saying they lose their independence but they have less when at the stage they NEED the care. It should be mentioned that nursing homes are not such a massive thing in the UK, used mostly when the elderly in question have some variety of Alzheimers that would make care difficult for most.

Councils have plenty of cash floating around. They just put political point scoring ahead of their residents.

The figures also show that councilsâ in-house spending continued to rise by a further 2% despite repeated calls by ministers to reduce administration costs and overheads.

Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said:

**There are no rules that specify minimum or maximum levels of reserves and people will be surprised that while councils are hoarding billions in their piggy banks some are pleading poverty and raising Council Tax.**

While it is sensible for local authorities to maintain a healthy cushion, such substantial reserves are completely unnecessary and should be tapped into to ensure councils can protect frontline services and keep Council Tax down for hardworking people.

Councils should also be making creative use of reserves to address short-term costs, such as restructuring or investing now to realise savings in the longer-term.

Well that's impossible. You can't know you don't like it until you read it. It's better to say that there is no right to not be offended. Grow a thicker skin. That is the price of living in a free society. Occasional offense at things people say is far, far better than the consequences of censoring people as a general policy against offense.

This isn't always true, of course. Speech can get people riled up to actually do things. Yelling ""fire"" in a crowded theater is a typical example. Joking about a bomb on an airplane also creates fear and requires a physical search and review. It affects lives. If you rant and get people to agree and tell them to attack somebody and they do, that speech did actually contribute to causing physical harm or danger.

And you've checked this? I know for sure that there are companies always looking to put someone through a ESL course so they can be shipped around the world to teach English, a few folk I know have used this to take them half way around the planet.

I am not addressing the point as to whether there is a right and wrong about free movement of labour.

My point has only been whether it is in the interests of a very large selection of the population of the UK. They are getting no benefit at all from the ability to work freely in the EU themselves. And I would like to add I disagree with you utterly as to the ease of finding working: in most customer facing jobs in EU capitals (where the jobs are) local language skills are critical to being able to find work.

You are also dismissing the fact that with relation to *EU workers* the majority of the migrant workforce we are talking about have significant degrees of existing ability in English, a consequence both of education in their country, and its incredible widespreadedness of use.

The right and wrong of freedom of movement has never really played into my point at all. My point is only that this part of the population is put at a significant disadvantage due to facing INTENSE additional labour competition, with which they cannot compete, as the migrant labour force is already trained, and the employer has no reason to train the untrained worker, while gaining far fewer corresponding opportunities to find work elsewhere.

Were I a member of that section of the labour force I would, quite rightly see that disadvantage and want to see that I was getting something in return. And if not try and prevent it.

&gt;I know for sure that there are companies always looking to put someone through a ESL course so they can be shipped around the world to teach English, a few folk I know have used this to take them half way around the planet.

This is not an unskilled job: there are only a few countries you can do it without a degree. Few of them are in the EU.

&gt;A British person moving to Paris, Berlin or Stockholm to take up unskilled work is going to end up with less money in their pocket than if they did the same job in the UK.

But the comparison here is UNEMPLOYMENT with paid work. Not the same job with the same job.

Also both France has a higher minimum wage than the UK, and significantly better labour conditions. The average unskilled labour wage in Sweden is also significantly higher, and the work conditions are extremely good as well, in fact the unskilled labour wage is extremely close to the average wage: a barista in Sweden makes about Â£10 an hour. I won't even get in to the labour conditions in the UK, but they are utterly dire, with very few rights, and irregular unreliable hours.

So you are simply wrong in viewing the conditions in the UK so favorably. Economically there are great advantages to seeking work in the EU. The work is simply un, or not easily obtainable in the same way it is for those with language skills.

I'd love to be able to go and work in a coffee shop in Scandinavia for a year. The coffee culture is great for it, and the pay is great. But its not an option without an extremely high level of language proficiency, in a language that would be useful literally for ONLY that, rather than one useful for a million and one things.

Edit, with question: Is it possible your experience as a professional has given you a rose tinted view about just how easy it is to take advantage of labour mobility? I assure you the experience is not comparable at the bottom end of the labour market, particularly in customer facing work. UK workers are not failing to take advantage of opportunities for work at any pay and work at better rates of pay, simply because they are happier staying at home on the dole. 

Its because there are barriers faced, and advantages witheld from the UK worker that his peer seeking work in the UK, particularly the south east, is much less subjected too. In markets where unskilled people from the UK CAN easily migrate and find work, oddly enough we do. Markets, may I add, where the pay is often less. Its not that we're happier here on the dole. Its that finding unskilled work in the EU is INCREDIBLY difficult.

Putting the blame on some amorphous ""cultural"" preference seems a bit glib when we have some clear structural issues with the limitations to employment oppurtunities the EU provides to the avergage low wage UK worker.

[I'd like to stress the point that brains of teenagers are highly plastic - they're still in the learning phase of their lives](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/26/brain-scans-porn-addicts-sexual-tastes). 

Combine horniness, awkwardness,  and the seeming unavailability of females(**median age of first sex is ~17**, puberty begins at ~13) and lots of artificial stimulation through freely and widely available online pornography and the end result is [young people who can't even have normal sex because it's not 'exciting enough'.](http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/02/24/visualizza_new.html_1583160579.html). I'll quote the article here:

&gt;**After developing their sexuality largely divorced from real-life relationships**, Foresta said, the effects were gradual but devastating.

&gt;""It starts with lower reactions to porn sites, then there is a general drop in libido and in the end it becomes impossible to get an erection"".

&gt;However, the condition is not irreversible.

Very few people find autopsy pictures or science documentaries to be sexually rewarding, so those are unlikely to make a teenager's brain fucked up. Porn however, is something else. It's sexuality divorced from reality, purified. Coca leaves don't make people fucked up, but cocaine might.

People don't need to man up. You can be offended, be hurt and I hope the proper systems are in place to help you deal with it if it causes a big issue for you *but* your emotional state doesn't grant you special powers over the rest of society because;

**A)** your emotional state is completely subjective, what hurts you might not hurt other people and we shouldn't be making laws about things unless we can prove the crime hurts equally, that there is a measurable and reliable outcome from an action. Some people are hurt by words and some people aren't, you can't say that for other crimes, you can't 'man up' and be not all that bothered about being murdered.

**B)** it's entirely possible, due to the hurt being subjective, that you inadvertently hurt someone with words yourself in the future *or* that something you think/say/do/enjoy that's perfectly ok today slowly becomes not ok and you're going to have to concede that you too should end up in a cell because when it wasn't happening to you, you supported it. 

It's happened all throughout history, society tries to silence people who do or say things they just don't like. How many influential preachers and ideas would we not have if the fact they offended some people had been enough to stop saying it?

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"First, I feel like Movember is pointless. The majority of the people I know who grow a moustache during November don't do it to raise money, they do it as an excuse to prove they can. I feel pretty shitty about it because I can't (I have a doctor's appointment booked - I'm 22ffs).

I don't buy into the racism argument particularly, though I appreciate where it is coming from. Whilst facial hair is perceived differently in different cultures, it doesn't have the strong religious and racial connotations that dreadlocks and sari do. Men from across history, of many races and cultures, have grown facial hair for many different reasons. I feel it lacks a specificity to a singular distinct culture. If Kurds, Indians and Mexicans all grow moustaches, despite being of different racial and cultural backgrounds, and it's not offensive to any of the others for them to do so, then I don't see why it's unacceptable for British people to.

I do think that Movember has inclusivity issues on the mentioned body chemistry grounds. The whole idea, to be honest, is ill-conceived, particularly with radiation therapy (as treatment for cancer) famously causing hair loss. Shaving one's head to support people with cancer makes a lot more sense. Anyone can do it, and it implies solidarity and togetherness. 

The gendered aspect of Movember is a thorny topic. Yes, it explicitly excludes women, but then so do Races for Life, and whilst breast cancer in men is rare, it happens. There are doubtless trans women out there who have been unlucky enough to develop testicular cancer too. Society has a deeply ingrained tendency, and an increasingly outdated one, to treat gender and biological sex as though they are biological absolutes. Not only are there huge numbers of trans people out there (so many as 1% of society according to some estimates. That means 900 in a sold-out demographically representative Wembley Stadium), there is an increasing body of evidence that shows that their brain chemistry indicates a measurable difference between their gender and biological sex. There are also far more people born with intersex conditions than most people realize - Germany recently ruled that in these cases doctors should not impose a gender on the newborn child, and other countries may well follow, so expect intersex people to become more visible over the coming years. Trying to divide people based on their body chemistry and biological sex makes a whole host of gratuitous and offensive assumptions. Trying to divide people up by gender makes little sense because it doesn't necessarily relate to body chemistry and biological sex.

I don't know anything about these 'gala parties'. I've never been to one or heard of one being organized near me. However I live in a university town and have seen enough society socials to know that as with any mass costume event, there will always be people who dress offensively and they can't really be deemed representative of a group as a whole.

I would like to see a campaign that is 'focused on deconstructing the strict gender norms that keep so many men suffering silently.' Movember isn't it.

&gt; It would seem that Movember isn't really about âchanging the face of men's healthâ, so much as fetishising facial hair for the entertainment of young men. According to Movemberâs own data, only 43% of those who take part in the campaign reported increased awareness and education regarding the health risks they face. It pays to ask what the other 57% of men thought they were doing.

Can't really argue with that. It's a bad idea that accomplishes little positive. But, as I said, many of its issues are directly paralleled in the similarly gender-segregated Races for Life.

To be honest I don't see why we can't just say 'Let's raise money to help fund cancer research' and dispatch with all the gendered bullshit. Well, I see why it doesn't happen.

* Lung cancer is the biggest killer by far but is often self-inflicted via smoking so it's hard to raise money for. Skin cancer is often similar.

* Breast cancer is highly visible and quite dangerous as cancers go, and campaigns capitalize on the idea that mastectomy robs women of their womanhood. More gender/biological-sex-normative bollocks.

* Testicular cancer is one of the least dangerous, most frequently early-diagnosed and most easily operable, but again there's notions of lost manhood at play.

* Just about the only cancer that is universally, equitably viewed as deadly and unfair is leukaemia, and people would care about it a lot less if it didn't affect kids so much.

The whole situation is ridiculous really. Cancer charity fund-raising is often a racket anyway.",0,1386078512,null,0,false,0,cdshknd,t3_1rzndz,t1_cdshknd,t3_1rzndz,null,1428414437,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You're extremely vulnerable and looking back I can't believe the decisions I made while I was sick.

OP: 'But I *don't want out of my old contract* I just want to move it to a new house'

true,Nemo_Lemonjello,smith,Smith,"Really, any of the first episodes following a regeneration is a good jumping on point, what follows is a quick, (almost)spoiler free analysis of the Doctor's first seven incarnations. Wall of text to follow.

The first Doctor has a bit of [Early Installment Weirdness](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness), In that the original conceptualization of the show was an educational program for children, with The Doctor being a foil for his companions, who were meant to be the stars.

The second Doctor came about do to William Hartnell's failing health, and the need to replace the actor who played the Doctor. Patrick Troughton set the precedent for a new Doctor being a departure from the precious one, while still keeping certain elements in place. Often refered to as a Cosmic Hobo, and one of my favorites, I highly recommend  watching his episodes.

The third Doctor was a James Bond like figure using Venusian Karate/Aikido and enjoying vehicle chase sequences. Of course, he was still the Doctor and reminded us of that in his first Serial [Spearhead from space](#s ""by escaping an abduction attempt in a wheelchair"")

The fourth Doctor had the longest tenure of any actor to date, and as such many who grew up watching the series think of him first when they picture the Doctor. He also spent quite a bit of time on Gallifrey itself. Fun fact:Douglas Adams worked on the show and wrote several scripts during the Tom Bakers tenure.

The fifth Doctor has been a bit maligned by the fandom as meek and somewhat ineffectual, though it's worth noting that David Tennant(the 10th Doctor) says Peter Davison is his favorite Doctor. The meekness comes from the natural departure from his predecessor who frequently showcased his superior Time Lord intellect by quickly solving many problems.

The sixth Doctor swung the pendulam very far in the other direction, and is seen by many as a jerk, although Colin Baker can hardly be blamed for poor scriptwritting. It's been said that his Regeneration Trauma was particularly rough this time, and that the Doctor was a bit disturbed and scarred by the process, but the show failed to really explain that. The Big Finish Audio Plays have redeemed the sixth Doctor immensely, so much so that he was voted favorite audio Doctor by the fans.

The seventh Doctor has a mixed reaction from the fans, low ratings eventually led to the shows cancellation, but now it has a cult following. He was a clown, but was slowly revealed to be a *sad* clown
and could also be quite the manipulative bastard at times. He was fond of having plans, though invariably thing would go wrong, and he would have to adjust.""Remberance of the Daleks"" is a prime example of this, and also contains the scene which inspired the creation of The Crowning Moment of Awesome Subpage of the TVTropes website,though you shouldn't go there.

If we grouped together a few different schools with varied Ofsted ratings in a smallish geographical area and then randomly allocated children across that patch to those schools we might find they begin to level out over time, because richer, better educated and more educationally-oriented parents would be keen to see all the schools in their area upped their game and particularly whichever school their child ended up in.

true,barejokez,null,null,"a few people have suggested spending this on something worthwhile - knowledge, or driving lessons.  that is a good suggestion, and one you should consider.

however, i will take a different approach just to throw open the discussion.  Â£350 is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things - even if you double it (or more), it won't represent much more than return flights to somewhere nice.  But it may well represent something more to you - saving any amount of money (before you are even a legal adult) is not easy for some people and should be applauded whatever the amount.  

Personally, i would consider keeping the money in an account and adding to it when possible (while still enjoying your life).  The interest you earn won't make much difference, but if you add Â£25 per month your savings will double in a little over a year.  it can be very satisfying to see your efforts accumulate and go from being the equivalent of cheap flights to being something more valuable. and one day you might have an opportunity to do something awesome with this money (or be grateful you saved it because you need it for something boring but important). 

regarding the vehicle you invest in - a bank account/ISA would be the most sensible.  however, i will be somewhat controversial here and say that premium bonds may actually be a decent place to put the cash.  the risk (actually more like a certainty) with premium bonds is that you earn no interest, and so inflation will chip away at the value of your investment.  however, 3% interest (which is the most you'll get in a savings account right now) is only about Â£10 a year, so hardly a huge loss.  what you gain with PBs is the very small chance that you will get a fantastic payout.  with Â£350 you could well expect to go your whole life without winning, but the chance exists.

* SALTAIRE - **Don't Tell Titus** has always been a reliant good restaurant for me and my bf, comfortable but people do get dressed up and the staff are very attentive, great variety of food too.

* Bradford City - **The Russian Restaurant** opposite midland hotel, is a real one off the staff cant do enough for you, the food was beautiful, nice to do something different, the atmosphere is very family orientated and the decor is very ornate and you wouldn't feel silly if you were dressed up in there.

true,Skitrel,null,null,"&gt;This isn't true at all. The 'finding holes' in the person's opinions isn't a happy coincidence - the questions were asked in such a way to find those holes.

You are creating an argument against something I did not say. I did not say they're not questions seeking to find holes, I did not say it was a happy coincidence, what I said was that it holds a neutral position, it isn't attempting to make a point but to pose a question such that the other person makes their own realisation of the point.

Your problem is believing you know it all and that what you know is true, while Socrates believed and taught in holding the opposite.

The method is an investigatory tool first, used honestly in order to inquire and expose problems. It doesn't seek to make any points at all, it only seeks to investigate. The other person makes the points themselves upon realisation of the flaws in their thinking.

You lack subtlety, in fact, you're being about as subtle with it as a brick to the face. The problem being that you're carrying your ego, bias and emotion into the discussion.

Step back, pretend you're a scientist investigating something from a completely neutral viewpoint, then ask a person a question. You'll find the question comes out inquisitive, without any point to make, and will give you answers required to further follow the method. Keep in mind to maintain such neutrality else you'll fall to the same errors, allowing the exposed problems to speak for themselves, and allowing the other person to see said exposed problems.

Further, when attempting to expose a problem, try to keep things within the topic.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Our fullbacks are a huge part of prividing width in our attack. Agger is not going to be able to get forward and attack with the kind of impact that Johnson or Enrique (or Flannagan for that matter) has.  I think it's very harsh to drop Flannagan too, he's been quite good barring the Hull match (but everyone was shit so it would be harsh to single him out for that and he was one of only 3 player who looked like they actually cared to try and win with Suarez and Skrtel).  He's a bit shaky defending in 1v1 situations but he reads play pretty well and gets stuck in with no fear when required.  Going forward he's made some smart runs and worked hard to be involved.  He'll be a better attacking asset down the flank than Agger (or Sakho since he gets mentioned for LB a lot as well).  Let the CBs play where they're supposed to play and do what they do best.  That said I wouldn't mind seeing Johnson play at LB and Flanno at RB.  Johnson is fine on either side and I think Flannagan is a touch more comfortable on the right.

Our midfield already gets walked through like it doesn't exist on a regular basis when those 3 play together as well.  It just isn't working.  I seriously think Allen is the temporary fix until we can bring in a real athletic defensive midfielder (like Bender or Matic... someone who defends well and really gets about the pitch but isn't wasted with the ball at his feet) to partner Lucas.  Allen and Lucas did really well against Everton and things didn't get shitty for us until after Allen was subbed off.  He covers the blind side very well for Lucas and takes a lot of defensive responsibility away from Gerrard which is important now since he doesn't really do well recovering timely these days.  People like to lynch Allen for the miss against Everton but aside from that one touch he played a good match and things became noticeably bad for us through the middle as soon as he was hauled off.  I think a midfield 3 of Lucas and Allen with Gerrard in front of them will work well.  Gerrard just gets a free role similar to Pirlo for Juve.  Obviously Lucas and Allen are not even close to the likes of Vidal and Pogba but the idea is similar in that both of them together can provide the grit and resolve to battle it out and hold the midfield while Gerrard is the architect of our transitions and attacks.  

I wouldn't mind seeing Alberto in there at Henderson's expense though, he's fallen off a little bit lately.  I don't think Alberto is any kind of solution for us at this stage but he's a promising young player who could do with some minutes and he's a bit more creative going forward than Hendo, albeit at the expense of Henderson's tireless work rate.  He's been solid in his cameo appearances so far and I wouldn't mind seeing how he does with a solid 60-70 minutes to try and impose himself on a match.",0,1386083425,null,0,false,0,cdsiyrm,t3_1rz8ir,t1_cdsiyrm,t3_1rz8ir,null,1428413788,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
true,Alex1609,null,null,"Fair enough, football is inherently transitive and very few things seem to last for long. A quick look over the past few years shows how variable it can be. Not so long ago Juventus were in Serie B, Man City in League One, PSG threatened by relegation &amp; Monaco struggling in Ligue 2!

&gt;Our squad lacks depth, another midfielder and a few back up players and top 4 is easily attainable

Top 4 isn't easily attainable for any team, just ask Tottenham (lol). 

I reckon if you can get your hands on a single creative player like Cabaye or Barkley then you would be in a much stronger position. Having the opportunity to rotate Cabaye with Gerrard/Allen/Lucas would give you much better depth and a significant boost in quality. 

Moses needs to be shown the door, and you need to bring in a strong wide player that can provide good service to Suarez. Someone like Arda Turan would be perfect, though whether he is attainable is a different matter. 

As for this...

&gt;Why are you here alex...you don't like liverpool so you here can't be good!

My feelings about Liverpool have changed somewhat since the Summer! Unexpectedly I've found myself enjoying Liverpool's surge in form as it's led directly to an increase in the misery of Man Utd fans. Still feel a bit miffed about the Suarez saga, but with Giroud in good form and the signing of Ozil it's been swiftly swept under the carpet.

1. People who are attracted to children or have a sex addition are seriously damaging themselves (addition) or others (children) by following through with their urges, so they are offered therapy. Homosexual sex (practiced safely) does not damage a person or others.

2. People who are attracted to children or have a sex addiction have therapy to remove those urges. Gay people do not have therapy to remove their urges, they instead have /conversion/ therapy (to change it to straight attraction). This is pretty much impossible, you can repress sexuality but not just change it. Making that promise will just damage people in the long run.

3. Most importantly, having an offer to cure something suggests it's wrong. Going around announcing it's wrong to be gay is like going around suggesting it's wrong to be asian.

If I did know, then I'd be working on the preceding invention/company so I can take advantage of it when it comes. Who in 1920 saw millions of people working in IT within 80 years? Who in the 1400s saw people working in factories? Who in 1945 saw man walking on the moon in about two decades? The beauty of real invention and innovation is that no one sees it coming. 

Given history's evidence, which shows us consistently carving out a purpose for ourselves, despite advancements in technology, it is the reasonable position to assume that we will be able to do that again. History's evidence also shows us that most if not all people were completely ignorant of what the job markets would be like in the future. People who would be working in IT grew up without really understanding what a computer was. 

So with history's evidence, the reasonable intelligent assumptions are:

1) Technology will advance. Whether this will be at an ever increasing rate remains to be seen, it may well stagnate. 

2) We will carve ourselves a purpose. We've done so with every technological leap forward, so we should be able to do it again. 

3) It is very unlikely that until a few years before, we will be able to tell what the future job markets hold. Even the most intelligent people will get it wrong (notable evidence - the famous thomas watson quote suggesting there would only ever be 5 computers in the world, McKinsey consulting firm telling AT&amp;T in 1985 that the cellular phone market would remain niche, etc).

So, it is reasonable to assume we will still largely be employed, we won't know what we will be doing yet, but it will probably be something to do with technology.

Good cycling infrastructure costs considerably less than roads, and actually generates money ~~apposed~~ opposed to loosing money for each mile driven (due to many social, economical reasons)

And when you look at the figures (this is off the top of my head based on a few articles)  the cost per mile of motorway covers literally miles of cycleway.

I would consider the US wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam to be incredibly misguided and borderline heinous, not to mention all the cloak and dagger efforts of the US to change the leaders of other nations to suit their needs (especially in central and south Americas). They don't always invade, they prefer to control in secret.

I'm going to keep my mouth shut about Tibet, nothing useful ever comes out of a discussion about that. Aside from that controversial one, I'm not aware of any other case of China attempting to extend their boundaries. If you're talking about DiaoYu islands, both sides maintain that it was *always* part of their boundaries (and both sides are frankly full of shit, they just want the oil). Chinese is acting like a child with their stupid air defence zone, but they're no more selfish about this than the Japanese.

A superpower should participate in wars to help stop atrocities and help the morally right people.

But I would prefer a super power that doesn't throw its weight around with such ""selective morality"" like the US. They don't participate in wars because it is ""right"". They participate as and when they see a benefit for them in it.

Everyone was involved in the world wars, the Chinese people arguable much more so than anyone in the US. The first gulf war, the US were simply protecting their oil supplying ally.

Where was the ""world's super power"" during the genocides in Serbia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Sudan? The UN was impotent as usual thanks to it having to pander to all the security council members (including both the US and China, both countries happy to veto any action they found inconvenient). But we've seen from the other US led wars that they don't need UN approval to begin unilateral action. So why didn't they step in in any of those cases? Because there was no upshot for America in helping any of those countries.

China is no utopia and the communist party ruling the world at the reins of a lone Chinese super power would be terrible. But let's not labour under any illusions that the US have been any better. They are very charismatic and they dress up their actions very well for the public with things like ""freedom"" and ""justice"", but they're just as self-serving as any other country.

But there still was plenty of work left to humans because it required a little bit more than just a simple repetitive movement. It required object recognition, navigational abilities, decision making and at least 3 degrees of freedom of movement.

Now it all changing. Now there will be no field of activity left untouched. Computers are coming. And they will displace us from everywhere. They already do. Why?

true,AnathemaMaranatha,dalek,Dalek,"Bon voyage, little piece of my brain. Well, if it's leaving home to go out in the world, somebody will want to know what happened next.

Here's the scene: There is a room in a small out-building on the campus of a VA hospital in a small city in the high desert, western US. Windows on two sides. Late afternoon bright sunshine. 

A dated but clean room, cleared out to accommodate a large ovate table, folding chairs, some side furniture, one with a coffee pot and white foam cups. Bulletin boards with dated VA memos and some encouraging posters. Everything is painted VA green, linoleum floor.

Seven or eight guys are seated around the table, some in civvies, some in the striped bathrobes and blue pajamas they make you wear for the first week of in-patient treatment. No-longer-hung-up guy is standing at one end of the table looking angry (he was always willing to fight biker-guy) and a little bit hurt. He thought we'd be happy for him.

Biker-guy is seated, and the moderator, Laurel, is standing behind him with her hands on his back. I'm seated to the left, double face palmed, feeling a variety of things. For one, I am noticing Laurel with her hands on biker-guy, and (I'm just realizing this as I write) I am a little jealous. Dumb. She can't possibly realize the impact her touch would have on any one of us. Or maybe she does. She can't help being pretty. She's a pro. She's using the tools at hand to help. Huh.

But back to me. Part of me wants to go kiss that Safeway clerk - or punch her in the snoot - kinda hard to tell. Part of me is with biker-guy, *You gotta be fucking kidding me! A Safeway clerk cracks yer head open?* Part of me is angry. Part of me is happy for Hung-up guy. Part of me is happy for *me*. What? Why is that?

I'm guessing pretty much the same thing was being felt around the table.

*I* am happy at Hung-up guy's news? Ah. It looks like he found a way out. There's light. Aaaand I'm afraid of the light. Right away, right then and there in that brightly lit room. Hung-up guy's light is like a torch in a dungeon. I'm in the loony bin. All his spark does illuminate the shithole I've put myself into, how much weight I've piled on top of myself, how there is no way out, and whatever light there is cannot last.

I've been on meds for about ten days. I amaze myself. I don't crash. I shrug it off, get ready for the next round. I've got someplace to go. I'm leaving this place. Didn't know I could do that, feel that way. This is new.

This all happens in a flash. I look around the table. I can see some guys not doing as well as I am. They're crashing. *Happiness hurts.* Happiness reminds you of all you have to be unhappy about.

Then I look up at Laurel, then at Hung-up guy and his anger and confusion dovetails perfectly with my idiot jealousy, and the whole thing becomes funny. I laughed and the guy next to me laughed too and biker-guy laughed and Hung-up guy thought we were laughing at *him*, thought we were his *friends* and then *everybody* started laughing because it was just too crazy and horrible and stupid not to laugh. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

When we added it all up, we informed Hung-up guy that we were happy for him. Just had to think about it a bit. We were all happy, even if it hurt. It was a good day.

His entire contribution in the second half was two successful tackles, and he looked visibly tired. In 65 minutes Lennon had 25 touches (joint-lowest of players who started, along with Soldado), in 25 minutes Townsend had 17 touches.
After coming on, Townsend made seven (out of eight) successful passes, attempted three crosses, won two fouls (one of which saw Evra yellow carded), made a successful tackle and was a whisker away from converting a Walker cross.
While Lennon played zero passes in the first 20 minutes of the second half, Chadli (the player most would have preferred to have come off?) played seven passes, won an aerial duel and made a clearance deep in our own half during the same period.""",0,1386087857,null,0,false,0,cdsklbh,t3_1rwvks,t1_cdsklbh,t3_1rwvks,null,1428413017,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Welp.

&gt; Coming out as being gay in some countries probably no different to coming out and saying you like kids at a Ford Transit convention.

The point is that people shouldn't feel they are ""saying you like kids at a Ford Transit convention"" when they come out; it's better to encourage acceptance of LGBT in society so people do not feel a need to resent themselves and change who they are.

This isn't *just* about saying ""going through this 'treatment' won't work and will fuck you up"", it's about saying ""you don't need to go through this, because you're awesome the way you are"". Sexuality isn't black and white, nor cut and dry; it's not a yeast infection where two tablets will take it away. I'm bi-sexual; do I take half a dose? Can my friend use the same treatment to turn herself lesbian because all men are arseholes? Several of my male, hetrosexual friends would jump at the chance to be gay, just because relationships would be wildly more awesome - but that's just not where their attraction lays.

If, just if, there was thing that could make somebody hetrosexual, would some people want it? Sure. Would people cry fowl of it? Sure; just like some in the deaf community discourage the use of implants to restore hearing - however, there is no implant for sexuality; sexuality just *is* and the pressure to want to change sexuality comes externally and is felt internally - not the other way round. 

Lets get rid of the the prejudice and discrimination and stigma and the stereotypes and then sure, if you still want to give changing your sexuality a whirl, go right ahead; in the mean time though, until that implant is made, I'd rather prevent vulnerable, confused and distressed adults from fucking themselves up because who they are and who they love matters to people that aren't them.

I've tried multiple times, but they're just very difficult to sit through. It's not that the stories are bad (""City of Death"" was an awesome one), nor is it because the Doctors are older and less ""actiony"" (I don't complain about that, but I've heard some people do), nor is it because of the low budget hokieness of it all (...even though it tests my suspension of disbelief at times). 

It's not because of that.

It's because of the pacing. 

In an era of instant gratification and Netflix binge-watching, having a single story span more than two episodes is taxing and, quite frankly, kind of irritating. This is especially true when a lot of it is unnecessary padding. 

I mentioned ""City of Death"" being great before, so I'm going to bash it now. About 70% (probably exaggerating) of the first episode is Tom Baker and Lalla Ward walking around Paris to a soundtrack. I understand that they probably wanted to get their budget's worth, but NOTHING HAPPENS. The entire story of ""City of Death"" could've been trimmed down to a single 45 minute episode (NuWho Style) and nothing of value would be lost. It would've been a tighter, more efficient story without the nightmare of tedious pacing.

I accept that things were different back then and when you're viewing week to week on the edge of your seat. But it doesn't hold up as well anymore. The time-commitment/story-value ratio is too high, particularly given that there are several places in these stories that could be easily cut.

The difference is, it's clear what you are getting with a Mobile phone contract. You are getting the phone, with a retail price in the hundreds of pounds. With some phone providers, they split the cost of the handset and the cost of the service, so if you cancel you are only liable for the remaining cost of the handset, not the costs associated with the service you are no longer using.

Installation fee, related maintenance costs, line rental, possible router rent charge (Assuming the ISP is renting equipment from BT and does not provide their own like Virgin Media). How much of that will the ISP incur after a contract cancellation? Just the initial installation fee, which is apparently around Â£90. I think it's outrageous to charge the full Â£480 when up to Â£390 is attributed to costs associated with the service that they will no longer have to provide. Unless they have to continue paying line rental etc. on OPs behalf (Very doubtful), they are ripping him off. It's an unfair contract term in my opinion, and he should definitely contact OFCOM and the Office of Fair Trading to see if anything can be done about it.

I would advise OP move to a different ISP if you have to go above their heads to resolve the issue. ",0,1386088832,null,0,1386089119,0,cdskzto,t3_1rzntm,t1_cdskzto,t1_cdshs80,null,1428412829,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,adrycook,null,null,"The proposed loan move of Alvaro Morata to Arsenal is the latest insult in what is proving to be a very one-sided âspecial relationshipâ between Tottenham and Real Madrid.

Striker Morata, 21, is a fringe player at Real but is highly rated enough to have won a dozen U21 caps for a junior national side that would beat most senior outfits.


Having come through the youth set-up at his hometown club, Morata is expected to sign a six-month loan deal at Arsenal, where he will play back-up to Olivier Giroud.


On the surface of things it is a deal that suits both parties, although it remains to be seen if he will earn many more starts at the Emirates, where Giroud is in fantastic form and Theo Walcott is returning from injury.


However it is another infuriating episode in the tragi-comedy that is Realâs so-called âstrategic partnershipâ with Spurs.


This purported relationship was unveiled after Real completed their long-running chase of Croatia playmaker Luka Modric, who moved to the Bernabeu from Spurs in the summer of 2012.


That transfer saga irritated Spurs, who had to fend off relatively low bids accompanied by Realâs classic tapping-up strategy, employed whenever a high-profile player is targeted.


So the announcement of a formal affiliation softened the blow of Modricâs exit, with Spurs fans led to believe their club would get first option on loans and other outgoing transfers.


But what exactly did this âpartnershipâ entail? In announcing the deal, Spurs said it was regarding cooperation ""in respect of players, coaching, best practices and commercial relationships"".


No more detail was given. Seems pretty unspecific to me.
One year later, in the days following the Bale and Ozil transfers, Spurs fans had launched a petition demanding the relationship be ended. And now, less than 18 months after the deal was signed, things have managed to get worse.


Rather predictably, much of Spursâ ire revolves around the protracted and painful exit of Gareth Bale, who eventually joined Madrid for something in the region of Â£86 million, depending on who you believe.


Bale, Spursâ best player and probably the stand-out attacker in English football for two seasons prior to his departure, was promised the world and rather publicly courted by a shameless Real, from club president down to reserve left-back.


Granted, Spurs got good money for the Wales winger, but the whole affair left a sour taste in the mouth, one which still lingers as the North London club struggle to find their feet with their new-look team.


Salt was rubbed into the wounds within hours of Baleâs transfer, as Real Madrid recouped some of the money by selling Mesut Ozil to Spursâ biggest rivals Arsenal.
Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was reportedly furious with Real counterpart Florentino Perez, furious because Spurs were not even notified of the deal, let alone given the first option their partner status may well entail.


Levy was allegedly angered that Perez apparently kept the deal a total secret until after the Bale capture was completed, that his team was weakened and that of his rivalsâ strengthened in a single motion.


That prompted Spurs fans to make their initial complaint â and the evidence appears to justify their anger.

Even feeder clubs get more than Spurs from this relationship â at least they get to loan the parent clubâs best youngsters. So far not one Real Madrid player has moved to Spurs in any capacity â the closest to that has been misfiring striker Roberto Soldado, a product of Realâs youth system but bought from Valencia.


In addition to Ozilâs move to Arsenal, Nuri Sahin joined Dortmund on loan this summer, Kaka returned to Milan, while Gonzalo Higuain, Jose Callejon and Raul Albiol all moved to Napoli.


That so many of these deals bypassed Spurs hints that this âstrategic partnershipâ has no legal basis, or that certainly it is very flexible. Otherwise surely Spurs would be due punitive compensation for any transfer they do not authorise? Clearly there is no firm first option.


If Morata does sign for Arsenal it will be Perezâs final âup-yoursâ to Levy. Perhaps the Bale money was deemed sufficient a sweetener by Real. Certainly it all seems rather one-way.",0,1386089183,null,0,false,0,cdsl537,t3_1rzz6i,t1_cdsl537,t1_cdsl2dn,null,1428412761,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

Now these are extreme circumstances and up until very recently I've always supported gun control in Britain but as the tyranny of government overextends it's reach time after time I have to wonder if the Americans have it better with the right to bear arms.

It's not a 'wish' to be someone of the opposite sex, it's a belief that you already are that sex and your body is simply wrong. Brains differ with sex, and there is sufficient evidence (gathered through autopsies of transgender individuals) that, yes, sometimes a brain that has developed in the manner of one sex is found in the body of the opposite sex.

Imagine if you believed you had one set of genitals, your brain told you - for instance - that you have a penis, yet you look down and discover you don't. That's a trick that a trans person's own brain plays on them constantly, and it's pretty disconcerting.

So, if a child does seem to be trans - and that is diagnosed not by them 'wishing' they were a certain gender, but by feeling and acting in a way that is understood to be Gender Identity Disorder by an NHS counsellor at one of the several gender clinics in the UK - then they can get medication to delay puberty (for instance) until they come to a firm decision on what gender they are, and whether they wish to go through hormone therapy and / or gender reassignment surgery.",0,1386089526,null,0,false,0,cdslabh,t3_1rzs72,t1_cdslabh,t1_cdskzcx,null,1428412693,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

From http://bustedhalo.com/questionbox/what-did-jesus-have-to-say-about-homosexuality

If you were to read all four gospels thoroughly in search of Jesusâ teachings on homosexuality it would be a futile endeavor. Not only would you come to the end of the gospels without finding anything attributed to Jesus on the subject, you wouldnât even find a single reference to the issue in any context.

In fact, there are only a handful of references to homosexuality in the entire Bible, but they are found in the Old Testament and Paulâs writings. (To put it in perspective, while there are only seven references to homosexuality, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of references to economic justice and the laws governing the accumulation and distribution of wealth.)

Jesusâ silence on the subject suggests that an issue which can be controversial and/or fraught with emotion these days was simply not a central issue in his lifetime 2,000 years ago in the land of Palestine.

The thing that I really dislike about it though is honestly I don't think anyone who hasn't watched most of the classics should be making theories. They're missing almost 30 years of information. Some of the theories I read just make me smack myself and think are you really a fan? 

This has nothing to do with watching the classics really, but the instant gratification attitude lends itself to missing things in the new series and then arguing about plot lines, such as the whole Gallifrey being time locked before and the 9th and 10th's runs being retconned. 

The scene where we have the 3 doctors locked in the tower of London and none of them checked the door because it ""should have been locked"" seems like a BIG metaphor to the time war. The doctor thought it was time locked, but it never checked because of his guilt. If you aren't used to how little things like that were hidden all over the classic series, you tend to miss them in the new series.The writers were all fans of the classic series and use it in the new series more than you think, but you have to have the history to be able to understand just how intricate some things can be in the Who mythology.

true,_workaccount,null,null,"&gt;I agree that people should be able to feel accepted for who they are but I would liken that telling a starving child in Africa that they shouldn't have to starve to death. 

But they shouldn't have to starve to death and there are people who work tirelessly, doing everything they can to prevent that happening. 

&gt;It's easy to say but the reality might be very different for the individual which leads me to think that maybe there are some people who might actually want to change their sexuality

You're right, people do want to change their sexuality - that's the problem - the individual that feels they *need* to change their sexuality and that's basically *wrong*; they've been told that being LGBT is wrong and is against God/Nature/Humanity/etc. and none of those is true. 

LGBT folks don't hate themselves by default, we wouldn't know any different until otherwise told that we're *dirty faggots*, that's the external cause that creates internal loathing. Giraffes (who are ""exceptionally homosexual"") don't care; they don't know the difference because it just *is* and they just *do*. We should all be more like giraffes, quite frankly.

You likened above to plastic surgery - lets say you're married with somebody you find attractive; you love everything about them, they're awesome and one day they tell you that they want to have a breast implants. Do they want implants for practical reasons? Well, maybe they might want the back pain and the ill-fitting bras - but most time, it's to 'cure' an insecurity that they feel they don't feel attractive.

Now, you find her attractive, you know (reluctantly) that your mates have commented several times on how attractive she is - her insecurity is without foundation; she is attractive, but Desperate Housewives, Vogue, OK! have all convinced her that she is not adequate the way she is because she does not have D cups. 

You might not to forbid her from doing it, despite knowing that her opinion is flawed and incorrect, but surely; you're going to at least try to reassure her that you find her perfect the way she is, without any need to change herself. She's beautiful and fuck anybody else that disagrees because it's none of their god-damn business. 

Despite trying to reassure her, she might get the surgery anyway - that's going to happen; she's bias against herself. You can't pin her down and stop her from doing it - she's an adult - but you're sure as shit going to make a point against it, because by letting it happen without resistance you are - 

* Agreeing that her B cups are unsatisfactory
* Enabling her insecurity about not being attractive
* Encouraging an industry who exploits weakness and vulnerability
* Paying somebody who profits from that insecurity
* Allowing attraction to be defined by people who don't matter.

Now imagine that instead of getting an implant, she's just going to be shouted at, repeatedly, that she has bigger boobs and that she's a disgusting failure if her boobs haven't grown by the end of the day. If they don't grow, she may as well just kill herself, right there on the spot. There are no implants or augmentations, just by sheer willpower, she will be expected to make them grow herself; we all know how ridiculous that notion is and by the same extent, that's how ridiculous 'gay cures' are, but people will still try; it's not the individuals fault, it's the fault of the dickheads around them; it's those people that are to blame and that should be stopped, not the victims of a flawed society.

So I'm all up for making a big deal about this, not because it'll stop everyone from trying it because it'll let people who are fucked up about their sexuality know that they're fine, there's nothing wrong with them, they're not sick and certainly don't *need* to be cured. We are not broken. If we just sit back, we're agreeing that your wifes tits are shit - when clearly, they're fabulous.

Ba seemed to do well holding up play and using his frame to hold onto the ball.

On the Oscar goal in that game when Ba got the assist it made me think that maybe there is a dynamic there where we can use Oscar's goal scoring ability more instead of wishing he would play like Mata and use Ba's frame to build something for Oscar to work with.

true,Lord_Binky,null,null,"I never had any particular problems with getting into Classic Who because I have been a fan of bad, schlocky movies. Grew up on Godzilla for one thing. That eventually lead to being an MST3K fan as well. So the cheap, outdated effects didn't phase me, allowing me to enjoy the stories it offered. However, I think that there are more differences. Thing is, I believe that there are fewer differences than it would seem, but they are sharp enough to make them feel very different.

First are the visual and special effects. If Classic Who was more up to the visual standards like The Twilight Zone/The Outer Limits in its early years, or Star Trek a little later on, or Star Trek:TNG by the end of its run, I think more New series fans would give it a shot and like it for what it is. The reality is that those shows all had better budgets and effects. People complain about Star Trek looking cheap and hokey, but that show looks ritsy compared to Classic Doctor Who. New Who's superior production values can hide flaws in the script with a little glamour where it would be bare in Classic Who.

Then there is the pacing. Classic DW was all about cheap production, so it made fiscal sense to produce a half dozen stories and split them up across half the year. The kids will still eat it up. New DW has a better budget and modern technology and both only get better with every season (or so it would seem). Classic Who was prone to filler while New Who can be prone to rush its plots. The best paced New Who stuff, to me, is any time it runs for an hour or more. I'm not saying those are better stories, but they frequently have better pacing. Imagine if every episode was as long as The Day of the Doctor or a Christmas special. I think the show would be better for it.

The last major difference is tone. Classic Doctor Who has a more frank approach to presentation where New Who is far more sentimental. Much of that comes from the music. Classic Who music is usually sporadic and cheap sounding, but it let's you arrive to your own conclusions. New Who music is omnipresent and manipulative like a laughtrack, but far better sounding all the same.

The tone is also in the writing and the acting. Someone else remarked that Classic Who is like a play and I agree. The actors feel more like they are on stage and use an appropriate acting style for that, which is to say frequently inappropriate for television. New Who has acting more appropriate for television and more modern at that. Writing-wise, Classic Who had to write to its strengths. That means conforming to low budgets and the ""film outside, video inside"" approach, which also means three camera setup and single camera at different times. New Who is entirely single camera which lends itself to a certain consistency.

So all in all, I think that the main differences are production values, pacing, and tone. These are ""dials"" in a manner of speaking. They can be changed, but the subject matter, plots, characters, that stuff is generally consistent between the two and that's what counts to me. They are superficial differences, but they are individually sharp and add to a still faster superficial difference that requires a certain sensibility or conditioningto like.

On an objective level, New Who is better in every technical way. This is simply beyond argument. Subjectively though, it must go to the judges, which means you and me. I like both, but I understand that stage-style acting on television, less sentimentality, more bare and cheap production values, etc can be a turn-off to a New Who fan. I don't force it on them. I let them ask me if they're curious.

Besides, I prefer Big Finish on the whole. ;)",0,1386091760,null,0,1386131722,0,cdsm97z,t3_1rzpen,t1_cdsm97z,t3_1rzpen,null,1428412240,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

OpenReach costs are for Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) providers and only cover the line from the end user's property to the nearest BT exchange. Beyond that, it is up to the ISP to transport the connection from the BT exchange to their core network (normally in Manchester or London), which adds a significant cost on top of the local loop.

Zen have only unbundled four BT exchanges (of the ~5600 in the UK) in and around Manchester (and even then I'm not sure if they offer GEA-FTTC products from these four), so for properties located anywhere else they are going to be selling a connection provided by BT Wholesale, which not only covers the local loop, but also the national transport and so will be significantly more expensive for them.

Additionally, Ofcom won't accept an individual complaint about a provider, you will need to go to the appointed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service for the communications provider. In the case of Zen, this is the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS).

Normally you will need to make a formal complaint to the communications provider, wait for them to investigate it fully (this could take several weeks) and then send you their final position in writing.

But watching the classic series is a labor of love for *Doctor Who*. It'd be like someone not reading the early *Harry Potter* novels because they are different from the style of the books after *Goblet of Fire*. If you really want to appreciate everything *Doctor Who* has to offer - beyond the Time War, beyond River Song, beyond fezzes and sexy TARDISes - then choosing *not* to watch the classic stories because they're old and slow and different is not an excuse. 

If an entire generation can get through reading *The Lord of the Rings*, they can watch classic *Doctor Who*. 

Besides, no one can say a story like *The Caves of Androzani* has any of those problems. Or *The Talons of Weng-Chiang*, *Remembrance of the Daleks*, *The Curse of Fenric*, *The Ambassadors of Death*, etc.

I take issue with people who say that the classic series is not as good as the modern series, or that it's not as important. The idea that the classic series is 'optional' is so completely wrong, it staggers the belief. There is no idiot out there who says that you *have* to watch every single story, but the idiot is you if you think that your *Doctor Who* experience is complete without *Genesis of the Daleks* or *Earthshock*.

When somebody is offered elocution lessons to sound different, it's rarely offered as a ""high pitch cure"" or ""northern drawl cure"". If it was, that would also be offensive and suggest that to have a high pitch or northern drawl is wrong. I hope you can agree the word ""cure"" shouldn't be used.  
NB: I am aware that there are high pitch cures, but this is when the pitch of voice is damaging the vocal chords; we're back to it being a cure for something which causes damage.

We also shouldn't remove this from the larger context that it exists in. Our bubble isn't the world, and you have to bear in mind that gay people are still very persecuted. If a gay person steps in the wrong country, they can legally be killed for being gay. This is something pretty unique to being gay; it's accepted in some parts of the world while being completely unacceptable in others.  
I think it's because it's in such a precarious position that we try and protect it, because it'd be very easy for somebody to fall under the mistaken belief that being gay is wrong. We understand how easy it'd be to fall into that assumption, and we want to help these vulnerable people instead of letting them be damaged by non-scientific ""cures"".

Would it be okay if we just didn't call it a ""cure"" then? There are things people might want to change, which doesn't necessarily mean what they were before is bad (e.g. female-&gt;male sex reassignment doesn't mean it's wrong to be male, just that this particular person is undergoing that transition). Would it be okay to have therapy to suppress all homosexual urges and become asexual?  
Maybe, but it shouldn't be done by a 'conference' or through a religious group. It should be done through a professional therapist with a series of 1-1 sessions.

Quite honestly that's all we could really expect from the relationship when you think about it.  Real is the richest team on the planet, aside from buying players from us what benefit would they get from a true partnership (where the benefit goes both ways)?....They never have a shortage of places to send their players on loan.  They buy huge name players, if those players don't work out (Kaka for example) they are still above the price/salary that we would pay.  From a marketing standpoint there isn't a huge amount of impact marketing with Spurs could have compared to what they already do.  There isn't much benefit from Real being partnered with us outside of Real getting something like right of first refusal on our players.

I think the ""partnership"" tag was a poor choice to be tagged on the relationship between Spurs and Real as it was never going to be a true ""partnership"" that would benefit the team on the pitch....it was always going to be an agreement where we would try to glean what we could from their business model and youth academy. In exchange we would be more forgiving in some of our dealings.

Not what I'm saying.

&gt;Plenty of trans people had no ability to express their gender identity as children, and denying them that didn't make them any less trans.

Indeed, it of course wouldn't because being trans is at least in part a neurological issue.

I'm not denying what evidence there is, I agree there exists limited evidence that certain stimuli affect trans people in a way which creates a statistical notably difference between them and people of their gender who are not trans, with the effect generally but not always being more similar to their identified gender than would be found in non-trans people.

The kid does not believe he's an elf. If he really thought he was a fictional creature that would be one issues, this is not the same.

So because you think someone identifying as something is ridiculous you refuse to accept that it's possible, or what? How do you pick which classes of things people get to identify as and which they don't? Do you just choose based on what you agree with, or what's already become big enough and accepted enough to have been studied?

&gt;Trans people exist. Being trans is not a thing people choose, it's just part of natural variation. Have you never heard of intersex people? Genetic chimeras? The fact is that there is ample evidence. Try /r/transeducate[1] Your stance is based on ignorance.

Yes, I know. I'm not the one claiming that people aren't allowed their identity, you are.

I have heard of intersex people, yes, even known someone who talked about it a great deal. I don't see what affect that has on our discussion though. It provides no evidence for the validity of self-identification or justification for your arbitrary categories of acceptability in the subject.

My stance is not based on ignorance, and as I said I've read a reasonable number of studies on the neurological basis of transsexualism along with studies which have looked at stimuli based responses, further to that I've explored both the philosophical side of it and the ethical. I know plenty on this issue.

true,satanspanties,null,null,"Technically yes. However, that doesn't necessarily mean you get money going into your account in weeks you don't work.

It's relatively common for people on zero hour contracts (it's standard practice in the NHS, for example), which may or may not include you, it depends what your week to week contract is on paper, to be paid a 12-and-a-bit (12.6% I think, but I can't remember off the top of my head) percent enhancement for every hour they work, which is representative of the legal minimum holiday allowance of 28 days (4 weeks holiday plus 8 bank holidays) per year for full time workers. However, they must also allow the employee to actually take at least 28 days of holiday.

If this is what's happening, you'll have two lines on your payslip, one for your hourly wage, and one for holiday pay, often abbreviated to WTD (Working Time Directive), with maybe a third line if you have a separate overtime pay.

What this boils down to for me as a zero hours contracted employee is that a) my employer may not deny me time off over Christmas, b) I don't get paid for my time of over Christmas, but c) I have earnt 12% more than other people who do the same job as me for every hour I *have* worked.

WTD pay should be a separate line on your payslip for tax reasons (unless your tax code has been adjusted accordingly), your employer is not allowed to say they've been paying you it all this time.

Personally I bank with Lloyds as a normal consumer with no debt. I get a really good basic level of service and am very happy with them. I have a current account, 2 savings accounts (unused atm) and a credit card (barely used).

I appreciate the high rate of interest on their current account (3%, Â£1k/month income) as this really simplifies my normal bills while maximising interest.

The phones are answered quickly and well with both a national and local number provided (great for those of us on local call packaged landlines). The automatic phone robot is pretty good but generally if I call its because I need to talk to someone.

Their web service is the best major bank one I've personally used. It is simple and clear. The main page shows each account along with most recent few transactions. As stupid as this is to say as a positive, Lloyds actually show you what your interest rate is clearly on each account page.

My in branch experience as a saver and normal bank user I really like their branches. The new scanning cheque machine is excellent and while other banks probably have them as well I still appreciate them.


Lloyds did bugger up my CHAPS or whatever transfer for buying the house but sorted it out quickly and didn't argue returning the fee. I do wish they would stop trying to sell me insurance in branch though. I know it is just what they are trained to do but I really am not interested.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Your position is that otherkin and trans people are the same.

No, lets clarify that because I think you've taken offense and it's making our discussion less productive as a result.

My position is that type of difference (identification as something which ones body doesn't match) is the same in both, and that if we're to accept that this is legitimate in any group of people who do this, then accepting it in only one group of people but rejecting another is arbitrary.

&gt;Your only interest in saying this is to discredit trans 

Except it's not, because I have no interest in discrediting trans people, and furthermore even if I did the very concept of self-identification pretty much makes personal acceptance or rejection on my part irrelevant as to reality. I can't tell anyone that they're not trans anymore than I can tell someone they don't like the colour red and nor would I try to.

&gt;The spill words are that since otherkin can clearly not really be dragons or elves or whatever, the same is therefor true about trans people.

I never said this was about actually *becoming* that which one identifies as, since that's physically impossible in both cases (at least at present) - this is about people identifying as something and society accepting that that person identifies as that thing. You're clearly accepting self-identification in some cases and not others where-as I'm saying that if we as a society are to accept self-identification (something I think we should) then we can't draw arbitrary lines as to what is legitimate to identify and what isn't, as you're suggesting.

It's like you want to allow people to say ""I love red"" but want everyone to think that's totally different from saying ""I love blue"" and that only the former should be treated with any seriousness.",0,1386098783,null,0,false,0,cdspe3q,t3_1rzs72,t1_cdspe3q,t1_cdsp5b7,null,1428410778,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

It's not an illness. There isn't a ""cure"" for being gay any more than there's a ""cure"" for being 6 foot tall.

&gt;and that their existing sexuality may be causing them serious problems in their life which they may which to mitigate by going through some sort of therapy or treatment?

First, there is no ""treatment"" available that works (see previous point) and ""ex-gay therapy"" has been repeatedly shown to make things far worse. If the problems in their life are caused by judgemental people, then the solution is not to try and change the victim of bullying, but to educate the bullies.

&gt;Is it not like someone who's sex obsessed and wants treatment for their addiction?

No. It's nothing like that whatsoever.

true,masterpigg,davison,Davison,"I have a friend on Facebook who is a New Whovian, and after EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, he likes to post a huge rant about how terrible Moffat is.  It is a constant.  I don't even care about that, though - my real problem is that he likes to jerk off Davies during his rant.  I often express agreement with his viewpoints on Moffat, but then I like to give a counter-rant on Davies.  Not that I think Davies did a terrible job as a showrunner, but to show that he wasn't perfect, either.  And besides the whole ""End of Time"" arc (anyone else think it was a completely awful way to end the run of one of the more popular Doctors?), my main complaint with Davies is that unlike Moffat, he completely ignores the very idea that any Doctors came before Nine. Moffat, on the other hand, embraces it.

For all of his faults, I actually like when Moffat throws in cheap fan service for us Classic Who fans.  For instance, the flashbacks while the 11th Doctor chose his tie, or [Impossible Girl Spoiler](#s ""Clara visiting all the previous Doctors""), or the number of subtle throwaway lines referencing classic companions or adventures.  Also, [50th Spoiler](#s ""other than the fact that he completely deserved it, was the addition of Four to the 50th Anniversary episode necessary?  Probably not, but it was AWESOME, even if I had to explain to my wife why it was awesome.  The lineup of Doctors right before the credits was completely unnecessary as well, but again, awesome."")  Other than taking on Classic villains, any reference to Classic Who during Davies' run is generally done in an episode by a writer who is not Davies.

But getting around to the topic of this question is that rather than having an interesting discussion (or even a vigorous debate!), my friend chooses to ignore any such complaints about Davies.  Everything is Rose and Tennant, and you can bet that next week, there will be a new rant about why Moffat sucks and Davies is the only showrunner worth his salt in Doctor Who's entire run.

The fact is, whether or not you liked Moffat or the 50th Anniversary episode, my dad and I both agreed that it was very solid Doctor Who, a series which has had many terrible episodes and many good episodes, many silly moments, and many serious moments, and there is more than just Davies vs. Moffat.

There were notable differences in those who were transgendered compared to those who weren't but it still found that the brains were very much of their birth sex.

The real problem which causes issue time and time again, imo, is that the 'ears' line from *Rose* is pretty clearly a throw-away line. They apparently wanted Eccleston to make some self-referential comment on him being the new incarnation of the Doctor (perhaps to reassure fans the show was a continuation, not a reboot?). But if you look at everything else in the episode and afterwards, it's not consistent with the idea that 9th had just regenerated. The implication is imo clearly that 9th had been around for a time (a century apparently).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Welcome to Doctor Who fandom!

This question has actually been around for many years - as far back as during Peter Davison's time as the Fifth Doctor. It's a valid question - no official explanation exists within the show to exclude the Doctor from being a woman - but it hasn't resulted in the casting of a female Doctor yet.

I think there's a couple of reasons why, and I'll explain.

First of all, there are a couple of regeneration examples that bear mentioning. In *The Doctor's Wife* it's mentioned that the Corsair had been at different points a male, then a female. In *Destiny of the Daleks* Romana ""tries on"" a couple of different bodies during her seemingly voluntary regeneration; including a blue bipedal alien. In *Let's Kill Hitler* River Song can seemingly influence the outcome of regeneration at least to extent as evidenced in the line ""Oh shut up, Dad. I'm focusing on a dress size."" It has never been confirmed, but it seems like the Doctor - as a renegade time lord - is unwilling or unable to influence the outcome of his regenerations to the extent that we've seen other time lords.

Now, to why the Doctor has yet to be female..

In the real world, I generally think that the majority of people aren't yet ready for it. Much like in the real world of politics and social justice, things are often talked about to death before they effect any real change. New Who is only in it's 8th season, and although we're on the verge of casting our fourth Doctor (five if you count John Hurt), not everyone is entirely familiar with the way our main character works. We've had a war survivor, a grief stricken god, a childish action hero, and by all accounts we're about to get a ""snarling beast"". We haven't seen all the aspects of this character in relation to the classic series, so it may benefit the show to reintroduce these aspects before diverging from the path.

In the context of the show, the Doctor has identified as a male for 1200 years (possibly more, we don't even know how old he is). If *he can* influence his regenerations even slightly, maybe he doesn't want to be a woman? It's worth thinking about, at least.

Finally, I have no problem with the Doctor being a woman. I think many people share my opinion. Though, I do have a concern with the reasons behind *why* the Doctor would regenerate into a woman. If the reasoning behind it is basically stunt casting, and to ""shake things up"" I think that is a shallow reason and not worth considering. If it genuinely is out of a pursuit of the best course for the character and the show, then I'm all for it.

After all, females aren't the only 'minority' (I'm using that poorly thought out word to illustrate a point, not because I share that view) to have not been the Doctor yet. The next Doctor could be of non-British descent - ""white"" or otherwise. 

Whatever the case, I want someone who is good for the show and by all accounts Peter Capaldi is the right person for the moment. ",0,1386101390,null,0,false,0,cdsql82,t3_1rvj1u,t1_cdsql82,t3_1rvj1u,null,1428410219,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If you look at the Man U match, this is classic Spurs gestalt: we're playing attacking football well, which is then undermined by our own tragic mistakes, or bad luck. I've only been a fan for about a decade, but it is something I've seen a pattern of. In a way I find it endearing, and in the current situation, it lets me know that we're still Spurs, regardless of the new faces and recent changes.

On the other hand, I do believe that Spurs have a history of being singled out and ridiculed, which is something that really lies at the heart of the ""Yid question"". Arsenal may be rivals, but I've had friends who are gooners who merely banter, and then I've met the racist pricks who have multiple axes to grind. Chelsea and West Ham are just not that far out of this equation.

When r/soccer tries to claim that Spurs aren't met with a particular form of abuse, you often hear the phrases ""too sensitive"", ""persecution complex"", or some other such drivel.

The biggest party we've had in my house was a birthday dinner for someone (which ended at about 10pm), and the houses around where I live seem to be more or less the same - out of my neighbours, there's been no loud parties or anything, sometimes people come back late from clubs, but that's about it. We got graffiti on our alley gate and as a result of that (and people loitering in the back alley), there's big gates being put on the entrances to the alley to stop people getting in.

My house is lovely and I really like it and hope to stay here for a few more years, and we haven't had any problems with anyone around us. The worst we had was a few drunk lads catcalling my housemates as we were walking back from the SU, and the graffiti, as I said before. I know we were pretty lucky with getting seemingly sensible neighbours and everything but still, I can go to sleep just fine at night, my house is good and well looked after, and I have no concerns about any of the people on my road.

Generalising the Holylands is pretty silly - it's a very cheap area to live and yes, that means there's a lot of idiotic students who get drunk and do dangerous and illegal things, but there's also a lot of students who live here because it's cheap and because they don't mind if their neighbours are noisy if it means they have the money to spend on food and utilities. I don't understand the point of getting drunk every night, and I've never thought it was a good idea to destroy things when I was drunk, and I do think a lot of the people around here are idiotic and disrespectful and that the litter and graffiti are atrocious, but I also enjoy living in my house and I would 100% recommend the Holylands to any students who don't have the money to live in a more typical residential area, even if they're not the partying type.",0,1386102193,null,0,false,0,cdsqygh,t3_1rpgfd,t1_cdsqygh,t1_cdqgq1m,null,1428410047,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

For your information after the time of Christopher Clumbus. the Spanish inquisition was hauling lots of gold and silver back from south america. to the tune of 2million pounds per month.
Only the Spanish thought it was bloody clever to build a big ship (known as the Armada). They also declared war on Britain after a row broke out because the Spanish ships refused to allow British ships into the Caribbean areas
This ship was defeated immediately by the good British cunning, and hence forth. they continued to defeat the Spanish fleet in the Caribbean islands.
Guns had already been invented long before this and every strong nation at the time, Dutch, the French and Spain used them without question.

after the defeat of the Spanish. slaves were used in all regions of the world as man power. The good British souls as they were, were forced by no fault of their own to use slaves in order to protect the British isles and your arse!
in fact you would have been eating shit out of a bucket if it wasn't for the great British intelligence.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm not who you replied to, but ""rape culture"" isn't so much a culture that justifies rape as one that belittles rape or ignores it, making it more likely to continue. The fact that you said that it's a ""bullshit sexist term used by feminists"" is denying its existence, and therefore belittling rape. Also, just out of interest, how is it sexist? (serious question, I'm interested as to why you think it is)

It's not just victim blaming, although that is a big part of it, it's things like rape jokes and [""Uni Lad""/Lad Bible stuff](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/sites-like-uni-lad-only-act-to-support-our-everyday-rape-culture-8360109.html) that promote taking advantage of people when they are drunk. I actually do think that article is sexist - it only talks about women being raped due to the context of uni lad only talking about women, so I just want to say that rape culture applies to anything that is belittling the idea of rape or implying it's okay or that certain circumstances [""aren't rape""](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/31/durham-university-rugby-club-rape-drinking-game_n_4181729.html) (""it's not rape if she's wet""/""it's not rape if he's hard""). That also applies to jokes regarding male rape and sexual assault, such as prison rape jokes.

A lot of discussion about rape culture *is* by women, some of whom are probably feminists (note that modern, third wave feminism is simply believing men and women deserve equal rights), but that's because a lot of rape that affects females is by the likes of drunk students who don't realise the girl they're trying to have sex with is unconscious, or that just because a girl has been making out doesn't mean that they want sex. From what I understand, those situations happen less with a man being the victim (although I don't believe there have been any studies into the frequencies of different ""kinds"" of rape in the UK so I can't support it with evidence, sorry). A lot of it seems to be associated with the ""frat-boy"" behaviour in America and then that has translated into the ""lad"" behaviour here, as their ideas glorify having sex with a woman, pretty much regardless of her mental state so long as she's hot. I've personally heard guys boast that they had sex with girls who were black-out drunk, because the girl was hot, completely ignoring the fact that they couldn't give consent if they were unconscious.

I feel that [this article](http://www.iars.org.uk/content/rape-and-sexual-assault-myths-examining-their-prevalence-criminal-justice-system-and-greater) is pretty interesting in terms of ""rape culture"" in terms of court cases, but it also addresses several myths that rape culture proliferates - things like clothing having any influence on whether rape is ""deserved"" and that kind of thing - it talks mainly about Canada but also includes a bit about the UK.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to clarify that rape culture isn't just about victim blaming and justifying rape, it's about anything that makes rape out to be anything other than a serious criminal act, including things that imply rapists are creepy men waiting in alleys or that having sex with a very drunk person is okay (as seen in quite a lot of tv shows and movies). The idea is that if we are proliferating these ideas in media, we're teaching young people that 1) it's okay to do these things because they're ""not rape"" and rape isn't serious anyway (otherwise why would we make jokes about it?) and 2) if it happens to you, it's not rape so you can't do anything about it - both of which are untrue.",0,1386103663,null,0,false,0,cdsrn3r,t3_1rpgfd,t1_cdsrn3r,t1_cdqndw4,null,1428409728,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Kolo has already missed 3 league games this year and had two bad games against Hull and Arsenal. I think he's been a good pick-up and has performed well in general, but he isn't an automatic selection. Sakho and Skrtel have been very good and Agger has been as good as Kolo, I'd say.

Moses was very poor and has not done much aside from his debut and perhaps the game after. He doesn't seem committed or willing to work hard, and I'd say his head's still in London.

Aspas and Allen are both a while away from their good performances for us, so I understand why people aren't standing up and singing their praises yet.

&gt; ISPs almost always overcharge for the 12 month contracts to force people onto longer term deals. 

The very best ISPs (which does include Zen normally) will offer the smallest possible term they can - hence 1 month contracts for ADSL, 12 months for fibre (this is imposed by BT). They do this because they want you to stay with them because they're good, not because you're forced to. It's the large, shitty ISPs that force you into long contracts (e.g. Sky, TalkTalk, BT, Virgin)

&gt; Then they catch you with hidden fees such as cancellation (If applicable), in-contract price hikes after 1 year etc.

It's not hidden when it's in the terms and conditions or other paperwork.

But it doesn't change the reality that young women are being abused, and neighbourhoods terrorised.

The sad truth is that because certain ethnicities are more likely to be involved in gangs the police and public refuse to get involved for fear of accusations of ""racism"" - even though their motivations are not in the least bit racist in wanting to make London a safer place for all children.

I'm also optimistic we'd see a shakeup in the back four with Bertrand (L), Kalas, Cahill, and Azpilicueta (R) to give the regular boys some rest. 

Realistically though I think Mata will probably start on the bench with Schurrle, Hazard, and Willian on. Our back four would be Cole, Terry, Cahill, and Ivanovic if not the same back line we saw against Saints. Eto'o will most likely get the start, Ba as a possible substitution.

iirc Sunderland handed us one of our few defeats at home in the 10-11 campaign in a 3-0 upset. I know we're away and Sunderland is at the bottom of the table coming off at 2-0 loss and a 0-0 draw, but they did manage to take 3 points away from Man City at the Stadium of Light.

So, I knew Stevie has been anything but ""shocking,"" and it turns out the stats are even better than I thought.  I looked through the last few matches he played in for us and went through the gamecasts on WhoScored.  In the 7 matches I checked, he had 4 assists on corners, 7 chances created on corners and a number of other half-chances that they don't put down to him, but that I know came from his set pieces (I'm counting Coutinho's goal against Everton as a half-chance, for instance, though that was just as much down to Stevie as it was down to Suarez's, I think, flick).  Evidently 4 assists on corners, out of his team-leading 5 assists, is not good enough in 13 games?

Stevie had a rough couple of years on set pieces with Roy and Kenny, but he has improved them again, and he mostly gets them very right. Hid freekicks are especially excellent, as he curls them with pace directly at the keeper. I can't even remember how many times people have praised his ability to do so (I remember Tim Howard talking during a game this season about how difficult his inswingers were).

I didn't mean to say you don't watch Liverpool, I meant to say that your memory of Stevie's set pieces this year seemed to be clouded by the last match.

You think I don't already wear sunglasses at night? Also bright and flashing is different. Bright is fine but flashing and I'm dizzy. Safety should be everyone's priority, that is why arm, leg and helmet reflectors are so important. When I used to cycle (can't cycle now in from the head dizzy stuff) I was always in proper gear to ensure that I was seen, so much that I even had various bag covers. 

I will ask my various sources for links but most of the reports I got my hands on where from Brunel or enteries into a road safety competition so it may take a while. There are also a number of ergonomic reports I'll hunt down from my human factor research about the impact of flashing lights v constant. 

Breaking it down though, the change in light means that your both your short term memory(0.5-1 seconds) to long term memory (1-3 seconds) will suffer in perceiving the distance as easily, while your iris' will be changing the amount of light too quickly and causing issues for the driver's general vision so leads to drivers swerving more.

Being safe is fair enough but there are other who are not happy about [them.](http://road.cc/content/news/13526-epileptic-seizure-warning-over-flashing-bike-lights)

It's illegal to sell items with other people's trademarks on if they are selling it in the same category, although some trademarks (e.g. CocaCola) are universal. It is unknown whether Doctor Who counts as one of those ""universal"" things however since the BBC officially license out and sell merchandise, it can be considered it counts regardless. Trademark ""infringement"" is extremely relaxed for non-commercial reasons, but none of that is non-commercial.

At the end of the day, etsy shop owners are making money off someone else's trademark. 

Having said that, it's not worth tracking it down and stopping people from doing it. First of all, it'll produce bad publicity for the fandom. Second, you'd need to pay at least one person to send all the Cease and Desists and court orders and everything else, and it won't make that much of a dent. Finally, I'd suggest it's probably one of the things that makes it great. That people would actually do that out of love for a show.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Honestly, how we do it is less important to my overall point here, which is that we have to expect and demand constant improvement. If we finish 6th instead of 8th, it isn't necessarily an improvement for me, and I think not being in the top 4 for another year is a detriment, not an improvement, as you pointed out. We can't keep floundering outside the top 4 if that is where we want to be.  So I was sort of speaking to the fans' expectations. I really feel that if we expect 5th or 6th, it'll be easier for all involved to not make the top 4.

I agree that purchases like Coutinho and Sturridge can get us to the top 4, but I honestly think Coutinho will turn out to be a once-a-decade steal and Sturridge is probably nearly as rare.  And not to mention that they cost us over Â£20 million.  So a ""few more"" of those signings next summer is a significant outlay of money.

I don't think we need to be Chelsea or City and spend for the sake of spending, but we will need to invest significantly in the squad. Tottenham has had a few years of Â£80 million + net spending in the last decade and have only gotten the CL once (really twice because Chelsea robbed them, but technically only once). If Tottenham is capable of this spending (and doesn't seem to have bought an entire team, well... until this year) why can't Liverpool spend this way?

I think this is an interesting conversation, but I've always felt supporters who hope for top 4 but expect 5th/6th and professing our slim chances of top 4 are just hedging their bets, and it bothers me. Not to mention that, as stated above, I do think this attitude can be detrimental to the club.

Also, I hope we get top 4 this year and can stay in it just for your sake.

These guys subsequently became known as the 'Glenanne Gang', a loose terror network which has been blamed for 70-100 terrorist murders in the 1970s, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Miami Showband Massacre. Numerous UDR and RUC personnel have been convicted in relation to incidents attributed to this gang.

Breen, in particular, is alleged to have participated in the supply of weapons to the UVF, and of being informed that his officers were committing murders, and covering it up.

It's pretty obvious that the British Army and police were involved in some serious and systematic collusion with loyalist terrorists throughout large periods of the Troubles, and one of the victims of this particular murder appears to have been guilty of the same sort of crimes as his counterpart - the one you just denounced as 'Scum' - across the border.

I've watched the 1st Doctor's first two serials (An Unearthly Child and The Daleks), and while I appreciate what they led to, I can't really get into them as a whole for the most part. I'm also a completionist, in such a way that not having access to everything is a major drawback (in addition to each serial being more expensive than I wish they were), and starting just from somewhere else in the story is not something I really want to do (so answers of ""The Xth Doctor is the best one to watch from, and by the Yth Doctor, the special effects are good enough"" are not good responses to my problem).",0,1386108603,null,0,false,0,cdsty3g,t3_1rzpen,t1_cdsty3g,t3_1rzpen,null,1428408640,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,Mampt,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I started off watching the new series, and, I'll admit, was a Tenth Doctor fanboy.  After that, I really wanted more, and one of my friends convinced me to go back and watch some of the old ones(specifically the Fourth Doctor, after telling me a lot about him).  I watched all of three stories before deciding for sure that he was my favorite.  I've gone back and watched a lot more(his whole first season and a half, and I own about half of his entire run from a birthday).  When I first went back to watch the show, it was alright.  Not the best, but it was still entertaining.

My point is that, just like the New Series, the Classic Series has good and bad episodes.  You wouldn't show your parents, who have only seen the classics, ""Fear Her"" to convince them of the new episodes' quality.

There are several issues people have with the classics.  ""They're boring!""  It all depends on the Doctor, the writer, the companion, etc.  Not liking Amy doesn't mean all of the new series is bad.  ""The Doctor is so *oooooooooold*!""  They're all within five years of Christopher Eccleston's age, except for Pertwee and Hartnell.  ""The special effects are terrible!""  You don't need special effects for a good episode.  And besides, the quality is usually exaggerated.  ""The stories take so long to watch!""  Most stories are four parts.  If you would take the time out of your day to watch ""The Empty Child"", ""Silence in the Library"", or ""The Pandorica Opens"", then you have the time to watch most of these.  And besides, each part is 25 minutes or so, and they were broadcast a week apart originally.  You can easily take out a half hour to watch an episode.

It's fine if you consider yourself a fan of the show if you've only seen the New Series, but if you consider yourself a ""Doctor Who Know-It-All"", or and expert on the show, or it's number one fan, but reject anything before 2005, or don't know who Tom Baker or William Hartnell or Sylvester McCoy are, then I think there's a problem.",0,1386108630,null,0,false,0,cdstyiq,t3_1rzpen,t1_cdstyiq,t3_1rzpen,null,1428408635,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Zen the ISP orders an FTTC line, so that's jumpering in the exchange to enable pstn service (dial tone), an engineer install which is jumpering at the PCP (primary cross-connection point or cab) installation of an NTE5 (master socket) and a SSFP (microfilter built into master socket) to make sure master socket is true first in line socket and to test the line to sin349 standard.

That's only the physical layer... on top of this activation and transfers ect happen to enable the firbe dslam with your isps configuration and to have the testing equipment, pstn equipment, new copper pair routing details and fibre details shifted and updated... this is a bit i know little about so this paragraph is deliberately vague.

So Zen have to pay for all that activity, and to get the best price or what ever they pay upfront or something which is why they need to recover costs.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt; Old Chinese culture is generally placed into a museum or turned into an amusement park with the actual places turned into construction sites.

So we're just going to ignore the literally hundreds of thousands of protected Chinese sites and artefacts that are visited by thousands of tourists every single day? I wasn't aware that the Forbidden city was moved. Did the terracotta army also get relocated? How about the great wall?

China has the longest continuously running civilisation in the entirety of human history. Thousands of years of developments. But there's limited space. Things have to be moved to make way for the here and the now. People need places to live and work, they can't all be museum curators.

&gt; horrible mishmash of the worst of western consumerist decadence alongside the mass migrating spitting peasant class

I've got nothing here. I actually agree. The rampant consumerism sweeping the newly wealthy middle classes of China is shocking and brings out some of the worst greed in people. The incredible level of inequality is just...depressing.

&gt; There's massive scope for efficiency savings but it'll require a genocide.

Not sure what you're getting at here. Are you saying that there are too many people for the jobs that could possibly be useful in China if they were to be efficient? Judging by their GDP growth, import/export balance and the fact that even some of the most advanced technology in the world is manufactured there by Apple, Microsoft, Samsung amongst others, I would suggest that they disagree.

Working conditions are terrible yes, and that needs to change, true. But you can't suggest that they aren't *efficient* given the amount of manufacturing capability and volume you can get for your dollars compared to any other country. If they weren't efficient at turning money into products, then we wouldn't all be throwing investment cash at them would we?

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"The only other person who would do as well as Gerrard at corners is Suarez. He has scored more goals with his head in the last 2.5 years than Gerrard, probably by a wide margin. Henderson and Coutinho have been poor on corners and I don't see anyone else who has the skill to take them, as we really lack decent crossers since our game is so far removed from that.

As for stats, I'd say it is clear that we both watch the games. So, in this instance, stats are invaluable to back up whose reading is more accurate. There is often this fight between people who use stats to back up their opinions and people who don't, and for some reason it devolves to an either/or situation. You don't look at stats and skip games and you shouldn't do the inverse. Further, supporters often only remember the things they enjoyed most or were disappointed by most, and those things vary wildly from person to person. Stats can help you get closer to an objective truth.

And I can't believe that you feel that corners are an automatic disappoint, for instance, given how many times we've scored from them this year. Seriously, we've scored 4 goals from corners in 13 matches so far--and those are just the corners, and those that Stevie took. I believe I saw Suarez deliver a corner from which someone scored while looking up those Gerrard numbers (but don't quote me on that).  That is nearly a goal from a corner every 3 games. For a team that is as devoted to short passing and lots of offensive movement without any real threatening wing presence, I'm extremely happy with that.

By the way, do you have a source for that number of corners? It does seem a bit high, but I guess I could see it. I had a hard time getting numbers on corners, as you could imagine after me telling you I scoured the gamecasts. I also think I should at least say that I wasn't trying to ""twist"" any stats, as I was surprised by how good his numbers were from corners. I just had a general recollection of good delivery all year and know we've been scoring from set pieces (direct freekicks and corners) this year.

In addition the modern English government came out of a Frenchman (okay technically he was a Viking, but he lived in France) and England really didn't even become a country until  at least the 1200s, probably much later.

Also you are familiar with the ""Indian Wars"" (or at least the French and Indian War) are you not? The Native Americans clearly demonstrated that using musket and sabre (or tomahawk), Guerrilla warfare was not only possible, but fairly effective.

The Automatic rifle was less effective too than people might realize, the Vietcong were far more effective due to their ability to ambush (which can be done with musket and sabre). Or lay booby traps which can be explosives, or more primitive objects such as Punji pits (sharpened bamboo).

 As far as lay of the land goes, the Japanese were so effective at laying down ambushes in the jungle that they were described as ""experts"" in Jungle warfare, when in all honesty most had never seen a jungle before, Guerrilla warfare can be waged if one just adopts the right mindset and has the terrain (like the woods that are so common in America) to use it.",0,1386110566,null,0,false,0,cdsutlm,t3_1rutqu,t1_cdsutlm,t1_cdstgy9,null,1428408232,-4,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,-4

Single glazing still sucks though - it's just shitty too because it means even if you do run the heating it's just a waste - we should try to improve efficiency via insulation etc. (and obv. encourage sensible clothing). In Scandinavia triple glazing is common and one of my Scandinavian friends said she felt colder in the UK winter than back at home simply because of the difference in insulation.

Tomkins has done well since he's come in, I've been really impressed. Collins has never been my favourite player, but he's experienced at this level and isn't stupid. That said, he isn't Winston. Collins has a tendency to dive in to challenges in silly areas and doesn't have the confidence on the ball to play it out so goes for a bit of a boot it up the pitch style game. That kind of stops the fluidity of our play.

It's not all down to that though, and I'm not pinning the blame on Collins at all. It's down to all of them.

We have *got* to be organised, sensible and not panic. It was highlighted before the game of our tendency to give away free kicks on the edge of the area. That needs to stop.

Our major lack of creating any real chances is holding us back. Nolan is simply not the player he used to be and, as much as I hate to say it, needs to be worked out of the starting XI. For me, Ravel Morrison should be playing CAM, with Diame and Noble behind him, and Cole/Maiga/Carroll in front. Downing and Jarvis/Cole on either wing and we have a decent forward line.

I respect BR, but I disagree with many of the decisions he made against Hull.

Roy Hodgson is a professional manager. Was everything he did at LFC the right decision because he is a professional manager and the supporters who disagreed weren't?

true,sacredstones,null,null,"I think its a case of different perspectives. I became a fan in 2010. We were already a mid table side by that time. You can say what you want, you can brag about history, but the fact of the matter is that we were a mid table side by 2010. This shouldn't surprise anyone. Look at the managers we brought in, and the signings they made. These were NOT signings of a top 4 side. The owners had a large hand in our decline. Its only now that we are seeing a positive change. I don't have the same sense of entitlement that you have. I can tell you for sure that this is not me hedging my bets or trying to save my pride. I'm just being real. Its easy to say, Hey we are going to win this next match and be in the top 4 cause we are Liverpool FC. But thats not really looking at the whole picture. I admire that attitude and passion, yet at the same time I think it should be kept in check. If you were to be shouting this around 2005-2009 when our decline was happening, that would have made sense. But to feel the same sense of entitlement 5+ years out of the top 4 is not acceptable for me. Fans should have demanded that change when we were in the top..now its rather apparent where we stand as a club. Lets say Man U began to crumble. Early on, you'd forgive their plastic fans for saying, We should have been in top 4 last season and we should be there next season. They miss out again and some of their top players leave to real madrid, they continue to to grumble away, expecting to win every match. then they sign Roy Hodgson who signs Paul Konchesky. By that time, you'd call their fans delusional for still expecting to be in the top 4. Rebuilding must be done, and is being done. 

I don't say we will get 6th for the sake of not getting my hopes up. When we played Hull City and Everton I fully expected us to win. I was very angry and dissapointed when we didn't. Angry even with a draw against the blues. I believe deep down that we are better than those teams and we should have won those games. Losing to Hull was especially unacceptable. But when you are talking about top 4 in the most talented and competitive season I can recall in recent times, when you take into account that we just lost Sturridge on top of an already crippled defense, things just don't look good. This is the exact reason why I never thought we'd get top 4 this season, we simply have ZERO depth.

Like I said, I obviously want top 4. you don't know how badly I want to be able to see my team in the Champions league. Seriously. Last year I literally had a dream about it. It was the second best dream I've ever had aside from the one where I fucked and married natalie portman. 

I don't think being realistic is detrimental to the club, regardless of what the fans think, the players and coach know better than anybody that top 4 is going to be tough. If we are not in the top 4 by 2 seasons, I will start to get angry. But for now, given our situation, our depth, and the possibility of losing Suarez, I think it will take us 2 seasons to get there, and I view this as a positive thing.

* What are your salary expectations when you leave uni? If it's hard to get a job in your field, you'll probably want to save your cash to support you whilst you're job hunting. If your field is low paying, or you get a part time job whilst hunting for 'the one', you won't pay much/anything back anyway, so no problem.
If your salary expectations are high, then you'll be fine paying the deductions, and might as well live up your last years of uni, and save for rental deposits when you move somewhere.

* Can you make better use of your cash? I don't know how the loans are structured now, but if you can make more interest in an ISA/savings account than your loan is costing you, then you're in the money.

Salary expectations and future need for ready cash are what should be shaping your decision, imo. Above all, go and learn basic personal finance! That'll put you in far better stead than any comment on reddit.

true,expendableyouth,dalek,Dalek,"Most good tattoo artists will try to talk you out of getting your partner's name in any language - the reason being ""Things may be going great now, but if it doesn't work out you'll regret this.""

That being said, if you like the idea, you should be perfectly free to get the ink. It's your body and your art, and it shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks. Do some research, find a good tattoo artist in your area, and talk with them about what you want. Bring examples of both the Rosetta Stone and how the names would look in the various languages. A good artist works with his or her clients to come up with a design, and will cater it to their wishes - sometimes going through numerous ""drafts"" until the client is satisfied. 

That last bit is important - don't settle for anything. If it's not quite right, talk to the artist and make revisions until it is right. This is art going on your body; you should absolutely love it, not merely accept it.

If you go ahead with this, feel free to visit /r/tattoos and share your artist's work!

true,uk_finance,null,null,"Pros: extra money in your pension from both you and your employer
Tax relief on contributions
Eventually you can take 25% as a tax free lump sum
You should get some form of death benefits before you take any money out of the pension (this could be return of the fund value)

Cons:
75% of the money you take out will be taxable*
Can't access it until age 55 (currently, this could change)
The money you can eventually draw out is heavily restricted currently and dependent on a number of unpredictable factors
Money is not accessible if you need it (not if you lose your job, are on the verge of bankruptcy etc)
Pension legislation changes all the time. Pension rules used to be much better than they are now and could easily get worse (or better of course!). Ultimately it's very unpredictable but when there are rule changes no-one is really protected
You will end up with less money in your bank now. This is important if you have dependants or need to save for something which requires cash savings
Many pension schemes are low cost, which means you get what you pay for, so they have very little fund choice. If you are diverting 15% of your pay into this and you do not expect to take money out for, say, 35-40 years you should be invested in high risk/high reward funds, not a lifestyling or index tracking product which is what most pension schemes have as their default funds.

Summary - it's not a clear cut case of ""free money from your employer, go for it"" unless the employer is giving you something for nothing (eg if they contribute 10% regardless of what you contribute)

* edit: this should say ""taxable income"", not ""taxable"". Current state pension is around Â£6800 per annum and personal allowance is around Â£9440 per annum.

A campaign group called Sustainable Shetland was campaigning against a wind farm (in the great tradition of giving lobbies the name opposite to what their actions will achieve).

They gave two reasons, something about the farm not being licensed to generate electricity, and something about the farm harming birds.

Their case is ongoing but they've decided to drop the former argument because they don't have the money to deal with such a large legal case. They're still hoping the bird argument will let them win their case.

Donald Trump wanted to join the case on the same side as Sustainable Shetland to argue the license argument, then use that case as precedent/evidence/something for putting the same argument across in a *different* case about a *different* farm which is by his precious golf course.

true,AimHere,null,null,"The allegations are very specific and not vague at all, except perhaps that they're not dated; if you accept Weir's testimony, Breen is guilty of providing firearms to terrorists, which would easily earn him a jail sentence if the laws were applied.

Since Breen is dead, there is no way of prosecuting for whatever crimes he may or may not have committed. It also means that discussing said crimes is the business of historians, and not the police or law courts, who use the 'beyond reasonable doubt' standard of evidence required for a criminal conviction. That means that discussing what he may or may not have done is on the basis of 'balance of probabilities' and the nature of evidence rather than proving beyond reasonable doubt that someone is guilty. This is the same basis the Smithwick report used, for want of direct evidence, to say what it had to say about his murder - the difference here is that the perpetrators of Breen's murder might yet be alive, and there may yet be evidence to convict them. Whereas there already exists direct evidence that could be used in a court of law to convict Breen, if there was the ability to hold such a trial. 

Since Breen was murdered 30 years ago, there's no 'bad taste' requirement not to speculate on the activities of a recently deceased person either. Historians wouldn't be able to operate at all if that was the case.

As for the nature of Weir's testimony, given that there was no apparent reason to smear Breen here - he was 20 years dead after all, the affidavit is detailed enough and plausible enough, and corroborates well with other allegations regarding collusion with mid Ulster UVF and the local police and army (the activities and apparent legal immunity of Robin Jackson, for instance, are almost public knowledge now), and that Weir's testimony was described as 'plausible' by a Judge, I reckon, on balance of probabilities, that Breen probably was involved with Loyalist activity.

You might disagree on the facts, which is fair enough, but your knee jerk ad hominems are getting tedious. If the UVF was to assassinate a republican activist, I doubt that many people would consider a news report mentioning court documents alleging that the victim was an IRA member as being some sort of sectarian smear aimed at 'mitigation for this murder'. Instead, those sorts of details would be part of the salient facts of the case.

&gt; All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

Which essentially means that everything in the Bible is supposed to have the seal of approval from an omnipotent, omniscient, infallible being. This verse works mostly against the Bible's legitimacy rather than in its favour, because it is riddled with inconsistencies, contradictions and occasions where god apparently has changed his infallible, perfect mind.

Another Bible verse is worth mentioning; Matthew 5:18:

&gt;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

These are the words of Jesus. Here he talks about the Mosaic Law, largely recorded in Deuteronomy, the Bible book filled with some of the most despicable of god's proscriptions in the entire book, gems like this from Deuteronomy 22:28-29:

&gt; If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,  he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.

If a man rapes a virgin, he should buy her from her father. This is Biblical morality, this is 'useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness', this is the Law that Jesus said 'not a stroke of a pen' would pass from.

Well you bandied about 'sectarian' and 'mitigating murder' quite a bit; which I took to be attempts to brand me as an apologist for republican murder.

And, certainly, I agree about the fundamental right not to be murdered. I actually have a problem with the very notion of an 'innocent victim', since that implies that there are 'guilty victims' - people it's okay to victimize, and it does end up with the 'our victims are innocenter than yours' flavour of whataboutery.
Although it might offend victims themselves, I think emphasising the innocence of victims, or giving victims of violence any kind of moral authority (rather than compensation and justice) is wrong.

It leads people into uncomfortable territory of narratives like ""Your cowardly terrorists kill kids that one time, our brave freedom fighters only killed military aged males"", or ""what about &lt;insert atrocity here&gt;?"" ""Oh yeah, but that was after &lt;insert worse atrocity here&gt;"" that you can easily find from the apologetics of any side in the conflict. I don't presume victims of violence are innocent; they're victims of violence because they were in the wrong place when someone chose to attack them, and the crime is no different no matter how innocent or guilty they are. I brought up the allegations regarding Breen not because of that whole stupid knee-jerk cycle of 'your atrocities are worse than ours' but because it really is a complex and difficult situation that is not helped by shouts of 'Animals' or 'Scum' or the like.

As for being 'in the wake of their murders', we're talking about someone killed 30 years ago, who appeared to be moving in dodgy circles 35 years ago. There has to be some statute of limitations on when you are allowed to speculate on this stuff, and now - when the shooting has mostly stopped - is a pretty good time, since the surviving participants are starting to be more open about what they did and didn't do.",0,1386119620,null,0,1386119854,0,cdsyotz,t3_1s0cik,t1_cdsyotz,t1_cdsy3mv,null,1428406427,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

End of season 2 was Rose getting sucked into another universe.

End of season 3 was Jesus Doctor. The only time there was anykind of wishing the Doctor younger. No where else does this show up.

End of season 4 was Doctor Donna.

I see no religious undertones in Davies episodes except in the Satan Pit creature which would be similar to Moffat's creature in the God Complex.

Also, Davies built the Doctor up and then dragged him down. In season 2 when he was carelessly going around the universe with Rose he inadvertently caused his own suffering by creating Torchwood.

In season 3 that had Martha pinned after the Doctor and ultimately had her illusions of him shattered. He causes immense pain to Martha's family &amp; ended up having the Master die right in front of him.

In season 4 the Doctor pretty much ends up losing all of his companions and is alone. He then thinks him above everything and thinks he is able to do with time as he pleases and he is quickly proven wrong.

IMO the Doctor was not even remotely portrayed as this amazingly magical being. He was incredibly flawed and all of his actions had huge consequences.

Honestly, the way the Doctor is used in both Davies &amp; Moffat's tenures is really not that different. The both do things outside the realm of possibility.",0,1386120539,null,0,1386120744,0,cdsz364,t3_1rzpen,t1_cdsz364,t1_cdsvbb6,null,1428406242,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"&gt; Cons: 75% of the money you take out will be taxable

When you take your pension as income it becomes taxable, as it is income. If your income from your pension does not exceed the tax allowances you're eligible for then you won't pay any tax, pensions don't have any special tax status when they're being taken.

&gt; Money is not accessible if you need it

That's a benefit. A pension is not a short term savings plan, it's a large part of your security for retirement. If people could withdraw their pensions prior to retirement it would not be good for their financial security.

&gt; Summary - it's not a clear cut case of ""free money from your employer, go for it"" unless the employer is giving you something for nothing (eg if they contribute 10% regardless of what you contribute)

Yes it is a clear cut case of free money. Every single person that is employed absolutely needs to have a financial plan for retirement, there are cases where a pension may not be the best choice for someone (for example if they have a reduced life expectancy) but for almost everyone the pension match from an employer is free money. There is absolutely no cost associated with taking an employers contribution match, contributions into a pension are not an expense, they are a saving.

As a *child* it's not an unreasonable assumption to make that this might be the Twelfth Doctor speaking as the curator, especially if you're not really familiar with Capaldi as an actor (and let's face it, not many kids go and watch *Children of Earth* or *In the Thicke of It*).

I mean the kid did make a mistake, but it's not like he's spoiled anything (everyone saw Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor earlier in the special). At worst the kid spoke during a film while everyone was gasping.

true,uk_finance,null,null,"I'll paint you a picture: someone saves 7% of their salary into a group personal and their employer also contributes 7%. They do this religiously for 40 years and consider this to be their main retirement pot. They come up to age 65 and suddenly the government pushes the state pension age up to age 66. They haven't got much other savings because they focused on paying off tier mortgage and savings into the pension. So they now have to work an additional 12 months because their money is tied up. They get to age 66 and intend to use capped drawdown. 6 months beforehand the government changed capped drawdown rules, reducing the amount they can draw out by 20%. GAD rates have taken a beating, so the amount they can draw out is less. They either lifestyled their fund choice far too early and therefore haven't had any real growth for the last 7 years of saving, or they left some risk in the fund choices and the markets suddenly dip 1 month before their 66th birthday. Thankfully the government still let him draw 25% out as a tax free lump sum, which is the only really good benefit left anymore and people are just waiting for this to be pulled as well. They start to draw the money out under capped drawdown despite the poor GAD rates and fund values, but the GAD rates reduce again before their first review. They panic and buy an annuity. Annuity rates are terrible but they were too worried about risking losing the income under capped  drawdown rules because this is their only retirement savings. They get a poor level of income for a year then pass away. Their widow gets a 50% spouses pension, which is 50% of an already small amount. 

I've seen this time and time and time again in my job. Many people blindly bought into pensions because they considered it free money and because it ties it up like you said. The government have changed the goalposts a ridiculous number of times and every time it has been applied to both existing savings and new savings, so it is impossible to say that any money saved into a pension today will still have a good shot at providing for retirement even in the next 5 years, let alone 30-40 years. Put some money in a pension, that's fine. But always be aware that a rule change, fall in interest rates, fall in fund values or change in your circumstances could spell trouble at any point before or after you retire.

Instead we ostracise the dirty pedo scum and put their windows in, make a register of them all and spit on them in the street.

And for your third, although you're right to think that these Christians equate ""biological dysfunction"" to ""moral wrong"" it makes a false dichotomy in the general case.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"&gt; They come up to age 65 and suddenly the government pushes the state pension age up to age 66.

I can find no evidence that this has happened, the changes that happened to the state pension age in 1995 meant people had, at a minimum, 15 years notice[1] (source: [this table](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/181343/spa-timetable.pdf)). Secondly the state pension age is not tied in to the age of non-state pensions, there is a state pension age and a retirement age which can change (right now it's 55). For example I cannot take my state pension until I'm 68 (based on the current age) but I can take my private pension at 55 (based on the current retirement age). A person that is currently 55 can take their private pensions now (assuming their specific scheme allows it) and can take their state pension at 66.

Please provide a citation on someone being unable to take their non-state pension because of adjustments in the state pension age because I cannot find any information on that, anywhere, nor can I find any information on that ever happening to anyone, nor does it make any sense because the pension age for anyone that retired before today is 65... 

&gt; They get a poor level of income for a year then pass away.

So they shouldn't bother with a pension because they were going to die a year after retirement? That is not a good way to plan for the future. Why bother saving at all, fuck it, go wild, you're just going to die.

&gt; The government have changed the goalposts a ridiculous number of times

Yes, they have, but not in the way you're claiming. The changes to the way retirement works should be a consideration for everyone in the long term (assuming they're relatively young) and nobody should expect everything to be the same when they retire as it is now but to suggest people should not bother with a pension (which is what your post seems to imply) is downright dangerous advice and about as far from sensible as possible.

If someone has the opportunity to pay in Â£500 to their pension every month and have that Â£500 matched by their employer then they should, in almost every case, take that opportunity **unless** they have an alternative retirement plan that has specific goals and has a specific path to execution. For almost every person a pension is the right choice and  they should maximise their contributions, and those that aren't suited to a pension would not be posting on her asking if they should contribute because they would know what they were going to do.

The scenario you laid out is, from every piece of information I know and every piece of information I can find, fictitious FUD so I genuinely want to see some more information on this. Please can you post something that backs up what you're claiming, that there are people who have had access to their private pensions prevented because the government changed the state pension age with no notice.

true,ZM2N4AiP_A4,num11,,"Humor me for a sec, I don't hate this, although with current injuries we couldn't play a 5-3-2/3-5-2 whatever you wanna call it but it isn't the worst idea I'd do something like this:

                       Lloris

    Walker   Chiriches  Capoue   Jan    Rose

                Dembele    Sandro
                             
                        Paul
                Soldado            Ade


I don't know, and personally I think it wouldn't work but I really like the possibility of Walker and Rose overlaping as wingbacks. Our current striker situation also really doesn't fit this formation, you need a Rooney or type of player than can drop back deep and receive the call and create, something we lack, maybe Ade could do it idk. I don't like Defoe. Also our midfield is strong, Lamela will come into his won and Chadli and Townsend and Lennon are all good options. My personal favorite lineup (considering injuries) is:



                       Lloris

    Walker   Chiriches   Dawson   Jan  

                  Sandro
    Lennon   Dembele  Paulinhio   Chadli

                  Soldado

I've tried to go and seek out a lot of the older shows...but a lot of them just don't hold up.  I'm sure they were wonderful when y'all were growing up, but they're just not good enough to be entertaining to me now.

I enjoy Tom Baker but I generally dislike all of the over-acting-shrieking companions.   Didn't care for the 1st doctor...really didn't like the 2nd.  3rd was alright.  I'm currently watching the Tom Baker episodes on Netflix but I got really bored with a lot of the earlier episodes.  

I've tried to watch the movie a couple times and never have finished it.  

I wish I would have grown up with it...I'm sure I would have loved all of it had I had the chance to experience it at the proper time.",0,1386128848,null,0,false,0,cdt2s1z,t3_1rzpen,t1_cdt2s1z,t3_1rzpen,null,1428404507,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0
