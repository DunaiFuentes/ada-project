true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"&gt;That, coupled with large gaps in capacity (present and future) due to state non-investment in previous decades

Where on earth are you getting that idea from? There was considerably more investment back in the CEGB days. Lots more bureaucracy, too, which convinced many in government to support privatisation.  In fact the big suppliers have shut down dozens of power stations since taking them over. (It's arguable that many of the coal-fired stations would have been decommissioned any way in recent years, but perhaps not in the mid-nineties when many of them were shut down, and also when refitting remains an option.) This raises the price of electricity, reduces spare capacity, and saves the companies all sorts of money on maintenance and payroll etc. 

It's all well and good comparing our prices to other European nations (with better insulation or warmer climates), but a better comparison would be to what we had before. By that metric, our current system represents an _unbelievably_ worse deal for bill payers.

&gt;But they are doing not too badly with a pretty awful hand - they don't make that much profit at 4.3% last year- EDF even made a loss

That's a bit disingenuous. The energy _suppliers_, you know, the ones doing all the investment you're on about, are still making a [cool 20%](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25101062). 

Government's recent big words about tackling the profiteering industry were met with threats of black outs. If it had been some sort of union or public utility saying the same the papers would have been plastered with headlines about socialists holding the country to ransom.

Part Two: Tell Hurt's story as he enters the time war. How does The Doctor just drop his name? Do his mannerisms change immediately? Perhaps he uses the flame of eternal life (like I said, not too familiar with Old Who) to achieve more regenerations? End it with him finally deciding ""No More"".

true,Cast_Me-Aside,null,null,"&gt;I'm about to start a new commission-based job which will, apparently, count as self-employed.

Whether you're self-employed or not can be fairly complicated.

As a soft rule of thumb think about it in terms of whether you have control over the work you do.  Whether you have control of where and when you do it.  Whether you bear the financial risk of failure.

To illustrate that, if you're a commission based salesman and you're told, ""Go hence and sell my tat!"" you'd probably be self-employed.  You can go where you like, when you like and sell to whoever you want.  If on the other hand you're given a list of leads and told who you can and can't sell to and when to turn up and how to present yourself and a specific sales pitch, you're probably an employee even on a commission only basis.

&gt;Since it probably won't be PAYE, does anyone have any advice on managing student loans/tax payments? Do I just report to HMRC about this, or what?

**If** you're self-employed you'll need to complete an income tax self-assessment.  *(A tax return.)*  If you start now your first one will be from now until April 5th.  The return would be due in next October, if on paper (assuming you can even do it on paper anymore) and January 2015 if not.  

At the end of the year you calculate what you owed.  Before then you'd have to make a couple of payments on account that more or less equate to what you think your income will be.  The last payment will be a balancing payment that corrects the payments on account when you actually know the figures.

When you register as self employed with HMRC ask them to send you some bumpf that gives you an idea of what records you're expected to keep.  Don't treat that as gospel, but at least understand what HMRC says they think the rules are.

Don't put off registering, because if you think you can call a week before the filing date and get things set up to file on time you're in for a surprise.

Depending how things are structured you may also need to consider registration for VAT.  *(As an extremely general rule, if the company invoices the customer and then pays you a share, you're probably ok.  (You're also a lot less likely to be genuinely self-employed.  If you invoice them and pay most of the money on, you want to look at whether you should be VAT registered closely.))*  VAT registration becomes necessary when you pass a threshold in the region of £75,000.  I'd suggest if you expect to go over £60,000 you look at that, rather than take my word for it.

None of it is all that hard, but keep on top of it.  Digging yourself out of a hole built of forgetting things, ignoring time limits and keeping lousy records will be no fun at all.

""Coalition ministers are aware that a defeat for David Cameron in next September's referendum would seriously weaken his coalition government and would increase the prospects of a Labour victory in the general election, adding to the potential uncertainty.""

The main problem with human grade meat products in the States is the treatment of the animals while still alive. There have been instances where flesh from dying or diseased animals was used, and I'm sure it's not all that rare. Additionally, while it probably won't cause immediate harm, the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock feed is very troubling. 

Beyond those issues, U.S. meat seems reasonably safe. Where I grew up (Midwest - Indiana) people still eat deep fried calf's brain sandwiches and I've yet to hear of Crazy Cow prions getting into people's heads. Although, personally, I would never, ever, never-ever eat calf's brain.

I thought it was ""ok"" but was chock full of cliches, poor acting, bad special effects (which were slightly low budget back when it was aired). I thought McGann himself was ok, I would have been at least willing to give him several more episodes to see if he grew on me. But Night of the Doctor shows him in a much better way.

I personally think a spin off would be a great idea. It could allow for some neat twists between the main show and this ""retro"" show. The only downside is that it could confuse new viewers.

They are basically doing something like this with ""Once Upon a time"" which now has a sister show ""Once Upon a Time in Wonderland""

At first I thought ""..in Wonderland"" was simply a tagline for the current season. It confused me that there was suddenly this second show that apparently runs parallel to the main series and will have some sort of tie ins to the main show.

I'm still watching the main show (although I'm not sure why... it has some really bad writting and acting and story lines). However I couldn't stomach the spin off series, it was pretty bad.

I know he doesn't want to be typecast, and that's a reasonable (if slightly overblown) excuse to not **star** in the special, but a ten-second post-regeneration cameo wouldn't have done that.

Problem was, since the bypass surgery interfered with the regeneration from 7 to 8, it jumped the track somewhat oddly, leaving the Eighth Doctor a tangle of impossibilities. So, in his first through seventh incarnations, the Doctor was never half human. In his eighth incarnation, he had always been. In his incarnations past that point, he never was again. His biodata jittered back-and-forth along the possible pasts of the Doctors who could have been, and settled back into a more familiar pathway.

true,NegaZach,null,null,"To answer the first question, small story arc would mean 2 episodes max. It wouldn't be out of the question to actually show that The Doctor isn't this super cosmic being who can just clever his way out of everything. Maybe the savior of space and time needs to be saved every once and a while. He doesn't necessarily have to not be shown the whole episode, he can be shown imprisoned, in fact the next season would be perfect for it, having the time lords come back.

To answer your second question. Amy and Clara. They aren't just normal people. There is something about them the doctor has to figure out, unlike Rose, Martha, and Donna who were just normal people the doctor happens to run into. Amy has the crack in her wall but for some reason there is something about her that helps summon the crack, making the doctor not only have to figure her out but the crack. Clara is a whole other story. She is the impossible girl. Not just any normal companion. The whole of the story spans the whole season and focuses mostly on those companions in their time with the doctor.
A prime example of how fucked up everything has gotten is the thing with River Song. Forest of the Dead and Silence in the Library were perfect episodes, but when you give Moffat the chance to write more episodes with her over a longer period of time, the episodes tend to lose their meaning and kind of destroy the character.

Listen though, I am not saying I don't enjoy these episodes, I am just saying they are very problematic and destroy upon what I already love.
Let's say like the 50th. Hundreds of years of suffering, believing he killed his own people to save the universe and feeling so alone. He see's the master and he feels so happy that not everyone is dead.....THEN BAM! The 50th happens and everything is taken away. The time lords never died and the doctor suffered for nothing. Now you may say that he didn't suffer cause he saw that they didn't die. That isn't how it works though, because of all those doctors being in the same place the space time continuum makes the doctor forget all these things. He still suffers and for nothing. It literally makes everything that built up to the 50th since the reboot of the series lose its importance and meaning.

Moffat is in no way a bad writer, but when it comes to planning or making a decent story arc or female character that is more than just a thing for the cosmic 9 year old to figure out, I just find it quite sad how the series has declined in and actual cohesive plot. Sadly this all pertains to just Doctor Who. Sherlock is an amazing series, as is DW, both ran by Moffat.

Again, I am not saying I hate the show. I would love to see the companion actually be a normal person again to just be by the doctors side and add some humanity to the show.

It took on a familiar form, only it didn't realize it took form of a companion the War Doctor hadn't met yet. She even mentions that. Neither Rose Tyler or Bad Wolf made an appearance in the 50th. It was only her likeness. Therefore, whatever happened to allow the Doctors to arrive in time to intervene with the War Doctor pressing the button was 100% solely accomplished by the Moment itself, not Bad Wolf. Make sense?

For all intents and purposes, it could have been K9. In any case, the Moment had the ability to play with time based on what was shown.

There's no proof that you presented that suggests Gallifrey was ever actually destroyed. Based on the events that took place, 11 had no idea he actually helped save the planet until exactly after it happened. In his mind, he's sure he killed everybody because the war stopped.

Yes, they mentioned re-writing time, but at that moment in time they were all under the impression the button had been pressed the first time. Because none of them remember the events due to all of them being present and being ""out-of-sync"", even the War Doctor would have to assume he pressed the button once he leaves 10 and 11 at the art gallery. The war ended - 2 minutes before he was standing there with his hand on a big red button ready to press it. Of course he felt guilty.

An inverse proof or evidence of the paradox. 

The Moment activated once 35-40 year Prime. All story told within that time and now is optimally told with that intent. That intent does not change. It can not change. Even if The event of the Moment's activation is changed by Bad Wolf during the 50th year by command of Steven Moffat in celebration. This does retroactively change the show, but exists alongside the old one, as a paradox.

As I said in my one and only post here (I stopped attempting to respond due to overwhelming downvotes), the special was just not an epic display of Doctor Who. It was not ""special"" in any way other than getting 10 and 11 on screen together.  War Doctor is a made up incarnation that we have no attachment to, having him be the one who ""pulls the trigger"" gives me no emotions to attach to him ending the Time War.

Not to mention, in the mini-episode which featured 8, we saw War Doctor regenerate as a younger man... yet we see NONE of his time as that incarnation.  11 has claimed to have lived for 300+ years and hasn't aged at all, but this War Doctor incarnation started young and fresh faced and is now an OLD man. How do we get no explanation as to why this has happened?

The real problem is, the fans just accept whatever happens, and because the writing includes winks to the fans, it gets hailed as an amazing story.  Catchphrases, fezes, scarfs, nicknames, and timey-whimey don't make a good episode. Why is The Moment Bad Wolf? The real reason is because they could get Billie Piper. If Billie was busy, the Moment would have been Donna Noble. There was no purpose for Rose to be the Moment and that made her appearance feel so much less interesting.

We also finally get to see the Moment and it's happening in a barn in the middle of no where... where the Doctors have a chance to talk and debate. And why is Clara the ONE to stop it all from happening.  We've had half a season to warm up to her, and SHE gets to be the person responsible for pretty much convincing the Doctor to find another way? After all of this time and the emotions of the Doctor spent over his actions... it's Clara who makes him change his mind?

But just make a quip about a fez, through in a 4th Doctor cameo and it's all good! 10/10!

also i would give 8 more screen time than the others...he had the least, and he definetly needs it, he was brilliant!

The Prime Time Line could also be said to be where memories are made. It's where the Doctor actually lives his life. As Eleven is actually living through these events in Prime, Capaldi as no need to subvert those memories into himself, he's already lived through them and then some, there are things Capaldi has seen that Eleven hasn't.

From their site,

&gt;What law defines the age of a child in the UK?
There is no single law that defines the age of a child across the UK. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the UK government in 1991, states that a child “means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier” (Article 1, Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989).
In the UK, specific age limits are set out in relevant laws or government guidance. There are, however, differences between the UK nations.
What is the definition of a child in child protection guidance?
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland each have their own guidance setting out the duties and responsibilities of organisations to keep children safe, but they agree that a child is anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday.

A benefit scrounger ""demands"" a comfy lifestyle, acquired from the suffering of the rich.

There's certainly something to be said for focusing on the intelligent people in a society, to try and pour resources into what will bring rewards for future generations.

But at the same time, the take-home message that the ""16%"" will get from his speech is ""Ok, so you're saying we're basically useless, and will never succeed. Why, then, should we actually aim to strive? What, in your argument, is encouraging us to come off benefits, leave the pub and struggle in a menial job with no hope of success?""

Boris has essentially done nothing but point out the crabbiness of these particular cornflakes!

Perhaps it's this false sense of ambition, the idea that the bottom 16% *can make it if they try* - the very Americanised notion that everyone could be president one day - that gives them a sense of entitlement to government benefits - ""You say that everyone can succeed if they work hard enough. You say that us, on the bottom, we all have potential? Support us then. Make us care. Get us out of this shithole""

If you started giving so many different and large groups a direct role in decision making in companies, the decision making process would be unbearably slow. In a world of instant communication and fast transport, that is inadequate and no international company would trade with us because we couldn't do anything on their level. 

  Even if you elected representatives to make those decisions for you, you would be completely undermining any meritocracy that exists and the companies decisions would taken by the person who can win elections. How can you expect a company to perform well when all of its employees are trying run election campaigns? A government is large enough to handle this, most companies aren't. 

Furthermore no one would take part - evidence the woeful Police commissioner elections. The few that did would likely have little to no idea about business or economics. People aren't willing to engage on that level. How do you propose ensuring enough information is promoted for every single company about any single decision or any single candidate? The scale of it would be ludicrous, and no one would take part. 

How do you expect to reap the maximising benefits of competition when rival companies are suddenly forced to go through this process. They would have to spend so much money and time influencing all the groups involved that they would collapse, no money would be left to invest in the company. 

It takes all focus away from the product/services being made and puts all of it on this power struggle, this black hole of resources and energy. 

All foreign rival companies would therefore be able to make goods far cheaper, far better and so everyone would switch to them. Our economy collapses.

Most foreign companies would withdraw from Britain being unwilling to lose that much power over decision making. The only businesses that could work in Britain would be small which is great if you're a small tech outfit, but bad if you are a mining company, or an energy company, or any company which by its nature will necessarily have a huge structure. 

I also enjoy the idea that you lament at our political democracy and its ineptitudes, and so wish to extent its scope to our economy as well. Doesn't make any sense.

I believe economic democracy has been somewhat tried somewhere called Spain. Most regions have their own bank or caja which is essentially a bank for the regional elected government. They've done a cracking job. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/08/spain-savings-banks-corruption

Their conclusions:
&gt;**In contrast to other countries, iodised household table salt is unlikely to contribute meaningful amounts to UK iodine intake as** (i) availability is low, (ii) table salt is only a small percentage of total UK salt intake and (iii) UK public-health campaigns have encouraged reduced salt consumption.

In the wake of the collapse of the USSR the RCP entered a period of re-evaluating everything and then re-surfaced as free market Libertarians(!). Other offshoots included Living Marxism magazine in the early 90s (shut down after a libel trial involving ITV, IIRC). Per wikipedia, ""The green journalist George Monbiot has accused him of overseeing crypto-Trotskyist entryism designed to insert ex-RCPers into positions of cultural and media influence, where they pursue an extreme pro-technology right-wing libertarian agenda."" And I think that's quite plausible in view of the bizarre direction the members of the RCP have taken since 1990.

Probability of a bunch of ex-Trots having considerable insight into what's going on with a bunch of ex-Maoists who lived down the road: a dead cert. Probability of the ex-Trots giving the ex-Maoists an easy ride: very low indeed (back in the 70s they were *not* the best of friends.)

Here's the article copy / pasted:

Dear Local World,

So, here we are then. Friday 29 November 2013. Venue’s last day on Earth. Hours from being swept away as part of what you so dreamily term “the development of the what’s on module.” Sometime in December, we learn, venue.co.uk will re-emerge, like butterfly become grub, as www.bristolpostwhatson.co.uk. Because, heck, nothing answers “Hey, where to find what’s happening in town tonight?” quite so snappily as www.bristolpostwhatson.co.uk. Given a firm push, a downhill gradient and a stiff following wind, it just rolls off the tongue.

It may surprise you to learn we don’t necessarily have a problem with you closing the Venue website. Don’t get us wrong, it is curious timing. As you know, the most recent figures for daily page hits are: August - 44,162; September - 48,544; October - 55,824. Nevertheless, the two remaining of our number, working part-time on alternate weeks, would be the first to admit that Venue is a husk of its former self. Frankly, they’ll be glad to be put out of their misery. Where once they were part of a vast team of journalists delivering informed, first-hand comment from every last facet of city life, today our hapless duo struggle to do much more than pass on received opinion and rehash press releases. Naturally, we don’t have to explain this process to you, Local World, but we’re keenly aware that newcomers to the site might look at recent content and wonder at our concern.

We’ll come to that shortly, but, this being an open letter, a brief history lesson for the uninitiated (we’re being tactful here, Local World - we’re all too aware you haven’t got a fucking clue yourselves). Venue magazine began life in 1982, covering Bristol and Bath and surrounds, but swiftly fter 18 proudly independent years it was sold to Bristol United Press, owned by your predecessor, the Northcliffe Newspaper Group. Last year, having suffered death by a thousand cuts and a colourful assortment of full-frontal stabbings, the magazine was closed down. Today, it’s fallen to you, Local World, to apply the coup-de-graceless and bring down the final curtain on 31 years of work.

And hand it all over to the Post.

The Post, which decreed all street art as vandalism for years, and yet today, having so very belatedly recognised which way the wind is blowing, reaches for Banksy with the same onanistic lust the Express reserves for Diana.

We’re not going to claim we ever “championed” Banksy. We never really went in for “championing”. We simply covered everything we considered of value. So we might not have “championed” street art, but we did report t. Always. Even before 1985, the year of Arnolfini’s seminal ‘Graffiti Art’ exhibition, featuring work from the UK’s first wave of can-wielders. One of them was called 3D, or Robert Del Naja. He went on to co-found Massive Attack. We put Massive Attack on the cover before they’d even released a single.

Do you see what we’re driving at here? Have you any idea the number of wonderful bands, and theatre groups, and artists, and voluntary organisations, and filmmakers, and minority groups who had no voice anywhere else, at all, ever, and poets, and DJs, and on, and on, who claim inspiration from something they read in Venue? We make no assertions for the influence of our opinion; we simply did our level best to place a mirror in every last corner of Bristol, no matter how hidden, and allow the city to reflect back on itself.

And you want to hand over that legacy to a paper whose management - not journalists - are the precise equivalent of those radio stations which promise “your better music mix” and then put the same few songs on repeat. Which claim “the best new music” and fail to add “once it has charted and proved its popularity.” You want to hand over that legacy because, to quote from a staff email you neglected to send us, “The existing Venue website has really good functionality with a real blend of music reviews, listings, restaurant reviews etc, etc. This is a fantastic opportunity to grow our digital audience and a great platform to sell advertising on.”

Do you have any idea how much that hurts, Local World? Of course you don’t. You who boast all the cultural hinterland of a freshly discarded wet wipe. (Though you do have history, of course: born earlier this year, the helplessly stumbling result of a merger between Iliffe Media and Northcliffe, with a profit forecast of approximately £30 million - that debt-free dowry from the Daily Mail General Trust was a lovely gift, no? And they absolved you of responsibility for the deficit on that pesky old final salary pension scheme. Ah, Local World! You are to localism what urinal cake is to mountain freshness.)

And now you presume to inherit our work. We were writers, Local World, photographers, not “content providers”. We were bound together not only by our city, but by a love of language, of striking image. Our editors consistently backed our individual judgement and allowed us complete freedom of expression. As a result, Venue inspired a loyalty out of all proportion with the pittance it paid. Local World, we put our very heart and soul into our catalogue of work. And if you think you can now simply walk in and trample on its remains, then you can, with the very greatest lack of respect, fuck the fuck off.

Because we, the undersigned, do hereby assert our full rights under copyright law. It really would be for the best if you were take a moment to visit this page on the Venue website. Sit down, take a deep breath, and pause and reflect on this: “This website and its content is the copyright of the individual authors credited.” Please be assured we did not pull this phrase out of our collective arses, but out of legal statute. And if we perceive so much as a single full-stop, a solitary pixel of our work when your shameless hijacking is unveiled, then you in turn can expect to perceive a court summons. We are, to put it in terms you regularly use but cannot hope to understand, passionate about defending our legacy.

Sincerely,

Robin Askew

A Marketplace requires seller/buyer interaction and/or to be online and active to participate in the trade. On an Exchange you can leave orders, day trade, remain totally anonymous to other traders (the exchange holds the information), have trades execute without your interaction. But you likely know all this (just putting it here because there's been a fair few emails/questions about what an Exchange is).

Must admit, the lack of Exchanges in the UK has unfortunately left many without the enjoyable experience of an exchange.

Also the IBWT platform is very mobile friendly and can be used as a 'travel wallet', or to conduct trades if you sell via localbitcoins, or just face to face.

Hello there. 

Well, maybe not a bad writer, but I *definitely* think that he's a bit overrated, both by the audience and by himself. It has to be said that he can write some really awesome one-offs, but I think that once you put him in charge of the long term he keeps stumbling over how good he think he is. 

Two examples I can think of are the Weeping Angels and the ""Doctor who?"" fourth-wall nods. Both are good ideas that work exactly *once*, but they got painfully dragged on: the Angels went from being scary as hell to being yet another mid-level baddie for the Doctor to run circles around, and the ""Doctor who?"" thingy went from a cutesy lean on the fourth wall to an over-important plot point that *must be taken seriously*, even though is a stupider idea than forming a Dalek boy band.

Granted, I've still to watch everything between *Angels Take Manhattan* and *Day of the Doctor*, so maybe he finally got his shit together and stopped relying on gimmicks and River Song (oh don't get me started on River Song).

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"Just a few points for clarity:

-There are many minerals that can substitute for iodine in a diet so a deficiency in iodine isn't necessarily something to be particularly worried about. Selenium and bromine are good examples of substitutes. In fact, in the case of development issues and mental retardation, iodine is generally considered as a substitute for the preferable selenium. Iodine is primarily considered useful for the thyroid. There are many scaremongers on the internet over bromine - ignore them, they think that because bromine acts as a replacement for the preferable iodine it is therefore bad. It is not. It provides much of the same functions as iodine and is far better than having neither.

-This issue is global and has been for some time. A major contributing factor to this problem is a drop in global soil quality. As soil has become increasingly polluted, absorption levels of iodine (and selenium and bromine) in the food that we eat has dropped. I'm not saying this is so much the case in the UK but it certainly is in numerous other countries.

-Third point (and possibly most important), this study was done on teenage girls who are basically anaemic in everything. This study does not imply a large wider problem (though, of course, as in all cases, there could still be one).

-Lastly, for those who either don't want to or can't drink milk, brazil nuts are a very good source of selenium and strawberries of iodine. Mainly though it's optimal to eat a varied diet including plenty of vegetables, pulses and fruit. If you can do this, it is unlikely you need to worry about deficiencies.",0,1385728017,null,0,false,0,cdpj5mc,t3_1rpavf,t1_cdpj5mc,t3_1rpavf,null,1428464949,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

That panelling is used extensively on the central line, particularly to the east as that was the parts of the line that were built later, previous to this time tunnels were all brick and mortar. Other lines do use this type of panelling.

You can see over the head of the girl standing next to the woman wearing the bonnet the cabling/piping that the underground network uses to control signals, points, and any lighting to be found in the tunnels.

The incline shown in the photo is very typical of the central line, particularly near stations as they used them to assist braking/accelerating. The central line tunnels are also some of the smallest/tightest found on the underground. Hence the cliché that started this thread of ""still more space than the Central line""

Underground bunkers rarely had any kind of incline like that, and were typically not so long. Certainly they had better lighting and didn't require the kind of cabling seen in this photo.

For instance, in public debate about immigration it is usually assumed that most immigrants are from new member states. Never heard anyone complaining about immigrants from Spain or France. 

In reality immigration from old EU accounts for about 19% of inflow, new members states account for 13 % of total inflow to UK. In other words there's more immigrants from western countries. Why no one is seeing this? Why do people only see Poles?

Moreover immigration from EU15 is growing, from 69 thousands in 2008, to 96 in June 2013. This is no doubt because of high unemployment in Spain, Portugal and Italy due to crisis. Immigration from new member states is going down, from 106 thousands at its peak in 2008 to humble 66 thousands now.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"International law is essentially made up, there's no real framework for it or way to enforce it. Even if you look at stuff that is really, really important like say, the Geneva Convention, if someone breaks it what is your recourse?

While they can be put to trial but the ICC (International Criminal Court) if it was the orders of an individual. In the ""every day"" world, if you or I were to break a law the police would turn up and drag us to court. Who forces the US President to go to court if it is discovered the US deliberately targeted civilians with drone strikes?

No-one, because international law consists of treaties and agreements, that are only enforced if other nations (usually more powerful nations) choose to enforce it. Britain and Argentina could go to the ICJ (International Court of Justice) to resolve the Falkland dispute, but even if the ICJ ruled in one or the other's favour, it could quite easily be ignored.

The only way to enforce any consistency in international law is through soft power (i.e. convincing people to do stuff for ideological, ethical etc reasons) or through military force. As there is no ""world government"" and the UN military is made up of armed forces that are loyal to individual nations, there is no objective way to do the latter. 

This is why negotiations like over Scottish independence, Catalonia independence, the Falklands etc is always stacked against whoever the weaker party is, or if not weaker then at least the person who isn't currently sitting on the land.

Take the islands disputed between China and Japan. There is no doubt that if China were to invade Japan it would (eventually) crush it. However they haven't taken the islands because Japan currently controls them, the most they have done is fly planes over it and state they will shoot any planes flying over it down. This also proved to be just gesturing as the US and Japan flew (unarmed) planes over the area over the next couple of days.

International politics if you're a small country is to basically try and go with the flow, maybe making a very small impact here or there, but generally not dictating the course of events. As a P5 member of the UN Security Council, a (for now) leading country in the EU and a powerful ally of the US with the world's 5th largest military spending, the UK has actually quite a lot of influence world wide.

Scotland would have none of that influence, and in my opinion the UK's role in the world would be diminished without Scotland, but even then it would still be far more influential.

That's the reason why Salmond wont be in a position to deliver on his promises unless he's allowed to, because he knows if he pushed it all over the edge, there's nothing he could do. Instead if the Yes vote does win, I suspect he will deliver on about half the stuff he has promised (e.g. some sort of revenue share on the oil etc).

There's a whole bunch of other stuff that puts me against the idea of the split, like Scotland will tie it's currency to the £, meaning that Bank of England monetry policy will have control over Scotland's economy and you'll have 0 say in what is done with it.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"No, but I often think I probably should possibly take selenium. Though, as I understand it is more important to prepubescent and pubescent children (because deficiency can cause stunted growth, which can be quite severe in extreme cases).

I honestly blame the influence of modern ""professional"" players as I regularly see boys diving, pretending to be hurt, pushing and shoving each other and shouting and answering back to the ref - everything they see on Sky or Match of the Day. And these boys are the future players - Football is going down the drain.

We'll get hate for it, but I completely agree. There's more to this than we're being told, or more to this than the parents know. 

Also, even now at 25 I get singled out for being ginger.. But it's not worth topping myself over. It wasn't even that bad at school. 

It's likely that the people bullying her hated her for other reasons (Too pretty, kissed someones boyfriend, etc) and that the ginger hate was just the most obvious angle to take when it came to *how* to bully her.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;If you started giving so many different and large groups a direct role in decision making in companies, the decision making process would be unbearably slow. In a world of instant communication and fast transport, that is inadequate and no international company would trade with us because we couldn't do anything on their level. 

The decision-making process in large corporate entities which are run as despotic autocracies is _already_ sclerotically slow, and their information flows are highly problematic.  If you look at the internal workings of most transnationals [they look remarkably like the centrally planned command economies of State capitalist nations like the former Soviet Union, with all the associated calculation problems](http://www.mutualist.org/id114.html).

&gt;Even if you elected representatives to make those decisions for you, you would be completely undermining any meritocracy that exists and the companies decisions would taken by the person who can win elections. How can you expect a company to perform well when all of its employees are trying run election campaigns? A government is large enough to handle this, most companies aren't. 

Ugh, no one is calling for a representative democracy and elections, such monstrosities are not representative nor democratic in the political sphere, nor would I expect them to be in the economic sphere.  I'm only interested in radical and direct democracy, with delegates, sortition, rotation and recall.

&gt;Furthermore no one would take part - evidence the woeful Police commissioner elections.

This is a serious issue, and were we to consider moving towards such system on anything more than an ad hoc case-by-case basis, a considerable amount of social change and education would be an essential precursor, probably over a fairly extended period.  If you look at the anarchist revolution in Spain, for example, it was preceded by decades of grass roots social movements and community education (the impact of which are still evident on social attitudes today in places where anarchism was historically strong).

&gt;The few that did would likely have little to no idea about business or economics.

I think the ""insufficient talent pool"" argument is a bit disingenuous frankly though, as well as being something of a sacred cow amongst self-congratulatory corporate execs who need to believe they possess rare and special skills in order to justify their share of the pie.  

For a start, the fact that universities need both economics departments and business schools show you how questionably relevant the rarefied world of mainstream economics is to how business actually operates in reality, the former is mostly an ideological indoctrination programme for the celebration of capitalism.  Secondly, consider that a century ago, a room full of surgeons or lawyers or business leaders would have been almost entirely made up of men, and most contemporary women would been viewed and have felt themselves as utterly incompetent and incapable of joining their ranks, because of the manner in which their society and they themselves had been socialised.  Looking round a similar room today, the gender split would be considerably more balanced.  Similar things have been happening with race in more recent times, and similar things could very easily happen with class, given the right sort of society.  The talent pool is much larger than you imagine.  Finally, and by way of practical example, in the aftermath of the disaster brought down upon Argentina by capitalism, numerous companies were taken over by their workers during the period of capital (and capitalist) flight, and there's a locally fairly well-known anecdote of a cleaner who was democratically selected as CEO and has successfully turned around her workers' coop out of the ashes of a failed capitalist enterprise.  When asked what the hardest part of taking on the mantle was she told her interviewer it was learning to read.

&gt;How do you expect to reap the maximising benefits of competition when rival companies are suddenly forced to go through this process.

This idea that capitalism is about competition also needs to be robustly challenged.  It is not, at its heart, capitalism is about collusion, monopolies/oligopolies and the extraction of rent through control of the political machine.  Even Smith partly recognised this.

&gt;They would have to spend so much money and time influencing all the groups involved that they would collapse

The whole idea is that, by diffusing and decentralising political and economic power democratically, it would be increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible for such influence to be wielded.

&gt;All foreign rival companies would therefore be able to make goods far cheaper, far better and so everyone would switch to them.

If the political will existed, such competition could be excluded from our markets, or, if a less arbitrary and arguably authoritarian approach was desired, we could simply insist on transparency and let people themselves make the choice whether they wished to buy goods from democratic companies or economic dictatorships.

&gt;Most foreign companies would withdraw from Britain being unwilling to lose that much power over decision making.

Let them, if they're no use to our economy, it's not like these sorts of companies can take their infrastructure, built with our labour and in our social substrate, with them  Such businesses can be taken over by their workers.

&gt;I also enjoy the idea that you lament at our political democracy and its ineptitudes, and so wish to extent its scope to our economy as well. Doesn't make any sense.

Nope, on the contrary, I want a radically democratic political system too.

&gt;I believe economic democracy has been somewhat tried somewhere called Spain. 

And it was going great guns until all the forces of Western capitalism (including fascism) and Eastern Stalinism were aligned against it and ultimately crushed it.

&gt;Most regions have their own bank or caja which is essentially a bank for the regional elected government. They've done a cracking job.

The cajas have had serious problems no doubt, but many have resulted from being tossed in the wider tides of international capitalism and the financial crisis brought about by capitalist banks.  To the extent that they have (been forced to) play the capitalist game, they have been punished.  Mutuals have always found it harder to access large amounts of cheap capital in the manner of limited liability corporations, and it makes them vulnerable.  Just as the Cooperative Bank has found in the UK market.  The cajas are being dined upon by the financial houses and hedge funds in the aftermath of the crisis, and it's true that corruption and stupid lending decisions in the property bubble there have played their part, but it's also the way the boom bust boa constrictor of capitalism invariably works on smaller less well financed businesses.  On the other hand, well-run mutuals and workers' coops generally survive capitalism crises in much better shape tan similar capitalist enterprises, and the statistics back this up.  Also, when they do have to take a hit, they generally look after their workers far better.",0,1385735249,null,0,false,0,cdpkc0y,t3_1rn3ee,t1_cdpkc0y,t1_cdpi2iy,null,1428464400,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Most of the Native tribes sided with Britain because of this, but a few sided with America. Quite a few slaves sided with Britain because they promised the slaves would become free men once they joined the British army. In the end it was settled with a treaty in 1815.

Who won? Some say America - the trade restrictions were dropped and no more press ganging. However, Britain pushed America back out of Canada, back to their capital and burned the white house down, so personally I think Britain won - I am British though ;)

Clearly, wearing this invites comment - and when I do wear it, I expect this and am prepared to explain why I am.

I am not a strict pacifict - which is a common assumption that people will make - nor do I feel that wearing these shows a particular disloyalty to my country, which is another assumption that people will make, and one that seems to me to demonstrate a extremely warped understanding of Remembrance day altogether, and the very kind of sentiment that put me off wearing a red poppy in the first place.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"Sorry, I suppose I should be more clear that I meant the bromide ion and not bromine but this is true of the above article as well where in fact they mean consumption of iodide not iodine. Tbh, I don't recommend supplementing with bromide (and maybe I should have made that more clear) because it isn't nearly as beneficial as iodide. Also, bromide will assume iodides place in the thyroid if you have high levels of it (so, if you have good levels of iodine, bromine has a negative effect, however, if you have poor levels of iodine, bromine picks up some of the slack). Further, I'm not sure there are any bromide supplements available because it swings from being beneficial to being highly poisonous fairly quickly. That is, it would be easy to fatally overdose.

The reason I mentioned bromine is simply because iodine deficiency is often not nearly as dramatic when considered in coordination with someone's bromine, selenium and even chlorine levels. These replacement elements should only be considered as of short-term benefit (especially chlorine) not as a reason to be ok not consuming enough iodine. It is more a remark on how one's body adapts well to it's balance of minerals and one should not be too concerned by deficiencies unless they are severe or chronic in some capacity (i.e. long-term).

Bromine is poisonous and much more so than iodine (note: I'm getting most of my info from a series of lectures I attended on poisons, which particularly focused in this area). These minerals should only be consumed in very very small quantities.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"&gt; The decision-making process in large corporate entities which are run as despotic autocracies is already sclerotically slow, and their information flows are highly problematic. 

So why worsen the problem? Especially when you know full well that it wouldn't necessarily improve the decision making, it would only spread the blame for it. 



&gt;  I'm only interested in radical and direct democracy, with delegates, sortition, rotation and recall.

Seriously? In a country of 62 million people and a GDP of $2.45 trillion? Direct democracy and sortition worked in Athens, a small city state. They couldn't work in a country as large as ours. That is the fundamental reason why we use representation. You would have people voting on things constantly. The sheer volume of decisions involved in politics and also in the companies every day? People wouldn't be able to work, and thats if they were just pressing voting buttons, let alone learning anything about what they were voting for. 


&gt; This is a serious issue, and were we to consider moving towards such system on anything more than an ad hoc case-by-case basis, a considerable amount of social change and education would be an essential precursor, probably over a fairly extended period.

Centuries, and this is assuming a party promoting this remains in power consistently, and nothing dramatic happens to place their ideology on the metaphorical chopping block. 

&gt; I think the ""insufficient talent pool"" argument is a bit disingenuous frankly though, as well as being something of a sacred cow amongst self-congratulatory corporate execs who need to believe they possess rare and special skills in order to justify their share of the pie.

I didn't say the public weren't capable of understanding. A CEO or board of directors although likely to be very intelligent and skilled (not necessarily) are unlikely to possess any special powers.  The key point is that because there are relatively few of them, the necessary information to make an informed decision can be easily distributed, quickly read, summarised and understood, because you have between 1 and maybe 30 genuine decision makers. Once you start scaling that up and including more people, especially less selectively, you are going to encounter huge problems as the time and resources involved in sending around the required information, making sure people understand it, getting decisions back, a decision that would have taken a day or less will now take weeks.

 &gt; disaster brought down upon Argentina. 
That was caused by the various consequences of a bonkers dictatorship, and widespread corruption lacking any institutional strength. Blaming it on capitalism is a one factor explanation and those are rarely if ever correct. 

&gt;The whole idea is that, by diffusing and decentralising political and economic power democratically, it would be increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible for such influence to be wielded.

But then no one would have any power to make any decision and nothing would ever happen. 

&gt;we could simply insist on transparency and let people themselves make the choice whether they wished to buy goods from democratic companies or economic dictatorships

So what happens if and when people choose the economic dictatorships? 

&gt; Let them, if they're no use to our economy

What about the many that are useful for our economy, and worker direct coops are far from an infallible solution.

&gt; many have resulted from being tossed in the wider tides of international capitalism and the financial crisis brought about by capitalist banks

I know you give some credit to corruption and stupid lending schemes, but come on. Corruption was endemic, ""stupid"" is an understatement. All economic models suffer from human incompetence and greed, and economic democracy will suffer from more human incompetence and greed because there are far more humans involved. 


&gt; On the other hand, well-run mutuals and workers' coops generally survive 

Well run capitalist businesses survive better too, because they are well run. Poorly run mutuals and coops will fail. ",0,1385743667,null,0,false,0,cdpmiug,t3_1rn3ee,t1_cdpmiug,t1_cdpkc0y,null,1428463378,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I wouldn't want credit to be split in the eventuality of success, a stable 5 year deal ensures he will get the lion's share when we get that success. Just a handful of his plus points :

* His handling of the Suarez affair, showing real man-management skills behind his courtly personality. 
* Turning Gerrard, Agger from injury-stricken to back to their influential selves, showing the importance and intricacies of Sports Science.
* Reinstating Carragher, understanding the importance of organization away from the touchline.
* Turning to youth right in the beginning, starting Suso/Sterling over 'bigger' but maybe less talented players. Gave the squad a reason to want to fight and push the first team hard for their places.
* Him giving Henderson and Shelvey chances too, legendary. Too many such as AVB (majority of r/liverpoolfc 's first choice back then) would've disposed of the 'less-talented' English soul of the team to bring in their version of talent, changing the social structures of the club without realizing.
More man management involved here than with the god-like talents, because here he's managing confidence *and* skills/tactics.
* Most importantly, he imposed his ethos around the soul of the club, rather than vice versa - one aspect I think he doesn't get enough credit for. He's understood the importance of non-football related stuffs both on and off the pitch.

He's a proper human being, a proper manager. No matter what you call him, he's the man to take us forward.



I'll still call him Brenda though. It's much sexier than Fergie.

So most of my knowledge about the lore comes from what people have told me, what I've read on the Tardis-Wiki and what people who know their Doctor Who say in videos.

The whole thing about the second heart seems to be a bit like an artifact from the very early days of the show. The first Doctor only had a single heart because the whole concept of having two hearts was introduced later in the show.

So I assume the regeneration just spawns a second heart just as it changes the outer apperance of the body.

Good point about River though, I've never paid attention to that!

It has never been addressed so far as I recall, but I do think she only has one heart since she spend her childhood and teenage years disguised as a human with her parents. At some point she had to have had some kind of physical check-up where someone checks her heartbeat and it would've been noticed as a medical anomaly. And I do think that would've caught the attention of certain people. The body of a Time Lord is very valueable after all, so I don't think people would pass up the chance, however slim it might be, to get one on their hands.

I'm sorry, you are simply misrepresenting the facts to suit your agenda. I'm not looking for a bunfight either, so just watch the video and tell me if you are seeing the same thing as me?

0:00 to 1:01 he is informed that he is being arrested, he is lowered to the ground and his first arm is in the handcuffs without any problem. As you will see he is *deliberately* placing his entire body weight on his other arm to obstruct the second arm being placed in the handcuffs, despite the officers first trying to remove it from under his body, while his ""assistant"" (for want of a better word) gets the camera in place and begins the running commentary. The first application of pressure to his neck occurs at 1:17, he looks up to see the cameras view is obscured and stays quiet, simply moving his head to the other side. Only after the officer states ""You're doing your job, I'm doing mine"" and getting no cooperation, do they try again, around 1:45 in the video, with the commentary about pressure points already ongoing by the female almost before they even start, and the obviously faked cries of pain .. who actually verbalises ""OW, OW"" when they are in pain?

The police might be many things, not all good, but this my friend is a deliberate setup to obtain the desired video footage. He's resisting arrest, feigning pain, and his co-conspirator has a ready made script designed to illicit exactly the response you see in these comments.

I am sure Brendan would still be thinking long term even if he doesn't get a contract extension. Having a whole year and a half left on your contract with a company that is near certain to renew it if you work well doesn't seem to be short term thinking. Short term thinking is handing out a 5 year contract to a manager who has not yet achieved any major targets set (not to say he is not on his way to achieving them).


Also by having too long a contract without seeing true tangible results could be a disaster, wait another 6 months just encase the team implodes or major problems arise. A good top 5 finish would be a good place to start for me.


I am a huge fan of Brendan's work currently but it's best to not be blinded by our early successes this season.

There were no talks, I've resigned as a mod, to be fair this place has changed massively from when i was first a mod, into something other than what I would have liked.

It's unfortunately now  a massive circle jerk where posts that take effort by the contributors receive very little support from the community, whilst pictures of shirts and poor quality content consistently get voted to the front page.

The level of debate is appalling, everyone is a tactician without actually understanding that nothing in football is static. Debates on here, like many places on reddit, are derived from whatever the hivemind believes is the current hero; Luiz, mata, Azpilicueto,or the latest tactical buzzword; pivot, double pivot, zonal marking. There is no real  or coherent understanding of long term strategy just bandwagonesque bollocks.

It's a shame, this place used to value interesting articles about the club, it used to value the effort that long term contributors made to posts.

Can i just say also that the other mods here no nothing about my behaviour and none of them asked me to step down, it's my weariness of the humourless way that the majority of fans conduct themselves on here that has led to my resignation.

Kane - Like him a lot personally, tons of energy to run up and down the flanks all day, pretty good going forward, decent defensively but not Dave-like so he's prone to errors. Had a pretty poor start to the season defensively from what I've seen but I think that's more down to form as towards the end of last season he was solid. 

Piazon - Not much to say that wasn't already apparent during his time with us, only difference is he is now been given the chance of first team football. Were it up to me he would have gotten all those games Moses did for us and would probably be better off by now.

PVA - Seems to have improved defensively over the years, going forward has never been the issue with PVA as he's always been a pretty good dribbler for a fullback. Crossing is a bit poor but still better than Cole's. I don't think he will ever be first choice but will make a solid backup to Bertrand. 

Then there's others like Josh, Chalobah, Romeu (if he's over his injury), Hazard, Lukaku, etc. 

Talent is there, just depends on if the club are willing to take the risk. I don't think anyone is a dead cert regardless of what Jose or people at the club say, it was suppose to be Josh's last loan and then he would be brought into the squad this season, Lukaku was meant to be here this season, Chalobah will apparently be here next season. I really don't know anymore. 

All I will say is that our defenders, statistically, have the best chance of being giving the chance out of everyone else, there will be quite a few spaces opening up over the coming seasons.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;So why worsen the problem?

I obviously don't believe it would, or I wouldn't advocate it.  Worker-self-management (autogestion), for example, has been shown empirically to be more efficient and equally or more productive than traditionally managed firms, not by politically-motivated researchers but by capitalist transnationals themselves - most famously Ford.  The only reason most ultimately flinched away from such models of organisation was fear of loss of control and the self-interested machinations of the managerial/bureaucratic class themslves.

&gt;Seriously? In a country of 62 million people and a GDP of $2.45 trillion?

Seriously!  Smaller scale it's true, but a form of much more direct democracy works fine in Switzerland, and with increasing technology it gets easier to scale. Not only that but there are a myriad of ways to decentralise, federalise, localise and syndicalise it.  People only need direct input into decisions in proportion to the degree to which those decisions impact on them, their families and their communities.  You can be completely dictatorial about what underwear you're going to put on today, and I don't care, but if you want to amalgamate my local hospital or move my factory overseas, I need a voice.

&gt;this is assuming a party promoting this remains in power consistently

No parties...

&gt;A CEO or board of directors although likely to be very intelligent and skilled (not necessarily) are unlikely to possess any special powers. The key point is that because there are relatively few of them, the necessary information to make an informed decision can be easily distributed, quickly read, summarised and understood, because you have between 1 and maybe 30 genuine decision makers. Once you start scaling that up and including more people, especially less selectively, you are going to encounter huge problems as the time and resources involved in sending around the required information, making sure people understand it, getting decisions back, a decision that would have taken a day or less will now take weeks.

Again, there are many ways of organising a flatter radically democratic organisation which [do not result in the same sort of informational asymmetries and bottle-necks which plague capitalist corporations](http://www.mutualist.org/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/otkc11.pdf) (particularly part iii, from page 151).  Such organisations can adapt rapidly and be responsive, decisive and effective.

&gt;But then no one would have any power to make any decision and nothing would ever happen. 

A example system might be one employing recallable delegates with specific tightly defined mandates rather than representatives acting according to their own lights notionally on behalf of the workforce, but there are other models.

&gt;So what happens if and when people choose the economic dictatorships? 

With sufficient transparency, do you believe that they would?

&gt;worker direct coops are far from an infallible solution.

I don't say infallible, only better than what we have currently.  Some on the left would argue the problem lies with markets, and I certainly agree capitalist markets are problematic.  However, I'm inclined to think anti-market leftists might be throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and markets have a far longer pedigree than capitalism.  I put my faith in anti-capitalist freed markets for now, unless and until practical experimentation suggests this faith is misplaced.

&gt;Corruption was endemic, ""stupid"" is an understatement. All economic models suffer from human incompetence and greed, and economic democracy will suffer from more human incompetence and greed because there are far more humans involved. 

All systems suffer from corruption, as you say.  There are many extreme examples of capitalist corruption - both contemporary and historic - and, despite our placing in the laughably partisan corruption indexes which are produced rank ordering countries annually, our own British system is corrupt to the core, and the numerous examples of scandals and rigging in the British-led banking and financial industry, involving colossal - indeed mind-bending - amounts of money, and which resulted in an economic collapse which is still expanding and has resulted in millions of ruined lives, hundreds of thousands of companies closing and probably similar numbers of excess deaths globally, exemplify this.

I disagree that democracy, involving more people leads to more corruption, quite the contrary, if you believe human nature is basically greedy and corruption prone, why would you want to concentrate power and create hierarchies the corrupt and greedy can climb in order to leverage the State and its security apparatus and weaponry to exploit the rest of humanity?",0,1385753800,null,0,false,0,cdppymv,t3_1rn3ee,t1_cdppymv,t1_cdpmiug,null,1428461703,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The 1970s: Doctor Who sold to the United States

&gt;The BBC series was originally sold to television stations in the United States in 1972, with Time-Life Television syndicating selected episodes of Jon Pertwee's time as the Doctor. **The series did not do well, despite an interesting write-up some years earlier in TV Guide**. Apparently, program directors of the commercial television stations that picked up the Jon Pertwee series did not know that the program was an episodic serial, and so it was constantly being shuffled about in the programming schedules.

electricity £50

It is going to take time for IBWT to build up a steady market and flow of buy/sells, I'll be the 1st to say that, its not going to happen after 1 week, nor after 2 weeks (it's been 1 and a half weeks so far), but it is slowly happening/growing, but again, don't expect massive influx of trade within the first few weeks of an exchange opening (or re-launching), especially with our alternative method of funding.

You know how difficult it can be convincing people that Bitcoin is actually a viable alternative to fiat, and its not just all used for drugs, porn and money laundering? It's also quite tricky to convince people that they can really step away from the banks, that you don't actually have to have a bank.

It's more than just 'another exchange using a bank with standard bank verification', IBWT is something different, and it will take some time for the general masses of current Bitcoiners in the UK to realise/accept.

&gt; We're not here to save the world, but we're not he

well true, but we also educated a great deal of the world and brough MANY other countries a great deal of trade. whihc in turn boosted they're economies.

In fact colonialising other countries was not and was never in the interest of England. in fact colonialism them was considered a failure.

what we preferred was to do business with them. and in turn, we did actually provide medical knowledge, schools and hospitals.

they would never have agreed otherwise.

the British colonies were not the repressed souls as you think.
we brought wealth and technology to them aswell.

look at the difference between central Africa and maybe south Africa?
one is poor and the other not so poor.

each of the Common wealth countries are all successful modern places. 
Kenya has better living conditions than Somalia etc..

Every where the British went, there were benefits that followed.
Im sorry, there maybe exceptions but generally the industrialization from the British Empire was a good thing for much of the world!

The fact that you didn't understand such obvious sarcasm, heck the countless sarcastic posts showing just how bad this sub is getting, and instead decided to claim that the mods need replacing and are power hungry just goes to show where this place is heading to. I'd like to see any one of you mod with the consistency that they have for years. Rule #1 of a power hungry mod is that they would rather ban the entire community than to quietly step down on their wishes, use some common sense.

This sub is lucky to have some of the best mods on Reddit and being here a week then calling them power hungry just further shows the hole this sub is digging for itself. Also what MD mentioned about the direction this sub is heading should be an eye opener to a lot of you.

It makes me wonder whether it's time to switch to five at the back for tough away games.  Play Vertonghen, Kaboul AND Dawson as CBs, with Walker and Rose very high up on the wings.

4-4-2 diamond in defence whilst in attack, sandro drops in between centre halves with walker and vertonghen pushing up to create a 3-4-1-2 formation. You can't play the 4-4-2 diamond with wingers otherwise we will get slaughtered in the middle of the park. It needs to be a narrow diamond not a wide flat one (which i personally think is a weak formation anyway). People have been asking for 2 strikers and this is the only way we can do it without playing 2 in the midfield. Lamela is capable of playing as a 10 (obviously Eriksen would be first choice but he's injured). Holtby could play instead of Dembele but Dembele seems to have a thing for United.

I personally am a fan of 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 but it isn't working. Maybe something a little different is in order.

true,mr_rivers1,null,null,"Hey!

I did an access course a couple of years ago at Hull College. The experience was great and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into HE. 

Don't get me wrong. It's BLOODY hard work. I had an essay due almost every week, for 6 months. It was harder than I have worked so far at uni, and I'm in my second year, even though it was less academically taxing.  If you want to get into uni, it's certainly the quickest way to do it. However, you have to be driven to want to get the higher grades the universities want, and a lot of it will stand on your personal statement, because they seem to value access diplomas less than A levels (unless you are over 25 or so). I applied to 2 pretty high up unis to study history and got turned down by both, even though I well exceeded their grade requirements to get in. 

That being said, the college you go to, if it has ties to the university, tends to consider them more favorably. I had a pretty much guaranteed place at Hull uni to study any degree I wanted in humanities. I ended up turning them all down and going to study archaeology at York, and I'm absolutely loving it and would not be doing anything else given the choice. 

The best advice I can give is work REALLY hard. Try and find out what modules you will be taking and start reading for the subject matter asap. And you absolutely HAVE to nail your personal statement. I would recommend starting to work on it now, if you have the free time, as it often makes the difference as much as the grades, if not more. 

I wish you luck! If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Oh and just a word of warning, if you have more than tier 2 education in the past, they will ask you to pay. A lot of the people on my course 'couldn't remember' and got it for free.

I started a two year, evening class BTEC ONC in computer programming, and after the first year, my teacher said I was too good for this course and should do the BTEC HNC. So I went to Slough college for a few evenings a week and did that for 2 years.

After getting that, I was offered voluntary redundancy at work and based on my HNC, was accepted on the final year of the fulltime BTEC HND course at Hatfield Poly.

Towards the end of that course, it was announced that the Poly was becoming a Uni and they introduced a scheme called CATS (Credit Accumulation Transfer Scheme) where the top 20 (I think) people from the HND course could go on to the final year of the BSc Computer Science. I was accepted.

During the summer of that year, the Uni asked me if I would like to do a year out in industry in Hamburg. I said yes.

When I came back, I did the final year and got my BSc.

Where am I now? I'm doing very well but I work hard. After a few years as a C programmer, I got in to the web and have been a web developer since '98.

""Slashing"" sounds quite dramatic - I think it's worth clarifying what is being proposed for corporation tax.

The UK has cut corporation tax from 30% (2007) to 21% (2014), and an independent Scotland would reduce it by *up to* 3%. So you're looking at going from 21% to 18%, or about a third of the reductions made by the UK.

Ireland's corporation tax is unusually low (12.5%), but there is a wide variation among EU members - Bulgaria (10%), Portugal (15%), Poland (19%), The Netherlands (20%), Denmark (22%), Austria (25%), Germany (30%), France (33%).

Reducing the rate slightly with respect to your nearest and larger neighbour sounds like a reasonable approach to attract new investment .

Like others I've been on the verge of detracting from him for his lack of resolution. However I can't give my final verdict until Christmas when it seems (I hope) hope he wraps it all up. Who was the voice in the Tardis stating ""Silence will fall!""? How and why did they blow it up? Will the Doctor answer the question and what will his response be? How will the the Doctor survive his apparent final death? ( I include the meta-crisis Doctor in my regeneration count.) 

The truth is despite the fact that these answers to these questions has been so long to be resolved, Moffat has managed to keep us watching by adding layers to the mystery as the arc progressed which managed to further gain our attention and intrigue. It really comes down to this Christmas when Moffat should finally unveil all. However I am a bit at odds about how Eleven's entire life has been consumed by this story.

If Moffat pulls it off in the end and wraps everything up neatly then I will be happy for him to continue. But then again, would this mean another multi-season long spanning arc? I don't think Moffat should stay for more than 2 seasons more and even that's pushing it. This is nothing against him or his writing but it's just that the show by that point will require some rejuvenation.

My only worry is that there is no one who stands out waiting to take his place. Gaiman is a brilliant writer however he would not be willing to commit to Doctor Who and all it entails. Gatiss is a good writer, but he doesn't seem to know how to write Who to the same caliber as Moffat or Davies which is disappointing as he is clearly a great fan of the show.

A charity with a lot of money effectively plans how it distributes it and ensures it is actually used for the purposes it is supposed to be used, and in the meantime invests that money via third parties so that they have even more money to distribute and continue to run. All publicly known before anyone donated to comic relief if the public actually cared to read these things.

&gt;Investment policy 
Comic Relief is a cash generative business. The business model in essence is that the funds raised from a Red Nose Day or Sport Relief campaign will be received across March to July in that year. The funds will then be awarded in grants over the 2 years before the next Red Nose Day or Sport Relief campaign with the great majority of the grants being multi-year, often for 3 years but sometimes for up to 5 years. These grants 
are scheduled for payment in tranches over the period of the grant to ensure the money is being spent as agreed. Sufficient funds will be held in cash or cash equivalents to meet all grant commitments for the next 12 months (this amounted to £58million at 31 July 2012). 
Beyond the sums to be held in cash there is therefore permanent core capital which can prudently be held in longer term assets to achieve an enhanced level of return.The overall objective of the Investment Policy is to maintain and grow the value of the portfolio. In addition Comic Relief aims to maximise the return from its portfolio, but only within an acceptable level of risk.

Personally I don't want him to become a woman just because it isn't right. The Doctor is meant to be this kind grandfatherly figure. Plus then if he flirted with his companions it'd be this very strange dynamic. 

I think the whole thing would be weird. 

I don't object to other races playing The Doctor though, I'd prefer it if we kept it the why we have though because of some simple reasons.

1. The internet is cruel, you can expect a lot of racial slurs and sexist terms being flung at them.

2. The first female/black/Asian Doctor will be hounded for years and only remembered as ""The First ____ Doctor"" no matter how good their acting is whenever anyone mentions them there will be the sentence ""The first ____ Doctor"" at least ten words before or after. I'd rather not see talented young actors/actresses be put down like that. 

3. The reason we have companions is diversity. The companions can come and go and to be honest the actors will be more respected than the ones playing The Doctor.

true,terirandaap,lfcflame,,"Again, bad basis of judgment. Your generalization of sentimentality dissolves the meritocracy involved here, and I feel I must give you a detailed response due to my addiction to procrastination. So here goes.

Dalglish (the only club hero put in a position of power, so singular pls) was needed then as the club was just rescued from the grasp of administration, and with a new regime the fans were in serious need of restoration of optimism.

*Apparently* Dalglish agreed he would be a stop-gap, so the failures you speak of are largely the inevitable ones carried forward by failures of the previous regime upto Hodgson, and avoidable ones such as Commoli's, who was incidentally appointed to account for Dalglish's rustiness in the transfer market.

But Hyypia would have none of Dalglish's old-school weaknesses, and is a young, exciting manager getting his team to regularly and spiritedly punch above their weight. In fact, theoretically he is the perfect mix of sentimentality and modernity.

A back three against two strikers would still need a holding mid in front of them to keep them from getting over run down the middle or for the other teams attacking mid to drift in between the lines and get time on the ball.

If Spurs had been playing a back three, Nasri still would have cut in from wide free of a marker to get on the ball and City still would have had runners from midfield bursting past our midfield. And if City had any spells of possession and sucked back the wingbacks into a five at the back then Spurs would have had little way to play out of their own half, which would have led to City getting the ball back and dominating the possession battle.

And if you had that setup against City, Naughton at LB would have need ed to be more cautious on the left so Walker could bomb down the right...so you'd end up with a lop sided back four anyways. The problem in the City game, ahem one of the problems, was that Vertonghen can't get back fast enough to push up as high as he does, Walker can and Rose can.

* 18 February 2009. G-REDU, an EC225 LP. During a night visual approach to the Eastern Trough Area Project platform, the helicopter descended and impacted the surface of the sea. 

* 1 April 2009 - G-REDL, a Eurocopter AS332 L2 Super Puma Mk 2, returning from the Miller oilfield went down in the North Sea, 40 miles northeast of Aberdeen, killing all sixteen on board. Preliminary cause was attributed to a catastrophic failure in the main gearbox.

* May 10, 2012 - G-REDW, a Bond Eurocopter EC225 Super Puma, travelling to the Conocophillips operated Joanne and Judy fields made a controlled ditching into the North Sea following a radio report of a low oil pressure light. All 14 people were rescued from the helicopter liferaft, 9 were airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary while the remaining five were brought to Aberdeen by lifeboat. On June 15, 2012 helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter cleared Bond Offshore Helicopters of any blame for the ditching of G-REDW. On October 17, 2012 AAIB concluded in their S5/2012 report that a faulty design of the Emergency Lubrication System was the most likely cause of the warnings that led to the ditching of G-REDW and recommended ""Eurocopter to review the design of the main gearbox emergency lubrication system

Secondly, about that Lachiendupape guy. I'm not going to say anything about him regarding to Chelsea. If he truly supports the team, I'll believe it for now, but the whole banning issue was fucking absurd. ""i'm going to ban someone and call MJ a pedophile, it's going to be so jokes man."" Frankly, I'm surprised you found that funny at all EnglishMD. You seem like you would be above that. I could steer this in another direction with the validity of that statement altogether, but I'd rather not. As with the post that EnglishMD wrote, it was completely unnecessary. The reason many people got upset was because... it wasn't funny. Not even remotely. I'm not sure how far the joke went (as in if the guy who got his account banned was in on it), but if that guy who's account was banned was not in on the joke, fuck you guys. Seriously. I can't imagine more childish behavior. I've had my problems with this sub for a while, mostly due to trolls and whatnot, but I think I'll refrain from participating if these are the kinds of things that our mods find funny.

An Exchange (like IBWT), that charges 0.6% fee (including VAT), would actually be charging 0.5% fee, the 0.1% is the VAT included into the fee. And this 0.1% is the amount that such an Exchange would be paying as VAT to Mr (or Mrs) HMRC tax person.

0.5% +20% (of 0.5%, which is 'VAT included' = 0.1%) = 0.6%

The reality is that the only reason McGann was not dismissed as non-cannon is because they showed McCoy's regeneration into him on stage.  I have no doubt that given the fact that a major plot point in the movie was the fact that the Doctor is half human and that the movie was generally disliked by Doctor Who fans we would have had movements within the fanbase to remove it from cannon if we had not actually seen the regeneration.  That was the defining factor, and trying to now contort that definition into something it never was just to support your preconceived verdict is not acceptable.

Second off, according to your definition if John Hurt now goes on to do audio books with Big Finish he will suddenly become the Doctor.  Besides the fact that there is a terrible way to define the Doctor and there is no precedent to support it, it is also complete BS because the majority of the fanbase would not change their opinion even if he did so.

Edit:  Also, the new series of Doctor Who premiered on 26 March 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as the 9th Doctor.  The first McGann audiobook did not air until 6 August 2005, so this was clearly never a defining factor until now.",0,1385768016,null,0,1385768597,0,cdpv16f,t3_1rnkht,t1_cdpv16f,t1_cdpuhav,null,1428459337,-2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-2
true,meeper88,null,null,"Are you running on a PC?  If so, download and install [uTorrent](http://www.oldapps.com/utorrent.php?old_utorrent=38).  [I'm linking you to an older version of uTorrent because the more recent ones are kinda bloated.]  When it asks for permission to open ports and make an exception in the firewall, say yes.  If you're on Mac or Linux, grab Transmission.  I can't help you with the install there, but it should be roughly the same process.

Not mandatory to do, but nice: Check your port forwarding (connectivity).  In uTorrent, go into Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Connection and get the number for the ""port used for incoming connections""; not sure where it is in Transmission.  Go to [CanYouSeeMe](http://www.canyouseeme.org), enter your port number into ""What Port?"" and click on Check Your Port.  If it comes back successful, you're done; if it's not successful, don't worry about it.  Port forwarding is useful if you're on a private tracker or you're trying to grab a torrent that doesn't have a lot of seeds, but for highly-seeded public torrents, it's a nicety, not a must-have.  However, note that, if you're not connectible, it may take up to 30 minutes to connect to a peer on a low-seeded torrent and start downloading.

At this point, find a torrent of interest (Pirate Bay, KickAssTorrents, etc), download the .torrent file or magnet link, and add it to your client.  The file should download and you should be able to watch your tv/movie.

You'll need to exercise some discretion over what to download.  There are legal torrents out there, and there are illegal torrents.  If you're in the States, the six-strikes risk of an illegal torrent can vary a lot, depending on what the programme is and how much the MPAA/RIAA/etc are interested in going after downloaders.",0,1385768049,null,0,false,0,cdpv1l5,t3_1rpe0g,t1_cdpv1l5,t1_cdptz5d,null,1428459332,4,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,4

We briefly discussed whether any would swallow it, but honestly had no idea the scale it would reached. Our responses in the thread were not pre-meditated, but rather were organic reactions. This one post led to a wholescale meltdown in the subreddit - and yet it's initial intention was to 'punish' EMD. That probably says a lot about the state of this place.

Personally, I was dumbfounded at some of the responses. The post itself was fairly subtle, but our collective responses were so clearly sarcastic - that people were swallowing it honestly surprised me. It's gotten to the point where myself (and many other users on /r/cfcuk) have grown so disillusioned about the state of this subreddit, that taking ourselves seriously was just not important anymore.

Judging by same of the comments here, I think a lot of you need to take a step back. This was a joke, on an internet forum. I think people are taking it too seriously.

true,lomoeffect,null,null,"With the increase in subscribers over the past 1-2 years, the knee-jerk reactions in this sub have been ever-increasing after every bad result. There's also been an influx of, if you like, *contentless* posts - i.e ""Look at my shirt that arrived today"" - which somehow get upvoted to the top. Fair enough, it's a community voting for it, but quite a few prefer threads with a bit more content and actual discussion. Indeed, there's also quite a few comments in here which you would never, ever, ever hear at Stamford Bridge. Anyway, the gist of it is that a new community/private subreddit was formed at /r/cfcuk. 

In /r/cfcuk praise of Benitez doesn't exactly happen, or at least it didn't before I was removed as a member. A post from /u/EnglishMD was found from a while back where this rule was broken. His punishment was to write a pro-Rafa, anti-Mourinho(ish)  piece that was convincing. 

The reaction was interesting. The front page here a few days ago was a bit of a mess with lots of overreactions, thoughtless posts and seemingly the beginnings of a civil war. This ignited a bit further when a mod here temporarily banned a user who submitted a Michael Jackson reaction gif. I'll leave you to decide whether that was just or unjust but I think a huge amount of people haven't realised that he wasn't really banned for that - more for his/hers [preceding comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1rilj0/match_thread_basel_v_chelsea_nov_26_1945_gmt/cdnn2xv) which reads:

&gt; seeing Lampard starting consistently makes me a bit sick

Many failed to see the vaguely obvious sarcasm in /u/EnglishMD's original post (and all of the comments from him and various members of /r/cfcuk) so consequently it turned into a convoluted mess. There was a reaction against /u/lachienupape calling for his head and so he 'resigned' as a mod. A shame because, in spite of some of the contentless posts, this subreddit remains one of the best run of all clubs. /r/Gunners have had a terrible, terrible power crazy mod in the past and its hurt that particular community badly. Therefore we should be thankful to all the mods here although ultimately /u/lachienupape going is his decision.

Dun dun dun. And here we are now. No surprises that the knee-jerk reactions have continued into this thread as well.

Other stuff you probably know but is worth repeating: take photos of every blemish and damage you can find before you move in, and e-mail copies to the lettings agent or landlord on the day. If you're really short on cash, avoid agents as on top of their £150-200 fees they'll drive the rent up as the landlord will have to pay them 10% of it. Also, don't expect the agent to mediate between you and a landlord - they are essentially promoters who put people in touch and charge them for it; they aren't obligated to mediate disputes and will sometimes warn you of this.

If possible, get an assured shorthold tenancy agreement - this gives you a lot of rights such as 24 hours' notice before the landlord can enter, and 2 months' notice from the landlord to end the tenancy. Avoid properties that the landlord is living in - you'll probably become an excluded occupier, and have no rights at all. Have a good read of [Shelter's advice](http://england.shelter.org.uk/) to tenants.

With winter coming, features such as double glazing, loft insulation, cavity walls, and gas central heating are very important. A well-insulated (read: recently built) house is much cheaper to heat.

If you drive, check out the parking situation for the present and the future - the council are expanding the Residents Parking Zones across the city, so you could find yourself charged to park on the street outside your door, or unable to do so at all if someone else gets a permit. Areas with cramped parking are likely to push up your insurance fees.

Remember to factor in the cost of transport from home to uni/work, as a cheap place can prove expensive if it's too far from everything else.

Once you're in a house, the most common issue for people to fall out over is chores. If possible, get a rota set up for cleaning the communal spaces - you may want to share resources such as toilet roll and washing powder, but don't push it if people want to use their own supplies, as it can be hard to keep track of who's taking their fair share from a communal supply.

Pay rent by standing order, not by cash unless you get a signed receipt each time from the landlord. Some landlords buy to let then leave the country, so make sure they would be around for this. You want proof of regular payments, as well as your tenancy agreement on paper. Most banks will withhold standing order payments until the next working day if they fall on the weekend - either make sure the landlord is aware of this, or keep track of when payments are due and alter them manually as they come. Make sure your deposit is secured in a [government-authorised scheme](http://www.depositprotection.com/).",0,1385771551,null,0,false,0,cdpw8il,t3_1rqgz5,t1_cdpw8il,t1_cdpvj59,null,1428458703,3,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,3

For example an Act of Parliment might legalise a certain act when 'it is reasonable and just to do so. The courts will then often develop 'tests' for finding out what 'reasonable' means in the context of the Act and then go on to create a legal precedent that other cases will have to follow (however higher courts could over rule lower courts precedents). The way law develops is really interesting and worth looking in to, although I'm only really familiar with Scots Law, I'm pretty sure English laws develop the same way with regards to how judges and courts can set precedents which become law.

true,Machinax,dalek,Dalek,"Given that ""The Day of the Doctor"" ended with a new dawn for *Doctor Who*, I can't see Steven Moffat handing the reins over for a while. I mean, it took him three years to bring the ""Silence Will Fall"" arc to its conclusion, and the ""Gallifrey Stands"" story should be much bigger than that. 

So, assuming that Moffat wants to wrap up the ""Gallifrey Stands"" story on his own before handing the show over to someone else, I can't imagine that ""Gallifrey Stands"" will be wrapped up by the end of Series 8. 

If I had to guess, I think Moffat would keep running the show until 2015, the tenth anniversary of the return of *Doctor Who*. It won't be a ""Day of the Doctor"" blitz, but it'll be a smaller celebration that will still allow for some larger than life, over-the-top plot development - like, perhaps, the Doctor finding Gallifrey again. 

At that point, Moffat could hand the keys over to his successor, who will have a new template with which to write *Doctor Who*: Gallifrey is back, the Time Lords are back. Enjoy.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"I regard to your last comments, I believe it is a much more complicated problem than just ignoring the kids and trolls. 

The reasons I think this

* The upvote system which is incorrectly used (popular opinions upvoted instead of those that encourage discussion)
* You can't tell anyones demographic features on the internet unless they declaratively state them
  * Therefore you don't know who is more of an authority on a subject other than their karma and posting history, unless you are willing to search hard enough and reference what they have said with actual research in the field. 
   * But even that is subject to upvotes and downvotes based on popular opinion. 
* It is primarily a form of entertainment and many don't contribute on Reddit using critical thought

Which I believe, on this subreddit, leads to this:

1. A statement is posted. 
2. Whether that statement is correct, incorrect, founded in actual knowledge or expertise or not.... if people agree with it. It gets upvoted. 
3. Those with little experience in the matters pertaining to the issue see the top comment in lieu of critically evaluate the points (a case of the most, not the totality) and assume the knowledge to be correct. 
4. Take the popular opinion and regurgitate
5. continue the cycle of the popular opinion. 
6. Amass a group of those who agree. 
7. Continue the cycle. A la Mata (I could talk for days as to why I believe he is not as effective for the team anymore)


This happens regularly on the sub and any form of correcting those who are incorrect are seen as condescending snide pricks, although I would admit on Reddit recently, I have been a massive snide prick. Those who then challenge the though are downvoted; this is only bad as it could reduce the visibility of an important or pertinent point. 

The main offenders of spouting recycled rubbish believe they are being vindicated for their opinions and believe more in their rhetoric.

Nigel from England is a third generation Chelsea fan whose family has lived in London for over a century? Fine. Eric from Canada became a chelsea fan when he played them in Fifa 07? Fine. 


Every person has an equal opinion and should be considered an equal fan. If somebody is a ""fan"" and they can't name 3 players on the team, then i can see you taking issue. It is not your job to look down your nose at people and decide, ""AndytheAlbatross, You suck and aren't a chelsea fan"".

&gt; I agree, Who is very much dumber now, though it had moments in the Davies era that were kind of interesting.

True. My mistake, though, was assuming that as time goes on, the stories and the population (see *the Flynn Effect*) would get smarter.

{sob}


&gt; Midnight was good and I thought the Daleks getting religion was very pointed social comment,

It was. Even if it didn't really make sense in the story; Daleks are supposed to be conditioned from creche to shell.

&gt; Children of Earth was excellent.

Yeah. *Well*. Certainly better than *Miracle Day*.

&gt; Sci-fi series in general have dumbed down, just look at Star Trek and Star Wars.

... I *really try not to*. 2009 *Star Trek* convinced me to never spend another penny on *Star Trek* ever again. *Into Darkness* was the first ever Trek I couldn't bring myself to go see; not in the cinemas, not even as a pirate video.

&gt; I'm not a Potter fan, haven't read the books, though I have seen a couple of the movies on TV. I found them a bit insular and snobby to be honest, maybe it would make sense if I'd gone to public school. The last films that I would think of as actual sci-fi were Moon and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. For the masses, sci-fi means an adventure film with a space theme, lots of computers and lazer guns.

... yes. I've had conversations with people who don't qualify *Doctor Who* as science-fiction. The only thing worse than that is the validity of their arguments as applied to *Doctor Who* post-2006.

&gt; Anyway, I still think you take it too seriously.

We all gotta have hobbies.

&gt; But you're sincere about it, so I have no right to judge. In fact I respect that, even if I don't take the same approach.

And you're probably the first person (who wasn't aligned as I am) to take *that* attitude.

That gives me almost as much hope as meeting the people who **do** feel the same. Thank you. And... well, thank you. It's *refreshing*.

That ""long range forecast"" was never more than a trend guessing-game to help corporations and government plan the next few months. As this blog states, that was always more like predicting odds for a horse race than what the public considers a 'forecast'. Several possibilities are listed (warmer/colder than average), with odds given for each, and any one of them could still happen.

Then some fuckwit journalist noticed these predictions were public, wrote a whole load of scientifically-illiterate voodoo, and the Met Office responded to all the shit being flung at them by promptly **closing long-range trend forecasting to the public.**

They still do it, as this piece demonstrates, and it's still useful for those working in logistics etc. I just don't get to read it on their website anymore.  
So they come up with a range of possibilities, for a single particular winter the shortest-odds possibility isn't the one that occurs, and you reckon they should just *give up?*

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Staffing numbers are a little white lie that charities have to tell.

I worked at a fairly prominent UK-based international charity which had 300 staff in the UK at the time.

Many years ago they arranged a small convention with all arms of the charity setting up stands and meetings showing off what the charity did. Education programs, clean-water and well building activities, things like that. They invited all their donors, both regular and one-time, to turn up to see the good work that they're doing, hoping for a donation-boosting bonanza. It turned into a PR disaster.

The regular donors who turned up were horrified by how large the charity was - imagining it to be a much smaller 'close-knit' operation run by grannies and helpful volunteers. Many decided that their donations were just going towards paying people's salaries and bureaucracy rather than going directly to the people they were supposedly helping. 

As a direct result a new policy was brought in that said all Heads of Department were to be the only points of contact for the outside world, vastly reducing the public facing aspect of the business. They continue to work very hard to pretend to be small, focused, caring, and individual when in reality it's actually a fairly large organisation and all that entails.

There are a whole load of other 'little white lies' they tell to get donation numbers up. I left after 3 months after realising that while they do a lot of good, morally I didn't like the stories they span to donors.",0,1385777011,null,0,1385777376,0,cdpy2di,t3_1rpscc,t1_cdpy2di,t1_cdpv1oe,null,1428457850,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
true,TheCheshireCody,adipose,Adipose,"&gt;I am *relatively* sure that John Hurt's role only exists because Eccleston refused to participate in the 50th anniversary, and they're having Hurt play a proxy for 9's role in (presumably) the Time War, because 9 isn't going to be doing it himself.

Nine was never the War Doctor. He was never the one who fought in it and ended it. At the beginning of his season there are references to the fact that he is newly regenerated and still not familiar with his body. Also, the animosity between Eccleston and the DW execs had been acrimonious for years, since long before the anniversary special was in the earliest planning stages, so it's pretty unlikely that Eccleston was ever a legitimate possibility to appear in it. There was never even so much as a rumor that he might appear.

I actually remember seeing that /u/EnglishMD post on r/soccer and at the time I did think something was slightly ""off"" as the post seemed completely uncharacteristic compared to /u/EnglishMD's previous contributions. However I chucked it up to the 'fickleness of fans', rolled my eyes at the self righteous responses of ""typical Chelsea fans"" from the r/soccer anti-Chelsea brigade and moved on to other matters.

Having learned more of the situation, I gotta say that I'm somewhat saddened. Saddened that some people find amusement in such petty, immature actions done for no other reason than to make fools out of people; saddened that those involved see absolutely nothing wrong with deceiving others so they themselves can sit around and pretend that they’re better supporters than those fickle, ""plastic Chelsea fans""; and also saddened that a committed moderator has felt the need to withdraw from something that he seemingly loved and that a once decent community is left divided, angry and hurt, all because of a stupid, pointless and just downright mean-spirited joke. Bravo! Here’s a round of applause for all of you.  

And to top it off, banning a random member as a joke? I expect that kind of stupidness from teenage, mean girls who think it's funny to play pranks on innocent people, not from self professed supporters who claim to be ""fans longer than many have been alive"". I mean really, what’s next? Spreading rumours about random members on r/soccer? Hacking into members’ account and posting nude photos under them? 

The one solace I'll take from this is that while there’s no online community that's 'perfect', thankfully there are many other Chelsea communities where the moderators (while being staunch supporters) are also professionals who wouldn’t engage in silly behaviour like this.

I walk past women in the street who are quite frankly stunning, and I would love to bend them over there and then and violate them in ways that would make Ben Dover blush. But I don't casually rape lasses whom I find attractive as I know its morally wrong and I use my willpower to resist the urge.

Now there are functioning pedophiles/ephebophiles out there. That is folk who are sexually attracted to children and teenagers who don't act on their urges and impulses. Sadly Ian Watkins is not one of them.

And it shouldn't be treated as a mental illness either. It wasn't that long ago that folk were getting lobotomys to cure them of their homosexuality (probably still going on in some parts of the USA).

Lorries are massive and it takes a lot of fuel to shift them. Accelerating uses much more fuel than cruising. In order to save fuel, drivers set their cruise control to the optimum speed for their vehicle and don't touch the brake unless they absolutely have to. The optimum speed for any given lorry is defined as 1 mph faster than the vehicle in front. This is why they will suddenly pull out and then spend the next half an hour in lane 2 while everyone else has to squeeze past in lane 3.

Now I'm not suggesting that lorry drivers should be made to drive properly. I'm suggesting that the requirements for lorries are fundamentally incompatible with a road network designed to be used by a variety of vehicles.

2) the way he handled this situation disgusts me. i'm a mod in a different sub, and the way i try to conduct myself is different from the way i would normally. when i go into other subs i can say the things i want, act the way i want. calling users ""cunts"" and the like shows no class.

3) there is no end to his retorts. the dude is just so low class that he can't bite the bullet and accept anyone's criticism for his disrespectful and downgrading remarks and actions. 

4) i don't care how much he's contributed to the sub, that in no way convinces me of his character. nor his ability to moderate an internet community.

5) your skewed perspective because you know him just adds to how silly this post is. if you want to be talked to with respect, you better insure that you talk to others with the respect you wish they would bestow upon you.

6) this will not end the input he has on the sub, it merely brings him down from his moderator pedestal that he so covets, to the lowly level of us normal fans..

[You're fucking kidding, right?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics)

&gt; Seriously though, there have been so many varieties in strange aliens and humanoids throughout the years. You also have to keep in mind that while at the time Classic Who was definitely not a ""sexist"" show, there was never any way they would have cast a woman as the Second Doctor, plus canonically wise it doesn't seem weird that they could end up the same gender twice or three times; e.g. Romana I, II, and III.

That's exactly what I'm saying.  It's pretty damn consistent that time lords regenerate to be the same gender every regeneration, with the exception of the Corsair who was mentioned in one throwaway line.

&gt; But come on, even you admitted (somewhat...) that he's ended up male THIRTEEN TIMES.

Because he's a male time lord?  I don't get why this is so controversial.  The show has never shown a male to female or female to male regeneration.  There's absolutely no reason to introduce one for a character who's been perfectly comfortable with his gender for 1000 years.

&gt; In a wide, vast, impossibly crazy universe, how is that even really feasible unless the showrunners had some sort of bias towards casting men over women?

It's feasible because he's been a man 12 other times.  Because he's a man.  You're a man (or a woman) and unless you're transgendered, you're not going to go through steps to change that.

And casting men to play a character that's always been male is sexist?  Were the showrunners of Bewitched sexist for not casting a woman to play Darrin after Dick York left?  What about the producers of the Harry Potter movies not recasting a woman in place of Richard Harris for Dumbledore?  I mean he's a wizard, so he can figure out how to change gender, right?

&gt; Hell, I'd even argue don't make him looking human every incarnation, but knowing their time, budget and the need to make the Doctor the very least partially relatable to us, I won't go that far.

He's very human-like.  That's an important part of his character.

Were the showrunners of Bewitched sexist for not casting a woman to play Darrin after Dick York left? What about the producers of the Harry Potter movies not recasting a woman in place of Richard Harris for Dumbledore? I mean he's a wizard, so he can figure out how to change gender, right?

Wait what? Two very obviously human characters, whether they're powerful magical figures, are not the same as a time lord who can live thousands of years and twist the very fabric of time itself, traverse between universes, and destroy threats much scarier than even Voldemort with a lift of oooh sorry, *his* finger.

&gt;You're fucking kidding, right? 

Whatever. I try to not get myself too deep into that rabbit hole (lest I go insane trying to figure out the reasoning of pedantic crazies like Laurelai) but I stand corrected. Thanks I guess.

&gt;Because he's a male time lord? I don't get why this is so controversial. The show has never shown a male to female or female to male regeneration. There's absolutely no reason to introduce one for a character who's been perfectly comfortable with his gender for 1000 years.

The show isn't the only thing that's canon. And that made me laugh, because in fact the very first emotion Matt Smith's Doctor shows is surprise at him possibly turning into a woman, but I see zero disgust or horror in his facial expression and I doubt he would have let it get to him on a genuinely emotional or mental level if he actually had turned into a woman. *She* would then move on from the initial awkwardness within the better half of the season. You... know... what? That could have been a good opportunity for the writers to come up with ways to show her own character development and struggles to adapt to today's world and sexism as a Time Lady. Goodness knows she'd kick Mr Connolly's ass if he turned up again.

I'm pointing out that if they wanted to, people could easily find ways to make them female, but that's no reason to do it.  The Doctor isn't a woman and hasn't been for 12 (and what will be 13) incarnations.  There's no reason to change that since he's clearly comfortable with his gender identity.

&gt; The show isn't the only thing that's canon. And that made me laugh, because in fact the very first emotion Matt Smith's Doctor shows is surprise at him possibly turning into a woman, but I see zero disgust or horror in his facial expression and I doubt he would have let it get to him on a genuinely emotional or mental level if he actually had turned into a woman.

I took that as him being slightly delirious due to the regeneration.  And I feel that if he had been completely comfortable as a woman it would have taken away from the humanity of the character.  He's an alien that outside of his immortality and second heart is essentially human, and human beings aren't comfortable with randomly waking up the opposite sex.

If you want Murphy Brown in space, find a different show.  What the hell do you mean by ""struggles to adapt to today's world and sexism?""  She takes a job as a mechanic or an IT professional and goes on a diatribe at the end of each episode?  We get a ""very special episode"" where the Doctor almost experiences a rape?  Do you see what a complete fucking disaster the show would be if you made the entire show revolve around the main character's gender?  It's almost as bad as another suggestion I saw for a black Doctor that suggested making aliens responsible for slavery.

[Essex raceway](http://www.arena-essex-raceway.co.uk) may fulfill some of those motorsport urges, [Lakeside shopping](http://intu.co.uk/lakeside) is probably the biggest shopping centre in Essex and actually not too bad. [Adventure Island](http://www.adventureisland.co.uk) a 'nice' theme park in [Southend-on-Sea](http://www.visitsouthend.co.uk/) , these are probably the places that spring to mind first..

With regards to getting around, most buses are run by [first](http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/essex/) , i would say the main route is the 100 which links Lakeside shopping centre, to [Chelmsford](http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/) via [Basildon](http://www.basildon.gov.uk/) and [Grays](https://www.thurrock.gov.uk/) . 

Buses are not the most reliable in Essex and will cost you. Your rail routes are generally worse the more north of the county you go. Two main lines, the [C2C](http://www.c2c-online.co.uk/) in the South and [Greater Anglia](http://www.greateranglia.co.uk/) in the North. Travelling to the capital is usually a 40 / 50 minute experience depending on things going your way.

Road links can be a nightmare during peak times due to people travelling to and from london. A127 &amp; A13 being the biggest in the South (with of course the m25)

[Essex County Council](http://www.essex.gov.uk/Pages/Default.aspx) cover most of the geography as the upper tier authority apart from Southend and Thurrock. Essex County Council also is the education authority with [Anglia Ruskin](http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home.html) and [The University of Essex](http://www.essex.ac.uk/) being the main uni's i can think of.

[Essex Police](http://www.essex.police.uk/home.aspx) will keep you in check, we also have 101 for non-emergencies.

[Broomfield](http://www.meht.nhs.uk/about-us/) is your hospital in Chelmsford.  [South Essex Partnership Trust](http://www.sept.nhs.uk/) and [North Essex Partnership Trust](http://www.nepft.nhs.uk/) provide mental health services in the areas.

The politics in Essex is mainly focused towards conservative, with pockets of labour (mainly in Harlow, Thurrock and Basildon). UKIP is making quite the appearance now too.

Speaking in general you will find Essex has a big ""north""/""south"" divide, with the north of the county generally more affluent than the South - Basildon, Southend, Thurrock and [Harlow](http://www.harlow.gov.uk/) are probably the more 'hard up' areas, but they are not too bad in the greater scheme of things, and i personally prefer them because the people are a bit more down to earth.

So, he wrote the 50th.  

As a stand alone episode, I think it's pretty great to watch.  I enjoyed it.  It's not perfect, and it has some very uneven plotting (everything with the Zygons, for example), but it hits all of the emotional spots I'd want the 50th to hit.  As a piece of the nuWho continuity, it is an utter disaster that makes no sense.  It yanks the rug on everything RTD built the show into, essentially in the service of giving Moffat access to the storylines he wants to tell going forward.  There is literally no way to reconcile the Council and Rassilon's actions in ""The End of Time"" with the events of the 50th, because in order for them to have a plan to get out of the time lock, they must first *be* time locked.

I am thinking when the Moment (a super-powerful, sentient weapon with unknown capabilities) opened the tear in reality (as 10 in the 50th special put it, just before 11 came through) it linked the two universes (the one where Gallifrey falls and the one where Gallifrey falls no more) and the two universes merged in a way where the Doctor remembers destroying his Gallifrey but has saved a different Doctor's Gallifrey which wasn't time locked in that universe (the decision to time lock the Time War created two universes, one where it is and one where it isn't time locked).

What the 13 Doctors did to Gallifrey is create a pocket universe (like in S07E09 ""Hide"") and now all he has to do is find the point in space where his universe and the pocket universe are linked.  

The stuff with the Master also happened, but with the time-locked Gallifrey/Time Lords before the Doctor destroyed everything.

When Lucy tossed the potion at him he hadn't fully reformed his old body so all the regeneration energy was leaking out, like a wound that wouldn't stop bleeding. His line about ""The Master of disguise, stuck looking like *this*!"" is him saying that if he were to try to regenerate now he might not have enough ""juice"", so to speak, to complete the process. EranLuck touched on how the Master knows some of the Forbidden Jutsu of the Time Lords(There are several Classic Who episodes dealing with some of the darker secrets of Gallifrey) which covers how he's able to eat just about anything and turn it into energy. And during 10's regeneration we see that the energy realesed *can* be destructive, as well as all the admonitions to companions to ""stay back"" in New Who.

The big hole in this is, of course, that the FX are wrong for regeneration. They are however, consistent with the FX of his rebirth scene, So perhaps The Master found some kind of Corn Oil substitute for the Petrol that all the other Time Lords use.(I'm an American who just used the term ""petrol""...Damn you BBC America! -Shakey Fist- :)""",0,1385806914,null,0,false,0,cdq5t8h,t3_1rr3um,t1_cdq5t8h,t3_1rr3um,null,1428454222,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

[From this source](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/disability_living_allowance_reform_personal_independence_payment-28993):

&gt;.....By the end of the period (October 2018 as currently planned), the Government estimates that 1.75 million DLA reassessments will have been processsed. 510,000 recipients are expected to get a higher award under PIP compared to their DLA claim. 270,000 will see no monetary difference. 510,000 will have a reduced payment and 450,000 will have their payments removed altogether.

The government's own estimate is that 450,000 people will have their entitlement removed on change-over from DLA to PIP.  Granted, a large number of these are likely to be 'marginal' cases, but given ATOS and the DWP's past form, there is likely to be a reasonable number of people in genuine need that will see their claims cancelled - at least for the time it takes to go tribunal.  Assuming 1 in 5 of those people are in-work at least some of them are not going to be able to continue to do so with the financial support it offers.  Whether that number is the 50,000 quoted is impossible to say from the figures we have.

&gt; DLA is not awarded based on whether you're employed or claiming benefits. DLA is awarded purely based on need. You can be unemployed or a millionaire entrepreneur or anything inbetween and still qualify for DLA.

I'm well aware of that.  Did you have point to make?

true,dispatcher_83,tardis,TARDIS,"I think you are giving too much credit to the conscience of The Moment - as far as the actions *after* the 50th.  The Moment was a weapon, unknown to the creators or ancients at the time of it's creation it developed a conscience, hence the presence to takes to the wielder.  It is unknown how much The Moment really knows since it mentions the Doctor hiding his actions from the Tardis - leading us to believe she is aware the Tardis is sentient.  Also how many children are on Gallirey - not an important question, but one she knows the Doctor has asked himself time and time again.  It could be said that Rose is what starts the Doctor torward a path of redemption rather than destruction.  Without Rose he wouldn't have faced the Daleks again and come to a different outcome (choice for the dalek, rather than death), personal loss compared to just losing a companion (when she was locked in the alternate dimension and when the Doctor met Sarah Jane - making him face the consequences of his actions) and down to road to Amy and Rory where they travel with the Doctor but still have seperate lives rather than completely abandoning their life and going on with the Doctor until they tire of it, die, are lost, or he gives them up - this ideally was supposed to be a different outcome for a companion and why we see Clara still having a life and traveling with the Doctor what seems like a ""part-time job""

I think that is why it chose Rose over anyone else.  Rose was the catalyst for everything changing in the doctor's life post time war leading up to the 50th.  It could be said and has been said by a lot that 9 goes directly to london - but we don't know that for sure.  All we know is that he is traveling alone and hasn't seen his face.  What if it's a year later?  5 years later?  20 years later?  It's entirely plausible that the Doctor has been traveling for years, alone, wondering around with the guilt weighing heavily on him until one day he encounters the living plastic.  His first action?  Same as his last - eliminate the enemy.  It's only because of Rose that a different outcome is reached - think about it, how many times does the 9th Doctor actually use force to stop an enemy after meeting Rose?  All in all it's the course 9 leads to Rose is what eventually leads them all to the outcome they achieve in the 50th rather than using the moment.  Since we'll never know how his path may have been differently all we can assume is the moment left the bad wolf clues for a bigger purpose than just the finale in the 1st serial.  The War Doctor doesn't know her, 10 never sees her, so this is more for the audience to understand the importance of how and what Bad Wolf is.

edit: it's also possible the moment did all of this out of self preservation since it is a weapon and would cease to exist after it was used or that it did all of this to save everyone on gallifrey (hence the conscience part of it being a weapon of mass destruction that feels empathy) in hopes that it would work changing the past with the BAD WOLF signs and with future doctors.",0,1385807931,null,0,1385809579,0,cdq5xzb,t3_1rrf39,t1_cdq5xzb,t3_1rrf39,null,1428454160,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13

true,[deleted],null,null,"Having worked with paedophiles, I can see your point. On the one hand, it seems only right that those who want help should find it readily available but it can be very difficult to assess whether the motivation to change is genuine. In my experience many paedophiles successfully convince themselves that their actions are somehow justified or beyond their control. ""It's not my fault"" is something I have heard many times, often blaming their own traumatic childhood experiences, depression or dependence on drugs/alcohol. Once they get into this mindset things quickly escalate from ""it's OK for me to look at child porn because it's just images"" to ""it's OK for me to befriend the neighbours kid because I haven't touched him"" to ""OK, yes I touched him but I didn't hurt him"" and so on. They sit in therapy sobbing uncontrollably, telling you that they hate themselves for the thoughts they are having, that they will do whatever it takes to not hurt a child but then the next day you get a call from the police/probation service informing you that they have broken the terms of their licence by hanging around the local playground attempting to befriend a young child or that the whole time you've been working with them they've continued to access child porn. There is a fine line between empathising and normalising or condoning their urges, particularly when someone is constantly looking for excuses to act on those urges.
