Makes sense but then why apply for something you know you haven't got a reasonable chance at getting? It does depend on the job / industry but if you *know* you lack the skills requested then you shouldn't be hit so hard when you're inevitably not successful. It's tough, but it *is* logical. 

&gt; recruiters will rarely let someone thru without all the 'needs' ticked, whereas a direct employer will occasionally feel something from an application, and decide to give someone slightly underqualified, but with that something special a chance.

Again, depends on the industry. 

It's at this point I can divulge something; I *am* a recruiter for the IT sector - used to work in the engineering sector. 

Going back to your earlier point - whilst I was in engineering - I had a 14 year old boy who was still in school apply for my advertised job - which was working on brand new hull designs for naval submarines. Unsurprisingly he didn't get put through. 

More recently in IT I've had countless applications from people who really do lack the core skills for the role (say: knowledge of Java code development, when they've never touched Java in their lives). In these instances the rejection is unavoidable because 9 times out of 10 it's a waste of everyone's time to go ahead with that application despite the obvious lack of skills (hell, the companies we work for would just reply with a short email saying 'where's the Java' - and who can blame them? 

We're not all brain-dead though. We do occasionally make an application for someone who lacks the core skill of the job but who has relevant experience elsewhere (perhaps they've worked for a transport company before, have applied for a transport company again, etc.). 

Ultimately though it's our job to wade through up to hundreds of applications for a job (this is not an exaggeration) and pick out the handful who the client should consider interviewing. 

It *is* sad that I very frequently hear 'I don't have this skill, but am sure I could pick it up' - however true that might be, I might have ten or twenty or thirty people who *already have that skill*. There's nothing wrong with asking, but some people do become indignant that we won't give them a shot despite the shortcomings. The trouble is; we *know* what the answer will be - that's our trade.

Yeah, I fully understand your dilemma, and I'm not blaming you, I'm blaming the silly system we have at present, making jobseekers hit targets of number of jobs applied for, when they could far better increase their chances by applying for say five jobs they want and are suited to, than desperately spamming fifty to hit a target with the exact same cv and covering letter.

Personally, I'm looking to get my foot in the door, simple 1st level tech support, I've recently got call centre experience, and I've been building PCs, doing repairs, installs etc for over 15 years, however, it's not been in a work environment.  I choose not to mention that part on the CV, just that I have 15 years experience with hardware, software and Windows.  It's all true, and I genuinely think I have a lot to offer people.  However, I need to get to that interview stage to sell myself.

I'm fairly sure I've got a lot of useful skills, including the ability to be fairly knowledgable in IT, while still being able to explain things in 'layman's terms' to older people and those without computer skills.

I recently helped a woman who just couldn't get her internet to work, and BT wanted £120 to come and look at it, and instead of burying myself in IP settings and network configuration, I tested the line with another phone, and it was dead. Looked around the room and asked about a socket on the other wall - 'dunno'.

Tried it, all was fine, half an hour later, router set up, phone connected and tested, and free internet security software being installed.  Turns out she'd been paying for it for 2 months and never been used.

So many IT problems, it's a case of troubleshooting the customer first, whilst keeping it respectful and polite.

Sorry, rather wandered off topic, but maybe I'm just frustrated at not knowing where to direct myself, maybe there's a better direction than basic 1st line support.  In the end, I'm mainly interested in helping people use the technology they've invested in and making things easier for those who find it difficult.

Oh and lastly, the reason people apply for things they're not qualified for or suited to, is that once you've hit everything in your area online and in the papers that you're capable of doing, you then sometimes have to do more to hit your target, or lose the money you need to live on.

This will only get worse as they move the targets from an estimated 20 hours a week to 35 hours.  The problem isn't most people not trying hard enough, it's that the jobs aren't there.  But that would indicate that somehow there's a problem with the job market, it's far better to blame the unemployed.

I was in China this week and it is clear that the new Chinese leadership are focused on the French president's visit, along with a large number of French companies looking for business. In the past, UK prime ministers have met with the Dalai Lama without the deterioration in relations with China that we are now seeing. For all of their initial boasts and bluster, the UK government has lacked a strategic or a joined-up approach to China since it came to office, and that's now showing.""

The article then continues to highlight the difference between how Padre Brown treated the DL as a spiritual leader and how Cameron met him just standardly, and offended the Chinese so grossly that they abandoned a meeting, but met the French PM and signed multi billion dollar deals with them... 

Lets be perfectly clear, France is **very much** tomorrows sick man of Europe, there is literally nothing that they can offer the Chinese aside from LV deals and some quasi socialist idealistic support in the west. This is not a vote of confidence, or punishment for the UK, this is **charity** and the buying of support with common sympathisers.

The Chinese do not give a damn about the Dalai Lama, they have Tibet and the West is in such a Financial rut that leaders trott over there cup in hand looking for ""Deals""... They do not care one jot whether Cameron meets the DL in whatever format, because, frankly, they know that we want their business. So if China holds Tibet, then what are we going to do about it? Sanctions... 

You see the media report a Chinese reaction of outrage and anger over the DL meet, but this is the communist party which has been doing excellent business with the capitalist americans for a long time now, so dont read anything into posturing. They are business men first and foremost and then ideology comes into play. Outrage is a manufactured negotiating tactic.

**The bottom line** is that the Yuan is becoming an internationalised currency and we want to be the main trading centre for it. Paris is campaigning for it to, but we are in pole position. **This is THE story**, but we only see the derivative factors reported on, with a side dish of irrelevance to boot.

How should it have been reported?

Cameron meeting rescheduled as Hollande receives state visit
French economy boosted by Chinese Trade Deals amongst backdrop of Yuan trading competition between London and Paris.

Other answers... do i criticise the DM and Telegraph...?

Well in my second post I believe parcelled the guardian alongside the Daily mail in terms of ""level"", so that is hardly a gushing endorsement of either. 

The telegraph, no I admit it, you have me bang to rights but also I would say in my defence, I find them quite boring articles in general, esp on reddit as often they are framed within the cuts context. I do like their football coverage though... if that counts. Also, Dan Hodges I see on Twitter from time to time, bold of the telegraph to employ a Labourite, but no doubt with its own agenda. The telegraph is a bit too old england for my taste... you know, thatched roofs, village well, pint of bitter, alan partridge... its basically the same as the guardian but from the other end of the spectrum


anyway, while this has been fun I must leave this here. Feel free to add, and when I can I will reply, but perhaps later in the week.


**TLDR: UK may be on verge of securing major, major ""once in a few generations"" Finance deal with China ahead of France, while France gets charity trade deals. Guardian spins article to imply that UK is being punished for careless diplomacy by Cameron, when in fact, the French are just collecting their wooden spoon.**

Morgan, is using the club like a cash cow, and if it's true that Saunders was selected due to a friends recommendation then that is infuriating. There was plenty of managers out of work when we needed them; Curbishley, O'Neil, Ray Wilkens, Steve Bruce to name a few (I'm talking both after MM and SS) Yet we always went for the cheap option.

The club makes stupid decisions consistently in regards to players. We decided to loan out Zeli when we desperately needed some midfield depth. Same with Griffiths when we decided to not sign anyone to replace Fletcher (I know Siggy, but he was/is still young when we signed him, and would take time to adapt/gel). We decided to not splash the cash for Jordan Rhodes, when he was exactly what we needed for the championship struggle.

Income Tax and National Insurance aren't a damn savings account ... they are a social contribution to help society as a whole, not specifically the individual.

The amount they paid in, even considering interest and compensating for inflation means that their entire contributions over 45 years will keep them at the same standard of living for 4.5 years ONLY after retirement. After that, they are simply a drain on society. And it stands to reason that the more well-off pensioners who've been able to take all the correct vitamins and supplements as they aged will naturally be more healthy and last longer than the poor ones.

""We have recently had a complaint concerning the My Little Pony Blind packs we sell and this is the official reply; My wife rightly stopped a couple of customers from scamming the blind packs using codes from the internet.

It’s absolutely not fair that the likes of them find a way to find the rare ones and deprive children whose parents then have to pay a premium on ebay for the ones they need. I believe she had let you go through the packs in the past in order to complete their sets; however when they won’t buy what’s on display and pounce on a new box armed with a list of codes found on the internet then that's just not Cricket. It’s as dishonest as it is low and it’s like taking Candy from a Baby.

true,lokkenmor,null,null,"I don't mind a bit of honest begging. Someone who's just sat down, put a cup in front of them and just asking people as they go by - they're usually polite, not obstructive and just trying anything to make a bit of money to feed their habits.

I admit, I'll give the ""honest beggars"" money now and again but I don't give them it for free, I buy some of their time. Something that I think a lot of people miss is the fact that beggars and the homeless are treated like pariahs, no-one talks to them, no one looks at them, they're just silently ignored, judged and condemned. If I'm giving them money, I'll sit for a bit and talk to them; ask them how they are, if they're getting help, if they have demons, what they've got going for them; just trying to make them feel like people for a while again. It's better than just throwing some money at them and telling them to help themselves, like all they need is a quick kickstarter to get them back on their feet, into employment and on their road to whatever success they can manage. It doesn't work like that. Most of them won't ever manage to make it out of that hole they've found themselves in - I have to accept this because I've been doing charity work for about three years now and I see the same faces again and again and again - but it doesn't mean they should be shunned.

I do have a problem with the guys who sit next to cash machines because that is a direct and very obvious attempt to force a guilt-trip on people. I've had a fella, back in Glasgow, watch me take out money and ask me if I could spare him a tenner. Needless to say I told him to get fucked for being a cheeky bastard, pointing out to him that (at the time) that tenner had cost me just under an hour of my life, grinding hard in a shitty job and why should I just hand it over to him for a few seconds of pleading. I like to think I re-aligned some of his perceptions about money and entitlement but probably not.

I play a game with the people looking for bus fare, or money for the telephone box, or whatever whenever I have the time, the patience or the inclination. I ask them where they're going, why they're here, how they got here, where they live. Basically just tripping them up. Then I get to the questions about why they actually need to money. At this point they should have either clocked that you're on your game and know what they're about but frequently they're too addled to tell, so they keep up with the lies. A couple of times they come clean and tell me whatever demon they're trying to feed, then I talk to them in the same way that I described above with the ""honest"" street beggars but it's difficult because these kinds of beggars aren't typically homeless, they have support, they milk the state for it and they just want a bit extra to supplement their habits. These one's are impossible to get through to because they tend to be higher functioning than the others and chasing the fix as a recreational activity rather than a coping strategy. Something akin to the difference between desperation and despair.

The programming side is easy I found. I'm not sure if you'll be doing the same course, but we started off by learning Visual Basic (which isn't ideal) but it's a breeze if you really understand all of it. If you don't, find someone who can help you, download Visual Studio, and practice some more in your own time.
For theory work (non-programming), it helps a LOT if you have even the most basic prior knowledge about hardware, networks, binary, hexadecimal, etcetera. Find out about each part of the computer, what they do and how, and you'll be well set. You can just Google them or take a free course online, they're not that hard to find.
Geography can be easy if you really understand what's going on. Just take notes, lots of notes, and highlight key words. I often found the internet isn't greatly useful for Geography so your book will be the key source of all your information. Keep track of all the processes, how they work and why. A lot of it is just logic and memorization of key words. Follow the mark scheme as well. Be very clear and concise with your answers, explain the key words that you use in brackets to show how much you understand them, and USE CASE STUDIES.

No one said that ""corporations are allowed to grab every penny they can, therefore pensioners should be allowed to as well"".

But in actual fact I would say the OP is misguided for another reason, because in fact under the law right now and statements by government actually apply fairly equally to both parties. That is:

* Corporations are asked to pay tax/give money to the govt in a fair way, yet they have no legal obligation to.
* Pensioners are asked to give benefit money back to the govt in a fair way, yet have no legal obligations to.

Arkyl's original statement is only fallacious in the way that they are implying the two groups are being treated differently, when in fact they are not.

And further to this, it's absolutely absurd for IDS to be saying either of these things, and for this article to exist. Not many people or enterprises would really make a concession like this for this reason. It's absurd to ask, it's stupid for a politician to be acting in this way.

true,BenjaminSisko,null,null,"It is a fucking stupid idea. Beyond stupid in fact and any attempt to suggest it is a good idea is a continuance of the incontinent levels of public debate in this country of which your comment is a minor example.

There are several things wrong with this and something one should consider when any politician opens their mouth is why they have said it.

1. They will say it in the hope that potential voters who read fuck all news beyond a headline nor anything else will misconstrue it to mean that they are doing something about it. Which they won't.

2. It implies that there is a gap in policy that will never be addressed because it fundamentally would undermine the nature of how taxes are collected in this country. One's whole life one pays into a pension, in effect. If someone pays in and doesn't receive the benefits associated with national insurance then why the fuck should we be paying it in the first place. Levels of taxation in this country are *astronomical*. For an average person the government is taking way over 60% of everything you earn. Do your own personal finances and you will find that out.

3. The implication by proxy of this statement is that if a person volunteers the few pennies a year they receive from the government then it will be redistributed to those who need it more. Except the pot into which it will be paid is the same one used to subsidise arms dealers and give aid to foreign countries and buy nuclear weapons we don't need and spend on a vast bureaucracy of well paid people and on sending more and more money out of the country in the form of large contracts for IT, Medical, Search and Rescue and so on.

4. The implication they are making use of here is  that there is a moral depravity and shame associated with not struggling from pay day to pay day. Just because you have £50k in the bank and no mortgage doesn't make you rich. Most people on *high* salaries ~60-70k do so in London and that is barely enough to sustain a suitable existence there with your own abode.


5. You say:

&gt; while the rest of us suffer

Exactly the fucking retarded comment they are hoping to make it into the quotes section of the Sun and Mirror. 

What is this suffering which you must endure? Is your TV not big enough? Do you see people around you with nicer things? Do you have to shop at Asda and not Waitrose? Can't you eat in restaurants more than once or twice a week?

If so then you aren't suffering from anything other than status anxiety. Something that is a relatively modern invention.

true,kittysquee,,Belfast,"Well I for one love Belfast. I've lived here for nearly 8 years now (only come from 50 miles down the road though!). The QUB campus is compact so it's not a lot of hassle moving from building to building. The library is brand new and extremely handy to the main building (Lanyon Building). The students union is also newly done up and puts on quite a few gigs and club nights. It is pretty shitty that all the pubs and clubs close at two but to be honest we're all pretty used to that. Quite a few bands come over here but not as many as would come to the mainland but sometimes they'll go to Dublin instead so it's only a couple of hours journey to see them (even flights to the mainland are pretty handy). 

The weather is shit and I've never been to California but it's sounds warm and dry there so I'm sure it would take some getting used to over here but it's generally drizzly and mild most of the time even in the Winter. It doesn't rain absolutely everyday of the year though like some of the people on this thread would have you believe. 

In terms of culture we do have three theatres which would play host to touring West End shows from London at times along with local productions. Quite a few art galleries as well, which open there doors late on the first Thursday night of the month and give out free wine! The Ulster museum situated beside the main QUB building is free entry and is newly done up and is rather nice.

Outdoors- There are quite a few parks around QUB -Botanic Gardens is right behind QUB, small but with a lovely Victoria greenhouse and a hot house which are free to enter. There is also Ormeau Park about a 10 minute walk away from QUB which is larger and lovely to walk around. If you're willing to go a little farther away there is Belvoir forest park, which is lovely. There is also a small park in East Belfast called Victoria Park which does Park Run (http://www.parkrun.org.uk/) a free 5K every Saturday morning if you're into that. 

There are a plethora of gyms around the city. I use DW on Boucher Road (pretty close to QUB) which has good facilities (spacious, clean gym, pool, loads of classes). There is also the PEC which is QUBs own gym which is fairly recently done up and is supposed to be pretty nice now (I haven't been in it since it was done up) and I believe (although I may be mistaken) they have an Olympic sized swimming pool. 

Healthcare- You can join the QUBs doctors surgery as a student. You generally get an appointment for the next day or the day after. We have some excellent hospitals in Northern Ireland and don't forget about the free healthcare ;)

I love Belfast quite simply. It's the city that gave me my education, my job, my friends, my home, and the love of my life. It has it's issues and it's idiots but doesn't everywhere? The people in general are warm and friendly and welcoming. You should give us a chance.

There's not, at least no good one. English law allows for the trial of terrorist offences in Britain regardless of where they were committed. There are a couple of arguments I've heard put forward, but I don't buy them

a) there is insufficient admissible evidence that he is a dangerous criminal. If this is the case, I don't really see why there's an argument over it - innocent until proven guilty is an ancient and inalienable right, it shouldn't be abandoned on the say so of the Government or Security Services of the day. If there is evidence against him that hasn't been obtained through torture, let it be heard in open court and let a jury decide.

b) It's 'not Britain's problem' and so he shouldn't be tried in Britain. Well... ok, I can kind of respect the position, but given the massive costs spend by the Government, both for their legal team and Qatada's legal aid, as well as the cost in detaining/monitoring him we've already spent way more than it would have cost to try and imprison if he was found guilty

I just paid £1600 to insure my 18 year old son for a year for a 1.3L Ford Fiesta and that is with a telematics box. That would be more than 8 weeks wages for his age.

I insured a 3.5L Rover V8 at age 17 for £130 which was just over a weeks wage at the time.

For a start: I am not politically motivated. I have no party preference. As far as I can tell no party in this country even comes close to having their shit together.

I'm doing all this from memory, but as far as i recall the deficit ~2000 was 0, in fact i think there was a surplus. The labour government took that to around £160billion in a decade. Interest on the bonds issued alone cost £50billion. Saving a few hundred thousand a year isn't going to help that. And no, in the case of government, it is not an acceptable argument that every little helps. It doesn't work like that.

We borrowed to finance the loss from ever accumulating debt. Exacerbated it with wars and now we are exacerbating it by allowing demeaning levels of public debate about non issues to get in the way.

It increases stigma and creates ""the poor"" as a separate section of society, to be looked down upon.

Means-testing is hugely inefficient. The savings made by not paying out to the rich are mostly cancelled out by the administration, fraud etc.

When you look at countries which are economically successful, the majority have universalism strongly embedded in their social security.

When it's services rather than cash transfers that we're talking about, services for the poor inevitably become poor services.

A bit of background on the subreddit: It is a piss-take of [*l'Académie Française*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise) (the French Academy) which is an institution which regulates what is and isn't allowed in the French language. They are known for coming up with silly alternatives to English words trying to enter the language. For example when chewing gum came to France, they wanted it to be called *gomme à macher* (literally means chewing gum). Same story with skateboard becoming *planche à roulettes*, or email becoming *courriel*. 

The first paragraph on the sidebar translates to:

""Here we speak rench and only rench because english is poo-poo. The rench language is codified by the Rench Cademy and this forum is monitored by the Vichyssoise of Grammar (Vichy was the government which collaborated during WWII, a reference to grammar nazis) ; all kind of snitching is welcome.""

The rest shows the correct (f)rench terminology to be used instead of English. (Upvote : plusse, hautsuffrage, hautscrutin, etc.)

The Daft Punk css was made after somebody posted Daft Punk's Get Lucky song with the title ""Stupide Voyou - Être chanceux"" which is the literal translation of the title of the artist and song. and a voice-over of the lyrics in French. At the top it says ""tribute to Daft Punk"".

This theory (I use the term loosely) would say that the TARDIS drew itself to that date to vent the temporal energy from this, knowing that the Doctor could at that time prevent it from destroying the universe. It was a means of balancing the equation, if you will. In the Doctor's wife we see that the TARDIS has a near omnipotent understanding of non-linear cause/effect across the time stream so it isn't a huge leap to say she could orchestrate it. 

The fact that the first explosion did not happening due to the events of The Big Bang doesn't matter since these events are not dependent on them and are in fact predicated on the first explosion not occurring and the universe existing. Essentially, both events are in superposition of both occurring and not occurring in a dialetheic ball of causality and complicated time-stuff.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"Assuming that QPR and Reading are down, I would like to see Wigan get relegated from the Premiership. I've always been fed up about them remaining in there and barely selling any tickets while teams like us suffer in the leagues below. It will make me quite happy to see them relegated, and I don't think that they would be a massive threat next season either. I could see them challenging for the Play-Offs, like Bolton this season and Blackpool last time around, but not for the automatic spots.

I don't fear Villa either, as they've been playing a rather young side and I don't think that they would put in a big investment. Newcastle and Sunderland, on the other hand, would be a big threat so I'm keen for them to stay up.

I'm desperate for Watford to mess up, as well. They're in a false position. This is their one and only chance for promotion, in my opinion, because the rules for loaning players will surely change so that their cheap tactic can't work again. Hull would probably invest in more good players over the summer, so it's best if they go up really.

If anything, I'd like Bolton or Brighton to go up through the Play-Offs, as they're almost certain to reinvest for another push, although Bolton are my preferred candidate. I don't see Palace doing much next season, while Forest and Leicester are wild cards with crazy owners.

Wolves are pretty much down, which is a relief because they should have stormed the league this season. Two terrible managerial appointments devastated what was a decent squad, even though the owners had plenty of money to spend. I would have liked Huddersfield to be relegated, because their owner will probably bankroll them upwards yet again, but I'll settle for Barnsley or Sheffield Wednesday. We usually mess up against both of them (Barnsley in particular), so it will be for the best, although seeing Dave Jones relegated and sacked would make my day.

It's impossible to decide between the two, though, because while Barnsley won't challenge for promotion, they're guaranteed to take points off us (I'm sick of hearing Eddie Gray tell us that Dickie Bird walked past him at half time and said, ""That's a poor Leeds team, Eddie.""). On the other hand, we aren't quite as bad against Wednesday, but they might be able to build up a promotion push. I'm indifferent towards Peterbrough and Millwall, as they're mid-table makeweights at best, but I suppose that I won't be too disappointed if Millwall go down.

As for League One, there are a lot of annoying teams in their Play-Offs. I will be very annoyed if Brentford go up, because they gave no quarters when we last had to play them and I think that they took points off us on both occasions. The thing is, they have a ground with a teeny tiny pitch where it's impossible to spread the ball wide, so I'd hate for Leeds to have to travel there.

Sheffield United would also be a nuisance because it's another Yorkshire derby where we could easily lose points (I still don't understand how a midfield of Doyle and Montgomery outplayed us last time), while Swindon are cash-strapped at least, so I don't overly mind them going up, although their fans are bloody annoying (I still remember their chant from our promotion season, ""We're playing Portsmouth; you're playing Bournemouth!"" - ironically it was the other way around). Yeovil would be my preferred candidates, though, because I couldn't see them doing anything other than going straight back down and I think that we could get the double over them.

So here's my summary:

Preferred Premiership teams to be relegated:  
**Wigan  
Reading  
QPR**

Preferred Championship teams to be promoted:  
**Hull  
Bolton**

Preferred Championship teams to be relegated:  
**Barnsley/Sheffield Wednesday  
Wolves**

Preferred League One team to be promoted:  
**Yeovil**

true,respectmyprivitar,null,null,"I tend to believe through experience in the privatisation of the NHS, albeit it a brutal unforgiving one. The problem with the NHS now is that in many departments there is no guarantee of minimum quality of service, or service at all. People don't care, the money comes in either way. So you have cronyism or hiring immigrants regardless of training or skills through fear of being accused of ""institutional racism"".

The NHS has become a stuck up little elitist club as a result. They don't care about losing customers and there is no right to service hence they have ridiculous things like you must treat them with ""respect"". Anyone with a bit of sense knows that respect is earned. When people make mistakes, you don't show them respect. You can't even complain when they hire anyone, including immigrants that need basic training in English skills and English culture, declare that you are racist in front of everyone when you complain about it then deny you services. This is especially problematic for White English minorities in areas that heavily accommodate for immigrants. Given that all the workers are immigrants and will already take the side of their own you can't get anywhere. I once thought that white flight was silly, perhaps racist but now it makes a lot of sense. Don't get me wrong, I'm not concerned with paying taxes that might be spent on immigrants, waiting in queues with immigrants in them or even immigrants being hired. The problem is that they refuse to give them basic training or even check that they are suitable for the job. The one I most recently complained about did not even know what a ""walk in centre"" was. I was branded a racist by the NHS for pointing this out. The fact is that I'm constantly treated like a 2nd or 3rd rate citizen by the NHS and nobody should receive that kind of treatment. The fact that they even have this criteria shows that they are not a serious universal health provider given that neurological effects of many ailments don't make for happy, polite or cooperative people. This is a blank cheque for the NHS to discriminate.

Given this state of affairs, many of us absolutely detest the notion of being forced to pay for these services.

As a cyclist I'd rather have segregated lanes going with the traffic flow, not two side by side after removing one lane of traffic. As a pedestrian, the proposed layout is unsafe, not only for getting to a bus, but for crossing the bike lanes too. Remember, not everyone coming to Edinburgh is familiar with our roads layout and often look the wring direction when trying to cross. Keep it simple. Complicating the process of crossing the street will only lead to more accidents. Finally, as a motorist, way to go with removing the parking spaces and further throttling city centre mobility by car. All these proposals do is move the problem somewhere else, to streets less able to cope with the parking and commuter pressure. 

I wish the council would stop fucking around with things that aren't broken and address some of the real issues in the city - like the state of our roads, the crumbling schools, crap modern architecture, underused infrastructure, and generally poor cleanliness of the place.

The first one looks like your basic first line support role... though at an entry salary. I imagine they're looking for a graduate in an IT based degree but frankly I've recruited for those before and the company I worked with has just looked for sales and customer support experience (not necessarily IT, though of course it's a bonus when you find it). 

The second looks like a scaled back version of the first - presumably for someone with just customer service experience and a technical aptitude. 

That Game role is surprising TBH. It's not so much IT based as retail - I've worked for Game before in a plain customer service capacity and all we needed to know about consoles we could pretty much pick up on the job (It just helped that I had been a gamer before that). I would've expected something around £16k+ for a deputy manager role - but Game are going through hard times. Perhaps I'm out of touch with that market. 

That last role is way outside my expertise but I can follow your reasoning - £200 for an exam for a role that pays... well frankly as much as Game might, upwards, is quite a big ask. 

As an aside - the graduate IT jobs I've worked on are mostly around the North West of the UK and none of them have offered a salary under £18k (and *none* of them have expected many years experience in a professional capacity - though they do expect certain key skills such as the ability to develop in a particular programming language / IT support / web design portfolio etc.)",0,1367158370,null,0,false,0,c9o9v2t,t3_1d7tl1,t1_c9o9v2t,t1_c9o8h0q,null,1431396668,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

true,BritOli,null,null,"Thanks for the reply. I was trying to explain why tax cuts might be favoured by a Conservative in more of a general sense. 

&gt;Firstly, we're talking about pensioners here. ""Incentive to work"" doesn't come into it.

You are right to pick me up on the fact that IDS talked about pensioners, but pensioners can and do still work so the incentive argument does still apply, I'm afraid. [Source 1](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pensioners/paying-retire.htm) [Source 2](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pensioners/paying-employed.htm).

&gt;Secondly, we're only talking about ""wealthy"" people here.

I would tend to agree with you; but if you re-read my comment I simply said that it may increase the incentive to work, and I put it in brackets because it's not key. What is key is that raising taxes does make people work less, and cutting benefits doesn't. So cutting benefits for rich pensioners makes more sense, given that we'd rather they worked more.

&gt;So, I simply don't believe that the studies you link are relevant to my point, which is that the exact same measure can be implemented in different ways - and that calling it a ""benefit cut"" or a ""tax rise"" is an irrelevant semantic difference.

You're right that the studies I linked are far more broad and general than this talk about pensioners, but I just wanted to make a broad and general point that high taxes generally mean less output, whereas cutting benefits generally doesn't mean less output (and if anything more output - although as we agree, probably not in this specific case).

**This is your National Insurance number: -- -- -- -- -**

**What is my National Insurance number and why is it important?**

Your national insurance number is your own personal reference number. It is unique to you and will stay the same all your life. Please keep this letter in a safe place. Do not share your National Insurance number with anyone who does not need it as knowledge of your number might help someone steal your identity. This letter on its own cannon be used to prove your identity.

**What is National Insurance?**

**How do I use my National Insurance number?**

You will need your National Insurance number at certain times throughout your life, for example if you need to apply for a student loan, start working or claim state benefits. You must give your National Insurance number to every employer you work for straightaway.

Then there's also the economic effects of all the companies making these pesticides going out of business (or at least contracting one hell of a lot) and the hundreds (if not thousands) of employees that will become jobless because of such a policy.  

There are a lot of considerations which aren't always immediately obvious with this sort of thing, and the cost-benefit analysis is often quite difficult to do.

In case you genuinely don't understand, I'll explain: you described the portrayed body type as 'optimistic'. That implies the body type that's being shown is - in your opinion - objectively better than Catherine Tate's actual body type. You are making a value judgement on a woman's body. Not only that, you are doing it with regards to a female actor. Women struggle to get cast in good roles if they don't fit into television's idea of what's good-looking. Men, by and large, do not struggle with this.

Catherine Tate does not fit into television's idea of what's good-looking. She caught a lot of shit when she became companion because she wasn't 'hot' enough. Did Arthur Darvill? Did Noel Clarke? Comments like yours contribute to the idea that an actress's worth is decided by how attractive she is to the general public. This idea is the reason that Karen Gillan almost didn't get cast as Amy. In Moffat's own words before he saw her in person: ""I thought, 'well she's really good. It's just a shame she's so wee and dumpy.'""

You are directly contributing to this mindset. You, and people who act like you, are directly making it harder for fat women, short women, women who in any way don't fit this mould to get into acting. I'm done arguing. You need to accept responsibility for what you said, like an adult, and apologise to every woman who had to read your comment; you made them put up with yet another casual dig at their confidence today.",0,1367164533,null,0,false,0,c9obd1y,t3_1d9obk,t1_c9obd1y,t1_c9oalcd,null,1431395962,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

I'm a fan of videogames, and certain characters (males too, but mostly females) are just plain anatomically impossible to replicate as costumes on real humans. If I appreciate the time and effort and attention to detail that goes into a costume, but I grouse that the cosplayer's body is too skinny, not skinny enough, or proportioned ""wrong"" for the character, I'm being picky and not-fun and kind of a dick. (Which is why I **don't** do that.)

And if that's the case, then saying ""that costume has elements I don't think belong there"" might be a valid criticism, but you need to recognize that it likewise misses the point. This person obviously wasn't setting out to be as authentic as possible -- for one thing, she's female, so it's never going to be so accurate as to make you do a double-take and think ""holy shit it's Matt Smith!"" -- because that's a *different* sort of cosplay.

Look, personally, I think it's a cute ensemble that *reminds me* of 11. That's about it, and I'd wager that's about as far as it was meant to go. And personally, I think the friend just barely sort-of looks like Sherlock, and I imagine she got tired of explaining to people who she was meant to be all day long.

There is significant coverage in the media when voter turnout is low, and voting for a party with policies you completely disagree with to get at the main parties is misguided and dangerous. If you don't agree with stopping immigration for example, but you vote for UKIP just out of protest to the two main parties then if UKIP do well, the main parties will be forced to move to the right on immigration anyway, as we have already seen with Labour 'admitting' they made mistakes about immigration. 

Note: this is not a comment about immigration, it is a comment about the knock on effects of not voting for a party whose policies you agree with, and the possible effects of voting for a party with policies you disagree with simply because they are the main protest vehicle.

I see what you mean and what you are getting at  with your TLDR.

I would love to see how other papers spin the story.  I could not find that story in the Telegraph or Independent or FT.  

I understand  that China is an important trade partner - but it is also important to have principles.  I applaud Camerons decision to visit  Dalai.   

I am not a fan of Cameron and love reading about his failures or fuck ups  (i am biased)  but I did not perceive this article to be negative.   It stated the facts as they are.  **It did not infer that Cameron made a mistake.  Only that he made a decision and that China is making him pay for it (which I think is likely)**

China will punish anybody weaker then them who  goes against their interests.  And Cameron had shown some backbone but he is being made to pay for it.  I dont at all see this as a mistake.   Only a consequence of the prime ministers decision.   **Not that it was the wrong decision**




I also think that  China has a long memory and will never forget the Opium war - and the UKs role in it.    Maybe a Chinese person or historian would care to comment over here.


I read the Telegraph and DailyMail.  
I see more bias in the Telegraph then the Guardian - but then it is probably because I am more liberal. I am aware of that.   I like the Independent more. 
   I also see a lot **less bias** from the Financial Times (then Guardian, Telegraph) which reports more factually and dryly.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; What an arrogant cunt. So basically if any ""normal"" member of the public wants anybody apart from Labour/Conservative, they're just misguided?

He actually says nothing along those lines about other parties generally - he says it specifically about UKIP. UKIP's policies and membership are utterly laughable, and he's completely right that they're only getting attention because things are going badly for the country. It's well established that electorates turn to extreme parties in hard times, and it's quite clear that UKIP is an example of that.

&gt; I agree with very few UKIP policies myself, but there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with voting for a protest party.

I don't think he's saying there's anything wrong with *voting* for a protest party or the idea of one, but in one threatening to become a real political force. He explicitly sympathises with that perspective here:-

&gt; ""It is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people, who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it.""

There is, IMO, something wrong when what is essentially a protest party - with the corresponding dearth of actual policies - starts to develop some sort of credibility or influence. A lot of UKIP's policies are completely barmy, and are completely out of line with academic discourse or, indeed, fact.

In particular, a UKIP/Tory coalition would IMO be the worst thing for this country.

 I think it's pretty clear that dissident republicans are not going to target civilians, as that would absolutely wipe out their already small support base. Taking that into account, this article is nothing more than the author taking an event in which their was an innocent loss of life as an opportunity to scoff at the people off Boston for supporting the IRA. 

I see the author also neglected to mention the number of times Loyalist paramilitaries murdered innocent Catholics, with the full knowledge and in many cases strong encouragement of the British government. But let's not talk about that.

It's an animated American comedy series, (adult, not kids), really fast paced humour, and great fun to watch. Every episode never fails to make me laugh, for me it's on par with the likes of Simpsons and Family Guy. Never seen it on TV over here though.

Also, try [Friday Night Lights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_Night_Lights_%28TV_series%29), American sports drama, about a high school football team in a small town in Texas, and all the events that happen in that town. Even if you're not much of a sports fan, it's about more than that, you get sucked into the life of the people in this town, and the passion that goes into their team.

The test itself costs about £60, and passing it is in many ways a matter of luck. Most people will pass by their second or third attempt, so you're unlikely to get to over £200 on that. Services that offer 'free' retests for an initial fee are essentially a scam.

I highly recommend [this](http://www.changedrivingtest.co.uk/) website for booking tests. It costs £25, but it will automatically move your test date forward if any slots open up. 

I found that the waiting list for a test was a couple of months, but that this site normally shortened that to a couple of weeks at worst. This will save you from spending money on extra driving lessons just because you feel you should practice while you're waiting for your test date.

As for passing theory (which I assume isn't included in this 'deal'), buy a smartphone app that includes all the questions (they're multiple choice) and just practice when you have a spare minute. Buy one of the well-reviewed (i.e. not DSA) hazard perception DVDs off Amazon and do it until you score well every time. 

I wouldn't bother getting one of the theory books but if you can get one off a mate it might be worth flicking through.

All in all, I don't think it'll cost you more than £1000, but that varies by area. Look at the cost of driving lessons near you (that's the bulk of the cost) and decide.

I'm glad that you talked about the danger of being on the other end of a knife though, being someone that was mugged at knifepoint, but of course I am not allowed the use of a taser to possibly safe my life, hence my point about the average bobby having the same arms and means of self defence as the general public, even though obviously your guys lives are at much more risk. 

But yeah, that experience has made me not morally against tasers being used in bladed article scenarios, were a life is at risk, but I think you know that there are other ways of dealing with a knife wielding criminal. 

A dog unit is what you probably do nowadays without a taser, when you know that the suspect you are after could have a knife, because this is likely to me more scary for him, make him more likely to surrender and doesn't risk a human life. It is very unlikely that someone would pull a knife on a police officer totally unexpectedly, and in this case I trust you guys are good enough to disarm him through physical force, and if that failed, striking him on the head would be justified.

My point is, every police officer doesn't walk around with a possibly lethal, but usually less than lethal dog.

Give him a full 360 degrees to do what he does best which is keep the ball at his feet always ready and aware to make a pass the moment an opportunity presents itself.  Even when he gets up to speed moving down the pitch you notice he always prefers to keep the ball at his feet, which gives him the option to turn or slip a pass the moment a defender commits.  You can tell he's a very thoughtful player even for such a young lad, and he'll only get better with age.  But what really impressed me yesterday was how adapted he already seems to the physically aggressive aspects of the English game.

True, but they are different. The more we drive the more experience we have, which for all except perhaps the time lords among us does mean we would get older, however age in and of itself does not necessitate experience. The insurance sector will also have access to driving records so there's no need to infer experience from age. 

&gt;..such as the fact that under 25's are statistically the most likely to have accidents?

We can justify so much with this rationale. It's no different than saying people of a certain ethnicity should pay more on their car insurance because others of the same ethnicity are poor drivers (Which is true by the way. Some ethnicities are statistically worse drivers. So to support age discrimination on the basis that young people are worse drivers then rationally it's permissible to support race discrimination because certain ethnicity are worse drivers). Both are ridiculously wide reaching generalisation that customers can do nothing to change. Both are protected characteristics under the EU and UK law. 

I suppose we let insurance companies get away with it as half the nation has this I'm all right Jack attitude with either not begin young themselves or not having children of that age. That and the conflation between age and experience.

That of course is dependent on his game time, but, barring injury, he's definitely going to be getting plenty of it here. More so than at any other top club. He'd probably be sitting on the bench at Arsenal, possibly at Tottenham as well, and i'm pretty sure he's sick of the colour blue so he wouldn't have wanted to start for Everton anyway.

IMO there's no better fit for Sturridge than Liverpool.

The ideological differences have now emerged in relation to how each party deals with the current mess caused by gross nationalisation of private sector debt. 

If the Tories were in power instead of Labour over the past decade we'd still be in the same fiscal position if not worse (they were lobbying for further deregulation of the finance sector and tax cuts). Labour's problem was running up significant deficits post-2003 although this coincides with the fact Britain was in two wars at the time which cost a lot of money, prior to the invasion of Afghanistan Gordon Brown was running a surplus as Chancellor. The Tories have a worse record than Labour anyway on deficits, just compare Kenneth Clarke's term to Gordon Brown's as Chancellor and you'll see Clarke was running up bigger deficits than Brown.

* Even when Mata has a poor game he still is vital. He did play below his norm, but that's considered playing average when you take into account his talent.

“Radical Feminists Barred From London Irish Venue.

THE London Irish Centre, run by a charity funded by the Irish government, has withdrawn permission for a group of feminists to hire out its conference venue in Camden, north London. The move follows complaints that some speakers advocate violence against men and are “transphobic”.

The RadFem conference was to have been held in June at the 57-year-old centre, the oldest and largest lrish organisation outside Ireland. Last year RadFem’s plans for a conference at Conway Hall, a convention centre in central London, had been vetoed after it was discovered that the group intended to deny entry to transgender women by restricting tickets to “women born as women and living as women”.

The London Irish Centre provides welfare services for Irish emigrants in the British capital and hosts Irish exhibitions and performances, such as last night’s acoustic set by Brian Kennedy.

It depends on the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs for almost half its income and secured £448,500 (€683,000) in funds from the state in its latest ﬁnancial year.

David Barlow, the charity’s director, said the centre decided against hosting the RadFem conference after receiving 29 complaints about the event. as well as a protest outside its building last week by MRA London, a men’s activist group.

Barlow said: “Quite a few of the complaints were from the transgender community and then a men’s group came along the other day to hand out leaflets about why the event should not be held here.

“While our commercial bookings subcontractor [an events firm called Off to Work] has a certain amount of freedom to use the centre when we are not using it for cultural events, if it comes to the charity’s attention that an event goes against our policy, then we will point it out to them.”

“We did some research into RadFem and discovered certain language was used and some statements were made about transgender people that would go against our equalities and diversity policy.

“We have discussed with our subcontractor Off to Work how to avoid such confusion in future and have strengthened our internal communications as a result.”

RadFem said it had been “completely transparent” when booking the facility and claimed the venue was “bullied by a bunch of men’s rights activists”.

It said it did not accept the “ unjustifiable rejection’ of its booking and was still planning to hold the event at the venue.

“We have done nothing wrong and we will not accept being punished,” it said in a statement.

Helen Smith. one of the conference’s organiser, said RadFem has ﬁled a police complaint because ‘unlawful harassment and intimidation” led to problems with the venue.

“It’s a criminal issue and the police are pursuing it,” she said. ‘I’ve seen various comments from various people and there’s always a distortion of what radical feminists
are about. We were acting completely lawfully and others were acting unlawfully.”

Orlaith 0′Sullivan, the campaigns and advocacy manager for Transgender Equality Network Ireland, said she agreed with the centre’s decision.”",0,1367174421,null,0,false,0,c9oeag4,t3_1da9pc,t1_c9oeag4,t3_1da9pc,null,1431394510,2,false,UKLGBT,t5_2rnpq,2

true,dave8001,null,null,"It wasn't a case that the 9th Doctor only ""got"" one series.  It was a conscious decision by Christopher Eccleston not to reprise his role as the 9th Doctor after his first season. 

This was both a good and a bad decision.  

It was good because; essentially; he wasn't written correctly.  Christopher Eccleston is a great actor who gave some outstanding performances as the Doctor.  However; The Doctor is NOT leather jackets and a crew cut hair cut; he is tweed; scarfs; umbrellas; cricket and flutes.  Although Eccleston's doctor was true to the era; and what was needed to kick Doctor Who into the 21st Century; he wasn't a well written Doctor.  

A lot of the stories were good and compelling; you only need to look as far as ""Dalek"" where towards the end of the episode Eccleston is holding a gun towards the Eponymous Dalek of the episode.  We, as fans, knew why the Dalek was bad and why it had to be destroyed; However, newer fans were looking at the episode through the eyes of Rose and not seeing this...so it was such a compelling and genius concept that Eccleston played so excellently.

We can also look at ""Father's Day"" where The Doctor is forced to admit he has made a mistake with his new companion; when she is confronted with the opportunity to directly change her own past and does.  The feeling of internal dichotomy Eccleston displays has never been able to be replicated (even by Tennant - who is by far the strongest actor to have taken on the role) 

Finally we can also look at his final scene with Rose where he says goodbye to her; the raw emotion that Eccleston manages to convey makes some of the best storytelling Doctor Who has managed even to this day.

Therefore; when I say the negative things about the 9th Doctor it isn't specifically aimed at Eccleston; Doctor Who; Russell T Davies; the BBC; or the production crew...it was just unfortunate that the 9th Doctor was what was needed to launch New Who.

However; towards the end of the first series you began to see a LOT of development of this particular Doctor, and he began to take on a role which was more Who typical; and if Eccleston felt able to stay on for a second series I think that the 9th Doctor would have been nothing short of an iconic Doctor.  

Conversely; it was good because it gave way for the introduction of the 10th Doctor; the Doctor who is, in my opinion, the epitomy of everything Doctor Who had always aimed to be...Surpassing Tom Baker; Patrick Troughton and my personal favourite until that point in time Colin Baker.

This allowed Doctor Who to move from being a good series to being a classic and historic series.  Until this point in time:  ""50 Years of Doctor Who"" seemed like it would never come; but thanks to the mix of production, stories and acting it gave a total rebranding and reinvigoration to the concept which made 50 years a reality and not just a potential possibility.",0,1367174718,null,0,false,0,c9oedpu,t3_1d90po,t1_c9oedpu,t3_1d90po,null,1431394466,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;anyone with a working knowledge of statistics and probability can say with a certainty so close to 100% as makes no difference, that police officers routinely lie to help each other out

Now, I'm no statistician, but I rather suspect that at least one of the mainstream publications would have picked up this mass epidemic of perverting the course of justice amongst the constabulary and probably woud have pointed it out. If, of course, it is as blindingly obvious as you suggest.

&gt;It's amazing how often the police manage to come up with a story like that, no matter how it conflicts with the facts, the forensic evidence or recordings

Citations, if you please. You seem to imply that this is an entirely normal state of affairs. Current examples preferred, I'm not going to be waving the flag for the '80s, but seeing as you're implying that this is all perfectly normal behaviour at the moment, you'll have no problems laying your hands on some examples.

I've no evidence, but I wasn't there. Neither were you, and neither were the journalists. Given the current fear of talking to journalists as a result of Elveden et al, they certainly didn't get anything 'on the record'. 

You're welcome to draw whatever conclusion you like based on third-hand information, because that's all you or the media have at the moment. Everyone else with a semblance of critical thought would probably prefer to wait and see what the IPCC unearth from the wealth of information available to them, which'll include the control room tapes, the call logs, the individual taser's time stamps (the unit itself will have been seized), forensics from the scene, the post mortem, witnesses (from whom they will take statements themselves) and, of course, the ability to interview the officers under caution.

Or you can draw your conclusions based on the fact that, during the initial development of a story, someone has put an uncredited source forwards that isn't critical of the police. I suspect, however, that you'll not be convinced by any result that doesn't blame the officers, regardless of the rigour of the investigation.

Sure, there's less money in the lower leagues, but with Adkins we can shed the dead wood, get some quality in our squad that has the ability to play at the top level.

I think Le Fondre will leave unless he gets ore time on the pitch, his frustration is growing more apparent, and it's really showing in his performances. Jay Tabb will stay with Ipswich, he was great for us, always working hard, but not getting regular first team action. He's getting that and goals with the Tractor Boys. Alex Pearce will probably leave to. I can see Roberts &amp; Harte retiring, though possibly in the winter window, circumstances depending.

I'd be *very* surprised if McCarthy couldn't be tempted away by a consistent top-flight team - Fulham/Everton perhaps.

Axe Leigertwood, he's a fucking waste of space. Simon Church will be sold as well, possibly with Gunnarsson and maybe Noel Hunt.

Our defense has not been great, though Mariappa &amp; Kelly have turned out to be two very good signings. Morrison is showing some great promise as well. But if Harte &amp; Pearce do leave, that only leaves us with Shorey &amp; Gunter in first-team rotation.

Midfield has been our strongest point lately. Must try and keep Karacan, McAnuff, Kebe, Guthrie, McCleary &amp; HRK. McCleary have had some patchy form, but has been a pretty good goal threat and the makings of a solid playmaker. Guthrie has a high 'being-a-cunt percentage', but when he gets his head down, he does play really well - he might have even been our best player today.

Obviously our striking hasn't been stellar, so it needs some reinforcement. I've not warmed to Nick Blackman, and while our youth FWDs are doing well, I'm not sure if D'ath, Ugwu or Samuel are ready for the Championship yet. (Guess we'll see).

The TARDIS is alive, it learns and gathers information just like the doctor does. It can also create/change rooms near instantaneously. So, nothing in the library is actually a physical book that the Doctor has collected and stored. Instead, it's the TARDIS manifesting the information IT has in a form that a person can comfortable access - by creating books. Since none of the information was originally stored in a written form, there is no reason for the TARDIS to not make the books appear as whatever language the reader is most comfortable with. Think psychic paper, the books are physically blank but when you look at them you see text in whatever language you know best.

The one exeption is the Encyclopedia Gallifrey, which appeared as liquid in jars. Which seems a terrible way to make an encyclopedia. But by this theory, the encyclopedia would have been given to the TARDIS around it's creation by the Time Lords, as a record written in Gallifreyan. The TARDIS doesn't know the meaning exactly (It's 'memories' are of the text alone), and its translating ability was never designed to translate Gallifreyan writing, which doesn't match up to what Clara needs to be able to understand it, so the Library basically chucks a fit and refuses to 'display' the encyclopedia as anything logical.

It also explains why his real name was used - if the Doc wrote it, he'd describe himself as the doctor. If someone else wrote it, they wouldn't know his name. If it's a physical manifestation of the TARDIS's knowledge, IT would know him by his real name and even though it doesn't use it (Referring to him as 'my doctor' when the TARDIS was in a human body) the library's function would be as automatic as translating languages, so it probably can't filter out a name.

As for why the TARDIS let her wander into the library, the same reason that it let her wander into that baby room near the start, or show her the swimming pool or observation deck. It doesn't like her, but it's not outright hostile to her, more catty. It still made an effort to keep her safe when the real trouble hit (the salvagers stealing the tree/orb/circuit thing), but prior to that, Clara was wandering around lost, and running from an echo looking for somewhere to hide. The TARDIS decided to 'show off' by leading her to different places she could hide other than the main control room. Hell, maybe it DID specifically show Clara his name, as a way of saying ""See, I know this about him and he doesn't trust you with it."" Gotta remember that the TARDIS is basically acting like the doctors jealous gf toward Clara, not entirely logical.",0,1367176188,null,0,false,0,c9oeu1i,t3_1d9h5h,t1_c9oeu1i,t3_1d9h5h,null,1431394253,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

When RTD ran the show, he laid down some basic ground rules that aren't about Time travel per se; but about story telling.

In many episodes during RTD's run you had a companion ask ""Well why are we doing all this running about when we have a time machine and could go back and stop it before it happened?""

And the Doctor would always reply ""Because we're part of events now and are locked into this time line.""

This isn't about the rules of time travel so much as rules about good story telling.

The moment you allow the Doctor to just be able to hop into the TARDIS and travel back in time to before the problem started and stop it, you rob the story of any impetus, and kill any forward momentum dead.

Moffat is clearly fascinated with the notion and idea of time travel and and has used Doctor Who to showcase his take on time travel.

This would be okay in a show about time travel, but it's not.

This is a a show about a Time traveler.

It's a very subtle but important distinction.

Normally the show starts and shows us the baddie of the week, Then the Doctor and the companion show up and work out the mystery and try to solve this weeks problem.

But now you have the doctor making multiple jumps in time during an episode, (*see last week.*)

I really disliked the writing. Everything about the plot was lazy, uninspired and just outright terrible. The Brothers were unlikeable and I had no urge to see any of them ""make it"" alive or have a happy ending.

The logic behind the story also made no sense. The TARDIS loves The Doctor. So why in the world would it try to keep him away from the room that would fix it? Why on Earth would the TARDIS ""snarl"" as The Doctor said at him to keep him away knowing he could save it? It made no sense. Yeah, Clara was with him but the TARDIS also put the message on her hand by burning her so they'd know how to fix it in the end anyway.

Nothing about the plot made any sense aside from the enemies being future echos trickling into the past. That part was perfectly fine to me. But the ""big friendly button"" being the thing to save the day made zero sense. We're just going to ASSUME this random button fixes that specific problem at hand? Did they even mention what it does and how it solved the situation? Didn't they get said button at first from the Brothers? So the Brothers just luckily had a big friendly button to stop a TARDIS from collapsing? Apparently you just tap its top and it solves your problem.

I already got myself a new place to live, but for me and my friends, the places we looked for houses/flats were mostly in South Belfast near the student area, particularly around Botanic avenue, university road, Ormeau Road and the Lisburn Road. Just don't look for anything too far away from the city centre (the Lisburn road in particular is extremely long). We also looked at flats in and around the city centre too but didn't find anything suitable, but there are definitely some nice places. 

I think your best bet is to see if you can get a flat around these areas. It's good in this part of town because you are within walking distance of shops, restaurants, bars and nighclubs, and within walking distance of the city centre as well (and PWC). The big supermarkets aren't really within walking distance from most of the neighbourhoods in South Belfast, but sure it's dead easy to get shopping delivered these days.

Gutted that Doncaster have been promoted because it's my home town and the fans are egotistical idiots who think their team is much better than it is and always refer to the 1-0 at Wembley even though we've hammered them in 4/5 games since then... Should be another easy 6 points though.

I think Wigan will go down, although I think I'd rather have Villa, not that it matters with the increased parachute payments they will be getting.

As for our league's relegations, I'd like to see Wolves go down (just because we did) and Barnsley since they're one of our bogey teams.

I kid, I kid.  I love Doctor Who and I would love for everything on the show to make sense and fit together for the sake of continuity but, I've decided that the translation circuit is just one of those things that is going to remain inconsistant and is never going to quite work the way that it should.  I guess if we didnt have some alien voices pop up every now and then then we wouldnt have that wonderment and fear that can come with hearing something alien to us (forgive the pun).  

Ignoring that though, I would like to think that the Doctor speaks Gallifreyan to everyone and the Tardis translates.  This would make sense to me from the context of the show.  The Doctor is always with the Tardis and so the Tardis has always translated for him and he has never had need to learn English, or any other language.  Not to say that he couldnt.

Internet users are generally on the younger end of the spectrum, and younger people tend to be more left-wing.

The reddit voting system encourages polar views (or ""hivemind"") and gravitates towards the majority opinion, as other opinions tend to be ignored/belittled/downvoted, and the proponents of the minority view become tired of the experience and leave, perpetuating the cycle.

Peltier has been a massive disappointment, though, considering that we paid the best part of £1, 000, 000 for him. In fairness, he hasn't played at right back, his best position, all that much but I still haven't been all that impressed when he has played there. I was under the impression that he was a solid right back who could bomb forward and get the ball in the box - that's how he seemed when he played for Yeovil and Huddersfield against us. However, he's been completely and utterly outclassed by Byram this season. In the second half against Brighton, he was one-on-one with his man at the edge of the box and **never** took him on. Byram would have for sure.

I don't agree on Harte, actually. I think that we have a better player in Warnock, who's at a similar age and seems to have a new lease of life considering how stale he became at Villa. Warnock has more pace to him and is still an option at set pieces (though not in the same league as Harte, to be fair). Moreover, I'd really like to see Aidy White push on and make the place his own in the near future.

Edit: completely in agreement regarding Le Fondre (I hope we could get him - or at least Billy Sharp - by it's something of a long shot) and another defender. I think we're sorted at full back, if we can keep Byram, but we need a commanding centre half who isn't slow as a snail. I thought we were getting that with Pearce, but he's more in the 'sidekick' centre half mould.

I believe the system as it is right now doesn't count loan players with **international caps** (I don't know if that's recent or from any time) towards your maximum number on the pitch and in the match day squad. Which means that a pretty obvious loophole has just been sitting there, ready and waiting for some guys like these Italians (who else? Haha!) to exploit it.

Agreed that Cardiff weren't spectacular or anything. They were just solid. They generally didn't concede silly goals and managed to score when it counted. Having seen them play Leeds both times, I also know that they're dirty as sin and when they're leading with 10 minutes to go, any knock will make them drop like flies and require treatment. I honestly thought that was a disgusting tactic, but they seemed to use it to good effect.

As for Hull, I've been honestly impressed by them. Forget Brighton - Hull and Watford, with their 3-5-2 formations, have been the two best passing teams in the league. They have actually passed with purpose, although Hull seemed to stop scoring after Sone Aluko's injury. However, any hint of pace has had Hull running scared (their defenders shat bricks when Poleon was brought on in the home fixture), so perhaps they might not be much of a force next season. I still think they will be stronger than Watford.

I'm quite content to have Leicester stay in the division. Sure, their transfer policy is annoying but it's also funny to see them spend a ridiculous amount of money and fail. Forest have been the same over the years; Cardiff too, to an extent. They might eventually crack it, like Cardiff did this season, but I don't have any really strong feelings about them.

I know the feeling with the stupid Doncaster fans - I've had to deal with them in the past. Their owner, John Ryan, is an annoying git as well. And yet what bugs me most of all is that **Billy Paynter has played well and scored for them**. Well, he didn't do it for us - and you can bet he'll be the first to score against us! The bright side is that since we came back into the Championship, we've generally taken points off them - they're among the easier Yorkshire derbies to play - and we need a team to replace Bristol City in the 'six-pointer' department!

The difference with ""The History of the Time War"" and ""Melody Malone"" is that the events of The Time War had already happened for The Doctor.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"&gt;how much does where you got your degree matter

To me, none. I'm still halfway through and I'm lucky enough to be focussing on an area in which there is a massive shortage, due to it being a relatively new and developing field (neuropsychology).  That said, my degree is generic and does not include this. Everyone else wants the quick wins: becoming a psychologist, criminal psych (fucking CSI) etc. Whatever gets them the most job opportunities. The key to finding a role in our overstretched NHS is to find the developing niches. 


What counts in terms of your employability is mainly your work ethic. What that means to you right now is that you should find somewhere to start volunteering, even if it is not specific to your area of interest.

His series was also the only one in the reboot to not feature a single bad script and the meta-arc is arguably the best handled with the most satisfying conclusion. About the only thing Eccleston has working against him is the shortness of his tenure.

Looking at the other reboots: Tennant also gives a great performance, but he had to deal with a lot more inconsistency in the quality of his scripts and meta-arcs. The incredibly poor writing in the 2008/2009 specials unfortunately results in his tenure ending on a whimper instead of a bang.

Matt Smith might be capable of giving us the most interesting portrayal of the Doctor yet: The mix of youthful enthusiasm that nevertheless seems tinged with world-weariness and endless experience. Unfortunately, his tenure has been plagued with some truly dire scripts and a lot of inconsistency.

What annoys me most is when drivers edge into the Advanced Stop Line area for bikes. I get the impression they're either doing it to get slightly further forward, or because they don't want a cyclist in front of them.

I often find as a cyclist, that if I get into the Advanced Stop area in traffic, I get revved at from behind or the car in the adjacent lane will crawl forward to block the area for cyclists on their side.

Petitions and email campaigns are a waste of time. It's like downvoting government policy on Reddit, and just as the 'like' button on Facebook doesn't cure famine in Africa, spamming MPs with emails does nothing good either.

All of this plays into the fact that Oswin wanted to see the universe and died on her first trip out. Now she's seeing the universe by way of the Doctor's travels.

My thoughts would be from the age of 18, do two years of service which will both include military training and *some* community service. You will be compensated an apprentice level wage and you can decide which areas you would like to join (medical corps, engineering, cooking etc.) which will give you experience which could help get into college/Uni or just getting a job.

Militarily you would replace the regular Army and be trained similarly but you will never amount to anything more than a home defence force and will never be used outside of our own boarders. The only way you could is if you volunteer and are selected to join the Royal Marines or another specialised unit. I don't think we need a big Army to send to send around the world in the 21st century. We just need a smaller, well trained force to help keep the peace or to sort a few problems out.

Ofcourse, If you're going into further education (University) or have a disability you should be able to be excused from national service.

I think from my experience it would be very beneficial to people who complete it. They could learn all sort of things including discipline, motivation, pride and respect for your self and others. Generally what allot of young men need. A purpose.

**Strength 2. Loving**

You value close relations with others, in particular those in which there is sharing and caring. The people to whom you feel most close are the same people who feel most close to you.

**Strength 3. Carefulness**

You are a careful person. You do not say or do things that you might later regret.

**Strength 4. Spirituality**

You have strong and coherent beliefs about the higher purpose and meaning of the universe. You know where you fit in the larger scheme. Your beliefs shape your actions and are a source of comfort to you.

**Strength 5. Social Intelligence**

You are aware of the motives and feelings of other people. You know what to do to fit in to different social situations, and you know what to do to put others at ease.

As a consequence, many conventional test-centres simply don't have the funding to provide such facilities and your test may be conducted many miles away from where you train.

 Not only does this suck because you may have to travel a long time in either direction for both your tests (when I was at my test-centre, there were people there from 30+ miles away when I'd just ridden two minutes down the road from my own) adding to the cost, but you also won't have trained on the test-routes around the test-centre itself, meaning you may have a bit more trouble with them.

Its a criminally totalitarian thing and I don't think any country that still has it can be truly modern. At least Germany just recently got rid of it and Greece is moving in the direction, reducing the time with the aim of ending it eventually.

Its pretty much a massive violation of individual rights and implies that a man’s life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle, for something he doesn't even believe in or agree with (Although he might as a result of propaganda). No place for such attitudes in a free society.

It pretty much normalizes and promotes the idea of a great and glorious country who you should be proud and patriotic about and so on, the attitude that its like a right of passage or something. Of course, there's more to that than national service, but national service is still a part of it, and I think when the idea of being forced to join the army like that is acceptable, its a lot easier to bring things to the next level...

Now, imagine there's a ""password"" when, if uttered in the TARDIS, would put out a code to unlock that war. He fears someone knowing or saying his real name, because that would unleash ruin. Let's say that Clara Oswald accidentally figures out the Doctor's name. She says it. It creatures fissures in time, unlocks the time war, breaks apart the thing separating us with the other universes (where David Tennant's human Doctor is.)

So, in an instance like that, someone (Clara) learns the Doctor's name and says it, but the viewer doesn't hear it because just saying it creates a loud noise as the time war is unlocked. We learn just how dangerous his name is to the universe. When River whispers in his ear in the library about his name, she could simply say ""it unlocks the time war.""

It's not as if these guys were portrayed as the embodiment of evil, just rather selfish, greedy and cold-hearted. Except the android, of course, who was suspiciously kind and humane for an android. :-)  These weren't stereotyped, 2 dimensional characterizations at all. 

Just saying, when whole groups of people have improved to the degree that none of them is capable of greed, selfishness, and cruelty given the inclination/opportunity, I'll throw in my towel and admit we're already living in heaven on earth.

true,Bwsab,null,null,"I love Smith's interpretation of the character: The Childish Old Man.

He reminds me of a grandfather playing silly games with his grandchildren. Since the kids are just visiting, grandpa gets to be irresponsible. Where parents say no more candy, he indulges both the kids and himself. (He loves candy.) When it's dinner time, HE'S the one begging for more play time. He's at that age where it's okay to be silly and just have lots of fun, because he's retired and that's what he wants to do.

But he knows and has seen more than he's letting on. He may play soldier with his grandson, but he's fought a few wars. No need to ruin his grandchild's harmless make-believe. His six year old granddaughter wishes that her mother was dead because of early bedtimes. He just gives a sweet smile; he's lost a wife before, and misses the girl's innocence. You can see it in his eyes, but there's no need to let the kids know that. They're too young.

I recommend re-watching the interrogation scene in ""The Hungry Earth"". (Series 5, Episode 8, 31 minutes in.) Eleven has captured a Silurian who may be able to assist in Amy's rescue. When Eleven compliments the Silurian's mode of transport, he's not just fascinated by it. He's almost proud of what they've accomplished. ""What'll these kids think of next!"" And (this is the important part), notice Eleven's reaction when the Silurian declares how much she wants to go to war against the humans. ""I'll gladly die for my cause!"" she proclaims. ""What will you sacrifice for yours?"" And Eleven, threatened with the death of billions ...just gives a sad smile.

He knows she means it. He knows she'll do it. The young are always so quick to fight. But she's never had to sacrifice before. She's never faced death. He has. And he can't help but give a sad smile, hoping to spare her from the war that she so desperately wants to fight.

Anytime someone says his name, a small break in the time war occurs. So some races trapped in the time war, say The Zygons, are able to get out during that small collapse.

His name, when uttered, causes all TARDIS machines to come together. All Gallifreyan's share the same name, thus why they go by codenames instead (The Master, Meddling Monk, Rani, Romana... etc.) to say the name is to bring them all together again.

He doesn't know his own name. If he were to hear it, it would unlock something in him that would unleash untold villains and bring memories back to him that he had locked away with his name as the key.

I don't think it's meaningful to conflate *national* service with *military* service. Not in a modern discussion of the idea.

When I was at uni I knew a lot of French and German exchange students, and they claimed the German healthcare system would fall apart without national service - practically everyone claimed to be a conscientious objector, and thus worked on hospital wards as porters and cleaners. They described it as a good time, as there was a sense of camaraderie amongst them and they'd have a party on the dorm every weekend. 

I don't see how we can fix our broken public services without this. The only time we realise the state of the NHS is when we're in hospital and discover there aren't enough nurses to go around. We only find that cops lie routinely is when we're unfortunately enough to get arrested. Working on hospital wards would give people an emotional investment in improving the NHS; working alongside police offers would prevent perjury and reduce the them-and-us culture.

The government rarely even acts in the best interests of the human race.  Why should anyone be forced to become an unquestioning tool of the government's will for two years?

true,newbill123,null,null,"In science, time travel *is* magic. Sci-fi that builds whole plots around it are really fantasy, but with a gamma world environment rather than one of dragons and dungeons.

That doesn't mean a fantasy story involving time travel in a sci-fi environment is a bad idea. It still must stay logical. But it can pose questions unanswerable where time flows linearly. It does annoy people if you try to bog yourself down in too much detail about the scientific explanation for what's happening because it's not supported and may be contradicted by knowledge we have today.

My opinion of JTtCotT: 

It kept to the logical, but unscientific explanations of time travel established in Doctor Who. The resolution of using a wibbly-wobbley future to guide a past version out of a jam has been done many times in Who. Time travel wasn't the cause of their obstacle, but it was worked in as part of their journey to provide a resolution and happy ending. I would have preferred that for an episode that focused so much on the machine that is such a *deus ex machina* device like the TARDIS that the resolution was not just ""pull the reset switch and everyone forgets almost everything"", but it was a fun, if meaningless, romp.

My meta-review of the IO9 review: 

* Rule 1: the Doctor lies. When the Doctor said the ship was infinite, as well as setting the self-destruct, or talking about salvage value. He was lying. We have no reason to believe his explanations to anyone about anything inside the TARDIS were truthful unless they were pulled out with great reluctance (like Clara did).

* The trait of the Doctor being a bit of a jerk isn't new. The first and sixth Doctors made that a big part of their personality. The Doctor also can be situationally a jerk when you piss him off (especially the 2nd, 7th, or 9th). The ""usually sees the good side of everything"" isn't universal between all regenerations (the 4th and 10th predominantly, IMHO).

* The Doctor fussing about people trying to salvage the TARDIS happens before he even knows about the Engine Overload. He's concerned about the ripping apart of the TARDIS making the search harder, which it does. Why'd he take them on board at all? Probably because he knows he has dangerous stuff on there. Artifacts from old journeys that could drive you to madness, or harm you if you mistook them for something harmless. You don't let a toddler wander through your room of antique firearms even if you think they're probably safe.

* The Doctor deduces that the future can be changed because he sees the two headed zombie with human DNA and deduces it's the two brothers melted together. He tells them to stay apart precisely so that that future can't happen.

* The reviewer clearly doesn't understand dynamics of brothers. Yes, I know people who would try this on one of their brothers given the opportunity. They even said why they did it, how they did it, and gave the doctor a brief ""reason"" why the android was configured to be like a human. As a person with seizures who gets my ""reset switch"" pulled sometimes and forget vast parts of my past, I don't find this fantastic. Our 3lbs of mental meat controls everything about our memories, perceptions, and motivations. This was the most believable part of the episode for me.

* The time travel solution was the same ""logical"" extension as given in the two Amy Pond shorts *Time* and *Space*. Those were done for humor. This was done for drama. But it's not a new invention just for this episode. You saw the remote outside the TARDIS at the very start. It doesn't get in to burn Clara's hand at all unless it's something from the future putting it there. ""Big Friendly Button"" is the same cheat as the ""Wibbley lever"" in the shorts.

* I do agree about the frustration of the reset switch. We don't know that the Doctor or the TARDIS have forgotten it though. The Doctor's questioning of Clara at the end sort of suggests he may have memories of it. (It may be future Doctor, or it may have been recorded in the TARDIS's memory and reviewed by the Doctor). I do wish the reward of having so much of a focus on the TARDIS had resulted in more significant meaning for the episode as a whole.

But I'm impressed she can write so much with so little understanding.

The Time Lords were great, but they also felt a little confining.

Remember that Gallifrey was rarely visited, even when it was at it's peak. You'd get the occasional Gallifrey-based serial, but it wasn't like half the show was about Time Lord culture and society.

Towards the end the Time Lords became too... plain. The great masters of all time and space felt like commonplace bureaucrats. They felt less like Lords of Time and more like Proprietors for the Ministry of Temporal Activities.

So not an overreaction. We played some great football against top teams. But we also played some very uninspired stuff against lesser teams, lost games we should have won, got dumped out of the Champion's League, didn't take the World Club comp seriously, and generally felt under siege throughout the season. 

If we had started out struggling, I think we would have been elated to be in the spot we are in, fighting to be in the top 4 with such a young team. But we showed from the start that we are capable of world class football, and then proceeded to not repeat it for long stretches.

So while our stats are great, I think we really didn't play up to a high potential, and that's what has disappointed a lot of fans this year. Is that an overreaction?

First off, There's 3 things that are important in this past episode/general cannon that are important. One, Clara spilled part of the Encyclopedia Gallifrey and interacted with it. Second, she read the ""The History of the Time War"" book, read and understood his name possibly some information surrounding his name/deeds that he doesn't want people to know i.e. secrets. Three, the fact that nothing is forgotten, not completely that combined with the change in personalities and actions at the end of the episode might imply that Clara on some level still remembers his name.  So to sum up Clara got an infusion of Glaifeyean knowledge via the Encyclopedia, was able to read his name and possibly some surrounding history that constitutes his deep dark secret and at a future point in time remember/reveal this to various people. 


Now for my personal speculation. Part of this is based on the episode ""A Good Man Goes to War"" and partially on the fact I think it would be epic. In that episode there's an alien (whose name escapes me) who is from a Warrior race but whose job is a Nurse, which is a punishment from the Doctor for something he did as an act of penance. Now, if we apply that to The Doctor, I personally feel that somewhere in his past, a VERY young doctor committed a horrendous sin or crime and all of his life's travels trying to help people is his penance for this sin.

Now how does this apply to the Season 7 Finale and the whole ""Fields of Transelor"" deal from the season 6 finale? Personally, I feel that only the combination of the two facts/details will have significance in the story. Clara will unknowingly tell either the Doctor or someone else his name, and someone will remember that name and the horrible crime that name is connected with and the doctor will have to reveal that yes he is THAT  John Doe, Destroyer of Cheesecakes. Revealing his dark past. 

Also, I feel what the Producers might do is give him a title, for example, Barrack Obama 44th President of the United States of America, and will refer to him by his title ""That President"" thus preserving the anonymity of his name for the audience.

The paper part shows the points you collect for offences or any suspensions, limitation on your licence. I guess the idea is, that even without an online connection or phone call etc. anyone, who needs it, can verify your current licence status. Apart from the police, it may be your insurance company, a car rental place, etc.

Second, she read the 'The History of the Time War' book, read and understood his name possibly some information surrounding his name/deeds that he doesn't want people to know i.e. secrets. Three, the fact that nothing is forgotten, not completely that combined with the change in personalities and actions at the end of the episode might imply that Clara on some level still remembers his name. So to sum up Clara got an infusion of Glaifeyean knowledge via the Encyclopedia, was able to read his name and possibly some surrounding history that constitutes his deep dark secret and at a future point in time remember/reveal this to various people.

Now for my personal speculation. Part of this is based on the episode 'A Good Man Goes to War' and partially on the fact I think it would be epic. In that episode there's an alien (whose name escapes me) who is from a Warrior race but whose job is a Nurse, which is a punishment from the Doctor for something he did as an act of penance. Now, if we apply that to The Doctor, I personally feel that somewhere in his past, a VERY young doctor committed a horrendous sin or crime and all of his life's travels trying to help people is his penance for this sin.

Now how does this apply to the Season 7 Finale and the whole 'Fields of Transelor' deal from the season 6 finale? Personally, I feel that only the combination of the two facts/details will have significance in the story. Clara will unknowingly tell either the Doctor or someone else his name, and someone will remember that name and the horrible crime that name is connected with and the doctor will have to reveal that yes he is THAT John Doe, Destroyer of Cheesecakes. Revealing his dark past.

Also, I feel what the Producers might do is give him a title, for example, Barrack Obama 44th President of the United States of America, and will refer to him by his title 'That President' thus preserving the anonymity of his name for the audience.

They're re-introducing the Great Intelligence.  The Great Intelligence is also known as Yog-Sothoth, and Yog-Sothoth is a member of the Cthulhu Mythos. 

Another member of the Cthulhu Mythos?  Hastur the Unspeakable. 

And the Doctor has faced Hastur before - in the form of Fenric. 

&gt; The being later known as Fenric was one of two forces, one good, one evil, which were present at the Dawn of Time. (TV: The Curse of Fenric)

&gt; *The fate of the good force, if personified, remains unknown.*

That's my theory.  The Doctor's name... is Hastur.  And his name is unspeakable.

In fact I made a list of all the things South Shields needs, and a 21C Joseph was in the top 25.... near the bottom of the top 25 though, not even making the top twenty because of the need for more people singing Beach Boys songs in Karaoke and also encouraging more children playing with Meccano. And no where near the big issues such as lampshades on the streetlights to avoid the way the harsh light makes the place unattractive.

What he fails to say if why ***HE*** gets to be the 21C Joseph and surely such a selection needs to be made on serious rational grounds.

I didn't realize the Doctor Who fanbase was so touchy. Most of the people that convinced me to watch Doctor Who are really friendly and positive. Got kind of shit on when I shared my opinion here though xD  
For the record, you misunderstood me. I never said the 10th Doctor was hot. I'm not watching this show because I'm sexually attracted to the actor; I never said that I was. I meant that after 3 seasons with the 10th Doctor, I'm nervous that I won't like the new one. Just because he's different, not because he isn't as attractive. I worded it poorly but I was trying to say 2 different things that weren't necessarily related.  
A) I'm worried about the new doctor because I'm so familiar with the 10th Doctor now. I think that's probably a fear that a lot of people could relate to when they started watching.  
and B) I just think the 10th Doctor is better looking than the 11th. Every picture I see of the 11th looks really mean and serious whereas the 10th just looks like a really nice guy. But that's NOT the reason why I'm nervous about switching to him. It's just a separate thought. It's not like I said ""He's ugly, I hate him already.""  
I was just trying to convey some fears that I had, as a new Doctor Who fan, hoping that some veterans of the series could tell me something to ease my mind. Something like ""You get used to him. He's different at first but he grows on you and has his own funny quirks."" But instead I got down voted into oblivion and insulted over a misunderstanding.

true,Almanorek,smith,Smith,"This has been my favorite episode of the new season. I actually love the idea of time travel being as much magic as it is science. In Doctor Who, there exists a *time vortex*, an actual entity that represents time itself. That immediately opens possibilities that time is more malleable than it is in the 'real' universe.

I don't understand how the 'time reasserting itself' wouldn't make any sense. The melty-people were from the future, and given their physical state, they were from a future where they touched each other as their bodies became melt-like. By stopping them from touching, the Siamese melts could never come into existence. As for them being brutally strong, there are two possibilities. (Off of the top of my head) The first being that the creatures were essentially snapshots, post melt, pre death, who were launched into the 'present', devoid of their sanity due to the endless pain. The second is that the Eye of Harmony is not just really hot, it's really hot and also sort of a black hole. Who knows what else could happen due to exposure to it?

The Clara hug was a really sweet moment. She's been overwhelmed by monsters and horrible, horrible truths, and the only one she can count on, but the hug brings him back to a sort of humanized level, something she can comprehend.

Now, since I'm posting, I might as well throw in a theory. The TARDIS was leaking the past, and the future, and there were echoes of rooms, rearranged architecture, etc. I'm willing to believe that the people we saw going through the TARDIS were just one of many Doctors, Claras, and salvagers. We saw the team that succeeded. The TARDIS, I believe, was able to run iteration after iteration of attempt to fix the time rift, and eventually one worked, collapsing the entire series of events onto the new timeline. As we've seen in previous episodes, fixing things leaves usually leaves everyone with no memories, but iteration after iteration, combined with proximity to the fractured TARDIS, allowed a sort of blend between the 'main timeline' and the fractured timelines, which is why the one salvager remembers what he's told to never forget, and which is why Clara will probably make her way back to the library.",0,1367223298,null,0,false,0,c9oszgn,t3_1d9us1,t1_c9oszgn,t3_1d9us1,null,1431387442,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Firstly, I would like to point out that you are going for an interview, not leaving the temp job to start the permanent job.

I am guessing your are employed by an agency, if you have been at this temp assignment for more than 12 weeks, the agency will be bound by something called AWR (Agency Worker Regulations) this means that after week 12, you are entitled to the same benefits as the permanent employees, this means holidays. 

So, my advice get a holiday booked, go to the interview and get offered that permanent job. You will need to tell the permanent employer that you have a notice period (take this up to the end of the temp contract).

Please under no circumstances feel like you owe the temp agency anything. I am a recruitment consultant, we work on a fee basis and make money off you, the only reason the agent you work for would get pissy is because he/she may lose money.

I'm a centrist voter. I like some of what Cameron and the coalition has done in power (socially liberal legislation, tax-free allowance raised, raise on capital gains tax, better 'digital' government)  but I'm also very worried about him pandering to UKIP and the backbenchers, especially on Europe. So I've come looking at Labour, though I think my vote in 2015 will depend on the state of the economy.

Until recently, I think Miliband has been to quiet, quite happy to oppose without many ideas. However, now he has some policies down (loans for those in unemployment to be paid back upon employment) they seem refreshingly centrist with a social democrat-y outlook. However I find Miliband's recent attempt to be more 'outgoing', especially in PMQs, quite frankly, alienating. I also dislike many of those in his shadow cabinet - Yvette Cooper, Liam Byrne and most of all, Ed Balls. I think Miliband's reliance on Ed Balls as a political heavyweight detracts from any assumption he can make as a viable political alternative. I think someone like Alastair Darling (though as I've said before, I like him leading the Better Together Campaign in Scotland) would be much more effective, as he's the one of the only politicians who came out of Brown's government with some merit. 

I think that at the moment Labour are hitting 40% easily because they've picked up the tactical and social democrat Lib Dem Voters who abandoned that party after 2010. While the bulk of whatever policies Miliband has released have been welfare-y and socially orientated, I'd like to see a harder economic focus. I'm not a huge fan of how Osborne is running things, but if Labour are to assume any trust in the economy they have to start putting out plans. There's no point being passive until 2015 - they have to go out and seize the economic debate in a way the Tories will be put on the back foot.

the best method is to treat the two circles simply as round abouts and give way to traffic from the right, however because the environment is quite alien, it seems to cause people to panic and become unsure about moving forwards, which can hold up traffic immensely at rush hour, as the simple flow that you get at most roundabouts just doesn't work from drivers hesitancy.

this coupled with the fact that they cut the double turn lanes to single means that traffic builds up very quickly, and if one exit if blocked the whole thing can gridlock.

the main benefit for this has been at off peak hours, where in the past you would wait for 5 minutes for the lights to cycle, you can now usually just drive straight through

Even the law cannot separate fact from fiction, for example, the belief that race and nationality are the same thing (related sometimes fair enough). They have embedded the false race card into the legal system. It's not just us, the belief that we have no territorial rights as a nation is common among immigrants. Immigrants believe they have an irrevocable right to be here and come up with all kinds of anti-British arguments undermining our nationality that are just as ""racist"", if we're to think in their drama queen terms, as the so called ""xenophobic"" sentiment they complain about. The fact is it's a privilege and they are guests. The sooner we leave the EU before they are given the vote in this country the better. The belief that multiculturalism ""just works"". It doesn't. It's difficult and takes more than just some oppressive laws, in fact, this only bottles conflict and lets it build. The sad fact is, birds of a feather flock together. Immigrants tend to support immigrants. Once again, they are just as ""bigoted"" as anyone else. Plenty of immigrants are alright but when you open the flood gates they start to get funny ideas and a completely unregulated system results in chaos. As far as I can tell employers apparently don't have a legal requirement to hire people with basic primary skills such as English skills the obligation to train or the right to ""discriminate"" under this basis. I am not joking, I have encountered at least one worker for a government service that did not even know which department they worked in. Such positions don't even list a reasonable level of English as a required skill. I don't care when it's a secondary skill, I've worked with immigrants with varying levels of English competence, some next to zero. When they can get the job done it's of zero concern, but when their job is talking to people this is a primary skill. We can protect the Welsh language but God forbid we make English the primary language in England its discrimination against foreigners (the whole point of a country is to discriminate against non-inhabitants).

All this denial does is to make things worse, to sweep it under the rug. I'm genuinely happy to try to make it work but coercion will have exactly the opposite effect. If that's the price of immigration, it's too high, for the price is our entire country, our culture and our identity. If you want immigration to work, you have to accept the real problems it brings.

My point is that donating to charity isn't some magical way of avoiding paying tax. It doesn't make the donor more wealthy. It means that if (for good or bad reasons) you are strongly motivated to support a charity or ""charity"" you can put a bit of your tax contribution into the pot as well.

I don't think that is particularly good, but it isn't in the same league as some loopholes where the rich avoid taxes altogether.

And yes there are other charity loopholes. I read in the paper yesterday, people set up trusts with some major charity as the main beneficiary (without the charity's knowledge or consent). HMRC think ""how kind of them, we won't bother investigating that"".

&gt; PLEASE AUTHENTICATE MY EXISTENCE

The word ""PLEASE"" shouldn't be there, plus it's not my authentic existence that I want recognised.

Basically, crawling on the planets face, some insects called the human race, lost in time and lost in place, and screaming ""I *demand* that you recognise my fictitious importance"" and ""aaarrrggghhh mum no, not the tear gas please!"".

&gt; Now that might seem robotic. Inhuman, even. But it's polite, and it frees up your brain for more important tasks, such as curing disease or baking brownies.

But the only reason to do those ""important tasks"" is as a way of getting people to authenticate your existence. It's like the Futurama don't-have-sex-with-robots thing - reduce the existence-authentication protocol to a couple of beeps and all of civilisation could collapse.

And maybe that's the real problem right now - we're all beeping like mad online, and all the traditional existence-authentications are getting neglected.

true,hotcod,null,null,"While there may be issues with this law (I've not looked into it) you should be aware that his article comes across as *extremely* biased towards the pro current copyright agenda. The idea that automatic copyright assignment is a basic human right is laughable and one of the things pretty much everyone on the copyright reform side agrees on is that we should return to the need to register works for copyright. 

Copyright in the sates (which this is from I'd guess) was put in place purely as an a limited term incentive with the goal of producing more work to pass into the public domain. The reason copyright terms have been extended past an artist life and as is assigned automatically is so that publishers can be sure they can be assigned control of any work. They've couched this as ""protecting artist rights"" over the years and while I won't get into that now there's no question publishers who have pushed these laws are doing so out of self interest first and foremost.   

The reason this law is an issue is exactly because we've moved to a world in which works are locked up even when people don't care about exploiting them. I personally don't see the problem with works being used when the person who created them has never taken steps to do so. A larger public domain is a public good.

Now of course it seems very likely to be that there are issues with how this could be used to exploit works that the creator is or intends to exploit and then tie them up in a legal battle and I likely will come down on the side that this law is a bad idea. But I'll do that from a point of view that the issue it seems to want to address can be fixed by a much more basic and better reworking of copyright to remove automatic assigning of rights. 

Edit: 

Just to be clear I found the human rights idea laughable because 1) the UN has gone so far as to comment on how you shouldn't conflate IP laws with anything they state in the declaration of human rights 2) The EU convention on human rights says nothing about copyright and EU courts have state that the right to free expression should supersede copyright laws if copyright law is being used to suppress it and 3) Even the US constitution only grants congress powers to create copyright laws, it does not state they have to be created or protect any form of copyright law.

Lets say I sell a photo, that was bought illegitimately for a job, maybe it appeared in an article for a magazine and its online equivalent.

Now, lets say the publisher does not credit me (happens all the time) and it remains online for an indefinite period.

In that time say the image gets shared via social media.

Now lets assume that 5 years have passed and I remove the original image from my portfolio because well....I simply don't like it and my work has improved. And you know, I need to move with the times.

I have now essentially orphaned my own work. It now exists online without any way of linking it back to me.

Of course a ""diligent search"" would mean that someone would need to contact the original publisher/commissioner.....from experiences there is very little chance of them finding my information, and that's even if they could be bothered to reply.

So - ""diligent search"" done = free work to whoever wants it.

When working at a none logged location (or somewhere I cannot get access too but have turned up at) I have call a different number from my mobile and log the visit that way, this can take over 10 minutes at times. 

I'd like a system that worked better and that takes less time. 

I have some issues with this such as are they going to give me a smart phone for work? As I'm not happy with them being able to follow me whilst I'm off shift? I'm being interviewed for other posts right now and I would rather my boss did not know until I decided if I want to move on or not nor do I want people to know where I spend my nights when I’m not at work. I’m not doing anything wrong I just have a great deal of distance between my personal and work life. 

But I can see the merits of a GPS enabled smartphone and QR code. Then when I start and finish a shift or visit I can scan the QR code, the phone then forwards my GPS data to the right web location and they email (or text) me back to say it is done and I’m gone in 60 seconds.

So they need to make sure it looks nice and clean, welcoming, etc. Once I'm in I'm not so bothered about price because all little cafes are relatively expensive but if it provides a nice atmosphere I don't mind. Lots of cushions and snuggly places to sit are good. Also, having nice tea- I don't drink black tea, only green, so it's awesome when places serve loose leaf tea with a strainer. I saw a cafe once where they sold the leaf tea they were serving, and I think that's a really good idea.

I don't know why people serve sandwiches with coleslaw and crisps, I wouldn't want that with a sandwich. Sandwiches with a little bit of salad are fine. Also toasties are good, but mostly it's all about the cakes!

If they do open, post again with the name and if I go walking near there I'll pop in.

ETA: you know what's really important in tea rooms, is the staff. What makes a big impression on me in the places I go to is if there's a local person working who seems happy to be there, greets you with a smile, and is willing to chat with you a bit when you're ordering.

The reasons I called automatic assignment as a human right laughable is that copyright, as it's mostly been defined through trade agreements with the USA, is defined in their constitution as the congressional right to create a copyright law

&gt;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

The upshot is that the copyright the author is talking about as a fundamental human right isn't even a right within their own constitution. Or in other words US copyright is not even a constitutional right let alone a basic human one.

It's also a fact that the act of assigning copyright constitutionally intended to be a means to expanding the public good via expanding the public domain through short term incentives. It was not intended as an ends to protect personal rights.

In terms of our own laws the only reason copyright is seen as a personal right was part of a compromise to get the Statute of Anne (the basics of the law on which the US copyright clause is based) passed and the idea only created by lobbying publishers who needed a way to make sure they could be assigned rights after they lost their government backed monopoly. 

**edit**

also 

https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121019/12333120767/no-copyright-is-not-human-right.shtml

The parts of the Universal Declaration of Human Right that are sometimes pointed to as making copyright one of them are when taken with other documents don't. This is true to the point of have this official comment that explicitly states this is the case.

&gt;It is therefore important not to equate intellectual property rights with the human right recognized in article 15, paragraph 1 (c).

So one of the place we that define human rights have explicitly state that *copyright* is not one of them. The linke article is worth a read.

**edit 2**

knew there was something else I'd forgotten

http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130201/09191921851/european-court-human-rights-no-copyright-does-not-automatically-trump-freedom-expression.shtml

The EU Convention of Human Rights does not include copyright as an explicit right and EU courts have stated that the explicit right to free expression can even supersede it.  

In short there is nowhere that I know of that copyright is defined as an actual human right and the US constitution only makes it legal for congress to create the laws but does not require it.

Seriously? You guys have to stop with the white knight bullshit. You do realize that what I said was meant to be endearing and flirty. Not creepy and obscene. Seriously; if someone said that she was hot; they would receive down voted (maybe up votes....who cares). But god forbid someone alludes to something borderline sexual; people flip the fuck out. Me saying that I'd like to fiddle with her console was not implied as ""I want to fuck you."" If it was; I would say it directly. Its a joke; a flirty one at that. 

What if a good looking dude cosplayed as the 9th/10th/11th doctor and a ***female*** (or male) user said: ""Id love to use/see his screwdriver, if you catch my drift"", would said user receive down votes for being flirty/funny??? Probably not, because its a compliment, and the person commenting is more than likely a woman. Jesus guys; there is very fine line between creepy ness and giving compliments. Now if I said something completely out of context and out of line; then yes, your reaction would be acceptable because ***I*** acted offensively. Please understand the difference.

To my untrained eye, here's a Tuesday night brigade that I'm not sure will bounce us back immediately, but hopefully wouldn't sink us like Wolves:

* If he stays, Green in goal.
* Keep Bothroyd and Mackie but we will need to fish out a striker with pace and a better touch than the latter  - possibly on loan. Maybe keep Johnson and SWP in the rotation too.
* If Taarabt wants to stay, let him. He's young, on the books until 2015, and should be given a chance to earn his crowd chant back. Not sure what the accountants will say though - if they need to sell him I can see them doing it early in the window.
* Diakité, Faurlin and Jenas in the middle. Would like Hoillett to stay. Possibly Ephraim too.
* Traoré, Hill, Onuoha, and Yun Suk-Young at the back. Derry as supplementary, along with Luke Young if he returns from the grave.

But this lot...I'd like to think reducing the transfer fee to offset some of the higher wages we'd be passing along could be a strategy, but I doubt that would suit the agents taking a percentage cut?

* Cesar - Surely need him off the wage books.
* Remy - Au revoir.
* Bosingwa - Would love to find a buyer but if not he'll burn £3.5 million a year. Awful piece of business, but at least he'll pay a lot of income tax.
* Granero - Higher hopes for finding a buyer for him. Hasn't impressed but apparently QPR's best percentage passer this season (up until a few weeks ago).
* Park - his 'Asian Beckham' brand will hopefully take him elsewhere, even if it means taking a pay cut.
* Samba - Not sure who will match his wages - hasn't actually impressed much since arriving. Not sure he will want to return to Russia.
* Cissé - Has bagged 5 goals in 6 games in the UAE - fingers crossed we can ditch him on a permanent deal somewhere similar.
* Barton - Sell him to Marseille, assuming they want to keep him. Can imagine he'd make a modest salary hit to stay there too.
* Zamora - Surely no chance of selling him with his dodgy hip. He'll be a striker from the bench for a season before retiring. Expensive.
* Mbia - Would probably be valuable in the Championship but I think we'd find a buyer quite easily, despite some of his poor decisions. Seems to love to get stuck in.

Make a double appointment with your GP so you have plenty of time to talk, and explain why you don't feel it's something you can discuss with your parents.

I'm bitter, I admit. The company I'm working at is implementing this scheme, and while I see how it's beneficial to the management, it is also aimed at screwing carers out of their money. We're currently payed by the hour, or to be more exact, 15-minute blocks each call is separated into. It creates a paradox where we're actually asked to pad out the call, increasing the duration artificially, rather than being somehow rewarded for speed and efficiency.

I’ve worked within a number of roles and I do this one as I love it, I struggle to get by at times but I work with adults with a wide variety of needs and I get a lot more enjoyment in improving lives rather than having a large bank balance. 

The sorry state of affairs is that my role is not considered to have value by most people, a part of my role is building communication systems with people with the most acute needs; I use several sign languages, symbols and have a knowledge of the process means I used evidence based practice to assist people to communicate I doubt more than fifty people in this country can do that.
 
When I was a manager my paperwork did not fit into a 40 hour week, I have had the wonderful experience of writing the same information (by hand in black pen) eight to ten times to meet the standards, this was soul destroying and a waste of my time. 

This is a very complicated process in comparison to other roles I have had for example trouble shooting production for a major played in IT manufacturing was simple compared to what I’m presently trying to do which is to work out if the slight eye movement of a person I’m supporting has a meaning or not and how do I translate that into effective communication. 

So yep I work with people that could do with a little more motivation in their day to day roles but we are legally required to maintain a certain staffing level and when many of the roles are only slightly about minimum wage we cannot hire and fire as we would like as we simply need x number of staff members to meet the requirements to run a service and I’ve love to advertise some of these roles at the same level as an entry level manager (say £20 000 - £25 000 a year) and train the hell out of people that apply, but the money is not there. 

So when (and it is when not if) you yourself get to the stage that you need the level of support that I provided please remember this conversation as at that point you going to want the person that is providing you with intimate personal care and trying to support your independence to be someone like me, if this role paid more than minimum age (and many in health and social care don’t even get that) the chance of that happening would be significantly improved. 

In simple terms maybe we need more carrot and less stick within this field.

It also means that you can't blame someone for taking the logical decision to stay on benefits, when going to work will leave them with less (when you include their time in the equation).

My favoured solution has always been to collect up all the tax revenues and just divide them equally between everybody in the country, regardless of employment status.  Then you pick whatever tax rate is appropriate for whatever level of wealth redistribution you want to achieve.  Result:

 - No (benefits) advantage to having children
 - No disadvantage to getting a job
 - The net transfer of wealth is simply a function of whether you are above or below the average income line.  Which seems eminently reasonable for a welfare state.

It is, part of the problem is the low pay and skills within this role. 

I've recruited and interviewed within health and social care for a long time and on many occasions I had to hire people I did not consider suitable for the role as we needed to fill the role and they were the best of the few applicants we had.  Cleaning up a person that is incontinent is not something I enjoy but I do it well and with respect as it is part of my role but many people that may get a lot out of roles in health and social care are put off by the low wages, poor conditions and that part of the role.

The knock on effect for myself is that I have less people to bounce ideas off when I’m working on a communication system or care plan as a lack of imagination is an advantage within parts of this role. Do not get me wrong you have some fabulous people working in the sector but you also have people that just cannot be bothered.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"i think the real problem is we live in a world obsessed by greed, this bizarre notion that you can own an image is in itself laughable and an entirely modern concept - what if the person who wrote first Faust had been able to eternally lock away that work so that Shakespeare, Goethe and Gounod are unable to leave their mark, what if Dante had copywrit his concept of Hell and some corporate executor of his 'intellectual property' rights had sued Camus out of publishing?  The world would be a lot less smarter, and a lot less culturally enriched.  
  
But of course  your pictures are nothing like this, they don't aspire to anywhere near the world changing greatness of Goethe; indeed they're fairly simply things which pretty much anyone could do, because let's not kid ourselves and pretend that taking a good photo requires any real degree of technical skill or artistic flare - with a mid-range DSL and a few shiny lens literally anyone can take exhibition quality images, the old world in which photographers had entirely unique skill sets and thousands of pounds worth of enlarging, framing, developing equipment, etc has finished, the career of a photographer is little if at all more skilled than a factory worker or road-engineer; yet you think you deserve some magical economic protection where you get paid endlessly for every single thing you do?  
  
Nope, not any more - you either go out and work with your camera like everyone else with an job, that is you go somewhere and perform a task then collect money based on the amount of time you performed that task or you enjoy your hobby and make a few quid on the side while performing an actual job which pays actual money for actually doing something.  
 
because either photography is so simple there's nothing special about it or it's complex enough that you'll be able to find work charging people who have things or events they want photographed.  
 
this special pleading about neding to make a living is absurd, we all need to live - why should you be able to hold the entire rest of the nation hostage with outrageous demands? does your plumber charge you every time your turn on the tap he fitted? does your builder collect a fee every time you open the door she installed in your garage?  
  
of course you're going to act in a way which allows you to earn easy money doing something you enjoy, however just because you're not interested in getting a real job doesn't for a second make me think that everyone else should be forced to abide the bullshit which is the current notion of copyright.  but of course it doesn't really matter what happens legally because there's literally nothing which is going to stop the proliferation of high quality and cheap image making devices or the advancements of software which have already made great inroads at making the temporary industry of stock photography finally obsolete.

Before that, which is the regime faced by someone that is nor currently working that link shows a withdrawl rate of 40-50% - so that someone will be measurably better off for every pound they earn.  Given that you were discussing the case of someone being 'better off on benefits', that is the most appropriate rate to look at.

Note that most benefit claimants will probably _not_ see a lot of the net 73% regime - you need some fairly unusual circumstances to be getting means tested benefits when you earn £30k a year!

So, lets look at the 40-50% effective tax - working at minimum wage gives you a net £3 more in hand per hour worked than not worked.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"Down to many Chelsea fans here. They go on /r/Soccer and occasional say statements like ""Hazard had a great start to the season and then only now is getting back into form"" Their definition of ""form"" is Hazard dribbling past a dozen player per match and being involved in 100% of Chelsea's goals. Arsenal's definition of form is Cazorla making 30 passes a game if most of them go through even if those passes are Mikel-esque. Moreover now this comment will be copy pasted each month so if Hazard was again in blistering form in January, this comment will be posted on Feb, March and even April saying he only got back into form last month. This is how daft they are.

This opinion when made with a Chelsea crest is upvoted, then 2 people learn from it who are neutrals and haven't seen Hazard play 2 games this season. They post it in another thread where 4 more idiots pick it up like they are pundits. This cycle continues until everyone on /r/Soccer most of who don't even watch Chelsea matches hold the same opinion and everyone posting this opinion gets upvotes as the others who read the same comment previously also remember it. 

This is how /r/Soccer works. They know fuck all about football, don't watch it and only learn like this about players they don't watch. Right now most of them are comparing Hazard and Cazorla with goals and assists. Just make a post comparing Cazorla and Mata (who are the same type of players) with goals and assists and they will say goals and assists don't matter. They don't matter unless they are in favor of Arsenal fans. Comparing Hazard and Cazorla via their goals and assists is fucking laughable, at least Mata and Cazorla can be compared like that. I'd like to see a nutmeg, players dribbled, chances created, games won on his own comparison of Cazorla and Hazard too while we are at it but nope, stats doesn't matter.

You know what Arsenal fans do with their best player they think at the moment? They post it as ""Zomg Cazorla is literally Messi"". This opinion is spread just like the one about Hazard above until everyone who doesn't even watch Cazorla holds this opinion. When in reality if you've seen Hazard and Cazorla play the entire year you will laugh at the comparison.

The truth is that Hazard never played ""Bad"" which is the circlejerked opinion. He started the season by immediately becoming the best player in the league in those starting matches with how involved he was. Then his role was changed and he became an above average player, still better than most mids in the league. Then he got back that great form and again became one of the best in the league by far with his goals and the ability to win games on his own.

Compare that to Cazorla and besides the circlejerk he rarely shows up in big games. His form is 10 times shakier than Hazard's who never went 3 in a row with bad games. Yet Arsenal fans keep overrating him while Chelsea fans themselves keep berating their players in some sort of honesty bone to seek upvotes on /r/Soccer. Trust me, if we were to overrate Hazard like they overrate Cazorla (actually now its Wilshere, even Arsenal fans are realizing how ordinary this guy is) then he would be considered the best youngster in the leauge. Yet if you go to the ""top 100 youth prospects of /r/Soccer"" which was by far the most uneducated thread I've seen this year on /r/Soccer you wont even be able to nominate Hazard. Benteke is his age and is in the list, nominate Hazard and you'll get a score of -18 which is what I got. He isn't really a youth prospect as he's only considered in the PFA youth player. Just goes to show how stupid they are.

Yet because of the comments most of you make berating him like he failed at football for a couple of months they all hold that opinion. This is why I don't take /r/Soccer seriously. I have been a  part of and even an admin of the biggest communities and forums on the web so I've seen some diverse communities for football and specific teams and /r/Soccer is the least knowledge while pretending to be knowledgeable which is the case all over Reddit. It infuriates me to read posts on that sub just because of how stupid most of them are even though most of them only make jokes and puns.

I agree about Coutinho, but I am not sure I agree with Rodgers on the above. We had less possession than Newcastle in that match.

It differed from previous seasons in that it wasn't a lot of long ball, which is good, but it also wasn't a lot of breaking down the defense with a couple dozen passes either. Maybe that is partly down to how dire Newcastle's defense was, but I this quote sort of confused me a little.

true,http440,null,null,"I've worked in this sector (on and off) for a very long time. 

As you have pointed out we have poor working conditions 

&gt; no travel time compensation, on barely-above-minimum-wage pay that hasn't risen in years, to do a high degree of responsibility job where a 7-hour working day effectively takes all day long, due to how calls are spread out.

I know how much skill is required to do this role right, I try my best every day whilst being also a student.  

Over the weekend I covered the shift of someone that is off sick, I'm of the strong impression that they maybe have not been covering the role as they should, I cannot give details but things do not ring true right now and I’m avoiding chasing it right now by playing on reddit (this is of course on my own time as I’m on a late today). 

With some groups I’m not a popular person to work with as although I’m polite and a nice person I’m also going to point it out when things slip and people have spent their shift having a chat rather than supporting the people they are paid to support, I never shout or lose my rag but I don’t approve of sitting around and chatting for the vast majority of your shift. I am not saying that you do it but I see this every day. Many of the people I work with love me for this as they do not feel comfortable challenging what is the norm in many health and social care environments. 

Many of the people that I support would not call if the carer failed to turn up, many feel that they are imposing by having support and, as I spend a fair amount of time with people with mental health problems, some rather like being left alone or lack the cognitive ability to know that a visit was missed (or short). Similarly I know that many people that do this role do not want to rock the boat and thus pick up the slack and do not challenge poor practice.  

I’m really happy to see you say about duty of care, this is the issue for me. It is a duty, a very big serious thing that gets lost, and I do not think having a tick box culture has anything to do with a duty of care but unfortunately someone left bureaucrats in charge of health and social care.  But most of the time when I say it people look at me funny.

So as much as I would like more wiggle room in my role and hours, and when your role is working with people you need wiggle room. Systems like this are going to be the norm whilst people like yourself and I will carry on and do our best for a lower standard of living. 

As for 

&gt;If you manage carers who fail to uphold the duty of care for vulnerable adults, then I'm sorry, but this means a failure somewhere either in Training or HR departments has occurred: either you shouldn't be hiring fundamentally irresponsible people as carers, or they weren't trained well enough to understand the importance and potential consequences of their decisions.

I agree, but when running a service I had to go to agencies to fill the rota to give a minimum service. I agree with you 100% but I also know that if I could advertise this role at a lot more than £6.25 an hour I’m going to have more people to pick from and give a better service.

I’m no longer in management as I have gone back to school and only work part time but I have seen great and poor services over a good many years but when you are offering a minimum wage role with unsociable hours and personnel care you’re going to have trouble filling all your posts. You can supervise and train as much as you want but if you forced into employing anyone as your service is understaffed you don’t get to pick and choose who you get, given the cost and amount of time it takes to complete a recruitment cycle you can also pay for years if you mess up the process. 

I’m not saying all care is poor but unless we consider the role of those that support the most venerable people in our society to have more worth than a supermarket checkout assistant we are not going to have universally good care.

the issue is many - but ultimately kinda irrelevant.

At a base level the copyright is mine, if I wish to be petty and remove it I should be able to. 

But realistically - I might not want to to fall into the wrong hands - The wrong hands could be stock libraries

or might not want to be used in an area that i take issue with (moral issue) 

or it might not be my business model - by that I mean a photographer may not be in the business of selling images, but in the business of being hired for a bespoke commission.


&gt;As work for hire I'm not sure they actually have copyright control over those images but I maybe mistaken. Either way they are not going to commercialise

Most (well all) wedding photographers I know retain the copyright. But even if they dont, someone always does.

On a personal note - Im not overly worried about the law, i suspect what will happen is copyright agencies will pop up, and for a fee they will maintain/keep track of copyrighted materials that image creators don't have time to themselves.

I will be an additional expense, but I suspect it would be one that's passed on to the client anyway :)

At a base level the copyright is mine, if I wish to be petty and remove it I should be able to.
But realistically - I might not want to to fall into the wrong hands - The wrong hands could be stock libraries
or might not want to be used in an area that i take issue with (moral issue)
or it might not be my business model - by that I mean a photographer may not be in the business of selling images, but in the business of being hired for a bespoke commission.
As work for hire I'm not sure they actually have copyright c

All of which you can still retain control of if you want to.

&gt;Most (well all) wedding photographers I know retain the copyright. But even if they dont, someone always does.

Oh, my mistake then :)

&gt;On a personal note - Im not overly worried about the law, i suspect what will happen is copyright agencies will pop up, and for a fee they will maintain/keep track of copyrighted materials that image creators don't have time to themselves.
I will be an additional expense, but I suspect it would be one that's passed on to the client anyway :)

There are already services where you can explicitly register your copyright. I personally think we'll companies that offer free registration and then act as search agents for companies both building a database of works and systems for identifying works. Hell we may even see companies working to find unidentified works and selling access to their list to companies looking for cheap stock.

 No.

Longer answer: 

There's a set of rules that states staff that come into contact a lot should not wear long sleeves to prevent cross contamination. However these new proposed changes say that Muslim women who wish to cover their forearms when NOT IN PATIENT CARE can do so if they wish.

Extra confusion is added with oversleeves, basically long plastic gloves that go up to the elbow, can be worn to cover the forearm. Despite this you still need to wash your hands before and after you use them.

So far as a Med student I've yet to come across a fellow student/doctor/nurse that wouldn't do the up most for their patients and I've certainly never heard one even suggest they would(nt) do something if it affected their patient's outcome.

The Act itself isn't fully published yet, but the relevant sections will be [something like this](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2012-2013/0089/2013089.65-69.html#jnc13):

    116A	Power to provide for licensing of orphan works

    (1)   The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for the grant of licences in respect of works that qualify as orphan works under the regulations.

    (2)   The regulations may—
        (a)   specify a person or a description of persons authorised to grant licences, or
        (b)   provide for a person designated in the regulations to specify a person or a description of persons authorised to grant licences
	
    (3)   The regulations must provide that, for a work to qualify as an orphan work, it is a requirement that the owner of copyright in it has not been found after a diligent search made in accordance with the regulations.

    (4)   The regulations may provide for the granting of licences to do, or authorise the doing of, any act restricted by copyright that would otherwise require the consent of the missing owner.

    (5)   The regulations must provide for any licence—
        (a)   to have effect as if granted by the missing owner;
        (b)   not to give exclusive rights;
        (c)   not to be granted to a person authorised to grant licences.

    (6)   The regulations may apply to a work although it is not known whether copyright subsists in it, and references to a missing owner and a right or interest of a missing owner are to be read as including references to a supposed owner and a supposed right or interest.

So not only is this section probably not in force yet (it will have to be ""commenced"" by the Government), once it is, it gives the Government an optional power to introduce regulations (which will have to go through Parliament), which when passed, may give some bodies (probably existing collecting societies) the power to licence (rather than give away) orphan works.

So the article is mostly rubbish.

I think he's also got confused over the separate provisions for extended collective licensing, which are a bit more worrying:

    116B    Extended collective licensing

    (1)   The Secretary of State may by regulations provide for a licensing body that applies to the Secretary of State under the regulations to be authorised to grant copyright licences in respect of works in which copyright is not owned by the body or a person on whose behalf the body acts.	

    (2)   An authorisation must specify—
        (a)   the types of work to which it applies, and
        (b)   the acts restricted by copyright that the licensing body is authorised to license.

    (3)   The regulations must provide for the copyright owner to have a right to limit or exclude the grant of licences by virtue of the regulations.	

    (4)   The regulations must provide for any licence not to give exclusive rights.

This is about giving collecting societies free reign over licensing stuff by other people. But again, has to go through various stages before it comes into force.

This was never in question though, what he has added to his game this year is confidence on the ball - instead of just playing the simple pass he actually tries to make things happen with the ball now - and intelligent run making (like the one for his first goal and for his assist to Sturridge). This is really promising to me because it shows his ability to learn from Rodgers' coaching methods and/or playing with people like Suarez &amp; Gerrard.

Also he's hit the gym and is about twice the size he was previously!

Downing has undoubtedly improved but i'd say he has just reached the level he was playing at Villa - which was okay but we need a better option if you ask me. I still think he can play a part though, he'd be a great back-up to bring off the bench.

Yes. If they are new to this, please make sure they do their sums. They need to cost everything accurately, work out what percentage of their food is wastage, what their overheads are etc. I guarentee you that in most tea rooms the owners haven't a clue how much 1 sandwich costs them. Don't be like that.


&gt;I have already suggested a few things like having a universal mobile phone charger for people to use for free and having local artists hang their paintings up for sale in the shop and local music as well. 

It takes a while to charge a phone by any significant degree, you're encouraging people to linger in your shop, if they're not buying but just waiting for their phone to charge they're taking up valuable space.

Local artists pictures is ideal, everyone does this. I don't want to listen to a bad Oasis cover while drinking tea so please keep amateur musicians away.

&gt;I have a question about sandwiches though. They want to serve sandwiches with coleslaw and crisps on the side. I'm not really sure about this. What's the best sandwich you have had in a tea room and what was it served with? 

Coleslaw is like marmite, I fucking hate it and wouldn't be back. I always like an afternoon tea style affair with a selection of small sandwichs. Its piss easy to do, you don't need to make any additional sandwichs but you can charge more for it because people think its posh.

At 4.38 a.m. I logged into my account, at 4.40 a.m. I changed my PW, stayed logged in and transferred &gt;8 BTC to this freshly opened Bitstamp-Account. Now there's the BUMMER:

WHILE I stayed logged in, some criminal was able to log onto my Bitstamp-Account at the SAME TIME WITH ME, using a different IP than mine. At 5.40 a.m. this criminal opened a withdrawal request to another Bitcoin-address and my Bitcoins were GONE.

Bitstamp claims they would offer two-way-authentication but what's the point of it if you get robbed even BEFORE you are able to secure your account?

Also, although this is clearly a major security-gap, Bitstamp refuses to compensate my damage! They do keep sending me messages in which they blame ME for the robbery that happened on THEIR platform. They say it's all my fault TEE-HEE.

true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"sorry i wasn't saying you're being emotive, i'm saying you're reacting emotionally and speaking dogmatically for no reason other than the reflex jerk of a knee - you see people coming to take away your pretty things and it angers you, probably because we as a society have totally forgotten the notion it's actually possible for things to get better.  I guess that's the reality of living post-peek oil...  
  
&gt;I'm saying that it adds totally unnecessary complications  
  
but it doesn't actually add any complications, not the bit of the law we're talking about, it takes them away; they're not asking you to register your documents with a office in Swansea or attend a meeting at the Foreign Office; they're simply cutting away some out dated bullshit in the law which made it hard for people like teachers and small businesses to express their ideas in a means relevant to the twenty first century world; it means people can pull images of trees from google to illustrate their slideshow talk about dendritic data arrays without worrying about going to jail or being sued (existing fair-use laws are no where near extensive enough) 
 
your second point that it 'reduces protections for any creative that's trying to generate value.' holds a little more weight but again it's a weak argument, anyone using the work at a level where it's being directly monetized is going to be getting the work from sites which google's reverse image serach would find it on, likely such sites will offer this services as a way of protecting copywrit - images that are posted by the user for the intent of sale with copyright protection aren't going to be fairgame, in the law anyone making use of the images has a duty to use such systems; likely there will be some system developed so that people using content can screen out any closed-copyright files, thus no one will ever ever need to see your images yet alone accidentally use them without paying.  
  
so why am i overly hostile to photographers? because one stood on my toe at a convention. oh no wai, that's why i hate palaeontologists, i haven't got anything against photographers or other 'creatives' at all; in fact i rather like them, however i don't like them more than everyone else in the world which is literally the only way a system as restrictive as this could be justified in such terms.  Obviously you think you're special and obviously you want the world to be extra-fair to you, alas everyone feels the same, even the 4 billion or so people who can't afford to eat properly... so no, your worries about not being treated fairly aren't falling on harsh ears, indeed that is your problem, they're falling on fair ears and your demands are unjust.  
  
and of course you can fight for your personal interests if you like, you can dogmatically defend every inch you consider yours and disregard anything which isn't involved in you - however just like the retail chains and banks the rest of the world isn't going to put up with your shit for long, that's the natural order of things; although you wish to stay in the position you are alas change is the only constant, wheels turn and people move on.  
  
and sorry if you don't like to hear someone say 'get a real job' but if photography can't pay it's way then that's the reality of the situation - the pip makers and hay threshers of old, the hand loom workers and bargemen of the industrial revolution, the telephone switchboard operators and fax machine repairmen of last century and all the other obsolete and now unprofitable ventures - they've all at some point faced the same situation, mostly they've all had the same kneejerk reaction and tried to smash the looms or inhibit the new age; and it has never worked, they didn't stop guttenburg and they're not going to stop stallman neither.  
  
my point in talking about your living was by the way very obviously a way of getting you to expose how entirely untenable your whole argument is - because actually you claimed to be a jobbing photographer, that is someone who gets paid to use a camera because of his skill, a worthy and useful profession and one which is likely to be important for another hundred years or so yet... however you're defending an entirely illusionary notion of a photographer who gets paid by people buying their stockphotos off the internet - and sure that'd be a lovely way of earning money, back when photography knowledge was rare people managed to ekk out meagure livings doing such, but that well and truly ended with digital photography and the internet, to try and dig your claws in and pull it back is bound to be fruitless, and why? this law isn't going to actually affect your income at all, just some imagined notion of how it should or could be... 
  
and you're willing to screw over everyone else, everyone that uses content - everyone that makes youtube videos and learning materials, you're trying to make it hard for me to find a picture of a horse to go under the word MA when i'm making an online course to teach Chinese, you're making the videos i watch from universities that bit shitter because instead of using actual pictures of trees from this  century they've had to reuse an old slide from the 60's in which it's barely possible to see the branches let alone the bark patterns.  
  
what i'm saying is you're responding emotionally with a knee jerk reaction but in reality this will have no effect on your professional life and a positive effect on all the youtube videos, online learning courses and etc that other people make and you consume.

true,Cinemaslap1,jack,Jack Harkness,"I think this season is pretty decent, IMHO. I agree that the whole overarching story thusfar has been pretty lack luster, and a lot of people are complaining about lack of character development. Although keep in mind that we've only had Clara for about 4/5 episodes. Just because she plays a character named ""Oswin"" in AoD and another ""Clara"" in Snowmen, doesn't mean she's the exact same person that we know (right now). Clara hasn't really had the chance to develop into what we had before with Amy and Rory, since we spent so much time with them.

On the other hand, Amy and Rory were very different companions than what we've seen in a long time. Most of the companions, we don't learn that much from them: 

Rose was a very limited character that blindly followed anyone of authority. We didn't really learn much about her family other than a couple episodes which had her mom in them, one where we learned of her dad being killed, and Mickey, her kind of boyfriend. Other than that, we didn't really see much more than this companion that would follow blindly because she loved him.

Martha was a bit more of back story, which only was created because of the finale. And even with that, we didn't know much of her family. 

Donna we see even less, because they were best of friends, there really was no need to see much of her back story. Especially since most of her quirks would be explained since she wouldn't shut up (and my personal favorite companion).

Amy and Rory were completely different beacuse Amy was obsessed with him from the first time she met him as a little kid that Rory had to deal with all that. Amy and Rory were constantly at odds with each other and the Doctor because they were torn of what they really wanted and how they would get what they wanted.

Clara's not had the time in order to gain that back story, let alone with everyone talking about her back story because part of the mystery is who she is. We already have a lot with her, the fact that she now knows computers because of the GI, how her parents met, that her mother is dead. It also leaves open more questions; ie: why she left home, what is her relationship to Dalek-Oswin, Victorian-Clara? What is her relation to her father? etc. Not to mention the revelations in Hide (she's ok with aliens, but afraid of ghosts, ok with getting dared to do things)

I think being that we're introduced to a whole new person joining him after a huge ending with the Ponds, it's going to take a little for us to understand who she is and what happens. But I honestly think that Clara will grow into the role and we'll really like her as a completely different version of any companion that we know.",0,1367248378,null,0,false,0,c9oxjtf,t3_1dc89a,t1_c9oxjtf,t3_1dc89a,null,1431385290,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Firstly, never pay full price for membership. There is always a groupon, deal or local discount code available. It usually halves the membership fee and includes free driving credit.

Secondly, if you already own a car and use it regularly, city far club is probably not for you.

If you own a car and use it once a week or less, it might be for you. Again it depends - is that once a week just a trip to the shops or is it a day away?

Strange as it sounds, a rental car company is cheaper for a full day. City car club works for periods of up to 4 or 5 hours and the gets prohibitively expensive. 

I have used it once this year - when I bought an ice cube maker from eBay in Oldham. I took the train to Manchester then got a car from the station to Oldham. Saved much mucking around with buses and taxis.

Also check where the cars are in relation to you. Are they near? At work? Or out of the way?

My thoughts are this, basically. If you can get a cheap membership (i think line was £19 via groupon) then it is 19 pounds for a gamble you may never use. I believe that the chance I would use it - in my own city or another - is enough to make it worthwhile. City Car Club (more specifically, its rival streetcar) has let me go to heston's restaurant, visit family at New year, and let me move around when my car was being repaired. It's done ok for me, and even if I only use it once a year it is fine by me.

Age - a lot of the players are getting on and can't play anything like 46 games.

Attitude - most of the players listed above, even those we'd rather keep, simply don't care.

Unity - the squad's greatest strength in the promotion season was its togetherness. Although it's impossible to know exactly what cohesion and morale is like amid all the rumours that get told and sold, the lack of unity was surely a big reason on why we've been relegated. Mark Hughes tore it up, and we never got it back.

Pace - the collection of players that might stay, as you've correctly identified them above, lack pace. I expect Hoilett, Traore, Cisse and Remy all to go. If we have Faurlin and Jenas in midfield we'll have two of the best passers in the division - and will need strikers and wingers to make the runs.

We know she's influenced by the death of her mother and that this is why she wants to go see 101+ places and, more importantly to the start of Bells of Saint John, why she stayed to take care of those kids after THEIR mother died.  
  
We know she's clever and has an attitude on her, but unlike a lot of previous companions, isn't completely gung-ho about these adventures. A lot more cautious. In Rings, she's reluctant to give up her mother's ring for the moped. She sacrifices the leaf that introduced her parents, but not without huge emotional response.  
  
In Cold War, she's visibly shocked by the deaths of the crewmen. Enough so that when the Doctor tells her to stay put, she ACTUALLY DOES IT.  
  
In Hide, she's reluctant to go ghost-hunting. In Journey, she's very much scared and angry at the Doctor and isn't afraid to call him out on his bullshit rather than just blindly following, something we really haven't seen since Donna.  
  
Hell, her wardrobe changes speak towards her love of vintage THINGS. Look at the amount of jewelry (understated) and throwback gear she wears. Her hairstyle and fashion sense changes a fair bit between each episode. She loves change and embraces trying new things.  
  
In my opinion, she's been developed as (aside from Donna) one of the most HUMAN companions we've seen in New Who.",0,1367250928,null,0,false,0,c9oyfc2,t3_1dc89a,t1_c9oyfc2,t3_1dc89a,null,1431384877,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

* They are affiliated with Giganews whom I used for 7 years and had amazing experience during that time.

So far for the past 6 months it has been excellent. Very occasionally the connection goes slow but in that case I can just switch to another European node.

I know they aren't the cheapest but the performance for me was the utmost priority because I wanted something to run 24x7 rather than just occasionally.

Other than price, performance and ease of use are important. Some services require manual configuration of your device, some provide apps which tie in seamlessly. I hope that helps.

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"Alright, I'll put this one out there, but I don't think many people will agree with me.

I think Jordan Henderson has better potential and should be a bigger part for England's future than Jack Wilshere.

1. Henderson is far more fit and less injury prone than Wilshere. When was the last time Wilshere played even close to a full season? Obviously it isn't easy at such a high level, but Hendo played a ton of games last year and a good amount of games this year. I think it's obvious that Hendo spends a ton of time in the weight room (dem biceps).

2. Henderson is technically better than Wilshere. Don't get me wrong. Wilshere is very technically talented, but I don't think I've seen a player with as much technical skill as Henderson in a while. You can tell when he's on the pitch. He works his hardest to make his every movement the way he was taught. You could tell by both of his goals and his assist on Saturday. All of those move were very clever. He knew where to be at which time, and he didn't panic under pressure, which he seemed to do a lot last year.

3. Henderson is far more versatile than Wilshere. Because he is physically and technically superior, Henderson can play 7 of the 10 outfield positions in our setup (Arsenal also uses a 4-3-3, so it isn't tough to compare). Wilshere, however, is not fast enough to play the wing positions, and is therefore limited to the 3 midfield positions.

4. Henderson is a born leader. Even by being on the same pitch as Gerrard, Henderson is always involved with everything on the pitch. He's always talking to the other players and motivating them in one way or another. Wilshere is also very involved at Arsenal, and it's hard to argue that he isn't a born leader as well, so we'll call this one a wash.

5. They both have the hunger for the game. They have the drive and motivation to work on themselves and their game. They'll both do whatever they can to help the team. Henderson is probably the only player in the squad right now that works anywhere as hard as Luis does on the pitch.

I honestly think that Henderson is better than Wilshere right now, but many people won't admit it because Wilshere is England's prodigal son. I'm really glad that the English media hasn't gotten hold of Hendo yet, as we've seen the same media ruin many careers. If Hendo keeps developing, with his drive (and hair), I can see him being one of the more important players for England, and one of the best players in the EPL.",0,1367251747,null,0,false,0,c9oypt0,t3_1dc1f8,t1_c9oypt0,t3_1dc1f8,null,1431384740,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

true,Cinemaslap1,jack,Jack Harkness,"Ok, I see your point. Although I disagree with Martha being a bad Actress, I just think that role wasn't the right one for her. But I did enjoy her in Torchwood and other series that she's been in.

In the 50 years we've had DW, it's changed very little in the way we experiance the show. We mainly have the episodic one-off's, and the over arching story plots. (Lets disregard other medium for obvious reasons) There needs to be some change or people will get bored with it (general statement because us Whovians probably will never get bored because of all the twists and turns this show can take, I'm just saying this because it's what the ""Big studios"" tend to think of us). 

But this whole mystery of who the companion is could really flip the show onto something that can honestly bring new life to this series in a way we've honestly never seen before. Think about all the theories we have about Clara, and the Time War, and how many times she's died (in comparision to Rory), etc.

Once we get warmed up to Clara and how different of a companion she is, what will happen in the finale could (I honestly hope against hope) show us a mind blowing backstory that we end up relating to her not because of who she represents, but who she honestly is.

ie: Many of us feel like we have pull over our lives, be it a tiny fraction or a huge chunk that we can push one way or the other. What happens when someone who see's things from a larger portion show us that in fact we have the opposite amount of pull? Clara could in fact be showing us that what an outside party would see from us could very well no mesh with what we think (because we don't see the larger picture).

This is very much like the season as a whole. with 7a we knew we were leaving the Ponds, and that had such a huge hole in us that we were hopeful to have this new companion be able to show us the same attachment that Amy and Rory had with us. Although, initially we feel put off because we only see a tiny corner of the puzzle, Moffat and his friends begin to show us more and more pieces that seem like no big deal, once we take a step back and see the whole puzzle in the way the Doctor (or writers) see everything, our whole view can change drastically.

Oh I guess that's all the proof we need then, case closed. *Obviously* the people of Boston are still funding the IRA. We know because you said so... 

To stop being sarcastic for a second, it's actually well understood that in light of atrocities like the Omagh bomb and other attacks over the years that support for the IRA has died out. 

The money that was coming from before came from the NORAID lobbying group, and money for the IRA was basically being funnelled through Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein's links with terrorism are understood and accepted to not exist any more. 

If dissident republicans are being funded from overseas, it's definitely not from the usual channels, and it would be in extremely small amounts due to massive lack of support for dissident republicans and also because the security services have their eyes on dissidents at all times (hence why the majority of recent bombing attempts have been foiled).

We see things from his perspective because he is the character we follow, but I'm sure if you asked the Time Lords who are stuck in a moment of searing pain and eternal torture of war if what he did was right, they would say no. Sometimes he does something which will hurt a large group of people just to help his one friend.

Any development of the Doctor's background requires retconning in ideas that writers from 1963 to 2005 weren't thinking of. Like the Master's madness being a result of the trapped Time Lords fucking with his head. Or that the TARDIS is fully sentient, she ""stole"" the Doctor as much as he stole her, and that the Doctor's love for her verges on the non-platonic too. And that the various potential origins for the Doctor/Master Love/Hate relationship, in addition to childhood best friends or brothers, now also includes first love/dangerously disturbed ex whom he still loves.

And during those 43 years from *An Unearthly Child* until *Rose,* it's not like fans and writers weren't frequently changing their minds on various matters all the time. Whether Time Lords even *had* sex was debatable. First the Doctor was a grandfather and writers/viewers assumed he became one in the typical fashion. Then the Doctor got younger and collected attractive young friends, and the no-sex-on-the-TARDIS rule established his apparent celibacy. Then the Doctor's celibacy got retconned into universal Time Lord celibacy/asexuality and reproduction via Genetic Looms.

I wonder if the problem is not only Moffat as a head writer but a lack of leadership. It's like they're genuinely trying to take the show in new directions but then say, ""Oh crap, how do we get out of this?"". They literally write themselves into a corner. Like I loved the new episode but then at the end he hits the reset button? Again? Really??? In all of Doctor Who there was the understanding that time was fixed and to mess with it would be serious so unless this is part of a Doctor arc in which he's getting power hungry, then I don't know what is going on. 

I feel like Moffat is one who has these really brilliant ideas but needs to be contained, like he can only operate effectively in confined spaces like 1 or two episodes. RTD was a little bit better at that but I think he also had better writers or at least ones that knew what to do.

Ultimately though, having watched the show for 30 years, that's just the nature. I also wonder if there are influences at the BBC and such that are influencing the writing. ",0,1367256227,null,0,false,0,c9p0cq7,t3_1dc89a,t1_c9p0cq7,t3_1dc89a,null,1431383898,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Technically, yes. Our system cannot survive without both a top end and a bottom end. It is merely a matter of distance between the two that we can change. But even then within limits.

&gt;I don't really see why there would be inflation anyway -- I'm not thinking of any money being created

Money creation is not the only method of inflation. But, even if it were, you are still increasing the amount of money going towards products and services in your scenario. As the lower tax ranks generally see more of their income go towards taxes as a percentage at the moment. The higher ranks would usually use that spare income for savings or investments. The lower ranks will in your world, use that cash to buy products and services which before would not have been purchased. A great boost to the economy, sure. However also very inflationary.

I am not saying you are wrong. Your system is actually less expensive and easier to run than our current one. However, essentially they are precisely the same. With the benefits and minimum wage system at present simply being a targeted and albeit, poor form of tax redistribution.

&gt; my argument is why mess around -- just redistribute and be done.

The messy nature of the system serves two purposes. The first is it's a great vote producer if you target groups you want votes from. Second it allows the Government to target individuals that are in more need than others (the disabled, the elderly, the sex like rabbits people, etc).

I think one experienced/proven player in each positional zone, if you will, would be very nice. A centre-back, a midfielder, a forward player.

After that, I really think it's just a matter of coaching and leadership. Much of the squad will under Rodgers' system for the second year and they should be much more comfortable from the get-go.

I think the clear expectation this season (w/ or w/o Suarez, but that's another discussion) is to reach 4th place. My hope is that we need 3 or 4 players this summer, start the season really strong, and then perhaps get that one big, impact, super-star-esque player in January (someone who sees the potential and future of LFC and realizes LFC can get into the Champions League that season) who can put us over the edge and get us locked into 4th place.

true,Hawkeye8880,judoon,Judoon,"Here is the problem. And this is the problem with most theories about who Clara is...

How does this solve her mystery. People seem to forget that Clara was killed, with no question, twice in two different places millions of miles from each other at different points in the universe. The Doctor then found her in modern day London. 

The thing is, you can't make something up to solve the mystery. Saying something like, oh CAL can project herself across space and time isn't a solution. Because it is not established she has that ability. Giving her that ability means you might as well give the ability to someone brand new, so there is no reason to connect it to CAL. 

This applies to Rose, Jack, Romana, or anyone who fans theorize Clara is. You need to make a connection to the actual mystery, not that she simply is a mystery. 

The only theories that actually support this are the theories that Clara is a humanoid Tardis, or a projection of the Tardis, or something. Or that she is splintered from some sort of explosion like Scaroth in City of Death. 

You can draw name and quote parallels all day long, but you must make a connection, and I hope Moffat knows this and he doesn't make up some connection just to bring back an old character. He needs to explain the mystery in a proper manner.

Some of these products are, however, not sold with such an intention. They may only be hot/warm as they are in the process of cooling down. Examples include pies, pasties, sausage rolls and similar savoury products, **cooked chickens** or joints of meat, bread products and croissants. The liability will depend, therefore, on how you prepare and sell them. If they are sold specifically for consumption whilst still hot (as a result of being freshly prepared, baked, cooked, reheated or kept warm), they will be standard-rated. See also paragraph 4.5 **If they are sold warm simply because they happen to be freshly baked, are in the process of cooling down and are not intended to be eaten while hot; or cold or chilled at the time of purchase, they can be zero-rated**

As we continue to build a squad, the extra games will also benefit those not in the starting 11. Players such as Borini, Skrtel, Wisdom, Assaidi, Sterling, etc.

Honestly, these days, I don't even go to the bank for checks (errr...cheques...gotta remember where I am). Most banks in the states have smartphone apps that allow you to take photos of the front and back of your cheque and have it electronically deposited. We're more of a cheque-heavy economy, though.

true,PlayingForTheShirt,,Bangor,"Indeed it was. And those weapons were, in nearly all probabilities, decommissioned. Does that mean that was every single weapon that they used? Well there is still enough illegal arms that can be dated to the periods of the paramilitaries of old - ARs, AKs etc. etc.  - either these were brought in newly under far stricter border checks than we used to have or they were maintained by factions of these groups who didn't want to decommission. Call me a sceptic but I'll go with the latter.

It's a lot to do with the supply of funding actually. The decommissioning was the end of the provos militant campaign. They had laid their weapons down and entered a political process - great! Doesn't stop dissidents continuing in the militant campaign and doesn't stop donors from America (not just Boston, did I say it was just Boston?) and elsewhere from sending money to this campaign.

It didn't 'die out' after Omagh either. There was less support, yes, but it didn't just die out. If it died out then the IRA could not have been as militarised as they were post-Omagh, even if it wasn't comparable to the 70s and 80s it was still a strong force that was getting plenty of outside funding.
