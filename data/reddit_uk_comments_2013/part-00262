Like you, I thought, ""There is no way I will like these other two guys."" I was sad when 9 regenerated.

Within two episodes I was in love with Tennant. Literally in love.

Same with Smith. I loved Tennant so much I told myself I wouldn't even bother anymore, there was no way 11 could compare to 10. I was wrong. I ended up loving him too, a lot. Not more than 10, but I think my love for 11 was more in a friendly ""let's time/space trip together forever"" way rather than ""please marry me now"" way like it was with 10.

Their personalities,  styles, companions,  one liners, TARDISes, and many other things change, but it doesn't matter because they are all the Doctor and they are all fantastic/brilliant, they are all timey wimey, and they are all cool.

If in one show he pulls a switch that he calls a time dialator, and in another he pulls an entirely different switch with the same name, he postulated that the fans would know and care, so while the events are in flux, that's something we expect because its a show about time travel, so history as we know it is bound to change from one show to the next, but if you all the sudden start calling Tom baker the 3rd doctor and don't have a reasonable reason to back it up, the fans are going to call BS on it because while there is no official bible, its common knowledge that Tom Baker was in fact the 4th doctor.

I don't honestly think many people dislike squatters at all.

But there is a difference between someone who genuinely needs to squat and the people trying to be cool or anarchic and those who do it beacause they need to.

Those people that clearly can do something else and take advantage are bad. Just take a look at this http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2013/12/01/the-ex-worker-14-squat-the-world/.

That is an example of an anarchist group urging people to squat for idealistic reasons instead of need.

That's naïve and stupid, to put yourself in a squat if you don't need to be. Those people should not squat.

A person who is GENUINELY HOMELESS with NO OTHER OPTIONS should squat houses, I have no problem with genuine homeless people squatting. But as a person on benefits who had to move with his mother to live with his grandparents and is currently unemployed I do take issue.

Tamara (22) is a rich property developers daughter she moves into a squat as she has 'real issues with money right now' and doesn't want to ask her rich dad for help after her gallery is flopping.

Tamara does NOT need to squat

John (19) ran away from his abusive father to live in London on the street he has a heroin problem that he is kicking and needs help that is thin on the ground from the government. He tries to sleep by shop doorways but he is always cold. He has an emergency blanket from a pound shop just in case he needs it to stay alive. John needs a place to sleep that is sheltered. John needs to squat.

Know the difference. I don't have a problem with john.

The timelines not syncing up (which first of all is obviously just an out to explain why all the doctors can be in on this plan and no one remember any of it) in my interpretation would mean that since the Doctors are changing their own personal future (something specifically stated that time travelers are not supposed to do) the new changes are not rippling back to each one of the doc's current lives until they complete the act. 

It's a bit hard to explain because it's all wibbly wobbly timey wimey but I'm going to take a shot at an analogy. It's kinda like mailing a letter to a friend and then deciding to alter the letter and mail it again. The original letter is the doctor's original story traveling from it's start to finish (Gallifrey to Trenzalore) and it will happen in that time line but the new altered version of the letter (doctor's life) is sent along still progressing from the same beginning to end but the events are slightly different.

&gt; Female civil servants and other public servants (primary teachers from 1958 were excluded from the so-called ""marriage bar"") had to resign from their jobs when they got married, on the grounds that they were occupying a job that should go to a man. Banks operated a similar policy... The marriage bar in the public service was removed in July 1973, on foot of the report of the first Commission on the Status of Women. In 1977, the Employment Equality Act prohibited discrimination on the grounds of gender or marital status in almost all areas of employment.

These laws called ""marriage bars"" only discriminated against middle class women with educations -- they never affected lower wage/lower skill jobs. As a result, economist George Borjas has argued that they discouraged women from acquiring education.

When he does do this, though... ay, chihuahua, what a fucking player he's going to be.

About Daws - I share everyone's frustrations for the most part: his lack of pace has been a major liability, and his attempts to play it out the back have been woeful at times (led to the first goal today, for instance). But I honestly think that he's just in a bad run of form (like most of the squad lately), and that he just needs to recapture it. Let's not forget that there's a reason why he won his place back last season: he's a fucking good player.

Compare that with Dawson's block almost ricocheting into the goal in the 87' or so last night). It seems like every single time we get scored on I see Dawson did something or DIDNT do something to result in the opportunity.

I remember a few times against everton dawson made idiotic runs up the field and when he lost the ball he would have to make a reckless foul to keep the opponent from counterattacking. It is nuts. Today he tried the same thing and it caused the goal. And dont even get my started on his idiotic long balls that never reach our players. And then people go on about intangibles...his leadership skills. What evidence do you have of him being an excellent leader? His ability to help our team bounce back from 1-0 first half deficits (not against Arsenal or Newcastle) or maybe his ability to have us keep our heads up during seemingly hopeless results (we didnt even get consolation goals vs west ham or mancity, neither of which had impenetrable defenses). Or maybe he has the great leadership skill to keep us focused an entire 90 mins, and not lose our edge after halftime (we didnt see that during Chelsea or Everton, for starters).

A pocket knife is legal, but only if it doesn't have a spring blade, doesn't lock and has a small blade, at which point you're more likely to slice your fingers then to hurt the other person.

Honestly, the best legal ""weapon"" that doesn't need justifying is probably a skateboard.

British prisons are [not a walk in the park](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/gang-violence-out-of-control-in-feltham-prison-8698500.html) (whatever our popular newspapers would like you to believe) but HM Prison Service would tell you that the big difference between UK and US prisons is that, by and large, in UK prisons the prison officers are in control of the inmates almost all the time. Not that I'm suggesting that Us prisons are all riot all the time, but I get the impression that in US prisons the inmates are left to their own devices much more of the time that British prisoners are.

HM Prison Service is much smaller, not just in absolute but in relative terms: the US has about 5 times as many prisoners per head of the population as do England and Wales—something which the rest of the work (except Russia and China, probably) views with absolute horror. As a result, prisons are mysterious places for British people in a way that they perhaps aren't for Americans.

[This guidance for charging](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/offensive_weapons_knives_bladed_and_pointed_articles/) Is also quite informative.

**TL;DR Summary:**
Offensive weapons can be made, adapted or intended.

* Made offensive weapons are weapons defined as especially dangerous. No excuses, you cannot carry them. It's things like hollow spike kubotans, knuckle dusters, lock knives, batons. Things that have no conceivable use other than as a weapon (I know, lcok knives are debatable)

* Adapted offensive weapons would be an every day item that has been modified in some way to be a weapon. For example a spoon with the handle sharpened to a point. Again, no excuses - clearly, the item is being carried with intent that it be used as a weapon (or you'd just have a normal spoon).

* Finally, intended covers literally *everything* else. ANY object that you pick up with intent to use as a weapon - a brick, a skeatboard, a screwdriver. The moment you form the opinion ""I can use this as a weapon"" you turn the object into an offensive weapon for the purposes of the Act.

Seriously, it's a minefield.

1) It improves situational awareness, which avoids conflicts like this in the first place.

2) It improves your confidence and knowledge in your own ability, so you look like less of an easy victim.

3) It is a viable self defence. Ok, so against 7 it may not do much, but against a guy dragging you into an alleyway? You best believe there are a few techniques that can resolve that situation, quickly, and allow you to escape.

Bare with me for a moment if you would, its story time :) Some spoilers may lie ahead, read at your risk.

I initially started wanting to have 3 characters in very specific positions, 4,9, and war.  I also knew I wanted to keep every figure in the exact same position as they original figures are.

I really always wanted the war doctor in the middle. I painted this before the special aired but knew that from the episode “The Name Of The Doctor” what he did in the time war caused him to stop calling himself the Doctor. I took this a step further, rather than being just an atrocity so horrible he could no longer be the Doctor, he in fact sacrificed his name for the Universe and his other selves. He took an entire regeneration killed it and buried it in his head to save the universe and effectively allowed the others to go on being the Doctor. 

The title of the episode wasn’t about what the Doctors name was, or who was going to say it. That episode was about the revelation to the audience that his participation in the Time War was not in “The Name of the Doctor”.

Some might argue that committing 2 acts of genocide is hardly a sacrifice, but to a man who values life above all there is no greater, especially when he has to do it for the greater good. Now with the events of the Day of the Doctor, we know that he in fact saved Galifrey. That to me makes the sacrifice of his name, the disavowment of an entire regeneration  and some 400 or more years of regret and guilt all the more powerful.
Hartnell  was placed where he was because I knew that people would say that he should be in the center, luckily  in the original there is a figure to the immediate right of center that is leaning in and pointing at the center figure. It was too easy to turn that into him pointing with his index finger as if to say, “I was number One. That should be my seat”
9 was placed were where most people think Judas is.(That position in reality goes to where 5 sits) But since most people take that position to belong to Judas as he is holding a knife I ran with it. Not to start a flame war but not returning for the 50th was just silly. And in fact he will now be remembered more for not doing it than if he had. It will always be a footnote on his career and a sour note for many fans. It’s his personal right, but as tenant put it a bit churlish.

Speaking on 10, I put him there as in the original image that figure is in the most visually dynamic pose. I thought that would speak well of 10’s personality and let me show off the suit.
Capaldi is where he is because with his addition I know had the 13 Doctors to do a proper last supper tribute. But no one knows what his outfit will look like. Luckily I was able to kill 2 birds with one stone by using  both of 11’s outfits.  Capaldi is in the Christmas outfit having just regenerated and is in the middle of taking it off. I imagine 11 is off to the side saying to the others,” Do you see this?! He is taking off the bow tie.”  

Beyond that everyone else was placed for mostly aesthetic reasons. And I always knew that I wanted 4 on the end because in the original image there is a very faint but visible pattern on the table cloth that comes down on each side. Its only on the two sides though, my immediate thought was to place 4 on the end so that his scarf could be easily seen, and wrap all the way down the table around each doctor, and fall off the table in the same two spots replicating the table cloth pattern. 

This gave me a way to achieve the draped look of some of the positions of the original while letting me emphasize that they are in fact all the same man. 

I have been asked so many questions about this I actually added a page to my website with even more details that I am slowly adding to. So if you want even more information please check out my website at [http://www.artmonkeyworld.com/the-infinite-supper.html](http://www.artmonkeyworld.com/the-infinite-supper.html)

That's what parents and teachers would probably have told you to stop you from playing with fire.

It's actually impossible for an undamaged can to explode in this way. In order for the butane to burn, it requires an oxidizer (air). For the precise reason of not wanting them to explode, cans pressurized with flammable gasses contain no oxidizer, and the pressure valves prevent any air from getting back into the can.

Deodorant cans chucked on a fire don't explode because they're flammable - they explode because the gas expands and bursts the can. The gas only sets on fire *after* they explode.

The wiring inside is ancient and quite dodgy, there are cracks everywhere, the whole thing needs a huge overhaul.

It's not just the cost of the materials and workers though. You've got to hire specialists to help preserve the artwork, sculptures (yep), the ancient carpets, tapestries, woodwork, stonework etc. You then have to factor in the cost of moving the staff to new offices in the meantime, the cost of physically moving everything around the myriad of visitors and tourists, including the extensive non digital archives - oh, and Government can't exactly shut down whilst they do it.

2. I did like that it was open ended because I like the *idea* of the gang choosing to become proper heroes but not actually showing it. At least for the show, it doesn't really need to be seen. If they did go forward with the movie, which is a possibility now with the way things ended, then I would be happy to see them team up with the old gang to stop a big crisis.

3. The time travel really didn't bother me, it actually felt like the older episodes that used it. The show has never had a strong grasp on its own time travel logic and it got the point where I realized it didn't really matter. The time travel really is just a plot device to propel the characters forward towards new revelations about their lives.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Ok. I'd prefer not to get shot, or have a wide availability of firearms.

My point is very much valid. If you allow the general population to be armed, then you must accept that those with criminal intent will also gain access to firearms. Hell, NORMAL people who have firearms lawfully help may flip out and then they're criminal with a weapon (See Derek Bird).

When you read those US gun forums... don' you get the impression that everyone is *Scared*. They're all in fear of their lives at the hands of armed criminals. They don't arm themselves out of choice, they do it out of fear. It's a ridiculous situation.

We get it right in the UK. I will stand by that, and the fact that even our police aren't armed. Other nations don't understand how it can work - but it does.

I will add that I can pretty much guarantee I've got more experience of handling firearms than you have: I've shot for over 20 years, I shot competitively for my university, and I've been hunting and target shooting with .22 and full bore rifles since I was 13. My opinion is not one out of fear of firearms themselves, but out of what their widespread availability does to a society.

You do NOT live in perfect world (society) and should be prepared that certain behaviours don't always have to be treated like ""dick approach"" but can be easily explained. The law isn't ideal and just because it currently is in the current form doesn't mean it should be obeyed in 100% just because some politicians thought of some regulations as proper ones for the moment. 

If you, by obeying law in 100% want to risk your whole life than it's completely up to you but I bet 99% of people on the world when faced with such choice would prefer even braking the law in more serious situations, rather than occasional cycle use of the walkway.

And yes, I'm afraid of my life when cycling. I read news. I personally experienced some dangerous situations when cycling. I also drive and see how plenty of car drivers behave (or don't behave like they should). I enjoy cycling and won't give it up just because government didn't bother building more cycle routes. I always do all that I can to avoid cycling on walkways, this includes trying like hell to find all local cycle routes (including looking at maps etc), as well as cycling on less busy roads. If I take a certain route once and I find it not really safe (good enough) I try to avoid it. However, just because once in a while I find myself with a choice to ""walk"" my cycle for few miles on the walkway where there is even nobody there (and outside of city) or go along on the A route with plenty of cars driving high speeds I will choice safe route, even if potentially I'm ""braking the law"". This doesn't make me dick, it's you who are a dick who says so. I bet even if you ask a policeman what I should do in such situation they would say I need to choose ""route which is safer and doesn't put other road user to big risks"" (saying, if you go slow we won't mind).

no i said cycling along the pavement was an idiotic dick move, it's not a personal insult if you happen to do that regularly, and they are, again saying 90% is not a personal attack on anyone specific

&gt;you do NOT live in perfect world (society) and should be prepared that certain behaviours don't always have to be treated like ""dick approach"" but can be easily explained

So easily explain why you can't walk the dangerous sections of road on the pavement, otherwise it really does have to be treated as a dick move.

&gt;And yes, I'm afraid of my life when cycling. I read news. I personally experienced some dangerous situations when cycling. I also drive and see how plenty of car drivers behave (or don't behave like they should). I enjoy cycling and won't give it up just because government didn't bother building more cycle routes.

well im glad you dont let the potnetial dangers put you off, but don't ride on the pavement, you dont have ot give it up just dont do it on a pavement it's that simple

&gt;I always do all that I can to avoid cycling on walkways

no you don't otherwise you wouldnt do it

&gt;just because once in a while I find myself with a choice to ""walk"" my cycle for few miles on the walkway where there is even nobody there (and outside of city) or go along on the A route with plenty of cars driving high speeds I will choice safe route, even if potentially I'm ""braking the law"".

yes breaking the law exactly. putting pedestrians at risk. dick move. walk it.

&gt;This doesn't make me dick, it's you who are a dick who says so.

yes I am at times, as most people are, but so are you. Like when you cycle on the pavement which is a dick move.

&gt;I bet even if you ask a policeman what I should do in such situation they would say I need to choose ""route which is safer and doesn't put other road user to big risks"" (saying, if you go slow we won't mind).

yes the safer route of walking on the pavement and not putting road users at risk by riding the pavement.

&gt;This is UK, it's the UK's approach that some laws aren't obeyed 100% or aren't specified with a typical yes/no approach. For example use of ""should"" in highway code.

""should"" isn't the word they use about cycling on the pavement, goes something more like ""do not""

&gt;Think about it dude or else you will die of heart attack in your life by getting angry too often, just because a ""dick"" used a pathway or littered on the street.

who's angry, I'm just pointing out that you make a dick move when you cycle on the pavement and you should never do it. I reply constantly because I find your floundering attempts to justify your discretions and dick moves are amusing to me.

Don't agonise over the MANY forms you  have to fill out. No one is going to read it in any great detail. This isn't criminal court. Keep it as short and simple as possible 

Leave out anything that isn't directly related. For example, my signature was forged (poorly) several times. When I showed this to the judge he told me he didn't care (his exact words)

Flat out ignore any court behaviour guidelines you see. They're there to make life easy for the people who work there and have no effect on the case. I was yelled at. Interrupted constantly. Completely thrown off in every way possible. And all the judge did was shh the guy. When it wasn't my turn I kept silent and professional, which made things ridiculously easy for the prick

Normally I would say I had one bad judge but it wasn't just him. Every single person I dealt with was a hack. Receptionists would lose files and case records. Forms were completely unclear. There was NO facility to provide evidence that couldn't be put on paper. The fact is nobody takes small claims seriously no matter how much your life has been ruined by them. 

My final advice, as much as I hate to say it is to not do it at all. I went to small claims court because I wanted to prove to a real scumbag that you can't go through life stealing and treating people like filth because the proper authorities will punish you for it In the end I learned the lesson that in fact the opposite was true. Getting conned was bad but it wasn't nearly as horrible as spending 8 months trying to get someone.....anyone... To look at my evidence and do something about it.

At that point, having read several pages, I'm afraid I lost patience with the chit-chat of the transcript, so what remains unclear to me is why she was still delusional after several weeks in hospital.

It is my understanding that the mother is perfectly fine when on her regular medication - that she came to the UK for work and left her meds at home.

So I don't understand how she was still sectioned weeks and weeks later - she should have been given her regular medications, if necessary posting them from Italy (if they're not licensed in the UK), and surely she'd be fine within a fortnight?

That seems kinda as much concern as anything - that any of us could be held as a prisoner for weeks and weeks because a doctor would ignore the prescription given to ~~use~~ *us* by our doctor back home in Italy.

I may be well off the mark here, I'm only going off what I've read, and obviously on what I assume being of average intelligence and not a doctor, but it seems like it was incompetent of the medical staff in the hospital to which she was sectioned not to just give her her medication. In which case it is medical incompetence which led to her being drugged, strapped to a gurney and having her baby cut from her womb.

And I don't understand how it's even a fucking question about her being able to be with her newborn baby or her child being adopted away from her. It may well be that the mother is very prone to irregularity, but what I've read is that she's fine on her meds, so we should be packing her and her child off to Italy, where she can be assisted by her parents and dealt with by the Italian authorities.

The government’s plan to establish a new generation of secret courts has sparked fresh controversy after it emerged that the fact that a hearing is to be held behind closed doors may itself be kept secret.
During House of Lords debates, it was disclosed that a government application for a court to sit in secret – with the public, the media and even the claimant and their lawyers being excluded – could itself remain completely secret under the proposals.

The admission drew immediate comparisons with so-called superinjunctions, which not only prevent the media from publishing information said to be confidential or private, but also ban publication of the fact that the injunction exists.

&gt;Essex County Council said in a statement on Monday that it was a health trust (presumably an NHS trust) which sought permission from the court to perform a caesarian section because of concerns about risks to mother and child. Essex said the mother was able to see her baby on the day of birth and the following day. Essex say social workers obtained an interim care order from the County Court because the mother was too unwell to care for her child. They say the mother has two other children which she is unable to care for due to orders made by the Italian authorities. They say social workers liaised with the extended family before and after the birth of the baby to establish if anyone could care for the child. They say the Italian courts have ruled that child should remain in England, and that in October 2013 they got permission from the County Court to place the child for adoption.

&gt;Essex’s version clearly contradicted Christopher Booker, who said it was social workers who’d been given permission to arrange for the child to be delivered and that the mother was not allowed to see her baby daughter. Of course Essex’s is only one side of the story, and may well not give the full picture. But given the track record of Christopher Booker and John Hemming, it was right to accept it until it was demonstrated to be wrong. To be fair, at that stage lamentably few people knew their track record.""

This would have been complicated by her pregnancy, **many** of the drugs used to treat bipolar disorder are harmful to babies when taken during pregnancy. It is likely the healthcare professionals looking after her had to make some tough decisions about treating her bipolar disorder and keeping toxicity low enough not to harm the baby.

With regard to her being ""her being drugged, strapped to a gurney and having her baby cut from her womb"" that is very sensationalist language. A C-section was in her best interest due to the chance of her suffering a rupture of her womb due to her previous two C-sections.

The reason they don't want to this someone has addressed elsewhere

~~However the Fixed Term Parliaments Act introduced by the coalition means it will take an act of parliament to dissolve parliament before the end of five years, not merely a failure in a confidence vote, or the resignation of the PM.~~This is wrong, a confidence vote will suffice.

Between them Labour and the Lib Dems do not have the votes to do this. Moreover it is challenging for parties outside the government to enact legislation.

So they are pretty much stuck.

I would however add that the current leadership of the liberal democrats is actually quite right wing. Clegg, Huhne, Laws, Davey, Alexander, etc: none of these are economically left wing in the slightest, and have been strong advocates for a shrinking of the state since taking control of the party a few years ago. Its not as bad a match as many people think.

However, yes, they ARE that desperate to be in power. It is the reson detre of any political party.

&gt; Climate change is likely to cause warmer, but much wetter winters, and therefore *less* snow. And obviously hotter and dryer summers.

Even in non-tropical places, [some IPCC models have predicted more extreme wind events](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter10.pdf), although probably less frequent.

With respect to people becoming more willing to shut everything down for less reason, I can't comment without actual data, and I was unable to find any sort of statistics about how much disruption has been caused year on year and how that changed with the frequency of extreme weather events.

Dawson gets the ball and tries to dribble it up the field. Alright. Walker and Vert see Dawson approaching mid field and only picking up speed, so they streak down their flanks.

It looks like a 50/50 ball, and in desperation to foul the player to stop play, dawson dives forward. He gets a foot on the ball, but it is too late. The ball goes flying off to the side, right to the feet of a fulham attacker. Suddenly 2 Fulham players are streaking down the middle of the pitch, Dawson is on the ground, and Chiriches has his hands full. Berbatov gets the ball 40 yards from our goal, but chiriches can't commit to closing him down because it leaves that Iranian bald shit open on our left. Vert is too far up forward to help. Dawson gets on his feet just as Berbatov fires a through ball to his support, and chiriches begins to close down the attacker. Unfortunately, Berbatov is making a run down the goal so Chiriches needs to choose whether to mark berbatov or charge the iranian (sorry his name escapes me.... dagejah or something) and attempt an acrobatic tackle. Chiriches chooses to mark berbatov, who has been threatening in front of the goal all day. Unfortunately this gives the other fulham a challenging, yet clinical goalscoring opportunity at a 45 degree angle of the goal. Dawson is nowhere to be seen.

&gt;S called for the help of passing motorists who were forced to slow down and drive past them in the road but no one wanted to get involved.

&gt;As she unlocked her car door a man pushed her to the floor and stole her vehicle. ....

&gt;Had C seen the man moving across the car park at the same time as entered the area, she might have had the time to deploy a StoppaRed, either distracting him long enough to run back into the building she had just left or at least stained the thief so the police would have known with certainty whether the man they arrested was the thief or not. 

##Did nothing, gave up and punched the guy

&gt;The aggressive customer then lunged for M, who felt he was going to assaulted for a second time so fired his Mk3 directly into the face of the aggressive man. This stopped him while he attempted to clear his vision. After a short space of time the aggressive man tried once more to re-enter the club. M and his colleague fired their Mk3s again stopping him whilst he tried to clear his vision. 

&gt;The aggressive man tried once more to re-enter the club and M was forced to strike the man on the side of his head with his open hand, knocking him to the ground. 

## Did nothing and the other guy kept hitting him

&gt;The aggressive man then produced a bottle and made threats against our customer who discharged his Mk3 canister and was expecting a fine spray instead of the ballistic stream. His aim was low and the spray hit his attacker’s chest. In the heat of the moment our customer did not think to change his aim and ran. His attacker paused as he was hit by the spray but quickly resumed his assault. Our customer ran and the man followed him. Eventually the attacker gave up the chase and ran into the nearby park.

Your grandma is a frail lady in her 80's. Mine is a frail lady in her 90's. How competent do you think she would be with a knife, baseball bat, or gun exactly? Have you ever fired a handgun? If someone is seriously frail, they won't even be able to level it at someone, much less so fire it. I doubt if your grandma is that vulnerable, she could swing a bat or fend of an assailant with a knife. All that would happen is her weapon would be taken from her and used against her. The fewer weapons in a violent confrontation, the better. Regardless of who is holding them at the outset. End of.

The important thing is she doesn't have to arm herself, and you don't have to arm yourself, because of the society we've created in the UK.

Why do you think it's reported Nationally when an old lady is mugged in the street? Because it almost never happens, that's why.

There's no such thing as ""offensive or defensive"" weapon. There's no way you can widely arm the general law abiding population, and not have that lead to a widely armed criminal population. All you create is a downwards spiral, with an arms race. And guess who LOVE weapons, and routinely arm themselves if they're able to? Violent criminals.

I was proud to serve in a country with overall a very sensible attitude to weapons. YEs, little hood rats carried knives and strived to get access to firearms.

The law allows you to act in defence of yourself, others and property. It allows you to use as much force as is reasonable in the circumstances. Sadly, that's a snap decision for you and a lengthy debate at court. However, in extreme cases where your life is genuinely threatened, it has been held that a pre-emptive strike and lethal force are both acceptable.

PRobably one of the most famous cases is that of [Kenneth Noye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Noye). He's a horribly violent gangster. In 1984 Noye was under surveillance following his involvement in the Brinks Mat gold robbery. A covert police officer was attempting to place a bug in his home, crawling through Noyes back garden to do so. Noye was alerted to this, and went outside with a knife and stabbed the police officer to death. He was aquitted of murder on grounds of self defence. His defence boiled down to : ""I'm a nasty bastard and a criminal figure. Lots of people want me dead. When I see a masked man crawling through my garden, I assume he's there to kill me, so I kill him first"".

He tried this a second time in 1996 when he attempted to use self defence to get out of a ""Road rage"" killing. He had in fact planned the killing using road rage and self defence as a cover, and he is currently serving a life sentence.

If you act with an honestly held belief, and use only such force as is reasonable and necessary, you really have nothing to fear.  Example: A punch knocks your attacker down and he cracks his skull on the floor, You run away. Fine, just unlucky. Vs You punch your attacker and he falls unconscious to the floor, whereupon you kick him in the head? Not fine.

But because they are private, it's impossible for anyone to prove, one way or the other, whether they work or not.

For example, there are no statistics about whether children who have been the subject of a contact order (an order which says the parent they live with must make them available to spend time with the other parent) then go on to have healthy relationships with that other parent, or whether the case ends up back in court over and over again because the order that was made was unworkable.

There is no reason why anonymised versions of court records and court orders couldn't be released. Then we could see whether the judgements and orders that are being made are workable, and give advice to judges to improve the effectiveness of the courts if it turns out to be necessary.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Fuck, you are obsessed with dicks and just can't understand simple explanation. 

THERE AREN'T ENOUGH cycle routes and safe parts of roads in UK to cycle safely and at the same time fully legally. How hard is it to understand it? What's the point of going cycling if I have to (like an old grandpa) get off the bicycle every couple of meters and walk for hundreds of meters?

Being a dick is posing actual risk and I have already said it. Cycling on a pavement is basically no risk to pedestrians if it's not a high street or highly populated area. You should throw your ""dicks"" at uninsured, drunk or idiot drivers. Tell me, was there at least ONE FATALITY when a cyclist killed a pedestrian? How many cyclists and pedestrians died when hit by a car? Would I go to jail for cycling on a pavement but a drunk driver who killed somebody only got financial penalty? You can't judge such extreme cases by the same ""dick"" word (unless you're obsessed with it).

And again, according to you at least 90% of British citizens are dicks as if you say cycling on pavement is a dick move, it also is for crossing the road not on a road crossing for pedestrians, not using indicators when required, not turning lights on in a car when it's dark and etc. All people are dicks!!! Jesus, mate, you are mental!

When I cycle on the pavement, where there is NOBODY walking there, nobody can walk into pavement as on the side is fenced forest and I do it because it's a busy road then it makes me a dick? Quite possibly the pavement isn't yet officially for cycling as an official didn't notice it yet or there is missing few inches to have it legally separated. That's just common sense, not a dick move. I don't pose any threat to anybody in such situation, at the same time I look after myself (not being killed thing - so when I die people won't call me an idiot for obeying stupid law and losing life because of that) and also make it more pleasant and safer for drivers who would have to pass me if I was cycling on that road.

You need to understand that government cannot say officially something like ""You should not be using pavement"" as this makes it not legal enough to prosecute because of the word used. They also can't say ""You must not use some pavements but can use some other"" as they would have to specify every single pavement whether it is of the particular type or not. Law cannot be fitted here, that is why it's usually police's job to distinguish the behaviour. They normally won't give a ticket for cycling on such pavement and I bet most of them won't find anything wrong with it and personally even suggest it. They would however give the ticket if it was in busy pedestrian area.

It's like with littering. You would call someone a ""dick"" just because ""he littered"". Now, does the world divide only to black and white? NO! Littering is throwing chewing gum on the pavement on high street (when such pavement looks then disgusting, especially when plenty of people do it). That is a ""DICK MOVE"". But, littering is also throwing a half eaten apple into some bush or forest. Would I be also be a dick when I throw such organic material, which will gladly be eaten by some insects and will in fact act positively for the nature?

Your problem is that you can't distinguish between certain behaviours which although technically fall under the same group, can't be judged by a black and white approach of your ""dick move"".

this is fun, I keep pointing out the flaws in your explanation and you keep ignoring them.

&gt;THERE AREN'T ENOUGH cycle routes and safe parts of roads in UK to cycle safely and at the same time fully legally. How hard is it to understand it? What's the point of going cycling if I have to (like an old grandpa) get off the bicycle every couple of meters and walk for hundreds of meters?

I understand that theres no safe places to cycle, but that doesnt give you the right to go on pedestrian only pavements. youre exaggerating most of the roads are perfectly safe for cyclists you only need to walk the dangerous ones.

&gt;Being a dick is posing actual risk and I have already said it. 

yes posing a risk to pedestrians when you ride the pavement is being a dick

&gt;Cycling on a pavement is basically no risk to pedestrians if it's not a high street or highly populated area.

tell that to the 1-2 people cyclists kill every year


&gt; You should throw your ""dicks"" at uninsured, drunk or idiot drivers. Tell me, was there at least ONE FATALITY when a cyclist killed a pedestrian? 

1-2 every year

&gt;How many cyclists and pedestrians died when hit by a car? Would I go to jail for cycling on a pavement but a drunk driver who killed somebody only got financial penalty? You can't judge such extreme cases by the same ""dick"" word (unless you're obsessed with it).

yes some drivers are worse than dicks true, but so that has no bearing on the dick moves you make. cyclists who have killed pedestrians by going on the pavement recieve a fine, drivers who kill someone go to jail.

&gt;And again, according to you at least 90% of British citizens are dicks as if you say cycling on pavement is a dick move, it also is for crossing the road not on a road crossing for pedestrians, not using indicators when required, not turning lights on in a car when it's dark and etc. All people are dicks!!! Jesus, mate, you are mental!

I'm mental because you make dick moves? ok sure mate. By the way those are all complete dick moves that most people make at some point.

&gt;When I cycle on the pavement, where there is NOBODY walking there, nobody can walk into pavement as on the side is fenced forest and I do it because it's a busy road then it makes me a dick?

I just dont beleive you can know there is no risk there, and if its only on one stretch of road whats the big problem with walking that part?

&gt;Quite possibly the pavement isn't yet officially for cycling as an official didn't notice it yet or there is missing few inches to have it legally separated. That's just common sense, not a dick move.

that or it's not officially for cycling because it's not at all for cycling but in fact for pedestrians, either way it's not your call to make.

&gt;I don't pose any threat to anybody in such situation, at the same time I look after myself (not being killed thing - so when I die people won't call me an idiot for obeying stupid law and losing life because of that) and also make it more pleasant and safer for drivers who would have to pass me if I was cycling on that road.

last I checked ""walking"" has never been recorded as a cause of death

&gt;You need to understand that government cannot say officially something like ""You should not be using pavement"" as this makes it not legal enough to prosecute because of the word used. They also can't say ""You must not use some pavements but can use some other"" as they would have to specify every single pavement whether it is of the particular type or not.

the point isnt about whether a bike fits on a pavement, it's about reserving it as a safe place for pedestrians to walk, I couldnt take my car down a bus lane because I thought it shouldnt be a bus lane, that would be an equally dick move.

&gt;Law cannot be fitted here, that is why it's usually police's job to distinguish the behaviour. They normally won't give a ticket for cycling on such pavement and I bet most of them won't find anything wrong with it and personally even suggest it. They would however give the ticket if it was in busy pedestrian area.

no the job of the police is to uphold the law, not just the laws they agree with. if they dont find something wrong with you breaking the law they arent doing their job very well.

&gt;It's like with littering. You would call someone a ""dick"" just because ""he littered"". Now, does the world divide only to black and white? NO! Littering is throwing chewing gum on the pavement on high street (when such pavement looks then disgusting, especially when plenty of people do it). That is a ""DICK MOVE"". But, littering is also throwing a half eaten apple into some bush or forest. Would I be also be a dick when I throw such organic material, which will gladly be eaten by some insects and will in fact act positively for the nature?

yes actually that is black and white since dropping fruit anywhere attracts the vermin animals before any others, not to mention adding nutrients and bacteria that don't belong in thae forest ecosystem since the fruit is probly from somewhere else, and that's before considering that you are wasting food when some people struggle to get enough, littering is always a dick move.

&gt;Your problem is that you can't distinguish between certain behaviours which although technically fall under the same group, can't be judged by a black and white approach of your ""dick move"". You wouldn't be a good cop nor a judge.

and your problem is that you are too selfish and lazy to walk 200 yards instead of endangering pedestrians. I would be a perfect cop or judge because I respect the law.

true,JayCartwright,lfcflame,,"&gt; he's the best we ever had

Bear with me here because this is going to sound confusing at first but I'll do my best to rationalize it.

 I have been having this debate with my brother for a while now and while I don't think he is in the top 5 Liverpool players ever, he is absolutely in the top 5 of just shear football talent that we have ever had, maybe even number 1 on that list. 

What I mean by that is, I don't think we can put him in the best ever category because he hasn't won enough trophies here to put him there (only the 1 Carling Cup to his name while at LFC). Obviously, he is not playing in one of the all-time great Liverpool teams who are winning things for fun, but without a trophy haul, I don't think you can displace guys like Kenny, Rushie, Hughes, Stevie, Barnes etc. etc. (we have so many historically great players who won a lot back in the day you can put a myriad of names in there depending on your mood).

That said, based on just football ability alone, yeah he might be the most talented player we have ever had. I mean the man can really do it all; is there an area in his game that is lacking? I can't think of one. He produces so many, ""How in the world did he even think to do that?"" moments and then pulls them off so easily that it is almost expected as the norm. It wouldn't even surprise me that if he had to go in goal he could probably pull off a couple world class saves. 

All in all, if he could just win one major trophy here (unlikely, but who knows) I think we could definitely put him in the conversation of Best Ever Liverpool Player.",0,1386251055,null,0,false,0,cdu5fpf,t3_1s5kuq,t1_cdu5fpf,t1_cdu4eme,null,1428386213,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

So there's probably not much to be gained from trees, even if they act as a bit of a wind break. In high winds you've still got to consider trains running along exposed sections of track, and in these winds you're also running the risk of a train hitting a branch or fallen tree.

On days like this some lines would still be closed because of storm force winds, but if they don't need to clear debris from lines, trains can start running again sooner.

He'd waltz into our first 11 at the expense of Henderson/Allen immediately and then our midfield wouldn't get passed through like it doesn't exist so often.  He's powerful and mobile, strong in the tackle and can play with a ball at his feet.  Ironically he's basically the sort of player we really need to shore up our midfield's defensive problems.  He is the kind of player that would excel next to Lucas because he basically does everything Lucas can't.  They compliment each other very well.

Eriksen and Lamela are taking time adapting (and then Eriksen's injury).  I don't think Eriksen is particularly special or a club much bigger than Spurs would have ended up with him.  He's got some quality in his game but to me it feels like he isn't going to get much better than he already is despite his young age.  Lamela was a heck of a purchase though, the guy is really good.  He's struggling a bit right now but I'd be surprised if he didn't adapt to the premier league at start tearing it up by the end of this season/start of next.  Remember how bad Lucas was when he first made the switch over to England?  Sometimes it just takes a bit of time to get settled on and off the pitch when you pack up and make a massive change like moving to a new country/culture.  Lamela would also be straight onto the pitch for us at the expense of Moses/Sterling.

true,sm9t8,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;It used to be a case of ""the harder I work, the more I gain"" but when you have nurses slaving away in hospitals for one pay, and ceo's playing golf for something considerably higher in jobs passed to rich friends and family, it stops being the fair capitalism marked on paper.

That's not how capitalism has ever worked. Capitalism has always allowed people with wealth to work less because to some extent their money works for them.

From a capitalists moral standpoint this is ""fair"" because it is their wealth, taking it is wrong, and investments do have a downsides in tying up funds and risking them, and an economy needs existing resources invested in order to gain more.

Capitalism also has labour market, and wage labour, where some jobs pay differently depending on the relative demand and skills for the job in question. Consequently there have always been people who work their arses off for sixty hours a week but are paid less than people in management positions who do 20 hours.

Again this is ""fair"" to a capitalist, because pay has been set by demand and is paid by the capitalists, who's money it is and who are free to do with it what they will. No one is entitled to someone else's money, unless an agreement has been reached with exchanging that money for goods or services. Agreements are entered into freely, and if they were unfair, they would not be entered into.

Of course this is all theory rather than practice, but it is what capitalism is, an economic system without central planning which revolves around ownership rights.",0,1386253416,null,0,false,0,cdu61c5,t3_1s5n8u,t1_cdu61c5,t1_cdu554z,null,1428385861,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I see. It looks like the [justification was](http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/marines-risk-if-not-granted-life-long-anonymity-court-told):

&gt; Judge Blackett, when ruling that the anonymity order should be lifted, said: ""The principle of open justice is immutable and must only be restricted where either the administration of justice would be seriously affected without the grant of an order for anonymity or there would be a real and immediate risk to the personnel were anonymity not granted.
&gt;
&gt;""This is not a case relating to the administration of justice and I am not satisfied that those who seek a continuance of the anonymity order have demonstrated that the fear that the marines' lives will be at risk is objectively well founded.""

I can certainly sympathise with the idea that if not convicted of a crime then there is no real reason to make your identity public, however to date UK courts seem to take the view that there is rarely a reason to keep it secret either.

You would be called behind your back as ""being a dick"" as you would slap with fines even old ladies who littered by mistake and give fixed penalty tickets for going above speed limit by 1-2MPH. You would however be ideal to be a parking officer in London, who rather than inform people of bad parking and encourage them to move away gives tickets as soon as possible to make the quota and earn a bonus. Everybody would hate you.

littering by mistake is a far cry for recklessly endangering pedestrians

&gt;bbc - this was behaving like a dick. The guy was a moron and if he was driving a car he would probably kill someone as well. The fact of whether as a cyclist he used a pavement or not isn't connected with the issue. He could very well kill someone when cycling on shared cycle route or on a road.

it's entirely connected, you cant run down pedestrians as easily on a cycle path, and that kind of behavior starts when cyclists are allowed to break the rules

&gt;Also, have some read as well as here. Plenty of points which I already mentioned.

1. im not trying to get around another argument, just affirming that it's a dick move ot cycle on a pavement

2. the crux of the argument is that drivers pose more of a threat to pedestrians. I agree, but just because drivers are more of a danger you are still not ok to cause more risk and danger

3. tell the pedestrians cyclists kill that they cause very little damage. at what point did any kind of death become simply acceptable in small numbers?

&gt;Remember, law and rules aren't ideal and they shouldn't be obeyed blindly in all situations. Why? Maybe because law changes constantly? (if they change it, then it means it was wrong, doesn't it?). I remember situation where a guy drowned in a shallow pond and no police officer nor firefighter got him out, because they weren't trained to work in water. They guy actually drowned because he felt into water after heart attack and if someone helped him quickly enough there was a chance he would be saved.

if that actually happened, and it probly didn't, they werent following the law or the rules to do that.

&gt;I'm done with this discussion and you should apply to become North Korea army member, with your despotic approach to all the things in life and zero understanding in exceptions.


Kim Jong Phil? has a nice ring to it no? well if you are tired of being wrong don't let me stand in your way.

&gt;I only hope you won't lose your life in the future by blindly following certain rules.

yes walking along the pavement really gives me that sense of danger which I crave.

He got a good shot away from inside the 18 that struck Ben Davies outstretched arm. It was totally unintentional and his arm was in a ""natural"" position. It was the kind of call that could be argued either way, surely no worse than the Stoke/Routledge ordeal. 

Jonjo Shelvey ended up in a face off with Mathieu Debuchy mid-way through the second half. The two had been going at each other the entire game. They were standing nose to nose and Jonjo ""head-butted"" him. His face moved about 2 inches and it didn't look as though he made contact. Nevertheless, it was dumb and he could've been red carded if he weren't behind the official's back.

I thought the tackle of Hernandez was rough, but not deserving of a penalty. Overall, despite Newcastle fans bitching and moaning, the game could've gone either way. Newcastle didn't finish coming forward, Vorm made 2 crucial saves on Remy, and Swansea dominated possession, really playing a solid passing game.

According to this, 20% of all workers are paid the ~~Minimum Wage~~ Living Wage (apologies for the mistake) or below. This in itself is a pretty sad fact, however, it does tend to make a complete nonsense of your linked blog-spiel.

Outside London, ~~minimum wage~~ living wage is 7.45, and 8.55 in the capital. Assuming a 40 hour week, this equates to 15.5k and 17.75k per annum.

Someone earning 15.5k will pay 1,212 in Tax, i.e 7.8% of their income.

Someone earning 17.75k will pay 1,662 in Tax, i.e 9.4% of their income.

However, someone earning 150k or more will pay a whopping 53,600 in tax, i.e. 35.7% of their income.

Now last time I checked, 7.8% and 9.4% are much lower numbers than 35.7%

A historical building is just as likely to be a 'soulless brown box' as any modern architecture, just because its old doesn't save it from being useless architecturally. You cannot live in the past, one thing we cannot avoid is to be modern, no matter what we do it is modern, because of the time we live in. There is no need to be scared of new advances in technology and architecture. Character is not specifically old buildings, we are just used to them being there. This country as preserved so much of our heritage, I would even argue more than any other country in the world. We have heritage coming out of our ears, however what we are lacking is good modern architecture taking us forward, showing what we have learnt from our heritage.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"A tweet from the editor of a magazine representing the class who push for a barbaric society in which low taxes are offset by the costs of electrified fences and alarm systems.

The home of the future, ladies and gents:

* Infrared cameras that can read the thermal heat signatures off everything in their sight lines regardless of time of day or atmospheric obscurants such as smoke. The devices can pick someone out even from a hiding place, from a kilometer away in the lowest-end models to as much as 15 kilometers away in the premium versions.

* Glass-break detectors can operate within a 15-foot range, allowing them to be unobtrusively installed in the ceiling or on a wall near the window. Some urban town house owners add a blast film to their windowpanes, which makes them nearly impenetrable, even if struck with a hammer or a pipe.

* A system that billows out fog screens that range from a harmless smoke meant to disorient intruders to a noisome gas with disabling effects lasting up to 24 hours. Then there is the Burglar Blaster Decintegrator, a relatively discreet ceiling-mounted device that, when tripped, showers pepper spray.

* Such smoke systems can even be laced with a “DNA code”– SelectaDNA, for example, comprises a series of unique, synthetic DNA chains that attach themselves to a fog-shrouded intruder. The invisible, harmless forensic code lingers on skin for weeks, shows up under UV light and, thanks to unique markers, can be traced directly back to a specific home.

* A prominent author who declined to be identified has had his South Florida home jerry-rigged with a physical perimeter alarm, motion sensors throughout rooms and stairways, and a heat sensor that detects room temperature differentials caused by a sudden change in body heat. If worse comes to worst: The third-floor master suite is outfitted as a 2,500-square-foot safe haven.

* Switches installed throughout the house will encapsulate the space, locking down its three entrances with reinforced doors while alerting local authorities. Taking it further, the space’s bathroom doubles as an inner panic room, protected by “a silent home defense system with sufficient armament.” 

* Gary Paster, founder of Sun Valley, Calif.-based American Saferoom Door Company, has been carving out safe rooms for wealthy homeowners, corporate headquarters, and international organizations like the United Nations. 

* Corbi says his SAFE has projects catering to such anxieties under way on four continents. These bunkers can span tens of thousands of square feet and tunnel as much as 30 stories into the ground. They are typically hidden in plain sight, accessed by secret passageways like rotating fireplaces and floors that lift up to expose an underground staircase.

* SAFE’s bunkers operate on geothermal power and have sustainable food supplies, their own wells for water and full medical facilities. Many have amphitheaters, restaurants and health spas; for one client, Corbi designed a promenade with ceilings hand-painted with blue skies and “stores” displaying the family heirlooms.

It's perfectly fair; how green a car is, is very closely linked with the amount of fuel it uses.

The system is currently unfairly weighted.

My car is in band K, so I pay £280 for emitting 225g/km of CO2. A car in band C pays just £30 for emitting more than half of the CO2 that mine does.

If this band C car drives more than I do, it could very well be polluting the atmosphere more than me. And paying vastly less in VED. 

But if you placed the tax on fuel instead, the green car would still be saving money, and I and everyone else (including the green car, which is actually only half as clean) would still be discouraged from using fuel and causing pollution.

I do think some of the things the SNP have been saying are fanciful. I do not understand how they can say they will join the european union without being party to the schengen agreement or joining the Euro, both of which are requirements for new EU members.

""On the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who fans got a treat – a short but meaningful appearance by the all-time favorite Tom Baker. I tend to believe there’s no “right” answer to who or what the Curator was but my personal theory is he was the Moment, or should I say, the TARDIS. Let me explain…

The Moment guided the Doctor from the very beginning of their encounter. It showed him his own future, tried to cheer him up, broke the Time Lock on Gallifrey, appeared as the companion who always made him better and cleverly made sure the current companion, the one who knows the Doctor best and was born to save him, is around to help him make the right choice and save him one more time.

The Moment also gave him hope. Rose/the Moment was glad to see he finally understood her intentions and found a way to save Gallifrey. And after completing her quest to save Gallifrey and the Doctor she returned one more time as the Curator to tell him he succeeded.

The Moment didn’t need to appear as Rose anymore because at this point the Doctor was already better, already a proper good man. She mixed up past and future again as she did by showing Hurt’s Doctor the companion he didn’t met yet, this time showing the Doctor himself, but the wrong incarnation in the wrong time line. She showed him his dream can come true: retire, be a curator or anything else he’d like, now he doesn’t have the responsibility he took as the last Time Lord in existence. Settling down, be the old man that he is, telling him one day he’ll stop running and find a home, just what he dreams about.

Again, the Moment had the handy Clara around to assist him, this time telling her he’s looking for the Doctor, making sure it had a moment alone (see what I did there?) with him.""",0,1386259240,null,0,false,0,cdu81b5,t3_1rba9z,t1_cdu81b5,t3_1rba9z,null,1428384929,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"**TL;DR**: Two NHS doctors, a consultant and the Italian's psychiatrist, advised that something needed to be done for, soon to be third time, *mother's health*. The court very specifically, in several instances, states that they are doing this for the mother's health and that they legally cannot take account of the baby's interests. The court and doctors deemed her psychologically incapable. The court deemed that the 30 odd week pregnant woman should have a caesarian birth rather than a vaginal birth for her own safety. Because of her psychiatric state, the courts made the decision for her. 

Furthermore, the mother does not have custody of her other two children. Italian courts (the mother is Italian) put them in the custody of another relative and refused to give the British courts guidance. 

The council which took the child into the British care system was not represented at the court (they have no reason to be represented at a court hearing that does not concern them) but it does appear that the judge advised them to put the child into care and directed them towards the appropriate acts of Parliament to do so. 

**Personal Opinion**: The court's version of events make their course of action seem very logical and sensible, which is a relief given the one sided manner in which the story was told in the press, however the story doesn't IMHO seem black and white.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,null,null,"&gt; An understanding of self-defense theory and application is often more effective than a weapon.

What a wonderful world you live in, where knowing how to execute a round house kick is more effective than a firearm. This comment, on others like it here, seem to be steeped in a naive view that a defender with a weapon is less effective than a defender who has taken a 3 month class in kick boxing. Come on, do you honestly believe what you are writing?

&gt;The biggest problem with a weapon is that it aggravates the attacker and there is a MASSIVE risk that the attacker will steal and then use that weapon against you

There is also a highly likely chance that they will leave you the fuck alone, and if they don't, then you at least have the means to defend yourself properly by evening the playing field. It seems like there is a mass delusion going here to justify your country's idiotic stance against letting people have any means to defend themselves other than running away or channeling your inner Bruce Lee.

&gt;I remember a very old Batman comic where a mugger pulls out a knife and Batman smiles and says: ""thanks for telling me which hand you're going to attack with""

Is that so? Well I ain't batman, and neither is OP. For the common person, it is much more sensible to be able to brandish a weapon, then suggesting a small female disarms a man with a knife, then executes a Rambo throat rip.

&gt;And if five people pull on you then you go for self-defense 101. YOU RUN.

And what happens if they are faster than you. Curl up in a ball and wait for the cops? 

&gt;Then because you've created a chase you gain options, the attackers might separate, you can turn around on a corner to take one of them out. The main thing is that you understand self-defense, thinking that carrying a weapon makes you safe is failing to understand self-defense.

Okay sensei. Do you have any more pearls of wisdom from Sun Tzu's The Art of War? I'll make sure to remember all these wise tactics the next time five people pull a knife on me.

Perhaps the first storm was manufactured and was meant to give people super powers but most of the powers were all based kind of ""meh"" and this second storm is like the finished product, awesome powers for all?

No I didn't see this.  ""We"" did not see this at all.

They were basing it on a 1% chance of vaginal rupture.  But they could not be sure of that either.  

They bent the rules of police powers who claim the authority to remove a **child** to safer dwelling for 72 hours.  It is still arguable whether that unborn being is a ""child.""  E.g. the judge has no jurisdiction over it.  And if the **judge** has **no** jurisdiction over it, what the hell is plod doing with his hands in the womb?

The judge had no jurisdiction on an unborn child, so they based the ruling on the best interest of the patient.  I fail to see how the **surprise and indefensible** use of force based on an alleged, assumed, potential 1% chance of vaginal rupture is in the best interests of the patient.

They took the word of **one** case worker on the patients mental health.  No account was made of the circumstance which brought the patient under their watch in the first place.  

This procedure is all too easily replicable at short notice and represents the ease of statutory overreach.

And again...if the judge has no jurisdiction over the unborn being, how does plod have the jurisdiction to effectively arrest this woman, incapacitate her and the unborn being and transport the thus arrested being to ""safer"" accommodation?

One problem is that it's very difficult to lose your job in the civil service, and now that there are job freezes, there's very little new talent entering it. Even when talented people do get jobs there, most leave because it doesn't pay well enough (it's ok money, but you can earn more elsewhere if you're good at what you do) and they're surrounded by incompetent idiots. My opinion is based on multiple anecdotes from friends/family/colleagues who have worked for the Welsh government, the Home Office and ONS - only 1 out of around 20 are still working in the civil service.

Another issue is that public money have to be put through a tendering process which seems to end up with useless companies winning them. I suspect this is because those reviewing the applications don't have enough knowledge of what they're tendering.

Even if it was recommendable to have a Cesarian, it is still her decision, or we could simply demand everyone have a Cesarian, or no one have one, ignoring the wishes of the woman involved. Wikipedia has nothing to do with it, I've known several people who've had v-backs (look up Ican vbac), with real obstetricians etc supportive of them. There are lots of disadvantages to the child if they are born by Cesarian, breastfeeding, etc. 

I don't see how discussing the risks of vbac can be irrelevant to a woman being forced to have a Cesarian because of her previous Cesarian- perhaps you don't know what argument you are making?

The woman's original wish to have a vbac was taken on obstetric advice as well, you seem to believe there is only one medical opinion (you also seem to believe what you are familiar with is the limit of knowledge). You also seem to believe woman taking charge of their pregnancy is equivalent to denying vaccines, rather than their basic human rights (and they are -you know- the people giving birth to children that are theirs rather than either their body or their child's being anybody else's right to make any decisions on).

I don't think you understand what an appeal to authority is, or why it's wrong, because you just repeated how highly regarded the obstetrician is, not realizing how much that is irrelevant, given that the vaginal canal doesn't care and the baby doesn't care. And that doing something against medical advice is no reason to have your decisions taken away from you - which is why we don't put fat people in prison.

Facts and statistics are not secrets people at a certain pay grade only may discuss. Vbacs are safe as per the evidence. We don't demand people do what we prefer or deem better even when they are pregnant.

Every damn time something in great demand comes onto the market, a whole bunch of people run sales on ebay for things like:

""NEW XBOX ONE*  (* box only)""

The description then goes into great detail about how the XBOX is such an amazing device, it's got great games and it'll get you laid. Usually copied word-for-word from the manufacturer's website.

Which is technically true, but doesn't tell you a damn thing about the product being sold.

To put it another way:  You would absolutely do your nut if you went into Currys, saw a stack of empty XBOX one boxes with a sign up saying ""£400"" and you totally missed a much smaller sign nearer the floor saying ""These are empty boxes you're buying"", picked one up, paid your £400 and **ONLY THEN** were you told ""Oh no, sir. These boxes aren't empty as a security measure; we're selling them as empty boxes. Did you think you were getting a real XBOX? By the way, our new returns policy is no refunds on these.""

If you define a certain functional curvature as positive, then negating that would be equivalent to ""reversing the polarity"" of your vector field. In this case your direction of rotation would be flipped.

I also mentioned these, I used my experience just to show I wasn't discussing wikipedia - this was very clear, you are clearly just circlejerking now. Feel free to address my points rather than misrepresenting them, or not, your ignorance doesn't actually hurt me. Appeal to authority doesn't become fallacious if the person is more important, it becomes fallacious if you discuss the facts. Their qualifications are the appeal to authority. This isn't nuclear physics, it isn't beyond discussion (not that you have discussed it, at all). As I said, we are not discussing secret info. So no, you repeating yourself hasn't added anything yet. But since this is the internet, feel free to keep persevering. And getting angrier because that will make you right, and when you have a child feel free to recommend to your wife she gets a Cesarian, ignoring all the negatives to her and your child. Of feel free to take the choice out of her hands because you know better, or feel free to clap along when some official takes her choices out of her hands.

Mention my name more, it really addresses the issues around personal body integrity and whether a baby can exit a birth canal. Repeat named expert, over and over, and it still doesn't address the risks and whose they are to take.

My previous prediction of your next post couldn't have been more right, don't disappoint me now.

I don't think you know the first thing about vbacs, and the chilling fact is your lack of knowledge doesn't disturb you at all. I think you believe actual familiarity with the subject being discussed is somehow distasteful, somehow elitist.

If you only repeat yourself again, that's why I haven't replied, or maybe your personal attacks have worked, either way you are still not just wrong, but also not addressing the question at all, at the cost of your own wife and child (or whatever you have and neglect via circlejerking).",0,1386264577,null,0,1386265371,0,cduabme,t3_1s5fzd,t1_cduabme,t1_cdu8s19,null,1428383862,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

I think Independence is a great opportunity for Scotland and for the rest of the UK at the same time, on a personal economic level I don't expect much to change I'll probably be marginally better off or worse off in the long run but it wont be anything of any significance, on a country-wide scale though I think we will be able to diversify the economy much better. One of the key things opponents to independence criticise is how reliant Scotland would be on oil for our economy and for me that is a *great*  reason to vote yes.

Scotland *is* reliant on oil, at the moment though that oil gives us a resource that we can use to diversify our economy, we could be funding other sectors to generate employment and skills so that when the oil does eventually dry up we as a country will not become an economic backwater. I personally don't see the UK ever providing the right environment to achieve that but in an independent Scotland we would have no choice but to achieve that and so we would.

Politically I cannot stand the fact that there is a truly massive part of our government (house of lords) that is made up of unelected people of great wealth and influence. An independent Scotland would have a single house, elected by the people and directly answerable to the people, the parliament would be too wee for there to be any irrelevant MSP's whereas in Westminster unless they are a front bench MP it is likely your representative is not going to be heard on the issues they raise. reform of the UK political system would be an option but unfortunately *every* opportunity to reform has been met with a solid ""no"" and that's fine if that's the kind of country they want to live in but it isnt the one i want, i see a way out and intend to grab it.

Culturally I could see the British Isles (including the republic) coming closer together as a result of independence, I think 3 governments as opposed to 2 would allow mediation of issues and ultimately we could cement the friendship between the isles but it would be done on an equal footing.

My biggest reason for wanting Independence though is devolution...
you just have to read comments on reddit or listen to debates on tv to see that the public in England *dont* understand how devolution works, the Welsh and Northern Irish have it so they do but ultimately the biggest voting bloc in the UK doesn't and the hard work that the Scottish government has done since 1999 to protect key public services is therefore under a perpetual threat, I am frequently seeing people suggest that the Scottish parliament should be disbanded because it isn't fair that we should be ""given"" things like free university. ultimately the only way to ensure that the things that the Scottish government decide upon remain in effect is to remove the only thing that can take them away from the equation and that thing is the UK parliament, it can theoretically dissolve the Scottish parliament without needing any approval to do so and I can't see a devolved parliament ever being a safe option because of that.

Over the *long term* pension investments (except those miss-sold) are generally pretty safe and the earlier you start the better - even if quite small amounts. The key is tax and compounding. 

There is an argument that maximising the speed of paying off your mortgage is also a good investment, again the earlier the better due to compounding interest. 

However, if you sacrifice say £100 from take-home pay into a pension you are investing more than that into the fund due to tax savings (broadly, you don't pay tax on the income you pay into the pension), if basic rate taxpayer this would be at least £120. The gains on your pension fund would also be compounding tax free. 

What you really want though is for your employer to be matching contributions to some extent, even if theirs was a third of your contribution you would be looking at total contribution north of £150, or £1,800pa, which over 35 years (increasing only in line with inflation) comes out at £63k at todays prices, and this is before investment gains above inflation. 

Any pension would be a top-up on the meagre state pension, even a small amount is going to be noticeable. I don't have actuary knowledge but using basic math (and abusing a calculator at https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/ in an attempt to check) suggests the above £100/m plus employer £30 should be at least £250-300 /m extra pension income. On top of full state pension currently £477/m. This is before allowing for changes in the value of the investments. That is still not a lot of income, but is a *huge* quality of life increase. 

But.... Can you find £100/m? You'll hate me for saying it but having a live-in partner would easily save that from splitting bills, maybe a promotion, maybe you can find some cut backs. It might be a little less rough if you consider how low state pension is - that this is essential expenditure, not some discretionary choice for extra comfort in old age.

true,gnorty,null,null,"&gt; Any objection is a prime example of local residents trying to stop anything happening on there own doorstep and treating the surrounding area as their own back garden. Can you not see what a waste of space these arches actually are, at the moment they stink of urine where they are used as unofficial public toilets.

So the local residents of Old Portsmouth (quite a desirable area to live in, not a cheap ""digs"" area) want to keep their ""personal back garden"" as an ""unofficial public toilet"".

It goes without saying that this article is biased, but to dismiss any opposing arguments with such ridiculous comments suggests very little actual consideration has gone into it. Probably a few people wanting cheap or free shopfronts to display their home made jewellery etc, at the cost of £40,000 of tax payers money.

Unfortunately I cannot afford to live in Old Portsmouth, but that does not mean I don't pay fucking extortionate council tax. Personally, I would prefer that small businesses pay for their own shops to trade from. Yes, that makes it hard for small businesses to survive, but if a small business wants to become a large business, it needs to be able to cover these costs.

Most of all fuck this article for making me sound like a rabid Tory.

edit :- I just dug a little further into this and found [the website of the opposing party](http://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/save-portsmouth-s-historic-arches)

&gt;This is an area with immense history and of international repute and interest. Once it has been tampered with, it will be gone forever.

IMO hard to argue with this. I cannot see anything here about ""back gardens"" or ""unofficial public toilets"", just sane and reasonable desire to preserve part of Portsmouth's historic heritage.

Tourism you say? Why does Portsmouth get so many Tourists? I thin most would say they come to see things like Victory, the Dockyard, RM museum etc. The number staying away because we have no low rent art studios is probably pretty small on the balance.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"&gt;  You are just trying to shut it down because it doesn't fit with the narrative of the general comments.

No, it really just doesn't demonstrate any deep thinking or lateral thought. 

But okay, lets engage with what you've put forwards. I'm assuming you mean this - 

&gt; Just because the system says its right does not mean its correct.

 &gt; I also find it quite disturbing that people think simply because it was legally allowable that it was right. 

Okay so lets examine this -

1) Nowhere in this thread has anyone said that because it was legally allowed, it was morally right. Not even in the original thread did anyone say it was morally right because it was legally allowed. People have made their own moral assessment of the decision, and have agreed with the courts that it was the best decision to make, and are glad the legal system permitted that. 

2) If you were correct and people in /r/uk did think that morally right means legally permissible, then the original thread would have been very different. It would have been full of people saying that ""it's fine, don't worry, the state has allowed this so it must be morally righteous"". They would have had no issue with the decision at all, regardless of the lack of information, because the state has enacted it. 

However what most people did was reserve judgement because they saw they were not in possession of all the facts needed to make a moral assessment of the court's decision. They did not believe it was moral because the state had allowed it to take place, but they were discerning enough to believe there must be more to the story (which there was). The few that didn't do this all related the UK to China, even people that stupid didn't do what you'v assumed lots of us are doing. 

So you were clearly not thinking very deeply or laterally because you missed those two simple points. 

_______________________________________________

So lets take a look at my point, how your egoistic cynicism doesn't count as deep thinking. 

&gt; What a wonderfully erudite contribution. Do you find it difficult to question systems and authority?

/u/guernican was mocking the way you made your point more than your point itself, but I'm sure it was a combination of both. But because he/she disagrees with you, you've assumed they are a simple-mindless tool of the state. People can agree with the state and still question it. Doesn't take a lot of thought to see that. 

&gt; Assuming the medical opinion was correct. I'm not going to buy the ""it was a highly trained perfect doctor"" schtick.

No I guess you are right here. It was two highly trained medical professionals - as quoted from the report - ""an urgent application by the NHS Trust, supported by the clear evidence of a consultant obstetrician and the patient’s own treating consultant psychiatrist"". A judge has interpreted evidence from two medical professionals involved with the case. This is good evidence, and furthermore it shows the distinction between scepticism and cynicism, a sceptic asks for this information before making a decision, a cynic ignores it

&gt; You're trying to belittle me to avoid thinking a bit more deeply, a bit more laterally about the issue. Shame. Well, not everyone has the capacity to question, some people get a bit uncomfortable with assertions that what the authorities do is not always right. I'm okay with that. 

Some people are uncomfortable questioning authority. However not very many people in this thread are as I've demonstrated. Most of us questioned it enough to require more information before making our judgement. You are not intellectually superior through merit of simply disagreeing with the state, you have to construct a good argument as to why you disagree, which you haven't. 

&gt; Obviously that is the last thing people on this comment thread want to hear, but sometimes you need to present a different opinion. Yes, I will be down voted for this.

/u/multijoy responded to this perfectly so I'll repeat it - ""No, you'll be downvoted for whining about the downvotes"".

&gt; Actually, most of them struggle to walk from their front door to the car on some days. On really bad days they struggle to walk from the bedroom to the toilet. I showed your post to one of them, she's still laughing now.

I'm glad I could put a smile on her face. Say hi for me.

Do you have any schemes down there for people to try out adapted bikes/trikes? Not that it would be any use on the roads we have at the moment.

&gt; It's more what I'm doing and how much time I have to do it rather than distance. ASDA is only a mile away, but if I'm doing a full shop for a family of five on my own I ain't gonna walk it. If I'm going to the station to get the train to London for work, that's probably 2 miles, but I'll take shanks pony rather than ride or car.

Get a trailer and you could do that shop by bike. Our train station has a really good cycle hub where you can park your bike indoors all day for a quid. From what I recall Brighton train station doesn't have great bike parking.

&gt; I'm all for cycling, as I said I do it myself. I'm not one of those motorists who hates bikes AT ALL. I'd welcome properly thought out traffic schemes, but they should be for the benefit of every road user who needs to use them. This is my issue with the greens, the traffic measures are punitive to car users AND unhelpful(in some cases more dangerous) to cyclists and pedestrians.

Like I said, you need the carrot to go along with the stick.

&gt; As I said in my original post I've got first hand experience of their lunacy and have to suffer it every single day. The idea of them running the whole country makes me want to cry.

Vlad's positioning is IMO a mistake.

I'm not saying Dawson wasn't partly at fault but Paulinho should have done better when Dawson passes to him (tries unsuccessfully to shield from Parker), Chriches should have been more aware of Dejagah's movement and Vert shouldn't have pushed on so high so soon (though this is a tactical issue, rather than a decision of his).

Any United Ireland would be a New Republic or possibly even New Dominion. Both states would cease to exist and so probably would the debt that has been dumped on the South.

I think in the long run a United Ireland would be of most benefit to the northern half of the island. Northern Ireland has run a deficit economy for almost the entirety of its existence and it always will. Also Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and northern Connacht constantly struggle economically and from lack of investment because of partition. 

People up here are cut off from their natural hinterland. Just look at an infrastructural map of Ireland and the massive gulf that exists west of the Eastern Corridor and north of the M4 Motorway. We need infrastructure here first then investment and economic prosperity will follow.

The pass made it to Gerrard. Allen saw the pressure coming in. When he passes Gerrard that ball, he expects Gerrard to one time it back to skrtel. Gerrard plays differently, first of all, he lacked the awareness to see the pressure. He got the ball and wanted to set up one of his long balls. this is a completely different style and this interception was a clash of styles. Its not that Allen is a bad player. Pair him next to someone likeminded like Lucas, Alberto, or Hendo and he'll excel. The team style will also change once gerrard leaves. I think we'll become a bit more possession oriented.

So what started out as passing and movement that drew players in and opened up spaces became just passing without getting anywhere.

That's why coutinho is such an important player - he wants the ball under pressure, and will sometimes lay it straight off, but will also reguarly look to turn or play riskier passes.

Suso coming in the future will also help this. Alberto may end up being the time of player that forces the opposition to do something about the spanish-passing.

Not completely Barca (never go full Barca) because thats not direct enough for the EPL (look at swansea). but I think he is focusing on technical players. especially in the youth players we are signing. 

edit: Arsenal are the perfect example. Their passing is sublime. the movement of the players is well thought out, and they've scored some amazing team goals this season. What I meant by Alberto is that he'll do this higher up the pitch. tiki Taka at the midfield doesn't do anything, because as you mentioned, the oppositioin will sit back. But tiki taka in the opponents half between our forwards and players like coutinho/alberto is more likely to draw out defenders.

So once again, if I am ganged up on by five people, I simply have to make sure I have been practicing my Greco-Roman wrestling moves so I can disable each of these guys one by one whilst the others patiently wait for me to finish dispatching the attackers one by one. How nice. I see the error of my ways.

&gt; As I said it gives you more options to disable the attackers if they give chase...

Oh boy, this is simply delusion at its finest. I guess we need to take classes on tactical retreats as well. As if a small female is really going to start planning escape routes, and planting bear traps and punji spikes behind her as she runs. I guess we all need to re-watch Predator a few times to get these techniques down. And we'll be sure to remember how to do this when approached by several men with knives.

On second thought, no thanks. I'll take a gun instead. Or a knife. Anything that makes the assailants think you are more trouble than its worth.

American law in states differs, but for the most part it allows you to defend yourself with deadly force so long as you have reasonable belief you are in danger of being seriously injured, raped, or murdered.  Since you can't read minds, you don't need to prove the attacker wanted to hurt or kill you, only that a reasonable person might believe so in that moment.

Also, quite a bit is categorized as deadly force since there's a very serious risk of severe injury or death.  Good examples include multiple attackers, younger or stronger attackers, various blunt force weapons, knives, or even just the continuance of an attack after an overwhelming advantage, say if the attacker is on top of you and is punching you against the pavement.

I wrote a polite letter to the chief constable explaining this, also that I'd never had so much as a parking ticket before and that having the courts waste time pursuing such trivial cases probably isn't in the public interest.

He wrote back saying that while the law states the disc must be displayed, police don't really need it to be nowadays and that most cases of this type are brought about by overly officious traffic wardens. He also said that he'd have a word with the magistrate and see what he could do.

A few days later I got a letter from the court saying that after further consideration the case was being dropped.

Not even in the original thread did anyone say it was morally right because it was legally allowed. People have made their own moral assessment of the decision, and have agreed with the courts that it was the best decision to make, and are glad the legal system permitted that.

Are you having a laugh? Do you not understand what morally right means?

&gt;It would have been full of people saying that ""it's fine, don't worry, the state has allowed this so it must be morally righteous"".

That and this thread are full of people asserting that.

&gt;However what most people did was reserve judgement because they saw they were not in possession of all the facts needed to make a moral assessment of the court's decision.

Most people certainly did not reserve judgement. As soon as the Essex council announced they had gone to the courts they immediately jumped on the ""she and her lawyer are lying"" and the ""the state did right"" bandwagon.

&gt;So you were clearly not thinking very deeply or laterally because you missed those two simple points.

Again you really do not understand the point I was trying to make.

&gt;/u/guernican was mocking the way you made your point more than your point itself, but I'm sure it was a combination of both. But because he/she disagrees with you, you've assumed they are a simple-mindless tool of the state. People can agree with the state and still question it. Doesn't take a lot of thought to see that.

I think in the context of brining up that particular author and that particular story that user completely missed the point I was trying to make. Bringing up Hitler was a bit of embarrassment.

&gt;No I guess you are right here. It was two highly trained medical professionals - as quoted from the report - ""an urgent application by the NHS Trust, supported by the clear evidence of a consultant obstetrician and the patient’s own treating consultant psychiatrist"". A judge has interpreted evidence from two medical professionals involved with the case. This is good evidence, and furthermore it shows the distinction between scepticism and cynicism, a sceptic asks for this information before making a decision, a cynic ignores it

To start with the assertion that they are 'highly-trained' is dubious calling them professionals simply asserts that you support the state's right to do what it did. But considering that none of that has any relevance to the point I am trying to make I really do not understand why you are mentioning it. I am not making the point that the state is wrong or right through the actions of its own procedures.

&gt;However not very many people in this thread are as I've demonstrated. Most of us questioned it enough to require more information before making our judgement.

Most of you came quickly to judgement and you haven't really demonstrated anything.

&gt;You are not intellectually superior through merit of simply disagreeing with the state, you have to construct a good argument as to why you disagree, which you haven't.

I never stated that I was intellectually superior to anything. I just pointed out the crass absurdity of the whole process which lead to a woman being put under sedation, forcibly operated on and her baby taken from her. Crossing the t's and dotting the i's and doing everything 'right' according to government rules is besides the point. The point is there exists a system which can lead to such abuse.

I'm really sorry to say this but you've completely missed the point I was trying to make.

I would guess that it's a combination of neurological and psychological factors, but that's purely a guess. We simply don't know at this point, it's a very very poorly understood condition (condition meaning ""way of being"", not illness). I'm happy to say ""We don't know"" - it's unfortunate that you and many others I've come across seem to take me saying ""Well no, you can't make that claim, we don't yet have sufficient evidence to know what's going on"" as a personal attack. If you're invested in finding an answer you want to find, finding the truth becomes harder, and I think it's always worth finding the truth.

&gt;I mentioned a scientific theory, which you do not believe has enough backing. Is there a different theory you prefer?

Well, no, you mention a non-scientific hypothesis. There has been science done on this topic, it has told us certain things. From this you and many others choose to take a giant leap, which can not be scientifically justified. You can't just claim that ""transwomen have female brains"" because there have been studies which show a trend of responding to a very limited kind of stimuli in certain areas of the brain in a way slightly differently than in males. Those studies are interesting, and may cumulatively one day be able to support such a claim, but absolutely they can not right now, and to make such a claim is either to lie or to misunderstand how the scientific method works, with a hefty dose of confirmation bias included.",0,1386278051,null,0,false,0,cdugp9w,t3_1rzs72,t1_cdugp9w,t1_cdufqgm,null,1428380637,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,wbright92,null,null,"Full story (my flatmate was part of the organisation of this occupation-turned-demo, and is currently being held in a station in Sutton without charge):

Last night, students at the University of London (a lot of them from SOAS) decided to occupy Senate House about a variety of university-related issues. This was an entirely peaceful occupation.

It turned non-peaceful when Senate House security let in police from outside (and also illegally confiscated student property such as laptops). The police threw the occupiers outside, at which point the demo shown in this video started. This particular punch I don't know so much about but the police were generally aggressive towards the protesters.

In response, students planned a peaceful protest outside SOAS today. My flatmate was there to protest as well as to report on it. This protest was about the increased police presence on the university's campus (SOAS) and their treatment of protesters yesterday. Police at this protest, which involved anti-police chanting but no violence, attacked the protesters and forced them down Gower St towards Euston Square station where another group of police were waiting to kettle them. Please note, again, that this was an entirely legal and peaceful protest.

Once kettled, police arrested everyone within the kettle without charge, alongside journalists and entirely uninvolved passersby. They then took them to police stations around Greater London where students couldn't protest about these arrests.

I can update this more when my flatmate is released and comes home. My other flatmate, a KCL law student, is writing an article about how the events of the past two days completely contradict the entire founding principles of the Met police.

Edited to include /u/SAPJ's clarification on who was arrested on the street.

Update: Our flatmate was released without charges but still had bail conditions imposed upon her. We checked with a seasoned lawyer who has worked with the police a lot and this should not have happened. To add to this, 3 officers turned up at our flat at 4 in the morning, and proceeded to give the three of us at home (none of whom were involved in the protests) what we later found out was an interview - without cautioning us. Again, this is not allowed and an abuse of power. They took my girlfriend's details after finding out that she went to SOAS. They also asked if any of us were involved in the protests, and our legal advisor assures us that if we had said yes we would have been arrested. We will be complaining to the ICCP.

We also got more information about the events at the protest itself. There was initially a standoff between police and students, with protesters chanting inflammatory and personal attacks at the police but with no violence or signs of violence. Then two vans of officers showed up who laid into the protesters without warning, and clearly without checking with their colleagues who were apparently shouting at them to stop. This was the catalyst for violence on both sides, though most protesters were peaceful and were chased into kettles befire being arrested.

Another protest was scheduled for today, and I saw at least 7 vans full of police in the vicinity as well as at least one ambulance. The students have decided to simply have a meeting about these events in ULU rather than going into another protest. Probably for the best, as the police are perfectly positioned to close off Malet St and arrest anyone they wish who leaves the ULU building. I'll update later when I hear more from friends who are at the meeting.",0,1386278757,null,0,1386357178,0,cduh1yv,t3_1s5szo,t1_cduh1yv,t3_1s5szo,null,1428380474,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Er... what?

&gt;  I mean, Capoue looks great and back in July, Paulinho was a Brazilian first-teamer, but did he really need to spend around 27 million on two positions Dembele and Sandro had sewn up last year

Er yes.. because there are these things called injuries. Last year we had no centre midfielders of Sandro or Dembele's quality so without them we ended up plying players like Parker, huddlestone and Livermore and we were nowhere near the same side with those guys playing instead of Sandro and Dembele.

Yes. I think calling somone considered one of the best young players in the world a good little advanced midfielder is a pretty ridiculous statement aswell.

again.. What?

It is true that this is the most common scenario but rapid knife thrusts are uncontrolled and more importantly unbalanced. If the guy he was demonstrating on was not standing like a fat marshmallow then it would be much more difficult to frenziedly rush in and stab him.

The techniques I was taught was about leading your enemy to do all the work and make mistakes. This includes let them over stretch to reach you, tripping them up while they are running or using misdirection to make them lunge at you in the wrong direction. 

Using keys totally work both as an impromptu knuckle duster and as a effective missile weapon especially thrown at the face. I also happen to be rather fond of wearing woollen scarves and have used that before now to deflect punches and incapacitate someone.

Don't get me wrong it is totally true that you should never get delusions that you are Steven Seagal and try and tackle someone with a knife with your bare hands that is just plain stupid.

&gt; create potential situations of danger because you carry a lethal weapon with you. If that's the trade-off you're willing to make then fine. I don't have a problem with that.

It is a trade off I am willing to make. Especially since it is more likely to end the dangerous situation than escalate it. People don't like seeing a firearm pointed at them.

Truthly, of course. In legal terms however he put in the description ""photo"". Now there is some wriggle room here. Did he attempt to hide it, how was the ebay ad written? etc. The problem is that our buyer has already admitted saying he saw the description as a ""photo of an xbox one"".

Bollocks.

First, there's no such thing as 'common law'. There's law and legal precedent. The police have strict guidelines about use of reasonable force based on both of these things. 

In this incident, there was no attempt to restrain or control the person that was attacked, which is what should have happened had he done anything materially against the law - or given reasonable grounds to suspect that he was about to do so.

If a police officer can say, with supporting evidence that a court would accept, that he she was in fear for their life or the lives of others, *then* they are supposed to 'hit as hard as they can'. That does **not** mean squaring up and lashing out with fists like that.

If the bloke that was hit had done something wrong, the copper should have put cuffs on him and had him removed to somewhere that the incidence could be investigated. Not smacked him in the mouth.

In all honesty the idea that you can simply magically restrain someone is a false one. How could you possibly? There is no magic training which allows you to do so. If you have three or four officers and one suspect, then that is more viable. 

As for techniques, punching is taught as a valid tactic. Its no more or less likely to cause injury than a palm heel strike, which again is taught. As are elbow and knee strikes, various kicks, pressure points, joint locks.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"&gt; Are you having a laugh? Do you not understand what morally right means?

I understand exactly what morally right means, believe me, I had examine it enough for for my degree. I don't understand from what point you are questioning my statement, you'll have to extrapolate. 

&gt; That and this thread are full of people asserting that.

Quotes? Evidence? I want a direct quote from a reddit user specifically saying or at least blatantly implying that because the decision was legally allowed, we should all feel it is morally justified. 

&gt; Most people certainly did not reserve judgement. As soon as the Essex council announced they had gone to the courts they immediately jumped on the ""she and her lawyer are lying"" and the ""the state did right"" bandwagon.

Again, any evidence for this? Any quotes you can give from either threads that blindly support the decision?

&gt; Again you really do not understand the point I was trying to make.

Evidently not, because the point you've given us is so clearly wrong.. If you aren't wrong which I and others maintain, perhaps you'll do us the honour of rephrasing your profound point so we might better understand it. 

&gt; To start with the assertion that they are 'highly-trained' is dubious calling them professionals simply asserts that you support the state's right to do what it did. 

Not really. I would argue the soldiers in Abu Ghraib were professionals as they were professionally employed but I don't support the states rights to support what they did. Furthermore, [as someone has already replied to you, at least one of the doctors is highly qualified](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1s5fzd/the_ruling_behind_the_forced_caesarean_case/cdu9a4j). But if years of experience, a degree of cambridge and being a fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists isn't enough for you, what would be the standard you would accept?

&gt; But considering that none of that has any relevance to the point I am trying to make I really do not understand why you are mentioning it. I am not making the point that the state is wrong or right through the actions of its own procedures.

Well that certainly appears to be the point you made. You were arguing that we should always question the state and if we agree with it, we must be uncomfortable with questioning it, therefore implying the state is always to some extent wrong. What new point are you talking about now?

&gt; Most of you came quickly to judgement and you haven't really demonstrated anything.

No most of us didn't. In the original thread, most comments held the view that there wasn't enough information to make a proper decision. Go look at it, and find some of the quotes I asked for while you're there.

&gt; I never stated that I was intellectually superior to anything. 

Not explicitly but you heavily implied it on several occasions. This quote seems to sum up your attitude - ""Shame. Well, not everyone has the capacity to question, some people get a bit uncomfortable with assertions that what the authorities do is not always right. I'm okay with that."". 

 &gt; The point is there exists a system which can lead to such abuse.

This wasn't your point at all. Your original comment essentially said because the court said it was legal doesn't make it right. Your original point was aimed at the reasoning skills of redditors in the thread, it had very little to do with the case itself. Very different point to stating that this is institutional abuse, completely different target. 

&gt; I just pointed out the crass absurdity of the whole process which lead to a woman being put under sedation, forcibly operated on and her baby taken from her. Crossing the t's and dotting the i's and doing everything 'right' according to government rules is besides the point. The point is there exists a system which can lead to such abuse.

It isn't abuse. This was the necessary decision that had to be made as many other people in this thread have already explained. If you are 'too deep in thought' to engage in the possibility that you might be wrong, and try to see if from the other side, then I can no longer be bothered.

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"Absolutely the best player in Liverpool's history, and one of the greatest English players to ever play the game. He's the reason I'm a Liverpool fan and 95% of the stick he's receiving this year isn't justified. Yes it's true his legs aren't what they were, but his vision has gotten better and his ability to ping a pass of any length is second to none. When he plays well, we play well. When he's not on or the midfield isn't clicking, it's far too clear where our deficiencies lie and they are exploited by teams who press or outnumber us. 

That being said, I think it's unclear whether he meant to dummy it or was trying to flick it on with the back of his head. You don't usually dive to dummy a ball, you let it go through your legs or by your foot. As much as I'd like to give Stevie the benefit of the doubt, I personally think he was trying to flick it on :X

Regardless there's not a doubt it my mind his cheeky outside of the left foot redirect was not exactly what he meant to do. The man knew what he was doing and did it brilliantly, I thought for sure the ball was rolling into the net and I had no idea how. He oozed class all day and reminded us yet again how much talent he still has. Model professional, unbelievable captain and absolute legend. Every young English player coming up through the ranks would do well to conduct themselves how he has done over the past 15 plus years. 

Anyway, I've gone and ranted about what a player Stevie is again, I swear every time I mean to write a short comment about him it turns into a epic love triangle novel between myself, Gerrard, and Liverpool Football Club. He cemented my love for the game and has carried Liverpool through thick and thin.

TL;DR Every time he plays well and we win people say ""Oh, Stevie is just getting better with old age, his vision and passing is incredible, his experience is invaluable"" and every time we lose people say ""He's too old, his legs are gone, he can't run, he's a defensively liability.""

Yes the ideal is to restrain without having to punch, hit, kick and so forth. Its often possible. Doing this means that the least possible force is used. Its often possible where you have a grappling match rather than where the suspect tries to punch. Its even more possible if you outnumber them. 

Its not always possible. Especially where you're outnumbered. You simply have no option but to quickly physically deal with a threat. Lets say you have one officer, one suspect, a crowd. Suspect has thrown a punch and you try to restrain but he resists, well restraint if successful takes time. The crowd is hostile and before you know it you're getting your head kicked in.

The ANC *were* terrorists.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umkhonto_we_Sizwe#Military_campaign

&gt; Landmark events in MK's military activity inside South Africa consisted of actions designed to intimidate the ruling power. In 1983, the Church Street bomb was detonated in Pretoria near the South African Air Force Headquarters, resulting in 19 deaths and 217 persons injuries. During the next 10 years, a series of bombings occurred in South Africa, conducted mainly by the military wing of the African National Congress.

&gt; In the Amanzimtoti bomb on the Natal South Coast in 1985, five civilians were killed and 40 were injured when MK cadre Andrew Sibusiso Zondo detonated an explosive in a rubbish bin at a shopping centre killing five people, including three children, shortly before Christmas. In a submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the ANC stated that Zondo acted on orders after a recent SADF raid in Lesotho.

&gt; A bomb was detonated in a bar on the Durban beach-front in 1986, killing three civilians and injuring 69. Robert McBride received the death penalty for this bombing which became known as the ""Magoo's Bar bombing"". Although the subsequent Truth and Reconciliation Committee called the bombing a ""gross violation of human rights"", McBride received amnesty and became a senior police officer.

&gt; In 1987, an explosion outside a Johannesburg court killed three people and injured 10; a court in Newcastle had been attacked in a similar way the previous year, injuring 24. In 1987, a bomb exploded at a military command centre in Johannesburg, killing one person and injuring 68 personnel.

&gt; The bombing campaign continued with attacks on a series of soft targets, including a bank in Roodepoort in 1988, in which four civilians were killed and 18 injured. Also in 1988, in a bomb detonation outside a magistrate's court killed three. At the Ellis Park rugby stadium in Johannesburg, a car bomb, killed two and injured 37 civilians. A multitude of bombs in ""Wimpy Bar"" fast food outlets and supermarkets occurred during the late 1980s, killing and wounding many people. Wimpy were specifically targeted because of their perceived rigid enforcements of many Apartheid-era laws, including excluding people of colour from their restaurants. Several other bombings occurred, with smaller numbers of casualties.

&gt; From 1985 to 1987, there also was a campaign to place anti-tank mines in rural roads in what was then the Northern Transvaal. This tactic was abandoned due to the high rate of civilian casualties—especially amongst black labourers. The ANC estimated 30 landmine explosions resulting in 23 deaths, while the government submitted a figure of 57 explosions resulting in 25 deaths.

I promise you I have cut neither of the above quotes short. In no place does it say that he must also arrest the person. The officer has to weigh up two factors. Do I arrest this person and take my entire serial off of the road whilst we take him back to custody, then deal with the ensuing logistical nightmare or do I let it go? I am unhurt. I can write my notes about this incident later. 

""Come on though, there's no possible way that - even if we didn't see what happened first - this was a situation where the officer could have thought his or others' lives were in danger. ""

I assume, like me, you were not there.  That being the case we cannot know that to be true. We are not in full possession of the facts. Nor does one need to fear for ones life or the life of another before he is entitled to throw a punch. The threat of bodily harm is sufficient. We cannot see the full size of the crowd. We are not in possession of the intelligence that they may have received. Provided the force used was reasonable there is nothing to say what form of force may be used. There is no ""If he throws a punch, you must do this, this and this.""

""Yes, there are reasons for coppers to use significant force, up to shooting someone with a sub-machine gun, let alone just twatting them, but in this case, the policeman in the video was wound up and lashed out. He got the arse and used it.""

I really only have two points here. First of all the term submachine gun irks me. The weapon to which you refer is the H&amp;K MP5 (although the G36c is erroneously termed a submachine gun) The police issue MP5 is not capable of automatic fire. Something which defines sub machine guns. It is capable of semi-automatic fire only. This offers the officer greater control and accuracy. It is also worth noting that the H&amp;K MP5 fires the same round as the Glock 17 handgun. Unless you are an eminent psychologist I don't see how you can tell what the officer was thinking.

The benefit of an Asian language over a European language is often wildly overstated - people somehow assume that if you can speak Mandarin then you can waltz into a high flying job, or that it will create a huge boom in business relations with China if we all take up Mandarin instead of French. There is a message in there somewhere that learning Chinese is 'better' than French which just isn't true.

The problem is that the motivation, incentive and teaching structure in UK schools for languages just isn't there. Firstly, Cameron makes the assumption that learning Chinese will help 'seal the business deals of tomorrow'. The current system isn't even good enough for 90% of people to string together an order in a French restaurant - let alone close business deals in Mandarin which is a far more difficult language. Furthermore, English is already the international language of business and teaching it to an inevitably low level is not going to be enough when millions of Chinese people are much better at English from a practical perspective.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt; In no place does it say that he must also arrest the person. The officer has to weigh up two factors. Do I arrest this person and take my entire serial off of the road whilst we take him back to custody, then deal with the ensuing logistical nightmare or do I let it go? I am unhurt. I can write my notes about this incident later.

The police are also told and expected to concur with the concept that they police by consent. 

Punching people and not following up on it is not the way to ensure that public consent to be policed will continue.

&gt;I assume, like me, you were not there. That being the case we cannot know that to be true

We can infer several things from the context, however. Seeing as it seems he was not arrested, it is reasonable to infer that he did not make any threats to life. So I'm calling bullshit on you suggesting that it was a possibility that he acted in a way that was taken seriously as a significant threat, no matter how many times you say 'we weren't there'. 

&gt;Nor does one need to fear for ones life or the life of another before he is entitled to throw a punch. 

Again, I'm calling bullshit on this. There is *never* a time when anyone is 'entitled' to throw a punch. It becomes something that someone, police or otherwise, has to resort to. Verbal abuse or rudeness is not sufficient cause to resort to this. 

EDIT: To say, I believe that the police are trained to say in court that if they've caused injury to someone, they should say that they were in fear for their life, and that they should also say that they used maximum force possible if they did not have a firearm or taser, because if they did not, then it is not reasonable for them to have said that they were in fear for their lives or the lives of others. There is no case to make that reasonable force to restrain someone or prevent their escape should begin with strikes to the face. It doesn't render people unconscious like in films. It doesn't quickly de-escalate situations. It's just what angry people do. 

&gt;I really only have two points here. 

&gt;First of all the term submachine gun irks me.

Really not important right now. Students getting attacked by police is something to get upset about. Being picky over the definition of shooty-bang-bangs isn't.

&gt;Unless you are an eminent psychologist I don't see how you can tell what the officer was thinking.

I think it is safe to draw a few conclusions based on his actions and the context. Whether it's possible to tell what he's thinking or not doesn't matter. What matters is what either he, the person attacked, other people present that can provide testimony, or other cameras, can offer as evidence.

He may well say 'I believe the person I attacked was about to commit a crime or take an action I needed to prevent' but needs to be able to offer supporting evidence that was the case.

On the basis of the available evidence that we *do* have, all speculation aside, it looks a hell of a lot like he lashed out because of something that was said to him. If you want to dispute that, 'we don't know' isn't going to cut it. *Of course* there may be other factors in play. But right now he's in the frame for assault and the benefit of the doubt is not on his side.

In terms of the 12/24 month option - in all honesty I can't imagine that would alter the position; the terms were communicated at sign-up and theres a big gap between you signing up and service being activated - so plenty of opportunity to cancel if the terms weren't acceptable to you (usual 7 day rule applies for distance selling too).  Other companies had different services with different terms at the time - it doesn't alter what terms you agreed to with Zen.   My reason for wanting to investigate is that I was looking to see if we had options to reduce the amount you had to pay to buy out the contract at your old premises if you took out another service with us.

In terms of the number port; thats not an area I know a lot about - but I'm concerned that may generate a cease on your old line - which would cancel the Fibre too (you need to keep an active 'phone line for the service to run over - I appreciate T&amp;Cs may not be your favourite thing at the moment, but that point does appear in them too).

Depends. 

If I was in fear for my life, I would do all I could to stop the situation by hitting them as hard as I could and would probably do something like kick them very hard too.

But let me relate a brief anecdote. A few years ago I'd come back to a female friend's house with a few other friends, after a night out drinking. One of them had wondered off, and been abusive to someone else, who just happened to be from an irish traveller's group.

The traveller, was looking for this friend of my friend, who had run away. I was out looking for him, and the Irish traveller guy squared up to me, asking where this other person was. I wasn't about to tell him, but had put myself in the way of someone a bit pissed and pissed off. He swung at me.

Now, seeing as this was near my friend's house, who wasn't involved, but I could assume the bloke who went for me's family would know where it was and possibly would not be very happy if I had beaten the shit out of this bloke and it might have come back on her and her family, I decided not to hit him back, but to do an arm-twisty thing and put him on the ground, without hurting him. He did keep lashing out at me, but I didn't hurt the bloke, even in that situation. And his mates dragged him away, as the police then turned up.

If I had the presence of mind to do that, even after a few pints myself, then a trained copper has even more options. I didn't get myself into trouble that night, or escalate the situation. Although the bloke that started the problem did get a serious talking to from the police after they turned up.

I'm not saying this for macho bullshit *'I fought a pikey and won with my ninja skillz without even hurting him much'* reasons, but because, yeah, someone hitting me isn't necessarily reason to hit them back. But if you really have to, you really go for it. Nothing in between is okay. ",0,1386290318,null,0,false,0,cdumg9t,t3_1s5szo,t1_cdumg9t,t1_cdulfc5,null,1428377882,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Yup.

&gt; The air is cleaner, the roads are safer

Again, yup.  More vehicles on the roads, but modern vehicles have cleaner and more efficient engines despite being worlds more powerful.  Leaded fuel was also banned EU-wide at the turn of the millennium and there are strict regulations on industrial emissions too.

I remember reading a very interesting article in a magazine circa 2000.  Apparently you'd need 28 2000 model Fiestas to match the emissions of just one from 1978, and the 2000 model was more powerful and economical not to mention cheaper to buy in the first place.

Old cars were just shit.  Unreliable, terrible fuel economy, terrible emissions, mediocre performance by today's standards, zero safety features.  Fail.  Don't get nostalgic about them, you wouldn't get excited over a 1960s washing machine or early 80s microwave.

As for road safety, the standard of driving has definitely improved.  I've seen footage of driving and roads from the 1980s and early 90s in particular (there's quite a bit on YouTube) and, quite frankly, the driving I see there is just **atrocious**.  Serious speeding, poor lane discipline, cutting each other up, dangerous undertaking, you name it.  Whenever I go out on the roads in 2013 there's a fraction of that going on compared to what there used to be.  Maybe more vehicles means that the clogged up roads *force* people to be more careful?  I don't know.

&gt; Technology has moved forward at a good pace (broadband, mobiles and most white goods are cheaper and last much longer than ever before).

Yes.  Mobile phones in the 1980s and 90s were pretty rare, pretty expensive and generally shit.  Carphones were a gimmick for flash wideboys and never really caught on, although there was a chain of shops devoted to selling them which today still retains a name close to its roots.

Broadband?  Nope, not for home users until 2001-ish, the closest you'd get might be ISDN, but again, very few home customers had that as it was marketed as a business product.  Large corporates/government/academia might have had T1 or something which, to be fair, was pretty fast for its day and the actual ISP backbones and internet infrastructure has always been quicker than the general public tend to realise.

I remember seeing a BBC News report in which they had the camera pointed at a phone jack and they said that BT were working on technology to allow internet access and the phone to be used simultaneously!  We were **amazed** and it was like something out of science fiction.

&gt; Bring back standing areas, it's easy to make them safe.

I think we *might* be okay with this now that we have more stringent H&amp;S regulations and put more thought into these things.

Few people realise that Hillsborough actually happened twice.  There was an incident in 1981 which led to a serious review of ground safety there and recommendations to sort it out, but corners were cut in safety improvement measures (to save £££) which led to serious compromises.  These serious compromises made the 1989 incident an order of magnitude worse than it should have been.

Hillsborough is the sort of thing you'd expect to read about in a Victorian magazine article described in vague terms long after the event itself, not something that actually happened and unfolded live on TV as recently as 1989.

I didn't want to look for jobs while at university because I wanted to make sure I got a good degree first, rather than being distracted. I got lucky in that the subject I chose (physics) is difficult, attractive to employers, relatively rare, and I'm good at it. Instead of stressing about jobs, I've been able to work at my bar, live with my parents, and take a more relaxed approach to job-hunting. I have to say, I preferred life as a student, but I've secured a high-value internship (£40k pro rata, though I'll only work for 8 months next year, so it's about £27k) which will translate into a full-time position/graduate job in February 2015. 

The thing I am most worried about immediately is how long it will take to move out of my parents' house. I love them, but since learning to love living on my own at university, I feel slightly smothered at home. And I don't see myself being able to rent my own place for at least 2 years (because between the internship and subsequent job is a 2 month gap). You hear about older generations affording their own *house* without a degree-specific job 40 years ago by 25, and that's just not possible now.

The poster was therefore not nearly as outrageous then as it is now, especially without the later context of Mandela's release from prison and presidency.

At first it was draconian parents who were afraid of my being run over or getting abducted (which makes sense, seeing how I nearly was abducted when I was three), so I couldn't stretch my legs and see the world through young eyes. 

I agree.  Although not as extreme as what you had to put up with, my brother always had more freedom than I did when we were growing up and it has damaged me.  My university years were pretty neat and I had great fun, really developed as a person etc. but I feel they could have been even better if I'd had more freedom as a teenager and developed earlier.  I didn't go on a proper ""night out"" with my friends until just before starting university aged 18, didn't go to my first house party until just before my 18th (drove there, didn't drink) etc.

Didn't hug a girl my own age for the first time until just after I turned 18, no first kiss until 19 etc.  As it stands, it's been nearly five years since I last had anything approaching a relationship, unlike some teenagers who have a new partner every 22 seconds and have sex 49 times a day.  My confidence around women is a little bit behind other people even now, although it's quantum leaps and bounds ahead of what it was when I was 16 or so.

I could only *dream* of going off on a week's break with the lads to the Greek island resorts of Krappos and Chavos when I was 17.  For some teenagers, it's as ordinary and routine as catching a bus.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;So applying that to the situation in the film the police officer has done some NINJA SKILZ and has put him on the ground without hurting hum much. That officer is stuck holding a man (who in your case was still swinging at you) (not to mention the police usually use two people to restrain one person). Now you're stuck with an increasingly aggressive crowd (they've just seen one of them get owned = angry crowd) and you are one or two officers down when you're already badly outnumbered and need every officer there protecting one another.

How many police did you count in the film? As I counted more than one or two.

And the guy that got hit *wasn't* kicking off, which is the crucial point here. The crowd wasn't even that big.

&gt;yes ninja-ing that guy is the correct thing to do though in that situation it would have simply been too dangerous and there weren't enough officers there to expend resources detaining people when a quick punch solved the situation nearly as effectively.

I disagree.

If he'd been a genuine threat to life, he should have been contained and arrested.

If he wasn't and had just been mouthy, he should have been ignored or *even just invited to have a chat about his attitude* which two officers - and there were more than two present - could have done, and he hadn't wound it in, could have then arrested him with little need for ninja skillz.

&gt;a quick punch solved the situation nearly as effectively.

First, I don't want to live in a country where the police think they can do that. Because, as someone with l33t ninja skills (aka Rugby player at county and Eastern counties level, ten-ish years sports TKD and the odd few Aikido courses, frequently alongside coppers that I've liked and respected who have 'shared best practice', and being not-small-at-all myself) if I thought I was going to be punched by a copper at any time, probably 60% of coppers would come off worse, which is not really a way to run things, when at the moment I'd be quite happy just to have a chat, even at a protest - which yes, is something I do, and at which the police have *mostly* been reasonable. But if I thought I was likely to be punched by one for no good reason, or for exercising rights to be in a place protesting, or even committing moderate civil disobedience, any pretence to 'consenting' to be policed would go right out of the window.

Next, it hasn't solved anything, as that copper has now found his actions subject to national scrutiny and justified or not, he's going to have to explain himself, and may well end up having to have words with superiors and the IPCC and possibly face either prosecution or being sued for damages. Throwing punches like that, extremely far from 'solved the situation'.

They've always been a little vague about whether ""time lord"" is a job title or race name.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well you turned out all right. I ended-up falling into a state where I had an over-dependance on computer games like Paradox Interactive Grand Strategy releases and early builds of Dwarf Fortress. I may have built at one point a near encyclopedic knowledge of socio-political history and minerals as a result, but it harmed my studies and I fell into a depression. 

I never got to go to university, even when a work friend of my father offered to forward some written work to a former friend that worked at one of the colleges in Cambridge. It seemed so implausable I failed to react, and what very well could have changed my life around instead fell by the wayside. 

No childhood and no liberation at university, meant that I don't feel I connect with the wider world. I got my degree in the end, working long hours at an archaeological company and studying through the Open University, but whilst I have work experience, when people talk about all their wild adventures and frollicking, I feel left out in the cold. 

The pay is also so low that my accomodation is shared with a bunch of illegal immigrants who are ""engaged"" to dodgey Italian and Belgian. One of these days I'm afraid I will wake up with a policeman screaming at me and waving a truncheon. 

Still, all these discussions about how friendly everybody used to be and all that nostalgic musing, is empty and meaningless to me.

Don't even know why I brought that up,  but grats on your fulfilling uni days.

That's not to mention fantastic memories of the [run up to the FA Cup Final](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/4/19/1240163463381/Everton-v-Man-Utd-001.jpg), [the Carsley derby](http://www.vintagebluekipper.com/assets/images/bbt/carsley_derby_05_mid.jpg), [the Andy Johnson derby](http://i2.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article3272049.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/andy-johnson-tells-liverpool-fans-the-score-in-the-2006-goodison-derby-620-520074736-3272049.jpg), and [Duncan Ferguson defeating Man United](http://d25yla7xp697oa.cloudfront.net/assets/_files/images/nov_11/efc__1320849173_ferg.jpg), among countless others.

To disregard all that just because he tried to purchase two of our best players (keep in mind (1) that he didn't determine the amount of the offer, (2) this is standard practice (see Martinez leaving Wigan), and (3) that we already knew they were targets of the richer clubs for years) is short-sighted, moronic, and yes the petty chants were **a fucking disgrace** and showed a complete lack of class from the supporters, in my opinion. 

For all his accomplishments it was damn decent of him to stay with us as long as he did when he certainly could have received better financial backing at a number of other clubs. We all knew he would go to United and none of us felt like he owed us anything. 

I hope when he comes back to Goodison cooler heads will prevail and he'll get the warm reception he deserves.",0,1386296884,null,0,false,0,cdupeqn,t3_1s5jed,t1_cdupeqn,t3_1s5jed,null,1428376502,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

When the Doctor decides to retire and regenerates (or already is) an older Tom Baker version. He sets up his Tardis, changes the chameleon filter to make it into the Museum and then starts hiring staff.

Now, if he has the same personality as 4, he'd be warm and welcoming. Now if Osgood is always unsure and a bit nervy, of course The Doctor will befriend her and try and pep her up.

He tells her stories about The Doctor (since we know she is a big fan of The Doctor), and gives her the scarf as a kind of 'good luck charm' since it belongs to the man she looks up to so much.
