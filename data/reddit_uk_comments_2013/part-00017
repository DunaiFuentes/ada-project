This shouldn't be a bloody sub-headline. It shouldn't even be a concern, mainly because it's bullshit and has been ever since the issue was raised.

Marriage isn't theirs. Marriage isn't anyone's. It's everyone's.

Stop whining. Stop predicting impending doom. Shut up. Deal with it. Oh, and realise that the majority of pretty much every demographic is OK/happy/apathetic about equal marriage, including your own parishioners. 

&gt; Fox said same-sex relationships should be treated ""with tolerance and respect""

The same way one ""tolerates"" an unruly child? Fuck you, Fox.

I don't use the word often but what an utter cunt.

Lying for Jesus there old buddy old pal. But it's good to see a man of Christ swinging towards the ""equal rights should only matter if everyone is OK with it"" side of things.

And to finish off, Yvette Cooper talks some sense. Good.

Sorry, had a rant. Just fed up with the same shit being turned out over and over again, and reported over and over again. It's almost done, finished, sorted.

Quite how you couldn't notice the god-awful state of the roads I don't know. I've also noticed a lot more streetlights - whole streets worth - being out for days at a time. Never used to see that. Bin only collected every fortnight now.

If she'd got cancer a few years ago I doubt my mum would have been waiting around so long every time she went for chemotherapy either, and maybe without austerity they would have built that car park so she wouldn't have to walk half a mile to the hospital.

If you don't really use public services very much at the moment (no kids, good health, no need for benefits, no crime, no fires etc.) then many of the effects of under-investment won't be immediately obvious.

The fact that it isn't affecting you very much just now doesn't mean it isn't fucking up the country though. Or maybe it is affecting you and you just haven't noticed.

Does this mean we're better?

true,morphinapg,tennant,Tennant,"Good point about the crib. He only looks young in his 1000s because he's regenerated. It has nothing to do with his aging. The first doctor was his first incarnation, and he stayed with it for something like 400 years if I remember correctly. Do we know when he stole the tardis? I have a feeling Time Lords age at nearly the same rate as humans when they are young (first 10 years or so) and then after that the aging process slows down. By the time we see him as the first doctor, he's been aging naturally his whole life, but by then the aging process has slowed to only a fraction of human aging, so instead of 400 years old, he looks like he's in his 60s or so (even though the actor was younger, I always thought he looked older than he really was). After he regenerates, who knows. He would either continue at the same aging rate he was, or perhaps (making it easier to fit with actors) the aging rate resets. 

**EDIT:** I find estimates that put the doctor at about 236 years old when he stole the tardis. It says he stole the Tardis 60 years before travelling with Ian and Barbara, making him 296 when with them. Let's assume the doctor's physical age is 55 when we meet him (same as the actor's). The master stared into the untempered schism at the age of 8. So let's assume a Time Lord's physical age at age 8 is consistent with a human's. Assuming an exponential scale (with aging rate decreasing over time) then the doctor would have appeared like a 49 year old when he stole the tardis, and technically would have looked 69 human years old at the age of 450, the estimated age he regenerated at. The equation I used is y=2.6359x^0.5339, where x is the doctor's actual age, and y is how he appears in human years.",0,1359166112,null,0,1359167460,0,c83q2pr,t3_179nqz,t1_c83q2pr,t1_c83oi0b,null,1435638509,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,SleepyDustKing,null,null,"See, the problem here is you're ""feeling"" when you should be ""thinking"". While it seems more intuitive to not be debt, it can be argued that borrowing is necessary to mitigate the peaks and troughs in a volatile economic cycle.

It depends what you invest the borrowed money in - simple economics really. If you take that money and invest it into things that will cause our economy to grow, like education or renewable energy (See [Gordon Browns golden rules regarding fiscal policy](http://goo.gl/q70PG) ), then in the long run you grow enough to pay off the borrowed money. The government, and thereby the nation see's a return on their investment. You mustn't use this money to pay for current spending such as benefits however, you use only today's taxes to do this.

Recently, [Japan bucked the austerity trend in and effort to get its economy growing again.](http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/14081-japans-fiscal-stimulus-yes-there-is-such-a-thing-as-a-free-lunch) 

By reducing investment you do reduce the deficit short term. However in the long term, aggregate supply is reduced. You've invested less into the future essentially. Conservatives hope by reducing tax rates, we attract foreign investment to make up for this reduced government spending. Whether this actually works however, or simply makes the rich richer, is debatable. Many argue that such economic models were solely devised, to give wealthy persons and corporations just cause for reducing tax rates.

[Ringing any bells?](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/dec/05/corporation-tax-rate-cut-autumn-statement) Good, well I hope you understand a little better now. 

In comparison, the Keynes model predicts that if an economy is not producing at its maximum capacity, increased investment through government spending will not be inflationary (which is what classical economists like Osborne argue). 

[Recent research has shown classical economic models to be flawed however](http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-admitted-their-economists-were-wrong-2013-1)

Many also argue that having low inflation is not important - merely that is consistent and can be predicted, so price levels can be adjusted accordingly.

So yeh, while ultimately I know it may seem better intuitively for us as a nation to not be debt, sometimes it's better to borrow during these ups and downs to smooth our growth over the economic cycle. This helps dampens recessions and bring us back to our maximum capacity faster. If you use the borrowed money to invest wisely that is. 

It doesn't matter how much I explain it anyways, [it's unlikely people are going to change their views](http://esciencenews.com/articles/2013/01/24/false.beliefs.persist.even.after.instant.online.corrections), even when presented with the facts.

Hooper doesn't add anything different to them and we really need a clinical finisher who can be a threat from 30 yards to 3 yards or a big fucking bastard who is devastating in the box with head and foot and Hooper seems to be neither of those.

I think the Doctor's emotions could use an avatar. A new companion who is either an alien or a more evolved human. Preferably a woman with scraggly hair and/or crazy eyes.(Someone not considered traditionally pretty is what I'm saying.) Someone empathetic so he can have a playmate, without interrupting his constant need for smooching, that helps him resolve some of his issues. Possibly someone who can't help it, much like the mirroring of the snow in the last episode, only instead of making snowmen it's a person who reflects his moods as a reflex. 

The possibilities for comic relief would be often, and if the person was someone he saved from an insane asylum, or off world, or possibly a refuge hiding amongst the human race and failing miserably due to their empathetic qualities, it would give them the ""I don't have anywhere else to go"" excuse to hang around for awhile, because at least aboard the tardis they wouldn't be inundated by the bad moods of others. 

I guess she'd just have to stay aboard for awhile, because if she went outside weird things would keep happening. The daleks are pure hate, so she couldn't even be in the same room with them without breaking things. She'd be absolutely no help during tense situations, over the top enthusiastic at inopportune times, but ultimately expose the Doctor's inner-workings....which I've always wanted, because I SERIOUSLY feel like he has a hidden agenda. I've just never been able to swallow a thousand year old being of infinite potential wheeling around the universe FOR FUN. 

I agree with you on the plot-lines. I'm sitting on my couch, squinting inquisitively at the television saying ""What's his obsession with the Earth?"" If he has been to almost every point in time then we must play an important role somewhere. 

Edit: And of course, the irony of the ""Doctor"" finally having a patient aboard his ship and/or being committed to an insane asylum for admitting he flies around in a tiny box.

You're thinking of the end of War Games in which the Second Doctor was forcibly regenerated and then exiled to Earth in the 20th Century.  So basically at end of the story where the audience first meets The Doctor's people (they hadn't be named the Time Lords yet) they end up, essentially, executing him for interfering for lower races.

The back story to why The Doctor originally left is that he was frustrated with the isolationist culture of the Time Lords so he took an old, never used, type 40 time capsule (type 60 was the one in use at the time) and left Gallifrey.  Later, his granddaughter, who called herself Susan on Earth, dubbed it the TARDIS.

true,billythekiddd,null,null,"Wow, that was incredibly insightful. You're exactly the person to ask about this subject considering you've been in all 3 - countries with unarmed police, armed police and heavily armed police. What I never realized is how different we view police. You're correct in saying a lot of people here in the US aren't fans of the police. The mentality is fairly ""us vs them,"" but not in any kind of violent or confrontational way. We just assume they're going to try to screw us.

I never realized how separated normal citizens are from the police, and I really believe you're correct in saying the fact that they're armed is a big factor in this. Someone without a gun I think of a just some guy paroling that I could relate to, someone with a gun I'd think of as a bit of a cowboy there to give me a rough time but someone with an assault rifle I couldn't imagine ever approaching expecting any type of typical interaction.
I also think some of this comes from the officers themselves. The first thing any officer here does in any kind of confrontation (even pulling over a 17 year old girl for speeding) is rest their hand on their gun. They always approach the person as a threat, and rightfully so, but they do not always lower their guard. An officer who isn't armed still is or should be cautious, but they aren't wearing the gun to rest their hand on and I just feel like that might be why they're a little less cowboyish.

That leads me to my downside, I was getting recruited by a lot of big colleges my junior year because of my scoring ability and defensive work, but everyone told me I wasn't fast enough. So I tried hard to work on it and ended up pulling both hamstrings within 6 months of each other attempting to push myself to get faster. The lack of speed also led me to have to move the ball on instead of beat a defender, so it always looked like I couldn't beat a guy with my footwork.

The normal solution to this problem (find an unscrupulous person to take them off your hands &amp; sell 'em for smokies) is out of the question because everybody's now watching. And this would be a lovely illustration of how mysterious parcels of meat enter the food chain every day. Which of course doesn't happen at all. 

It would be kind of nice and professional if the police would take it upon themselves to sort this little pickle out. Here's hoping. ",0,1359194367,null,0,false,0,c83vv3q,t3_179ocw,t1_c83vv3q,t3_179ocw,null,1431084283,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

We all know that, in any court, anywhere, a guilty verdict does not necessarily mean ""he did it"". Because there is such a thing as objective truth, *and* it's possible for a court to be wrong. (Hence, appeals.)

But society does accept that the verdict of the court(s) is the arbiter of truth. So you go to prison or you don't, or your reputation is ruined, or it isn't. 

That being the case: if *any* appeals process is completed, and overturns an earlier ruling -the earlier ruling *was* a miscarriage of justice, for which the state is responsible. Surely?

Even if the miscarriage wasn't anyone's fault, in most cases it sure as hell wasn't the fault of the (innocent) defendant. In which case, I'd say society (which funds the police and the courts) ought to stump up compensation to the man who's been wronged.

What's interesting is whether the person with them in their garden now has a *liability* if they just open their gate. The sheep could cause thousands of pounds of damage to neighbours gardens, or (worse) cause a traffic accident. 

If they keep them there for any length of time (after they've eaten the entire garden!) the landowner *could* even be answerable for the animal's welfare (access to food &amp; water, &amp; enough space). Although a public interest argument for prosecution over this would have to be insane. 

Practical solutions: police pay a licenced livestock transport company to ship 'em out &amp; give them to a farm park or animal sanctuary FOC; or a farmers union or local farming association gets together to put 'em on some farm land temporarily while the paperwork is sorted out.

true,IKILLYOUWITHMYMIND,null,null,"The reason they have planned to put it where it is is that Copeland and North Cumbria were the only boroughs in the country that actually volunteered to have the repository built, and due to the way Copeland is built, as a cluster of small towns and a lot of the rest of it being on floodplains is that there is little other option for where to build it. It's important to understand that because it is a ""deep repository"" any affect on the beauty of the area would be very much temporary while it is being built. As far as the lake district goes, Ennerdale is not heavily visited as it is difficult to get to and there really isn't all that much to see there. It is nice, I won't deny that, but there are far better things to see in the rest of the Lake District (pretty much anything you can find at Ennerdale can be seen more easily elsewhere) and Ennerdale would be right back to how it was after the repository had been built. As far as heavy machinery and lorries heading to the area goes, it wouldn't actually be all that different to how it is now as logging takes place at Ennerdale, which results in a lot of movement of heavy lorries, and has far more of a visual impact on the Landscape and the range that the animals can go than the deep repository would. If it is radiation you are worried about I can assure you that the effect any radiation would cause is completely negligible (I'm not pulling that out of my arse, I have been learning some of this stuff at University.)

Furthermore this is a key example of a 1% vs 99% argument. I actually went to primary school in Ennerdale (my Mum didn't want me going to the local one, due to how rough CM is) and I have actually met many if not most of the villagers who are involved in the campaign against it. Most of them to be honest are people who moved here from down South with more money than sense (not to say all Southerners lack sense, just these ones) and as they aren't struggling for money, they fail to see the reason that ""their valley"" which isn't really theirs in the first place should have to contribute to getting money into the rest of the area which really needs it. The ones who are actually local are the ones in favour of it. Essentially Copeland is up shit-creek to be honest and could really do with this, with Ennerdale being the best possible place to put the repository, because the land it would be put on would just be logged anyway, the logging has proved that the roads can handle heavy vehicles and it is more likely to have appropriate geology and conditions than anywhere else in the borough.

The biggest problem I can see is in order to really cut costs on food you both need free time (to prepare it) and the equipment (cooker, pots, pans, etc). Neither of which are a guarantee at that level of poverty.   

I would think rice, pasta, and oatmeal would form the basis of your diet. All amazingly cheap for the number of meals and at least pasta/rice can be turned into dozens of ""different"" meals just by added sauces (which can be kept/frozen a while).

Ironically a family with two people bringing in £35/week could likely live much better since cheap meals have a nice economy of scale.   ",0,1359198057,null,0,false,0,c83w6q0,t3_17b6iz,t1_c83w6q0,t3_17b6iz,null,1431084440,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

We just lose possession and end up having to try win it back again. We need to be the ones in control of the flow of the game.

In attack I feel that if we lose Becchio we need someone who can score like he has this season. McCormack is starting to score a few again now and Diouf seems to be too but I feel that we may need someone with that flair infront of goal. Someone who can see chances when maybe others couldn't.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I wonder how much you can live on just food wise and still maintain a roughly healthy diet? 

Naturally you're talking about the UK, but it depends where you live of course - Save The Children did [a recent study](http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/The_Minimum_Cost_of_a_Healthy_Diet_corrected09_1.pdf) of 4 ultra poor African and Asian countries and it worked out as an absolute minimum of between 72c and $1.27 a day for a family of five including a child under 2 (probably a bit higher in each case because of the availability of certain foodstuff, culture etc.).  And significant sections of the populations still couldn't afford it!  And that was before the ramping of food prices since the global crash, the biofuels fiasco, increasing commodity speculation etc.

On topic though, it also depends what you mean by ""roughly healthy"".  Also, do we include feeding children, those with special dietary needs, etc.?  Are we just talking enough to prevent malnutrition, or enough to have a reasonable shot at full longevity? You're probably not going to be getting all the unprocessed wholefoods, berries and nuts, fresh fruit/veg, grass-fed protein etc. that might well take on your basic poverty diet. Most people are going to end up with a goodly amount of bulking with refined starch, sugars, unhealthy fats, as well as a lot of processed food, all cooked in crappy cooking oils (unless you can face a lot of steamed/grilled/boiled food and skip the oils).

Yeah, too few people do.  But, whilst you can choose to eat a crappy diet, most people do so because of lack of resources or lack of education, both of which are tied in with wealth.  Even the choice to eat a crappy diet may be taken because the healthy choices at lower cost tend to be less appetising.  They used to call the ""Western"" diseases, diseases of affluence - diabetes, cancer, heart disease - because they were considered signs of excess, but there's evidence rolling in over the years that they're pretty much tied to wealth in the same way other diseases are, but that they tie into lifestyles and mass production and over-processing of foods.  The fact that being wealthy is more likely to give you good longevity than not smoking is a very telling indicator, despite the fact it clearly has many more causes than simple diet (and being less likely to smoke is obviously one of them, accounting for around half the difference).",0,1359202179,null,0,false,0,c83wjtk,t3_17b6iz,t1_c83wjtk,t1_c83wf4s,null,1431084616,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Europe used to be a geographical description. Now, acolytes of a political entity that extends over only part of that continent, are trying to give ""European"" a new meaning - to bless it with a pseudo-national ""identity"" - that in turn blesses the EU with some sort of legitimacy as the Instrument of the newly minted European People. Of course, that ""European"" identity is defined by the core states of the EU.

In the same way that ""British"" is usually synonymous with ""English"" in terms of the identity that it describes, ""European"" doesn't refer to folk from Azerbaijan, Russia, or Istanbul. It is a manufactured, exclusionary identity used to describe only the particular European core.

As soon as someone starts going on about their identity as a ""European"" you know they're down with this, and seeking to use this new identity to manufacture consent for the EU as an institution.

I'm perfectly content to be described as European in a geographical sense. I'm also mostly content with being in the EU - in the same way that I'd be happy to be in CONCACAF if I lived in the Caribbean.

Yes there is a civil war, but there are civil wars in Egypt, Yemen, Mali, Sierra Leone, Bukina Faso and a tonne others. Why afghanisthan? 

Al Qaeda? An organisation funded by and who live predominantly in Pakistan, that's if we're to believe they exist at all, many would argue that they don't. What does going after Al Qaeda have to do with removing the government of Afghanistan and occupying their country for ten years? What the majority of the Afghan people wanted, that really is a stretch, nobody ever asked them. They only had one choice when Karzai was elected, the corrupt puppet of the UK and the US. 

How do you separate the Taliban from the afghani people? are they not afghans too? Have they not lived and ruled there for centuries? And who dies mostly from our apparent defence of afghani people? innocent afghans. it is a guerilla war, everyone is a threat and civilians are killed more than most before you even consider the effect war has on basic access to food, water and medical supplies. The country, like Iraq, has overwhelmingly gone downhill since our intervention. 

Gaddafi was elected, in what way wasn't he? Ah so Palestine is complex but you don't believe Afghanisthan is? Saddam took power in a coup backed by, oh yes, the british and the US. 

What I am arguing is that you cannot claim to be defending yourself when you are in someone elses house. We are in their house, they are not in ours. We are indisputably the aggressors here. We're overwhelmingly fighting shepherds with apache helicopters and drones, its not even fair. And what are most of these people doing, fighting for the lands they and their families grew up on. The army is there doing what exactly?

Unfortunately, now you've demonstrated you don't understand the region very well if you think oil might just have something to do with it. The Caspian Sea has the worlds second largest reserves of oil, estimated to be worth about $4bn. And although afghanisthan doesn't contain all of it, the country is absolutely the key to getting the oil, plus a shedload of natural gas, opium and other mineral deposits out of there and towards the west. 

That wonderful war criminal that is Dick Cheney said in the year 2000 of the caspian sea, ""the area of greatest resource potential outside of the Middle East...I can't think of a time when we've had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian.""

true,sirbruce,null,null,"The was once a race of powerful aliens called The Time Lords.  They mastered time travel but used it merely to observe the history of the universe, outside of and largely unaffected by it.  One of them, who we call The Doctor, but whose real name is unknown, went rogue, stole a time machine called a TARDIS (which is bigger on the inside the outside, and the outside of which looks like an old British Police Box), and ran off to experience the universe first hand.  Once he did, he found himself unable to turn a blind eye to evil and injustice, and so he began to meddle in their affairs.  He developed a special fondness for humanity and Earth in particular, so many of his adventures are based on Earth or involve humans.

He typically travels with one or more companions, again often humans, and more often than not pretty young women.  He enjoys showing the wonders of time and space, and in turn sees them fresh through their eyes.  It also helps ease the loneliness, because for a long time he was a renegade, an exile, from his own kind, a kind he didn't really get along with anyway, and later, because the Time Lords are now all gone, and he is the last one (more or less).

A standard adventure involves he and his companions materializing somewhere in time and space, often not where they were intending to go, looking around, and discovering some mysterious and/or evil plot or danger is afoot.  Sometimes they get drawn in despite themselves; other times the Doctor is motivated to help avert disaster.  A lot of hijinks ensue, usually involved a lot of running, and in the end The Doctor (usually) saves the day and puts everything right in the end using his wit and superior intellect.

Edit: Don't expect hard science fiction, and don't expect a lot of time travel plots (although those sometimes do occur).  It's primarily an adventure/mystery show where they discover a problem and then work out a solution.  There are some scary bits, there are some funny bits, and some dramatic character moments.

Whilst the film makes it look very one sided, what actually happened between that guard and that kid is uncertain. Our only knowledge of this comes from a newspaper with a lot of biases and it didn't even show the entire footage. It chopped it up and played us different bits. It certainly looks like the guard was extremely out of line, but we don't know that. The magistrates almost certain took into account this CCTV footage and found the shoplifter guilty **of assault**, and not the security. I'm not saying any thing comprehensive, just that we're being fed one slightly dubious looking angle of this story and there seems to be other angles which are unexplored. It's certainly very sad that there's some asylum seeker out there who can't afford sandwiches and certainly seems like a nice guy with no reason to be subjected to such things.

I'd like to see a Beckford type striker come in to complement Becchio. Just a striker with some ridiculous pace but preferably a better first touch than Beckford.

Would be a pretty good team i would think. With Tonge or green in the centre it might stop some of the hoof ball and the pace of a striker like beckford would allow some through balls or let them chase some of becchio's flick ons. Gradel or a gradel type player would give width and allow crosses into the box for Becchio to get on the end of.

Having said all that I think this is just wishful thinking as I don't see GFH having the money required to get players of the same quality of beckford and gradel.Worryingly if becchio leaves we're just going to be hoofing the ball to nobody 100% of the time rather than the current 50%.",0,1359206538,null,0,false,0,c83wzpn,t3_17abzt,t1_c83wzpn,t3_17abzt,null,1431084817,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I would add laziness into that. Takes less effort to throw stuff in the oven/microwave than prepare it and then cook it.

Well, we could probably agree on effort.  But I'd argue that's partly tied up with wealth too - poorer people are more likely to be working multiple jobs/longer hours (despite the rumours about rich people working harder - it does happen, but it's the exception) - so they're likely to be less enthusiastic when it comes to preparing food at home.  Also, with families, they're more likely to have both adults in jobs outside the home.

&gt;Eating healthily has nothing to do with money.

We're not going to reach a compromise on this though.

&gt;Asda and Morrisons seem to permanently have a weeks worth of vegetables for 50p per bag so you could buy a weeks worth of four types of vegetables and two types of fruit for £3. My local butchers will sell you a bag of different types of meats enough to feed a person every day for a fortnight for £30.

You'd accept though, presumably, if it requires refrigeration or freezing, you have to have those in your home.  Not sure what the current ownership rates for fridges and freezers in the UK are - doubtless a high percentage, but not universal.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Oh I do believe in free markets and that one always has a choice, but nevertheless, a cunt's a cunt, y'feel me?

Definitely.  But I should probably clarify my point. Globally, and in any named (capitalist) country - almost all, if not all of them are by my definition - none of the markets are free.  They all favour large corporate interests. And I'm strongly dubious that everyone has an equal or even a fair access to choices.  In fact, I'd say the vast majority of people are coerced (but that's a debate for another day). 

&gt;I could go off and shit in the woods like the pope, but I'm too lazy for that sort of survivalism, plus I like being able to walk down to my cornershop for a 6 pack.

Totally concede this.  I'm a poor excuse for an anarchist in many ways too, most of us are.  Though I've done some stuff I'm proud of, and walked away from stuff I wasn't proud of (which I'm proud of!)  But really, the only way to make the world more libertarian is to be libertarian, to plant the seeds for the future in the present etc..  If you don't do that, you just make people look at you and say, this anarchism thing is all talk and hypocrisy.  Anarchy is action and all that, pretty logical arguments and philosophies notwithstanding.

&gt;Ain't no-one who ever met me going to call me an immoral man because I am pretty fiercely moral.

Brilliant.  You can't always live up to your ideals and when you fail, you have to forgive yourself, learn, and do better next time.  Ideologues who disappoint themselves and get all self-reproach-y are the ones who end up doing bad shit.  Active anarchism is hard, physically and mentally, and people burn out all the time if they are practising what they preach.  So you back off, have some fun, and go to it again.

&gt;there's a difference between being a cunt and being immoral.

Yes that's true.  But, whilst your examples are true in law, I'm neither a Statist nor an an-cap, so the guiding principle for me is mutual aid.  If I can help someone, I will.

I live with some German international students at the moment and they have friends from all over Europe who come and sit in our kitchen to chew the fat about politics. It's really interesting hearing their views and we're all friends at the end of a discussion, but ideologically we are pretty damn different. I don't see that as a bad thing, or a reason for us not to be a European country - Europe's a big place with lots of differing religions, cultures and so on, we're just part of that patchwork quilt of interesting stuff. 

Leaving the EU IMO is only going to exacerbate our financial difficulties and give the current government more freedom to push through an agenda I don't agree with.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There is a misconception that KDB has played in a double pivot this year. He has been very influential in midfield but he ALWAYS plays with a dedicated DM behind him. Bremen play either a 4-5-1 or a 4-1-4-1. The midfield roles in these systems significantly differ from a 4-2-3-1 pivot. He did play in a CM role in a 4222 in Belgium, but he has not been tested in that role at a high level.

I wouldn't be opposed to KDB coming back if Marin were to go on loan. That would be an upgrade. Otherwise not really worth it IMO.

I'd rather us bring back a player like McEachran. Yes he still needs to develop but bringing in McEachran would instantly make our midfield stronger as we don't have a player who can do what he does.We need a natural passing midfielder who can keep possession and distribute well more so than we need an adventurous (albeit hardworking) midfielder like KDB.

McEachran has a ways to go, but he is the kind of player that plays better around better players. He functions best when he is supporting play, helping everyone else express themselves more. Plus we have at most 1 midfielder right now whose strength is keeping possession and he is away at the African Cup.  If you believe he would flop on his face stepping up to the Premier League level I'd urge anyone to check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwuWKHQJ9aQ) of Josh playing against a decent  Marseille team two years ago.

We are constantly short staffed and under pressure to work extra hours, leading to exhaustion and increased sickness among staff. We are all contracted for 40 hours a week but 60-70 is becoming the norm on our ward. I can't remember the last time I had a day off without getting at least one phone call begging me to come in. The domestic staff (cleaners, kitchen staff etc) have also seen their numbers slashed so nurses end up cleaning the ward when they could be spending time with patients. Important pieces of equipment (basic stuff, by no means luxuries) are disappearing from the wards, being ordered in smaller quantities or replaced with cheap and shitty alternatives. Opportunities for training courses or professional development have been withdrawn, meaning that staff are not as highly skilled as they could be and that patients are not offered the latest evidence based interventions. I fear that it will take a serious incident before the increasingly unsafe staffing levels are addressed but in the meantime we are just doing the best we can to make sure our patients don't suffer.

For the most part you'll find our playing stats from last year aren't that different. We still create tons of chances, have over 50% possession, etc. You'll find differences in how we create chances (less crosses), our defensive record (probably a combination of the defense unwilling to push high up in the new tactics and losing Steve Clarke), and our record against clubs above and below us in the table has switched this year (last year we were great against teams above us and terrible against teams below us). 


I believe the biggest difference under Rodgers is we have more a cohesive vision as to what we are trying to achieve with our play. Whether or not it will ever 100% work or you agree with it or not, there is a plan he has outlined multiple times on how to play. Too often last year it looked like we really didn't have much of a plan and if we did it was just cross it into the empty box. 

I though Dalglish was better about getting his initial tactics right than Rodgers is (probably an experience thing, Rodgers will get it eventually) but he had horrible in-game management unlike Rodgers who seems to be the opposite and capable of fixing his mistakes.

Rodgers is also much more media friendly which may not seem like much but can do a lot for a club. Dalglish could be so bullish and off putting in interviews that it raised quite a bit of criticism among fans and the media. This isn't a huge thing obviously but every little bit helps.

**TL;DR**: Rodgers direction and the feeling that he will stay in the job no matter what for the next 3 years are the biggest changes from last year.

true,psyugrad,lfc12,,"Firstly, great decision starting to support LFC! 

When King Kenny took over in mid-season from Roy Hodgson (who by all accounts had a miserable time in his stint as manager of LFC) there was an air of excitement. Results picked up significantly and Liverpool finished the season strong after christmas. 

Then FSG forked up a lot of transfer money and we were all really excited about the season ahead (last season). Unfortunately it didn't really work. The whole Suarez saga was not handled well by the PR team and Dalglish took the brunt of that. After that it was an uphill battle and although there is always great love for King Kenny here, there was the sense that if it was another manager with less of a connection to the club, the fans would have been speaking up about getting a new manager. 

I can only speak for myself and not the other fans, but this is genuinely the most excited I have been about the management within the club since 2000, when I first started following. 

Hopefully you'll get some perspective from the others on here too :D

Architect managers; BR and Rafa.

Consumer managers; Dalglish and Hodgson.

Architect mangers are a rare breed of manager, these managers reshape and rebuild the teams from the bottom to the top regardless of what and if it hurts peoples feelings. They love setting everything up to suit how they like to play and they like to know and be involved with everything thats going on.

These tend to either be a big hit or a massive flop.

Consumer managers will make little changes to the back staff and tend to trust the staff to do their thing, they will just concentrate on the first team, they tend to bring players in rather than adjust the team to make the best of what they have. 

The majority of managers are consumers but there are a LOT of different variations.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"I think the difference is that most people in the UK have no desire to own a gun and/or they appreciate that the restriction of their freedom is a small price to pay for the benefit of living a (mostly) gunless society.  So it's not so much a case of the government prohibiting guns that people otherwise would want to own.  It's that we, the people, are (mostly) in agreement that guns are bad, m'kay, and we're better off without them. 

If guns were rife and the ""War on Guns"" had already been fought and lost, then I'd be inclined to agree - we should then do the pragmatic thing and ""even the score"" by allowing honest law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from the armed masses.  In fact, that's why I'm inclined to agree with Americans who assert that they *need* a gun to protect themselves.  In many case they do, and if you took their guns away from them then only the bad guys would have them.  I think the US is already too far down the gun route to turn back, but that's not to say that they shouldn't tighten up their regulations.

However, in the UK things are completely different.  Apart from a few criminals who manage to get their hands on guns by whatever means, the vast majority of people don't own or use guns, and there is little to no black market in the sale of guns (at least, in comparison to the huge black market in drugs).

However we were very much broke at this point. It worked in the past when Dalglish (first stint) was in charge because he had built on the foundations set by Paisley.

However in modern times it hasn't been what we've needed. Rafa had come to the end of his cycle, and you could see he really wanted to rebuild to start the next one. Alas he was never given the chance. Hodgson was a ""consumer"" manager in a period of massive rot within the club, both behind the scenes and on the field, and it really showed. We were poor and although he can definitely be blamed for it, it wasn't all his fault.

The important thing is that Rodgers is given time to mould this squad into a quality unit that can play the way he wants. Coutinho (just the medical and work permit to be sorted now) is a good start for the type of player he wants. 

Time will tell and FSG will give Rodgers all the backing they can and it has been a learning experience for them in the last 2 and half years.

I'm conflicted by it really, because whilst the owners supported Dalglish much more financially speaking, they didn't seem to have the faith in his long-term ability and had huge expectations of him. BR on the other hand has almost the opposite going on; he's not given anywhere near the same resources as Kenny, but he's on a much firmer foundation and the owners expect far less of him. Rodgers could get away with no cups or Euro spot this year and the owners would still be 100% behind him and give him at least another season. Kenny had no such leniency.

All that said, I'm loving what BR is doing in trying to remould us into a tiki-taka team, and his signings have for the most part been pretty shrewd and astute.

I could advise you to skip through a lot of the extraneous stuff, which is quite obvious - a lot of it is stylistic and staged and involves the same ""characters"".  But I'll try to give a brief version.

It talks about the history of modern free, compulsory, universal education and its origins in [the Prussian system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system), how this is in conflict with older classical systems and how it has more in common with the education of slaves in the ancient world.  It discusses many of the features which mark it out as such, and links this up with industrialisation and Taylorist management - particularly noting those who funded the initial roll-outs.  It looks at problems associated with division by age, ""ability"" according to arbitrary ""expert"" standards determined by clerks rather than educators, the antiquated experience of the classroom with children chained to desks paying homage to a ""boss"" at the front as the font of wisdom.  The focus on testing, measurement and banding is also shown to be part of this and flawed.

It looks at alternatives and how successful they are - much more child-centred approaches where the child is taken as an individual, and listened to and gets to choose their own learning path.  It notes that 98% of five year olds exhibit genius level capacity for learning but that by around age 12-14, this figure has dropped to the levels of adulthood, and notes the way in which traditional educational systems drive out creative thinking.  And so on.  If it interests you, it's worth a watch, but some of it can be skipped without losing much of the message.  Basically, modern education systems are designed to reproduce safe, predictable, compliant and productive workers, not free-thinking creative individuals who maximise their individual talents.

2. In fact, possession of *anything* that could be construed as a weapon in a public place is an arrestable offence (this includes butter knives).

3. Freedom of expression is far wider-ranging in the USA, making our laws look totalitarian in comparison. They have no law prohibiting 'insulting or abusive language or behaviour' (though the former is under speculation here at the moment) which makes swearing at somebody, or even putting a sign up in your window that a passer by may not like, a fine-able offence.

4. They do not have an equivalent of Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, which bans insulting people over the internet and has resulted in several UK citizens getting arrested and convicted for heinous offences ranging from making off-colour jokes on Twitter to insulting Tom Daley. Such a thing would not even be dreamed of in North America.

5. Laws on hate speech are unconstitutional. You can stand in the street on November 11th and burn poppies all day long (had they any significance in the USA) and nobody can stop you.

6. You do not need to purchase a licence to watch television.

7. Substances such as cannabis are perfectly legal (or at least decriminalised) in 20 out of the 50 states for medical use. 

8. [Curfews on people in town centres at night](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18499475) would be laughed out of council chambers as unconstitutional before they even get drafted.

9. Don't even get me started on self-defence in one's own home.

Having said that... at least we're through to the next round (achewBlerg*Norwich*coughslurgh) , and at least we got to see McManaman show some good potential in the first half... I don't know if he was just tired or something, but we should have used him more in the second half.

Good to give the youngsters a win. Nice to see all three signings too.

I'm not convinced that the team is strong or motivated enough to avoid relegation this year... a couple more signings would be nice. I like some of the people we've been linked to, but most will probably be speculation.

To me it seems like the most obvious interpretation of this by far is that more people who get taken to court are actually guilty and that the police have stronger cases against them. Why would you automatically assume that the increased percentage of guilty please (not convictions) indicates some sort of judiciary or police conspiracy?

A) A police force which detects a higher proportion of crimes
B) A police force which builds successful cases for a higher proportion of crimes
C) A population that commits more/worse crimes
D) CCTV etc making it much easier to correctly identify perpetrators

Strange place, the past. It appears to have been full of people who had next to no understanding of 21st-century mores. For some reason, they all seem to have carried on as if it didn’t remotely matter how their 20th-century attitudes and language would be judged by us, their descendants and superiors, in 2013.

This week the BBC was confronted with this problem when airing a repeat of Fawlty Towers. The episode had a scene with the words “wogs” and “niggers” in it. The old major, played by Ballard Berkeley, is explaining the difference between the two. The line gets a big laugh from the studio audience. Or it used to. This time, the BBC cut the line out.

The reason given was that it contained language that might offend. Well, I’m sure it might, if you didn’t get the joke. The joke's on the major. At first it looks as if he’s about to scold someone for being racist – but then he turns out to be racist himself. So we laugh at him. The joke’s actually quite PC.

But still it was cut, because these are words the BBC now feels uncomfortable airing, certainly at 7.30pm. It’s happened before. In 2007, a joke about gay men being sticklers for cleanliness was removed from a repeat of Porridge. It makes you wonder what’s next for the cutting-room floor.

Take Monty Python’s Life of Brian. In 1979, Life of Brian was thought shocking because it mocked man’s weakness for superstition and doctrine. Today, I suspect a broadcaster would be more shocked by the scene in which a male character is ridiculed for his desire to change sex. “I want to be a woman,” he says. “From now on, I want you to call me Loretta… It’s my right as a man… I want to have babies… It’s every man’s right to have babies if he wants them… Don’t you oppress me…” Plainly, we’re meant to find him absurd, and to agree with the male colleague who grumbles about the man’s “struggle against reality”. (“What’s the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can’t have babies?”)

Given the outrage this month when the columnist Suzanne Moore joked about transsexuals – and the even noisier outrage when another columnist, Julie Burchill, used the phrase “chicks with d----” – I doubt such a scene could be written today. Lynne Featherstone, a Lib Dem minister, demanded that Burchill and her editor be sacked. What would she do with John Cleese? Hang him by his tonsils from Tower Bridge?

Soon, we’ll start to find Nineties comedy failing the 21st-century rectitude test. For some, this process has already begun.

Last year, Word magazine ran an article claiming that the “Scorchio!” sketches in The Fast Show – first broadcast in 1994 – were xenophobic. “Humour born of bored English comedians sat in luxurious holiday villas,” it growled. “Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish people all sound the same! How hilarious.” Maybe if the BBC repeats The Fast Show it could edit those sketches out. I’m pretty sure the Ralph &amp; Ted ones were OK. Hang on, though – the joke is that a man has an unspoken crush on another man. Is that homophobic? Oh dear. Future generations are going to be very cross with us.

Lines like the major’s in Fawlty Towers might not be very nice. None the less, this is how a lot of people used to talk (it’s how quite a few people still do talk), and it’s not much use pretending it isn’t. Because that’s what this type of editing is: a pretence.
George Orwell, incidentally, used to write disparagingly of “the pansy Left”. He was, by 2013 standards, homophobic. Should publishers erase his prejudice from his essays? Or would that be a little, well, Orwellian?

Why would you automatically assume that the increased percentage of guilty please (not convictions) indicates some sort of judiciary or police conspiracy? 

It's certainly open to a variety of interpretations, but there's no reason why yours is the ""obvious"" one, and the fact that you resorted to using the ""conspiracy"" silencing tactic is depressing.  That's the kind of thing MI6 do when they infiltrate forums. ;-)  This is since the events of 2001 remember, since when there have been significant changes to the law and the operation of the CJS, and additionally of course there were plenty more before that.  We've been increasingly adopting some of the most repressive aspects of an inquisitorial system of justice whilst adopting none of the protections.

&gt;Why would you automatically assume

I don't automatically assume anything.

&gt;increased percentage of **guilty please**

Freudian slip? ;-)

&gt;[The fact the UK has the highest proportion of its population imprisoned in Western Europe] could represent:- A) A police force which detects a higher proportion of crimes B) A police force which builds successful cases for a higher proportion of crimes C) A population that commits more/worse crimes D) CCTV etc making it much easier to correctly identify perpetrators

I'll leave others to judge those possibilities (and you're right, they are possibilities).

Absolutely - they'll grow it, beg it, earn it in one way or another, even if it means spending all day scratting for plastic on the top of some rubbish tip - this is REALITY where I live, because people, no matter how poor still have a sense of what is right and wrong.

&gt;  just to please twats like you

You mean people who think that encouraging stealing is a BAD idea ? Because that's what it boils down to like everything else. If you say ""stealing is a crime UNLESS x,y,z"", then everyone who steals will place themselves in category x,y,z. If doesn't help them, it doesn't help society.

Can I ask a question to you, seeing as you are a ""non-twat"" ? If someone starving decided to break the locks on your house, and empty your fridge, would you be happy with that ? Would you put a sign up outside your door stating ""it's okay to steal here provided you are starving"" ? Would you STILL be okay after your fridge had been emptied for the 50th time in a week ?

No, thought not. Fucking asshole.

You're quite happy to justify any behaviour provided it doesn't affect you PERSONALLY - then it would be a different story.

EDIT : Because I wanted to try and see if you have ANY understanding of why poverty occurs.

Take an asylum seeker from a country like Somalia. Why does he want to leave ? probably because the people with the guns STEAL everything they want, and ordinary folks are powerless to prevent it.

And YOUR solution to this ? Wait until an asylum seeker arrives in UK, and then condone the very behaviour he just left behind in Somalia. Instead of teaching him, there is a better way, you condemn UK to become just another Somalia instead ?

No one in UK is starving - everyone gets housing benefit, child benefit, dole cheques and assistance to find work. Come live where I live in the Philippines, and see fucking raw reality when there's no social net whatsoever ! Despite an official unemployment figure of around 7%, EVERYBODY finds something to do to make an income - the don't as a general rule steal what they need because ""it's okay if x,y,z"" - they'd die of shame first. I see people collecting plastic bottles, old scrap (remember when the rag and bone man used to be an honorable trade in UK ?), selling homemade dusters and shit at street corners, ANYTHING to make a living.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"It's a tiny amount compared to what we get back not just in terms of money but also in terms of freedoms. To quote [a report](http://www.bis.gov.uk/feeds/~/media/568CC723188C40DFBB02E868353B40B9.ashx) from our own Department of Business Innovation and Skills:

&gt;It [the EU's Single Market] gives UK business access 
to the world’s largest market with 500 million people generating about £10 
trillion of economic activity. European markets account for half of the UK’s 
overall trade and foreign investments. As a result, around 3.5 million jobs in 
the UK are linked to the export of goods and services to the EU...

&gt;the Single Market may be responsible for income gains in the UK between 2% and 6%, 
that is between £1100 and £3300 a year per British household.

Most of our exports go to Europe and &gt;50% of our trade is with them. The reason we have such robust trade is due to years of freedom and universal rules. It takes time for businesses to become used to new markets and to start to take advantage of them. The Single Market aims to reduce those worries and encourage UK business to trade in Europe and other companies to trade here. If we were to leave the EU it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to take up the slack in trade: what are the rules on property in India, on workers and their permits in Kenya, what about taxes and other administrative things in Australia? The benefit of the single market is to make all these rules the same so the rules in the UK are the same as in France etc meaning any business big or small do not need lawyers and special accountants but they can just trade all they want bringing in more money from more customers. 

Now i'm not a businessman so my primary benefit and the thing I like most is the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital through the EU. I can work, buy, travel and live anywhere in the EU. I can retire to Spain and no rules are there to stop me. I can work in Paris as my friend will be doing next year with no need for a work permit or visa. I can walk up to the employer, apply and by law he must treat me the same as his French applicants. There can be no special charges for me in the EU just for not being native and I cannot be constrained from doing anything a native citizen can do. 

Is that not worth £140 on your part? £10 less than an Ipod nano and much less than the insurance on your car? Sounds like good value to me and i'll happily pay it. ",0,1359231761,null,0,false,0,c842j77,t3_16orbh,t1_c842j77,t1_c841me1,null,1431087509,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Fuck off is that moral.

&gt;I do not believe they have earnt the right to deny food to someone starving.

Absolutely to not **deny** - just as that starving person doesn't have the right to **deny** them of their property. Thankfully they aren't denying anyone of anything, they're just not giving away everything they own, which is perfectly justifiable.

Your ethic would enslave us all.

You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs some forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all seven series.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Is it just me or does it feel like we live back in the heavily religious days where many words and concepts were strictly forbidden?

I hope you'll take this reply as constructive, but that appears to be because viewing the matter from a majority-centric (or white-centric) view. 

Perhaps racism has been approached wrongly in this country, the past couple of decades, I don't know, but the point isn't really about just about not saying ""nigger"" or ""wog"" - the point is that we live alongside each other, people of different colours and races, and the point is to have consideration for each other.

Part of that not to say things that are hurtful or oppressive to each other, just as you wouldn't make jokes about cancer or ""your mom"" to someone who was recently bereaved.

It's well within living memory that pubs displayed signs saying ""no dogs, no blacks"", we have a history of institutionalised police racism and people with black names still find themselves invited for fewer job interviews.

So words like ""nigger"" and ""wog"" are a hurtful reminder of this - it's not just the words, it's showing a failure to see things from the view of those who are experiencing discrimination. This is genuinely harmful and divisive. 

TFA states that, that the language is ""only offensive if you didn't get the joke"". He might be right that it's only offensive to *white people* if they don't get the joke, but I'm not sure that's the case if the viewer is black (an experience the author has presumably never enjoyed). It may be the case that these words are inherently offensive if you're black - for all we know the viewer is vividly reminded of suffering a kicking from a bunch of skinheads, or being spat on by the girls at school, every time they hear that word.

TFA explains that ""the joke's on the major - it looks as if he’s about to scold someone for being racist, but then he turns out to be racist himself"" and claims that the major is the subject of the joke. Yes, maybe, but they're quite cheap laughs, aren't they? I mean, don't get me wrong, this joke gives me a belly laugh, too, but that's because I'm a white guy - I don't pretend this humour is sophisticated. I think we can lose those kinds of jokes without losing much, and that's why it's false to claim that ""the joke’s actually quite PC"". The guy on the telly is saying ""wog"" and ""nigger"" for cheap and easy (if shocking) laughs.

Finally, the major is portrayed as a ""harmless"" old racist - he's probably the kind of guy who would say ""he's a very good chap, for a wog that is. don't have anything against wogs myself"". Why! He's hardly even racist! These are only words, and actually he's showing that he does actually judge people (even ""wogs"") on their merits. But actually ""harmless"" old racists aren't really so harmless - they're in responsible jobs and positions of authority, subconsciously preferring people of a background and ethnicity more familiar to them, over minorities. No-one's saying it's not natural for them to do so, but combatting racism is about acknowledging one's own prejudices and, trying to have consideration for others, overcome them.

I don't have any easy answers about Fawlty Towers, I don't think we should censor it. But that's not the point - the BBC have just been considerate, on this occasion, of their viewers. I believe they're cutting these words before the 9pm watershed, and the show will be uncut if it's shown after the watershed, that you'll still be able to buy it uncut on DVD. And I *think* the idea is that shows before the watershed can be watched by kids of any age, that the TV can be left on and that parents won't have to worry about what little Johnny is watching. So in that case it makes sense that the BBC wouldn't want unattended kids thinking that these words are acceptable or inherently funny, so that they'll go out saying them without understanding the context.

You can say ""wog"" and ""nigger"" if you want to, but I think, as a matter of consideration, you ought to have a good reason for doing so. I think the BBC have decided this time to err on the side of safety, and I think they're probably right. 

&gt; I hardly think we live in a truly liberal age when so much language is deemed ""offensive"".

""Liberal"" isn't just an adjective, but it stems to [a political movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) two or three hundred years old. ""Liberalism is a political philosophy or worldview founded on ideas of liberty and equality"", wikipedia says. I don't know that we can have liberty and equality if we allow our natural prejudices - for the majority to favour people ""just like ourselves"" for example - to go unchecked. 

I think it's possible we should consider that words can be harmful and divisive, that they may contribute to ""them and us"" mentalities, and that it's worth being conscious of them.

So this was *way* more of a wall of text than I planned, so sorry about that. I'm not saying this to criticise you or argue with you. I just think you're misunderstanding the *intent* of this particular ""censorship"" and of antiracism in general - it's not just about the words, or about censoring them.

And can I just say that I'm not posting here looking for debate. I hope I won't get replies trying to ""prove me wrong"" because that's not what I'm about - it's black people and minorities that have told us how they feel about this, so I just try to have consideration for how they feel about this (or how some of them feel, at least).",0,1359239445,null,0,false,0,c844jof,t3_17bdm3,t1_c844jof,t1_c83xoqh,null,1431088454,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Despite the fact the jails are full to overflowing and we're imprisoning the most people in Europe - following the US lead

The public do keep calling for more and longer sentences though, and a good deal of the problem is the fact that the British view prisons as punishment, not a chance for rehabilitation. And even if you do turn over a new leaf in prison, society will penalize you for life if you have been in prison. Then factor in the education system which allows a substantial amount of people to ""progress"" through it without basic literacy let alone qualifications. 

So we have a situation where someone can have a bad childhood and fuck up school, only to leave at 16 with a level of literacy that makes reading a McDonalds menu hard. They can't work because all the manual labor jobs went overseas or are done by far more capable immigrants (who are used to hard work, something a 16yr old who spent the last decade doing fuck all at school isn't used to). So they drift into minor crime, get a few convictions and spend a bit of time in prison, and now they are completely unemployable. Add in drugs and drinking, and you have a situation where all they will do is go in an out of prison.

So I don't think it's the evil state putting innocent people in prison thanks to a corrupt justice system that's lead to the UK jailing more than any other nation. It's a complex problem caused by multiple factors such as a poor quality education system, endemic socio-economic problems, economic changes, and a highly vindictive culture, all made worse because we view prisons as storage space for bad people rather than a way of using the punishment of denying someone their freedom as an opportunity to make the person into a useful member of society. 

If you wanted to reform prisons, then it would be worth looking at the Nordic systems and instituting things like a minimum level of literacy to be required before release.

Oh, and the only reason I can think of that a person would vote against the AV change is because they want our parliament to stay a two party system. A system where the vast majority of people vote party x because they are too afraid that party y will get in to power if they don't vote x. It doesn't even matter what party w, z, q have to bring to the table, the voters just know that party y is popular enough to win if they don't vote x. So they vote x. Or even worse, they just don't want people who would want to vote for other parties to be able to vote for them in a manner that doesn't bring in to effect this intelligent voting.

You can pretty much guarantee most other drugs (including alcohol) you could not consume as the same frequency that a 'proper' smoker does and not be in a mess.

JM has played as a midfield pair with Leadbitter who is a  similar kind of player to JM but wins a few more tackles. This system is much more similar to a 442 or 4231. 

I'd agree that KDB does support the midfield very well. He gets a lot of touches, runs box to box, and has good distribution. You could definitely compare him to Lampard. My point was that we don't need another Lampard. We need a Modric, Allen or Moutinho type. I find that McEachran is less developed than KDB but more so in the mould of a Modric.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; In living memory Germans were bombing the streets of London! In living memory! To state that those who lived through those times should adhere to a new social protocol is hardly considerate, surely? But now we should prioritise new residents of the country over those with far more historical attachment to the country?

Yes, I absolutely agree with you.

I've found myself in this weird middle ground recently, because I've started to become more aware of this stuff, and finding myself thinking ""well, I suppose feminists do have a bit of a point, when you put it like that"". And yet at the same time my background is very much white British - I can count on one hand the kids I knew who were minorities, even by the time I was 19 or 20 - and I value British culture. I'm probably attached to the way I perceive England.

But I don't know saying ""ouch! blimey! you can't say that, dad"" - which is something I probably have said on occasion - isn't the same as prioritising others over the older generation.

I think we can overlook it if a man (like my father) of 75 says something ""politically incorrect"" and just shrug it off because not only were things different in his day, but also because it's too late to teach the dog new tricks. I think it's futile to get angry or pissed off with him, although I probably will try to make the effort to explain patiently, if he says ""well, why can't I say that?"" I won't get mad if he doesn't accept what I say or wishes to ""disagree"" with me.

All this, I don't know that it's such a sacrifice to the older generation to have one or two jokes cut from an old comedy film.

What I do think is problematic is a younger man, like this journalist, using a platform like the Telegraph to dismiss racial awareness and ""political correctness"" (which is just a term to describe being considerate in a particular technical way). I think someone of his generation probably should be more capable of this kind of consideration, and of saying ""I'm not an expert on racism, so I'll leave it to the experts"". When he complains on his Twitter feed, as he does today, about the new Dambusters movie renaming the dog, he appears to have a slightly unhealthy desire to air bad words.

I'm going to cut this reply, because I could keep writing all night. It's a pleasure to exchange views with someone here on reddit who isn't out to prove a point, but I want to have a blast on the PS3 before I sleep.

The last thing I will say (tonight, although I might be glad to resume this discussion later) is that some of Frankie Boyle's jokes are made at the expense of other people and groups who are victims of circumstances beyond their control (or who may be marginalised in society). 

Whether one is disabled, suffering from mental illness or simply too unattractive to meet Mr Boyle's romantic ideals - none of those are things that one chooses, and I think it's valuable to consider whether the challenges those people face are comparable with those who are gingers or left-handed. I think the better comedian uses himself as the ""victim"" of his humour - ""I'm a fat bastard me, but I don't let it get me down. I still smoke 20 a day and manage my fried breakfast.""",0,1359246222,null,0,false,0,c846bki,t3_17bdm3,t1_c846bki,t1_c844nl2,null,1431089444,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"OK, I'll try to be concise.

BP is actually 2 companies *(it's more complex than that, it's actually many more, but pretend 2 for now)*. BP is BP Exploration and BP Sales.

BP Exploration is the people who actually discover the oil reserves, get the oil out of the ground, refine the oil and then ship it around the world.

BP Sales is the people who own the gas stations (petrol forecourts) and actually sell the petrol.

BP Exploration sells the petrol / diesel to BP Sales at the same price that BP Sales sells it to you for, meaning BP Sales makes **no profit** and pays very little tax (other than consumption tax).

Just to kick the taxpayer in the teeth, BP Exploration even though it technically owns BP sales through foreign parent companies actually then charges BP sales a ""name license fee"" of several billion per year, just for using the BP brand name, so it even looks like BP sales is constantly making a loss, so there's definitely no worry of ever having to pay tax. Infact sometimes they can even get money back from the government! This is like wearing two condoms just incase.

This same model applies to how Starbucks works, and why it looks on paper like Starbucks is making a loss, but actually it's making massive profits in the UK, but paying Starbucks Belgium more for it's ""brand license"" than it makes in profit, so it always looks like it's making a loss when it isn't really.

Many thousands of big businesses do this. It's perfectly legal, and to make things worse they have a **legal obligation** to do this because by law a business has to do the best for it's shareholders.

It is about adventure, the unknown, friendship, love, family, and living life. It is about forgiveness and tolerance and courage and strength. The Doctor is kind of a mystery. He is the best kind of hero-- he is intelligent and kind. He stands up to the most aggressive of enemies and never uses a weapon. He is truly good and gives every one that chance to do the right thing. He does what is needed to makes things right, even if it is a hard choice. And he battles with the pain of making those hard choices. He is fierce and loyal. He lies. But when it comes down to it, he is just a mad man with a box.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; My own view is that it is differences in car culture, not parenting culture, that are key – as I have argued before. Many German cities have efficient public transport and safe, popular walking and cycling routes, along with generous, well-managed green spaces. Take for example Vauban, a new neighbourhood in the Southern German city of Freiburg, which I visited in 2005. The housing, road network and parks and open spaces are thoughtfully laid out, so that almost all homes look out on some attractive public green space. Cars are parked away from houses and apartments, while an efficient tram system means fewer families feel the need to own a car at all. The front streets are designed along ‘home zone’ lines to be sociable spaces where the car driver is a guest. It is no wonder that families are queuing up to live in the area.

Absolutely agree with this. City planning needs far greater prominence in Britain, we are absolutely expert at creating grim suburban estates with nowhere to go and no way to get there.

I also wonder what effect autonomous cars might have on this. As a parent, you could say that a child can have a card which allows them to take certain routes, or to go anywhere within 20 miles of the home. It would make it much easier for kids to meet up with friends, and independently get to parks, sports centres, and other places.",0,1359250685,null,0,false,0,c847hk4,t3_17c7s0,t1_c847hk4,t3_17c7s0,null,1431089995,25,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,25

You'll need to obtain an application form from the relevant dept. at your local council, you'll also have to visit a Solicitor and take an oath, declaring that you haven't got any previous ""form"" (or declare any that you may have)

If you're going to be using your own car, you'll need to have a meter and a radio + aerial fitted by a specialist firm (at your expense). I don't remember about the meter (you may have to provide it yourself), but the radio is owned and provided by the taxi company (as it has to be on their frequency) and you pay weekly ""rent"" for it.


Then, you have to take the car to be tested by an inspector from the local council, almost like an MOT (even if the car is brand new). You will also be given a driving test, during which, the inspector will ask you to take him the shortest route from point A to point B. He'll also check the meter at this time, to make sure it's registering the correct Tarriff for the individual firm you'll be working for. If all goes well, he'll give you a licence (12 months, I think) and your vehicle plates.

You'll probably find that your insurance will rocket too, I know mine did, and also your car's going to need servicing a lot more frequently due to the significantly increased mileage.

Also, it's *very* competitive, especially at first when the dispatcher calls out an address that you're not sure of, by the time you've thumbed through your map book to figure out where the fuck Acacia Avenue is, another 2 or 3 far more experienced drivers will already have responded and you've lost out :( It's dog eat dog, every man for himself.

And as for the hours you'll be working, well that's up to you, the more you put in, the more you'll earn.

So, that's about all I can tell you, I hope I haven't discouraged you in any way, but there is quite a bit of financial layout before you even get started.
 
I was pretty naive, I thought it was just a case of jumping in a car and earning loads of easy money, but it didn't work out that way for me. I only lasted 3 months and earned significantly less, and put up with far more stress, than I would have at my usual job (bricklaying)

So, I would check with your local council, check with your insurance company/broker, check with the taxi company to find out the score with the meter and radio, and see what you think...

Sorry for my long-winded answer, but maybe I've answered a few questions for you :)

A [good article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4357383.stm) explaining what academies are and the costs.  [Salaries in academies](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/nov/14/academies-pay-200k-salaries). [Academies expel far more pupils](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6897429.stm).

&gt; ""It has been the case for the last seven or eight years and so it will be going forward. It is clearly a part of the programme that academies should have autonomy over their admissions,"" Mr Groves said. ""Obviously, the Government does need to be careful and monitor admissions. But I would certainly not advocate a central body to oversee admissions.""

Science fiction used to be a place inhabited by H.G. Wells, Ray Bradybury and Isaac Asimov. Real, legitimate authors threw their hat into the Sci-Fi ring when they got a chance.

Then Russel T. Davies comes along and does stuff to make Doctor Who a *Saturday Evening Family Entertainment* show and, of course, includes things like SuperNanny and Robot-Anne-Robinson hosting 51st-Century-Weakest-Link.

Steven Moffat isn't writing *Saturday Evening Family Entertainment* because he knows people who want that shite can turn over to *Ant and Dec*. He's writing *Science Fiction*.

What I think should happen is something bigger than anything that's ever happened in the show. I'm not sure what happens, but the ending should be like this. During the beginning of the penultimate season they find another Time Lord who also managed to escape the Time War just like the Doctor. He's young, only in his first or second regeneration, and he travels the universe in a Tardis, but more of as an explorer than a hero. The Doctor and his companion meet this other Time Lord (let's call him the Professor) throughout the last two seasons. So jump to the series finale. The Doctor faces the biggest challenge in his life. He can't defeat whatever it is alone, so he calls on all of his friends and companions (including the Professor), similar to the episode ""A Good Man Goes To War"". A monstrous battle takes place, and a great many lives are lost. The Doctor and his team manage to defeat the enemy leader, but the Doctor is mortally wounded. Assuming he's the 13th and he follows a normal Time Lord life cycle, he can't regenerate. As he's dying, they should have a scene similar to the part in the final Harry Potter book where Harry talks to Dumbledore for the final time at King's Cross. The Doctor meets all of his former regenerations during this sort of dream sequence (1-8 obviously played by lookalike actors, 9-12 would most likely still be around). They all talk briefly about the Doctor's long life and all the amazing things he's done. It fades from this back to reality, just as the Doctor takes his final breath. Everyone who knows him is obviously devestated. This is where the Professor comes in. He feels it his duty as the last Time Lord to take on the title of the Doctor and protect the universe, just as the original Doctor did. Later on there is a monumental funeral for the Doctor. Everyone from every corner of the universe who knew and loved him come to say goodbye. They hold the funeral in the area of space where Gallifrey used to be, and they cremate the Doctor Time Lord fashion. Afterwards the new Doctor begins his journey using the original Doctor's Tardis (the other Tardis was destroyed far beyond repair during the battle). He steps into the Tardis and closes the door behind him, leaving an exterior shot of it. The Tardis begins to leave with it's famous sound, then the screen goes black and the credits roll. Maybe afterwards they begin a new Doctor Who show, but maybe they just end it there. *That* is how I imagine the series ends.",0,1359256590,null,0,false,0,c8491dc,t3_17cjyj,t1_c8491dc,t3_17cjyj,null,1431090820,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

All arguments to restrict the use of guns for self-defense rely on an assumption that government will function as a police force to protect people.  If you cannot trust the cops to keep haters from burning your house down -- and few would say that African Americans in the Jim Crow South should have trusted them -- you have a moral right to use the threat of deadly force that a gun embodies to deter the would-be attackers.

People have the moral right to self-defense.  Theoretically, it is okay for a community to decide that they want to voluntarily disarm and hand the self-defense function over to a government police force.  But this presupposes that the police force is effective and not corrupt.

OK, I admit, there's a certain amount of stress in not losing a small fortune, but almost all of this can be outsourced to professionals if your fortune is large enough, and that's how most of the very wealthy do it.  Likewise, there may be work involved if you're managing your own  individual buy-to-let, but once you become a serious player, all of this can be outsourced to property managers, letting agents and so on.  Investments, to brokers, portfolio managers, etc. (and since the market outperforms the vast majority of fund managers, it's usually better just to buy the market, with a bit of balance for whichever part of the business cycle it is).

We're still top five in goals scored despite the missed chances. I'm not worried about scoring goals, because we'll get them regardless of whether Defoe, Ade, or a new striker is up front. 

A striker would be nice, but Joao Moutinho would make us infinitely better than any one striker would. He's the type of player that can dominate a game single handedly in midfield, and break down the small teams that park the bus. That's where the points are, against those small teams. If we had someone to keep the ball moving, to dominate a game on the ball and break down the teams that wont attack us, we'll eventually score. Because lets face it, we have trouble scoring against those types of teams. Against Stoke and Reading, we created few chances. Sure, maybe we should've scored one, but who says that the new striker would've put them away. Moutinho would've helped us create those extra chances to put away the goals vs. those teams.

Then vs City, we were dominated chance wise. I just looked it up and it was 10-3 in favor of city. They completely dominated the second half as well. David Silva bossed the midfield and flipped a brilliant pass over our defenders to create the winner. If we had Joao Moutinho, that game may have been different. He could've slowed the game down, keep the ball moving and retain possession. A striker wouldn't have helped at all.

We create chances and are terrible at converting them. So you want to drop a huge chunk of change, to create MORE chances (not a bad thing at all) which we will struggle to convert and still lose those games.

If we're to spend that sort of money, I'd rather get someone who's going to do something with those chances, rather than get someone who's just going to create even more chances for JD and Ade to waste.

We have ONE striker (and Adebayor), the closest thing we have to a second striker is Dempsey, and while I rate the guy, he's no number 9.

I really hope you decide to wake up for the match (not to question your fandom or anything mate, but Spurs &gt; Sleep). I could go on a rant about the cerebral nature of support in spirit but absence in physical presence as applied to our intersubjective relationship with our lads, but instead I'll just appeal to the football fan in you:  

Spurs football is a pleasure to watch, an experience much like a rollercoaster... sometimes leaving you immensely satisfied, sometimes leaving you sick to your stomach; but, to dare is to do and tis better to experience rather than to bereave yourself of potential glory or hardship by absolution of the moment. You could say that this is merely the 4th round of the FA cup against a Leeds side sitting 11th in the Championship, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not remembering the history of this particular matchup. We play to win, we play for glory; our temper is short but out memories are long.

Henderson will continue to improve and shape matches by getting forward.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If we use strict sense of fail (not breaking into the first team, being at the peak years), none of these players fall into that group. However if we use fail as failure to meet the price tag, then you can remove the likes of Sturridge, Allen and Assaidi as one is cheap and 2 have broken into the first team. Also none of them have reached their peak and so there is a lot of room to improve.

Then we have Cou and Borini, both bought around 10m area, ability wise, they are around that area. However they must be able to apply it on field and IMO unless we sign another striker I can see Borini growing into his role with time as he is only 21. That leaves Cou, which we have no measure of.

I agree with you, I remember the summer before last that I told a friend that we couldn't expect all the players to adapt. Sadly from the whole of 2011 only Suarez and recently Henderson can be classed as not failure. Downing for all of his improvements will likely never be a 20m player, he was at his peak when we got him and it was wasted. Hendo has shown good signs and is easily worth 10mill if he could bring the quality he has shown last few weeks for the rest of the season.

One thing that differentiates us is the fact that you see Enrique, Downing and Henderson improving due to both squad rotation based on performance and that we are system based. Obviously Suarez is his own outlier, but the rest fall into a structure in which players can be moved in and out. Downing isn't told to score goals like a classic winger, but to provide width and pass/cross. Henderson isn't classic nr 10 that scores a lot of goals, he passes and pulls players. City are comparable to QPR, but players without considering your system, funny thing they had the same manager through those early rebuilding phase. If we were like them we would have bought players on availability and reputation.

I agree with you that we should take one step at a time, but we are Liverpool. There is always optimist at every little bright spot. ",0,1359266983,null,0,false,0,c84bkro,t3_17bx36,t1_c84bkro,t1_c84a6i5,null,1431092617,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Doctor Who ran from 1963-1989 then rebooted in 2005. But don't start at 1963 unless you have experience with old black and white tv. You should choose between 2005 reluanch and 2010 when the new writer, Doctor, and companions took over. It felt very much like a re-relaunch.

Pros of 2005: you get to see more Doctors, more adventures, companions, etc. You won't miss out on it by skipping it. No prior info needed to watch here

Cons: It's a bit cheesy and the writing needs some forgiveness the first two series. The show still shines though.

2010 Pros: Great writing, shiny new everything, same awesomeness that DW always has, fresh start, no prior info needed

Cons: You miss out on 2005-2009. You won't get to experience the show chronologically and see how things change and develop. You'll get spoiled by the special effects.

Even with these pros and cons, if you choose 2010 you should go back afterwards to 2005 and up. While the writing and effects may not be as shiny, there are still wonderful heartbreaking stories here, and both Doctors absolutely shine. Many people went on Who-hiatus because they thought the new guy wouldn't live up to the 10th Doctor. The ninth only has one series with some questionable writing, but he's a fantastic Doctor as well, and shines when given the chance. No matter what you do, watch all seven series.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;It's perfectly legal, and to make things worse they have a legal obligation to do this because by law a business has to do the best for it's shareholders.

This oft repeated self-serving justification is actually only - at best - partially true, at least in the UK since 2006.  Here are the current legal duties of the Board to ""promote the success of the company"" according to s172 of the Companies Act 2006:

&gt;Duty to promote the success of the company

&gt;(1)  A director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to—  

&gt;(a) the likely consequences of any decision **in the long term**,  
&gt;(b) the interests of the company's employees,  
&gt;(c) **the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others**,  
&gt;(d) **the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment,**  
&gt;(e) the desirability of the company **maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct**, and  
&gt;(f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company.  


&gt;(2) Where or to the extent that the purposes of the company consist of or include purposes other than the benefit of its members, subsection (1) has effect as if the reference to promoting the success of the company for the benefit of its members were to achieving those purposes.


&gt;(3) The duty imposed by this section has effect subject to any enactment or rule of law requiring directors, in certain circumstances, to consider or act in the interests of creditors of the company.

The only arse-covering that amoral Directors get there is subsection 3.  The text highlighted in black could be used by any ethical Board to justify paying all valid local taxes within the spirit of the law (particularly if, like Starbucks, their ethics are supposed to be part of their brand value).",0,1359271976,null,0,1359276510,0,c84ck9o,t3_17c65o,t1_c84ck9o,t1_c846h3r,null,1431093984,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

I live in a city where it's impossible to get around without a car, half the year it snows up to my ankles, the culture here is terribly American but to be fair it makes perfect sense why. I clearly don't want to stay here or go to America and the UK is such an obvious choice and I love it to boot. Britain to me is in everyway favorable and I take much quicker to English culture than Amero-Canadian culture. I mean it will have good and bad but I fail to see how it could disappoint.

Edit: I know it seems I'm using British and English fairly interchangeably but I'm referring to each specifically really although I am using British and UK that way because it's difficult to refer to the entire country and I'm pretty much excluding Northern Ireland in my mind and Britain isn't a proper country on it's own.

Merlin: Is there anything you need?
ARTHUR: How can I love someone who's betrayed me? It doesn't make any sense. And how can I make myself love another? Tell me that.

ARTHUR: What should I do, Merlin?

&gt;I was very struck by this sentence from Ward:

&gt;‘It appears that the suffering by the Jews has not transformed their views on how others should be treated.’

&gt;Eh?

&gt;This can only logically mean either  
a) That prior to the Holocaust the Jews had distinctively extra-deplorable views on how others should be treated and despite the experience of the Holocaust failed to learn their lesson and reform themselves morally and act decent like anyone else.
or  
b) (more of an interpretative stretch, alas), that prior to the Holocaust the Jews had no specially distinctive views on how others should be treated, but having experienced the Holocaust they ought to have acquired much more saintly views than anyone else and can be sanctimoniously attacked for not having done so by others still only averagely moral.

&gt;a) is utterly appalling.

&gt;b) is distastefully absurd and unpleasant.

&gt;Sure, Ward would say that he meant neither a) nor b), but no other meanings could be attached to his words, so if he didn't mean a) or b) what the fuck did he think he meant and will he admit to cognitive disability in not understanding what he himeself says?

and the closing remarks of the article too

&gt; I think MPs such as David Ward might want to remember that the Holocaust wasn’t some kind of cathartic communal learning experience nor was it the great event that allowed us to get our own country, the Holocaust was systematic death, nothing to do with Israel, nothing to do with Palestine everything to do with Jews and certainly not an excuse for him, or anyone else to label us all as Nazis.",0,1359283876,null,0,false,0,c84e3d6,t3_17cfq6,t1_c84e3d6,t1_c84dp1c,null,1431095478,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Head-to-head**

•	Tottenham have won 36 of 96 previous meetings with **Leeds**, who have prevailed in 31.

•	Their most recent contests have been in the FA Cup, where Tottenham lead 4-1, knocking out their **Yorkshire** opponents after a fifth round replay in 1999 and a fourth round replay in 2010.

•	**Leeds'** only success in the competition was a 2-1 victory in the 1972 quarter-finals on the way to winning the silverware for the only time in their history.

**Leeds United**

•	If Leeds can avoid being knocked out by one of the two north London giants for the first time in four seasons, they will be on their best run in the FA Cup for a decade.

•	The last time the Elland Road club won an FA Cup tie, prior to the victory over Birmingham in this season's third round, was against Manchester United in the third round three years ago, when Jermaine Beckford famously scored the only goal of the tie at Old Trafford.

•	That is the only occasion the Whites have knocked out a top-flight club since Arsenal in February 1997, when Leeds also held Premier 
League status.

**Tottenham Hotspur**

•	Only Manchester United and Arsenal have won the FA Cup more often than Tottenham's eight, but they have not lifted the trophy since 1991 despite being semi-finalists in two of the last three seasons.

•	Spurs have also been fourth round victims in three of the last five years, but have only lost one of their last 18 against second level league clubs; Leicester won 3-2 in the third round at the Walkers Stadium in January 2006.

•	The 3-0 victory over League One Coventry in this season's third round was Spurs' 29th triumph in 30 ties against lower league clubs.",0,1359291355,null,0,false,0,c84eszd,t3_17d7r2,t1_c84eszd,t3_17d7r2,null,1431095850,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

If you refuse to have Sky (there are quite a few legitimate reasons but that's a whole new topic) then there is the cheaper ESPN but it has relatively few games. If you want free-to-air games on Freeview (free to watch) there are practically none apart from a couple of FA Cup games.

There are more games on the radio that are free to listen to if that's your thing. In this redditor's opinion the radio is better than the TV because having the picture encourages TV commentators to be lazier in their description. Plus local radio commentators are always hilarious to listen to because of local sayings and them making no attempt to hide their bias.

When the trains break down or when people need lifts from airports is where you make a lot of money, so learn the routes and accept those jobs from the company. Sitting on a station rank you'll likely do local jobs (£4 fare) and unless you get them all day it might not be cost effective. You can never know how much money you'll earn, sometimes only £10 in an entire day and sometimes random jobs where you'll earn £500 in a day.

putting on azpilicueta wasn't retarded like most of you are making out either, considering he was putting on ba like a minute later, he warmed up azpilicueta to be able to put crosses into the box, which basically wasn't happening very often, nor with quality all game.

People who are calling for more state regulation would do well to reflect on the fact that the UK state spends 50% of GDP and that has to come from the same workers who pay the tax. The state giveth and the state taketh and we all end up poorer (except the politicians).

IMHO the problem is social mobility in the UK has ground to a halt. People are looking to bet big because the normal routes out of poverty are blocked. So the young poor end up idolising tv talent singers and footballers as they are the only people who made it out, even if only one in one thousand makes it, it's better odds than the people who tried to do well on the minimum wage.

Consequently the CC are probably well within their rights to sack teachers for doing/being things they don't like. Attempts have been made to close these loopholes but so far have been blocked. For example [a little over a year ago](http://www.secularism.org.uk/teacher-discrimination-challenge.html), amendments to the Education bill were proposed that would have prevented (state funded at least) 'faith schools' from dismissing/not-employing a teacher based on their sexuality and what not. The Bishop of Oxford said (paraphrased): ""Its unthinkable that a school would discriminate in that way!"" but still voted against the amendments because... 'It's nice to have the option'? I think we can guess why.

TL;DR - They can often do as they want because, even though they're funded by the frickin' tax payer, they still claim that religiously motivated bigotry isn't really.

Another explanation I've heard is that the third kit can also be a ""Euro away kit"", meaning we use that when playing away in continental tournaments. 

Then again, we have used our third kit this season without the home OR the away kit clashing (like away at Norwich - we used our third kit, and Norwich play in yellow and green, not exactly a clash with red or black).

The back line has looked shaky, BAE going forward has looked good, though the last 15 minutes I didn't see too much of that. Our midfield has not been good. Huddlestone gets it and either passes it to Parker or to the back line with the occasional long ball, that hasn't worked out too much this game. Parker gets the ball and just drives it forward, has had some good passes, but he also kinda has put us in positions where its either a goal or nothing type situation. We haven't had any time just recycling possession in front of the Leeds goal, probing for a way in. Lennon and Bale haven't looked bad, but they haven't had the ball near enough, and their service hasn't been good when they've had the chance. Siggurdson hasn't really impressed me yet this game, but he is working hard. Dempsey has had a few shots on target from some half chances, but hasn't been able to make something special happen. One more step back and I think he puts that header off the corner in. The rest of the chances were a bit more difficult and would have taken some luck. 

Leeds has been working hard and defending really well. Our players haven't been getting too much space anywhere in their third for the most part.

What you don't see is the guy kicking off in the first place, once he's brought back into the store. He then tries to make a break for it and get away which is why he was pushed to the floor. The first employee was helping restrain him, and the kid sank his teeth into the guard's arm. Not just a little bite, but went right through the guard's shirt and deep into his arm. He needed to go to a hospital and get stitches afterwards. By this point, the store had called other male staff down to help restrain him, and the kid also managed to boot a guy in the face and spit blood at people too. He was not going to go quietly.

Granted the guard shouldn't have restrained him by the throat, and the bystander who comes over showed the guard that the guy couldn't breathe, and restrained him in a better way. The guard has since been taken out of the store and replaced, but the kid was not a helpless victim like this video seems him to be. It took 5 people to pin him down because he was resorting to violence to get away with it. They don't call down employees to help for nothing. I'm sure the kid has learnt his lesson, but he still shouldn't resort to stealing.

Saying this, I feel we have a much better shot at progressing further in the Europa league as opposed to the F.A. Cup.

true,veridical,num2,,"I'm too upset right now to be really detailed but mostly it was just pretty bad. Vertonghen and Caulker really didn't work as a pair and Naughton was poor as well. 

Huddlestone showed his passing range but unfortunately no accuracy at all. Dembélé came on for him and was poor - made a number of mistakes in passing, tackling and positioning.

Benny was pretty decent, should have been awarded a couple more fouls, and Bale was genuinely good in the second half. His dribbling especially was impressive, and his skin-and-cross for Dempsey was excellent. Our MoTM for sure.

Both of the Leeds goals were due to crap defensive positioning on our part. Caulker got caught upfield far too often and Vertonghen just had a bit of an off game. Naughton looked better offensively than at LB but his defending was also pretty crap. Walker was an improvement when he came on, and contributed to the attack without leaving quite so many gaps.

Dempsey wasn't decent, and obviously got the goal, but passed up a few half-chances. He looked more productive in midfield after Obika was brought on. Lennon was alright by his current standard, some nice runs but only had two good crosses if my memory serves.

Siggy was pretty anonymous to be honest. Had a few decent moves but really didn't see much of the ball. Obika was much the same, but our attacking got increasingly direct in the last 15 minutes so it was a bit of a free-for-all anyway.

Parker played ok-ish. Was probably our best player in defence, but was getting visibly agitated by Michael Brown, losing some composure towards the end - his passing was not great.

All in all, not a good performance. I was living in hope right up to the whistle - we got upfield often and controlled the game for long periods - but our defending was actually shocking and the final product in attack was not really up to scratch. If we played like that every week we'd be mid table at best.

That's all I've got right now. I think that covers everyone. I will now resume lying face down and weeping quietly.

""It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory."" -Bill Nicholson

Surprisingly, the Europa League and Champions League are the general downfall of clubs who are in and out of those competitions, such as our situation.  The two contain the biggest hurdles as far as extra matches are concerned (midweek, thursdays, long travel, etc.).

Comparatively, the FA Cup designates weekends for rounds to take place of league matches, up until the 6th round when there's no point at shutting out a league schedule with so few teams in the competition.  This allows for a manager to rotate a squad accordingly.

I will concede that our squad is stretched fairly thin at the moment due to injury or apparent illness (Defoe?).  However, focusing on a lack of squad depth for quickly shaking off, almost scoffing at a competition almost old as the game itself, and one in which Spurs have the richest history, is kinda sad.

by quoting someone else i vaguely see your point but considering your own complaints a couple of posts above why don't you articulate your argument? 

for me- yay we lost to leeds it's good we aren't in as many competitions i disagree with. it's embarrasing- we should not be losing to leeds period. while i see your argument about squad depth, it's equally valid to argue that the europa league has over double the amount of games an fa cup would've. money is one thing but you could also argue that not playing in either europa or fa cup and qualifying for the champions league would net more income. 

i don't want to ramble but i've been viewing this reddit for a long time without commenting much. i think a lot of people pat eachother on the back but in reality- there's not much option for dissent, if someone disagrees with a regular poster they're immediately called upon and that isn't good.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"Urgh, this is ridiculous. I love our culture, I am extremely proud of most of it, I want immigrants to be able to share in it and contribute to it. 

BUT I don't think a freshie arriving here needs to know about the intricacies of 1970s sitcoms, the 'mundane' stuff, how to pay a utility bill, how to apply for a benefit, how to find translation services and English language lessons, how to register with a GP, how to open a bank account is really bloody important. Try doing any of this stuff in a country where you don't understand fully the language or customs and it can be a nightmare. 

Not only do I think immigrants should be taught this stuff, I think every kid in a British school should be given a basic grounding, it would save the citizens advice bureau a lot of hassle. Simple things like 'don't rent a flat without reading and signing a tenancy agreement.' 'If your doctor is busy you can use an NHS walk in centre for minor ailments and referrals' - that stuff is obvious if you know it, but if you don't it's not. It doesn't need to take up any time in the curriculum either, teachers could easily cover stuff within tutor time or assembly, 5 mins a day on how to be a functional adult. Hell, thanks to my GCSE English teacher I can tell you more about divorce law than I can about Shakespeare, but I still got very good grades. 

 
If you want immigrants to assimilate culturally you don't have to ram dated popular culture and Whig history down their throats, give them access to decent English language lessons and an inclusive environment and they will assimilate themselves as people having been doing in these Islands since always.

There could be an argument made - like you say - that cutting corporation tax would promote growth and investment, but I think it's more likely that the money would be returned to shareholders rather than re-invested. It might be an idea to offer a special investment tax break whereby money spent on premises, plant, employee training etc could be offset against Corporation Tax although companies can already offset their expenses against their tax obligations.

I agree totally - a *reasonable* disinterest. When something noteworthy occurs, they, like ourselves in any other part of the UK, will then express a *reasonable* interest. It would be interesting to see the BBCNI viewing figures before people go deriding levels of interest elsewhere...

This option would not be available to an independent chain because they don't have a Swiss operation.

In terms of it being legal, has that ever been tested?

Games against weaker opposition, you can't let them get the advantage, because they shut up shop. From 3-1 the game was done.

Brad Jones did do a really bad job of holding onto the ball, but it is only one error, criticizing him further will only undermine his confidence and stress him out. 

Once Gerrard came in, he established a more solid possessive team, the one we all care and adore. He linked good intricate passes to team mates and generally controlled the tempo of the game.  I believe that Suarez and Sturridge were isolated, not sure about those two. Perhaps they are just diverting themselves from injuries.

I understand Rodgers has to fit these young lads in at some point, and on paper, a cup tie against a League 1 side seems the perfect opportunity.  But don't play all (well, most) of them all at once.  Even Chelsea today played a lot of their established players (Ivanovic, Torres, Cahill, Terry, etc).  I don't know how he expected the team he put out there to put in a decent performance if half of them haven't played together all season.

On the other hand, the players are professional, Premiership footballers.  Even the younger ones are supposedly considered Premiership material (eventually).  They should put up a better fight than they actually did.  I think that's fair to say.  But I think today has pointed out that some of our younger fringe players need a severe talking to and change in attitude.  I was gobsmacked at Robinson.  You don't talk to a senior player like that, esp one as important to us as Suarez and one who would've definitely had a better chance of scoring.  Shouldn't have taken the shot in the first place, but I understand why he did.  He should not have reacted that way though.  Hope Rodgers addresses this.

In order to attain outstanding, roughly 95% of students must be making rapid progress. In many boroughs (Haringey especially, with bullshit resources and funding), this is literally impossible.

I have 1 teaching assistant, devoted solely to the pupil with Down's. It's unrealistic to expect these kids to be making rapid progress.

true,d4w50n,null,null,"OK, I'm off shift now, so I'll give you as much info as I can off the top of my head, if I miss anything out, please ask, and I'll answer if I have the info.

* There is a difference between taxis and minicabs. Taxis are typically ""black cabs"" that you can flag down in the street. Minicabs are booked privately, by phoning the taxi office, and generally speaking, cannot be flagged down. If you own your own car, it will be minicab driving that you're going to do (however, for simplicities sake, I'll refer to minicabs as taxis from now on, makes it easier to read)
* To be a taxi driver, you need a taxi driver license, and your car needs a taxi license (known as a ""plate""). Both of which are issued through your local council.
* Most councils limit what sorts of cars they will let be taxis. There are typically restrictions on age (my council will not let you ""plate"" any car over 6 years old, but once the car has been plated, you can re-plate it until it is 16 years old) as well as size (my council will not let you plate any small car, the smallest you can plate is a Skoda Octavia) and seat combinations (some councils are funny about 7 seaters, they do not like that people have to ""climb over"" the seats to get to the 7th seat at the back)
* Once you've plated your car, you need taxi insurance. Some operators will let you put your car on their policy for a weekly fee, others won't. Be warned, this is expensive, but depends a lot on where you want to work. Birmingham city centre taxi drivers can expect to pay anywhere between 6,000 to 12,000 annually, whereas in my county, anything over 2,500 is considered expensive
* To get your taxi drivers license, you'll typically need a CRB check, a medical, a statutory declaration signed by a solicitor, and you will have to sit a regional knowledge test, which tests your knowledge of the local area, which is normally routes and landmarks within your councils boundaries. You need to know about places in the whole of your councils boundaries, and not just the town you want to work in
* If you get your taxi drivers license, but your car isn't up to requirements to be plated, do not worry, most companies will allow you rent a taxi from then, for a weekly fee, and the beauty of this is that they will be responsible for the maintenance of the car, and in many cases the insurance too (but it is up to you to pay for your own diesel). If the taxi firm does not have any cars to rent to you, I guarantee they will have details of a company who provides these services.
* so now you have a car and you want to be a driver, what next? Well the company you want to work for will charge you a weekly fee to work for them, this is known as ""settle"". Anything you earn over your settle (and the cost of renting a car and insuring it) is yours to keep. Including tips.
* the cost of settle varies greatly from firm to firm, but my costs are broken down into 95.00 per week for settle, and my insurance and car payments come out of my bank, as I pay for these myself, I do not rent a car. In my company, to rent a car, it costs 240.00 a week, but this is fully inclusive of settle, insurance, and the cost of the car, as well as the maintenance of it (including tyres and bulbs).
* I think you are better off owning rather than renting, but this is purely my opinion, other peoples may vary
* To get started, you may find it beneficial to rent a car from the taxi company for a few months, and save up to buy your own car, so that for the first couple of months, you can get settled into the job without worrying about the running of your car.
* taxi companies that promise you pots of gold if you work for them generally will not deliver. They will be quiet companies who take on as many drivers as they can so that the owners have lots of people paying them settle. To find out the best company to work for, the council will be able to tell you which company is the biggest and busiest. Go with the busiest you can.
* to get started, phone your local council, and ask for the licensing department, who will give you everything you need to apply, but bear in mind the application process can take a couple of months
* Should you go minicab or black cab? I think there's more money in minicabs than black cabs. Plus minicabs are cheaper to buy (they're just standard cars), and cheaper to insure. And they get a lot more to the gallon.
*Be prepared to work long hours to make the job pay good money. You have to earn a LOT before any money is yours to take away.
* On the plus side, you have a constant trickle of cash coming in. you're never more than a couple of hours away from a ""pay day"". You won't be rich, but you'll never be skint.
* You'll need to register as self employed with the tax man, but if you do your own books, remember, EVERYTHING is an expense that you can count against your earnings to pay less tax. your settle, insurance, diesel, etc are all deductable against your tax bill, you only pay tax on whats left over after the expenses for your car and being a taxi driver.
* talk to everyone who gets into your car, you'll meet all sorts of passengers. You'll meet mechanics who can help fix your car on the cheap, tax advisors to make sure everything is right in your tax return, people who are selling stuff you want to buy, and people who are looking for stuff you've got for sale. Got a couch for sale? advertise it inside your car, you'r getting upwards of 100 people in your car a day who will see the advert, and may know someone who wants to buy one.
* what car should you use for a taxi? There's loads of good choices out there. get the car on hire purchase. You can take the car back halfway though the finance term, and owe nothing on it. This means you can have a £12,000 car for 2 and a half years, and pay only £6,000 overall (if you get it over a 5 year finance agreement). Very affordable way to keep getting a new car that remains under warranty
* what hours to work? there's a bit more money at night, but it is a bit more dangerous. Daytimes are safer, but a lot of the work will consist of taking the elderly to the supermarket and back home (whereby they'll take a good five minutes to load and unload your boot, with your help, and the tips will be rubbish!). And there's more traffic in the day.

true,thatbloke83,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Gambling is regulated fine as-is, as far as I can tell. There are safeguards in place for people to help them stop spending too much money. The problem is that people think they don't need them. Or they hit the limits and then just try and extend them

Gambling IS, and SHOULD BE, fun. If you find that you are gambling ""for the sake of it"" or because of some compulsion, or you find that you go somewhere (a casino, fruit machine arcade, bookies, whatever) and you start betting, and then find it difficult to stop, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

I know this because I fucked up my University life and the 3 years after it by getting addicted to gambling myself. In my case, it was fruit machines.

Anyway... The point of my post is this:

In my experience, it's easy for gambler to realise that they have a problem. The hard part is admitting that to another person(s), and then actually getting help for it.

I realised that I had a problem at least a year before I actually got help for it. In that year I gambled away a LOT of money and could have saved myself a LOT of trouble if I had have just manned the fuck up and got help sooner.

Now, I can gamble, and it's fun again... so it's not a problem.
