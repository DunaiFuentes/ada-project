The 'new suspect' isn't really new at all. You have to bear in mind that all the police have done (or indeed have been able to do) is go over the volumes of evidence provided to them by the Portuguese. This 'new suspect' was reported shortly after the disappearance by the Irish family in question. In fact, the patriarch of the family said he was '60-80% sure' that it was Gerry McCann that he saw (although McCann has around 10 witnesses placing him at the restaurant at that exact moment, and neither of the other two members of the family said it was him). All this new appeal is, is focusing on another sighting.

Agreed on the local crooks. I'm sure if you went back to the resort area and hung around long enough you'd come face to face with plenty of 'charity collections' trying to get a quick payday off British tourists.

The creche thing is a commonly repeated statement. The basis I think I read was that the creche was for kids to play around etc. whereas the McCann children were all sleepy by 7.30ish. Either way, it's something that they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.

The first was a throwback of an old villain, the Autons from the 1970's, which at the time of their creation was considered scary. This was also the first time the show had been on air since 1989 and, with a lower budget than they have now (the cgi gets much better), was trying to gain a new audience. So the new series opened with an episode that would be appropriate for a wide range of viewers, but it comes off as a bit cheesey. The show gets darker, scarier, more suspenseful, as well as funnier, and more exciting as it goes on, but the first season is really just the tip of the iceberg.

My girlriend *hated* the first episode, couldn't see why I liked the show (and I agree, that first episode is corny). She agreed to watch the next episode after a few days time, which she thought was better, and by the time we reached the middle of the first season (episode 6, ""Dalek"", specifically) she was hooked and wanted to watch episodes three at a time. And from what I've seen most of the time, this is how it is with a lot of people (both friends of mine as well as some people subscribed to this subreddit), that once they make it to the first season finale they are hooked.

Grant as The Doctor, who later played the Great Intelligence, who in ""The Name of the Doctor"" could have infected the Doctor's timeline around the time of McGann's regeneration, causing The Doctor to both look and sound like Grant/G.I. 

This ""Doctor"" wound up doing something awful, and lived long enough to age to the point of looking like John Hurt (or possibly regenerated into John Hurt, meaning *another* regeneration), and disgracing the name of the Doctor, before regenerating into Eccleston. PLUS not only does ""Scream of the Shalka"" have Richard E. Grant to tie into this theory, it also has Derek Jacobi playing The Master, who would later play The Master again in the episode ""Utopia"" to tie it in further.

That's my theory, since I was truly very surprised at the DVD release of Shalka (a story I never thought would make it to DVD).

I would not have taken issue were it not for the lack of events aimed at anyone (regardless of gender) wanting to go into the industry at such a young age in the area.  There is GameDevNorth, which is 18+ IIRC (and even that is aimed more at those already in the industry), a massive shout away from the 12+ this event is aimed at.  I know when I was 12 I would have loved to attend an event telling me how I could work in the games industry.

true,bustanuttson,null,null,"Rotation! All three are great players who excel at different things. Against teams who park the bus and we need something more offensively, I think the Henderson-Gerrard combo is the way to go. When are up in the game, Gerrard can be withdrawn for Lucas and Henderson can push forward a bit while still tracking back and Lucas can do his usual cleaning up. Against teams who will attack us, I think Hendo and Lucas will be the way to go. Hendo is more mobile than Gerrard and his energy in the middle of the park against the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea, who have two of the best midfields in the world, will be invaluable.

Against the other top teams where I believe we hold an advantage in midfield, such as United and Tottenham, Gerrard and Lucas should start. They bossed both United games this season so far, I would definitely say that the game at Anfield was our captain's best performance of the season so far, although I expect even better from him after a little rest and a run of form. He's Steven fucking Gerrard. I don't care if he's 33. Pure class. 

The only team that truly terrifies me this year is City. They have the only strike force that can compares with ours. You could make a case for United when fully fit only because of RVP and Rooney, but I give the edge to City because of their midfield. Yaya is terrifying and Silva can be brilliant. Nasri too. If they figure out their defensive issues, and Joe Hart can go back to being the best goalie in the league, they are the favorites to win the title. IF. Playing the 3-5-2 right now, with a lit match held to my Gerrard shirt, I'd pick Stevie and Hendo. I think we're sound defensively with Hendo, I think he's more than able to fill in for Lucas, as we saw at Palace. And call it blind loyalty, but no chance I'm dropping Gerrard against the best.

edit: Assuming the odd man out in any of these scenarios is on the bench, they can always be brought on to add their unique style to the team.

Since he resigned the DWP deemed that he had made himself unemployed and was not eligible for any benefits for six months.  It took numerous meetings with people at the JobCentre and his place of employment refusing to answer questions from the DWP to get his benefits sorted out and back dated.

         Toure.        Skrtel.        Agger

                    Sturridge.    Suarez 

I think agger should play, but Skrtel has earned a spot, I say give sahko the day off, he's played every game since his debut. 

Give Gerrard a rest I think, Henderson can provide real box to box runs from that position that Gerrard can't anymore, and give Lucas a chance to get back in the flow and redeem himself after his 1 match ban, he can track arfa who has looked dangerous at times this season. 

Lastly, I'd love to see Alberto get a run out, and this seems the perfect game, coutinho is coming back soon, and Newcastle's defense should not be able to press him out too much what with SaS running around. 

Rotation is good, and this gives some experimenting, while still being strong enough to handle the challenge, and we'll have Stevie and Moses off the bench if we need to add more firepower.

There are other schemes for young people like the 'YES' Youth Employment Scheme that does offer full time paid work under Enhanced Employer Subsidy and that is for under 24's. Usually it would be in 3 stages though; 1st stage is 6-8 weeks work experience then moving onto 6-9 months (increase in benefits) and then at anytime in those 6-9 months the employer can hire someone under EES so they become a full-time worker on NMW.

The Youth Employment Scheme needs to be monitored better though! I always found employers letting people go before their 9 months and hiring someone new and giving them the full 9 months which is basically slave labour as they're working in the business for their benefits + a little extra then getting let go for no reason at all so they don't have to pay them.

Also a note; companies get paid for bring someone into their business on these schemes, I don't remember the exact amount but if you hire someone though EES then you get a lump sum of £2500-5000.

6-8 Weeks is £250
6-9 Months is £500

Which all goes to the business owner.

The photo creates the impression of, for instance, a bitchy dom, but it does not make me assume the fact, and therefore hopefully I avoid the pitfall of prejudice against whomever you might actually be.

But humans are great at picking up on abstract, wispy clues and hints and we like to build models from them in a really speculative way. Even the most nebulous model is a framework which we can then begin to add further data to as we acquire it, and we seem to be happy to work with the vaguest of clues as we attempt to approach the facts from a position of uncertainty.

They have not questioned them (apart to re-create timelines and use them as whitnesses). 

Importantly, there is no evidence to connect them - all the DNA evidence that was used as the reason for the Portuguese police naming them as suspects in the first place has been conclusively proven to be false or inconclusive. No witnesses place them as suspects. They have pretty cast iron alibis for their whereabouts.

You are basing your thoughts on information we don't have. Maybe we'll get new information soon, and things will change. Right now however, it is foolish and frankly pathetic to assume, in any serious way, that her parents are guilty.

by an average individual

Hence coming over here and paying 1 years worth of NI and then claiming expensive medical care isn't the same. as a resident supporting a service for 40 years and then using it.

This policy makes sense, as outside of accidents (emergency treatments etc)  healthcare needs can be somewhat predictable in that someone with failing health could decided to go to the UK pay minimal NI contributions and receive ""full coverage"" which is unsustainable and unfair on its citizens who have supported it and are the main revenue stream for its survival.

France is, for better and worse, built around a strong idea of unity and uniformity. The [French language policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_policy_in_France#Fourth_Republic) is one good example of this:

&gt; As a result, the speakers of minority languages began to be shamed when using their own language – especially in the educational system – and over time, many families stopped teaching their language to their children and tried to speak only French with them.

I have a feeling that this has led to French considering the difference as being anti-French. It's probably not something people even realise anylonger, it's almost ""natural"" for many until they challenge their own perception of the World around them and what it means to be French. The Muslim religion challenges this sort of uniformity but I'm not sure this makes people racist per se, it's more like our History (I'm French) is so strongly written in our bones that it creates reactions just as strong.

The themes that came up time and time again were assimilation and opportunity. People talked about how they'd been living in Denmark or the Netherlands or France for a decade or more but they still got asked 'when are you going home?' and they heard of family and friends living in the UK who said that that doesn't happen here (and mostly it doesn't) some of those who re-migrated took a considerable drop in their standard of living for the sake of this feeling of belonging to a society.  To know they could go for a job interview or apply for a college place for their child without being treated with scepticism, because in the UK we mainly assume migrants are here to stay unless they say otherwise.

I don't spout conspiracy theories about anyone - at least I don't think it's a conspiracy theory to assume that a couple running a multimillion pound charity would draw a salary from it. Certainly other people seem to have been employed on behalf of the McCanns or by the fund. 

I feel that missing kids and their parents should get the same support, and that the police search should be as intensive and thorough, irrespective of how attractive they are or how media-savvy their parents are. 

The McCanns are in the spotlight because they thrust themselves forward, and I guess they did it for the best of reasons (assuming they had no role in Maddy's disappearance) but it's weird situation.

Me worrying about them or caring about them won't make a jot of difference about them.

So I do take your point about it being part of the larger barrage, but IMO it's not me you should be addressing (because, as I said, I consider that speculating they draw a salary to barely be a slur) but everyone else who does say genuinely shitty things.

And honestly? They could have avoided my speculations by, when they found that the purpose of Maddy Fund was too narrow for it to receive charitable status, putting the money into a fund which would have helped support the search for other missing kids, too. They could have put other people in charge of the fund, constructed a charter which describes the things that the charity would pay for, and allowed the parents of other missing kids to apply for funding. 

So you've made me write way more that I should be writing about things I don't care about. Congrats on that. If the McCanns are reading: I'm sorry about your loss, and it must be really distressing to lose a child and not have closure; I can't imagine what a weird situation it is for you.

There are a couple of others in the same boat. I think Paragon Training are another similar outfit. Their [site](http://www.paragontrainingni.co.uk/) is broken but I believe they have offices in the lower Shankill and one in the east somewhere.

As far as the subsidies go, what DTN101 said is spot on. I was on a Steps to Work placement for three months and was paid £15 extra per fortnight, while the employer received a few hundred. 

The business owner showed me all the paperwork that he received and it outlined the subsidies for the various time frames. I think they were offered remuneration for up to 24 months if they guaranteed at least *x* amount of hours per week, ie they pay a gradually increasing % of your wages.

The employer as good as told me that they use the scheme for free staff, all while getting paid. That said, he mentioned that he carefully vets any potential 'employees' to ensure they're only going to require the minimum amount of time/financial expenditure, and doesn't just blindly take anyone offered to him.

true,Change_you_can_xerox,null,null,"This is part if a wider problem with the ways in which human rights law is represented in the media in general. The Mail is probably the worst offender, but it's not the only paper that frequently misrepresents cases, just like the Tory party exploit the public misunderstanding more, but Labour will have a go if it suits them. Facts are irrelevant in the debate - the Home Secretary can make a speech at the party conference claiming a deportation was blocked because the criminal owned a cat, and people assume she's telling the truth if it suits their bias. It doesn't matter that the story is completely false - it reinforces a perception a lot of people have that judges (particularly foreign judges) are barmy academic types out of step with common sense.

I would urge anyone who reads a story about human rights in the newspapers to do their own research on the subject before taking it at face value. Very often the papers simply lie about cases (see: the case about the cat) or very seriously misrepresent the facts to give an impression that is the opposite of reality. For instance, it was reported a while back that Britain loses 75% of the cases heard by the European Court of Human Rights. That's superficially true, but that only takes into account ones which actually reach the court. In actuality, the court considers thousands of applications every year, and about 99% of them are dismissed, which for all practical purposes counts as a win for the government. The 1% that do reach the court are usually therefore quite strong cases, simply by nature of the selection process. Moreover, the court hears about 10 cases a year involving the UK, so the 75% figure in reality amounts to about 7 or 8 cases a year.

There's also a prevalent belief that human rights laws prevent criminals being deported. Generally when deportations are blocked, the media reports it as a human rights case, but most of them are to do with asylum and immigration law, and have nothing to do with the human rights act. Deportations blocked on human rights grounds are extremely rare - less than 10 a year, and they're usually only blocked because a deportation would not be in the best interests of the family, rather than because it might hurt the criminal's feelings.

Please help us help someone, and sign this petition.
I am aware the petition itself has been somewhat poorly written, but please do not let that detract you from the situation at hand. Here is what the Petition Writer wrote (as edited by me for easier reading)  


&gt;“I have discovered that the guidelines for Civil Judges are not being adhered to.  They are not impartial and are blatantly biased in their judgements. My ex wife is a court officer with the secret children's courts.   


&gt;She has manipulated our divorce case and settlement by insisting that I attend the Dartford County Court for settlement hearings where it was ruled that despite her leaving me in 2007 and not having paid any of the mortgage for 5 years , or having invested any money into the home, she is not liable for the payments.   


&gt;Despite having received offers to buy the house at a reasonable price she insists on selling it to a property developer for £25,000 less than equivalent houses a few yards away are selling for, with the express intention of making me homeless and penniless.   


&gt;The court has signed the transfer deed as I refused to, and plans to evict me.  


 &gt;She has worked at Dartford Court for several years and has even manipulated a small claims court action for her half of the mortgage payments away from Medway Court to Bromley Court, then added to divorce proceeding where one her best pals dismissed the claim.  


&gt;They are holding hearings and making judgements without me being informed or present. This is in my opinion total corruption that allows friends and work colleagues to manipulate and influence the court hearings and rulings . Simply because when I reported this to the Police they said its not criminal so none of their concern. This is an uncontested divorce and I haven't claimed a penny off her, and I actually caught her out (cheating) , which was why she left, no violence, no drugs , no alcohol. No reason to be this badly treated.   


&gt;How would you like it if your ex made you attend a hearing with his or her work mates at their place of work. Fair Impartial Forget it ! This corruption needs to be cleared up and using existing rules for criminal cases is the way to do it. “  


So, what is my involvement in this case, you ask? Well, my fiance and I were the couple who had put in the honest and fair offer for the house when it came on the market. But, before the seller could even accept the offer, his ex-wife got the house pulled off the market again to try and force the sell for £20.000 less than we offered. (It does say the property developer offered £25.000 under value in the petition, but it was listed as slightly under value for a quicker sale, so that's the slight discrepancy there).  


We loved the house, and we were certain we were going to buy it. However, we have since found a better place not tied up in a skewed divorce battle. But, although we no longer have a personal interest in this case, we still feel like the ex-wife should not be able to get away with her dirty tactics. This is corruption of court, pure and simple, and regardless of who it effects, it should not be allowed to happen.  


All we wish for is for these underhanded tactics to be exposed and for a fair trial to commence, so that  the seller of the house can finally put up his house back on the market again, for the price that it is worth. I still do think it was a lovely house, and though in need of a bit of TLC, the very spacious 3-bedroom is worth much more than the paltry £120.000 the property developer offered.   


Thank you very much for reading, and please sign the petition! :)  


TL/DR: Please sign this petition to help a man fight corruption of court, and save him from being left homeless.

His life is just a cycle of him saying or doing something linked to homosexuality, bipolar, or liking technology despite being over 50. When attention in him lulls for 5 minutes he pulls one of the cards out. 

From what i've read about the program it sounds like Stephen Fry was not the right man to make this program. He has very very thin skin as it is, let alone when being in a position where he is supposed to confront homophobes. He seems to have taken what they are saying extremely personally, and been unable to keep his cool, which would have made for a better program. It seems like he butchered the program even more than that shitty open letter he sent to the PM over the Russian Olympic games.

The left doesn't have a problem with taxes being levied, and the only tax I can think of that's regressive and comes from the EU is VAT, which they specify must be 15% or above, this current government decided it should be 20%.

The idea that it's a great thing for all involved to inflate away your debts ignores how much damage inflation has caused to European economies over the last century.  There are reasons why the Germans are perhaps overly cautious about inflation.

Norway has huge reserves of oil and gas which rather than sell off for a short term profit, turned into a huge national sovereign wealth fund; their situation is atypical.

true,andtheniansaid,null,null,"&gt;Because in its simplest form medical care is a ""rarity"" in that for a citizen of the country's average lifespan they will contribute around 40-50 years worth of NI and will claim only on rare occasions, it is not a standard service like ""Food"" or ""power"" which is consumed daily. by an average individual
Hence coming over here and paying 1 years worth of NI and then claiming expensive medical care isn't the same. as a resident supporting a service for 40 years and then using it.

Okay well let's say on average each resident who pays for 45 years covers their costs (i know that's a gross simplification). 

Do 45 people who come here to work for a year claim more in that year than the 1 resident does over the course of their life? Let's not forget biggest costs are likely to come post-retirement. For those that are genuinely coming here to work I would be surprised if this was the case. Yes one individual who comes for a year and needs something on the NHS will cost it more than they pay, but many will pay NI and never use the NHS

edit: my wording there is a bit convoluted so let's put it this way instead:

a resident pays 40-50 years of NI but requires 80 years of NHS treatment (average life expectancy), including at the expensive end of life stage

a working migrant pays x amount of years of NI and requires x amount of years of NHS treatment. Economically they are better for the NHS than the resident. Add in something to deal with those that come mainly/just for treatment and we don't need this horrid legislation


Without knowing the numbers it's not really possible to judge, but I don't see why they should pay NI if they are not entitled to the services it goes to. Maybe set a limit on the amount they can receive before they have to pay another sum (the £200-400) to deal with those who come here just for medical attention. But if someone comes over to work, pays NI, and then say, breaks their wrist, I don't see why they shouldn't get treatment.

No, it really can't.   

You're an idiot, or someone who has just read 1984 and Animal Farm for the first time.  

Teaching school kids about speaking ""proper"" English is *actually* important for the real world.  

I'm an English Lang &amp; Creative Writing graduate, and yes, I know all about the whole ""language changes/evolves"" etc etc, but people are missing the point it seems.  

Schools are supposed to be there to not only educate but to ready people for life beyond school. As much as there is a plethora of linguistic changes that are happening constantly, in the real world it *is* important to ""speak properly"" in certain situations.   

People in this thread seem to have interpreted this whole thing as ""The School thinks slang and ""wrong"" language use is wrong."" They're not. They're saying if you had an interview for a high-flying job for example, yes, it is ""bad"" to speak to the interviewer like ""Yeh blud innit"". Big difference.   


Yet again this has been over-sensationalised.  

Asking someone to ""reflect"" on how they speak isn't the same as ""banning"". The word ""Banned"" in this context is hardly used in its literal meaning.  
 

There's *nothing* wrong with informal language, no, but all this basically is, is teaching them the differences between informal and formal language, and how formal language use is important in certain times and situations when it comes to the real world.  

There is nothing wrong with that.  

Comparing this to something like 1984 or Animal Farm is fucking stupid.

Depending on the circumstances of your claim you may be able to claim the £2,200 (or less, or more) that is apparently set aside for you. I am not sure if it is the law, but because whiplash claims are so common here in the UK, and can be claimed literally YEARS after an accident, insurers do set money aside for claims.

When it comes to whiplash and other small claims, most solicitors claim their fees from the insurer on top of anything they get for you. If you weren't injured, you may not get anything, and the solicitors may not want to take your case. 

The insurance industry is scummy as fuck. I recently had someone crash straight into the back of me and was inundated with calls from people like this.

Even peer pressure won't change their attitude, not public pressure anyway. They are in a position of power such that even if you had the political, cultural and religious leaders of the world outside of Uganda condemning them and ridiculing them, they *still* wouldn't change their mind.

How do you conduct a serious interview or debate with someone like that? How do you ask straight questions when you can never get straight answers? How do you respond with reason when their ears simply shut it out?

The answer is you can't. You can't have a debate because debate requires reasoned arguments, and these people don't think of it like that. They think of it like faith, which requires no reason or logic, just belief.

I think that the point of these interviews was not to try and reason with them or change their minds or change the minds of the viewers. Fry knew that was an impossible task.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think this depends a bit on if we're going to continue on with 3 center backs or return to a formation that utilizes 4 defenders.  And while I know Allen wasn't mentioned in this, he's also an important piece of the puzzle and should be considered when discussing our midfield IMO.

If we go to a back 4 then I want to see Henderson in with Lucas and Gerrard in what would most resemble a 4-3-3, with Coutinho and Suarez starting to either side of Sturridge.  I know this will be an unpopular opinion as everyone wants to see Coutinho through the middle but him and Suarez with license to roam (so basically the have a limited defensive responsibility to recover to either flank but plenty of freedom offensively) and the freedom to come inside to receive the ball really allows them to work at what they do best while creating space for Enrique and Johnson to get down the flanks.  It also seems like Coutinho tends to drift more towards the left side anyway even when he's deployed in a central role.  Allen fits into this system reasonably well for any of the 3 midfielders as well since barring the more defensive of the 3 (Lucas), there's a bit more freedom to play and possess the ball.  I think this 4-3-3 with a holding player and 2 natural midfielders plays most to the strengths of our creative players by giving them huge freedom while also protecting the weaknesses of our midfielders (Lucas and Stevie are slow/not very mobile, Henderson isn't exactly an attacking powerhouse but all he has to do is find Coutinho/Suarez while his work ethic and engine cover beautifully for Lucas/Gerrard).

If we continue on playing a back 3 then I think Henderson will be the one to make way for Johnson, and Moses for Coutinho.  It's a shame because Henderson has been absolutely immense but Johnson's strengths as a player are really ideal for the sort of wing-back position that we're making use of in this formation.  Moses has been a reasonable stand in for Coutinho but ultimately he's not a creative attacking player and he doesn't do very well as the one who is supposed to orchestrate and construct our attacks.  Coutinho certainly takes his place.  I would love to see a regular starting spot for Henderson in this setup but I very seriously doubt that Lucas and/or Gerrard would get dropped.  I think a bit of a rotation would suit all 3 players well since Henderson can fill in for either of them.  This is awkward for Allen though, who is tougher to fit into one of these places because his qualities are rather a bit different from the other 3.  He can cover for Lucas as a DM but it's a serious waste of his passing and possession abilities, which I think are the ones that will be most important to us in the coming years as BR builds a possession based system into our squad.

* Blood behind the sofa.

* Cadaverine behind the sofa.

* Cadaverine in the wardrobe.

* Cadaverine outside the window.

* Cadaverine in the car rented 3 weeks after.


Cadaverine is not produced until at least three hours after the person has died. The *earliest* Madeleine could have died was 7pm so for Cadaverine to have been produced behind the sofa or in the wardrobe the body must have been there after 10pm that night.

Therefore, Madeleine must have met a violent end (because of the blood). Although not violent enough for the twins to notice and not violent enough to have produced enough blood for forensics to pick up. The body must have then been stuffed behind the sofa (or in the wardrobe) until at least 10pm when Kate went up to check on the children and then ran down to the others to raise the alarm. 

Because of the cadaverine (remember we are trusting these dogs 100%) the body must have stayed behind the sofa (and/or wardrobe) during the initial search and all through the first night (whilst the police were in the apartment) - wow, I bet the McCanns were sweating a bit! Then, in-between talking to the press and the police, the McCanns must have moved the body (via the window with the worlds press outside!) and hidden it somewhere outside of the flat.

They then waited 3 weeks until they had rented a new car and then they moved the body elsewhere.
Pretty neat to have achieved all of this without being spotted by all the police or the press.

&gt;""So upon finding your daughter missing, you immediately contacted the police, using your phone. Great. Thanks, that's very helpful.""

To the Jury (or a judge, to get a warrant for arrest or search based on suspicion), potentially months later:

&gt; ""Upon finding her daughter missing from her room, she did not search the house, check outside, or ask her husband if he had seen or taken the child anywhere. She immediately phoned the police, apparently knowing something was wrong without performing these basic and logical tasks. Every time your child wanders outside or goes to another room without you realising, do you also alert the emergency services?""

&gt; ""That's not true, I did check first.""

&gt; ""According to your testimony, I quote, 'I immediately ran to the telephone and contacted the police'. Are you saying you didn't immediately contact the police, even though you thought your daughter had been abducted?""

___

20: [I have no context since I've not read all the details]
&gt; ""My husband took them upstairs, so I don't know""

To her / the jury: 

&gt; ""Did it surprise you that your daughters didn't wake up, when being taken upstairs?""

&gt; ""A little, but they can be heavy sleepers.""

&gt; ""Could you explain how you felt this surprise when it was actually your husband who moved them and you didn't have any interaction with them at this point?""

&gt; ""Oh, I wasn't surprised at the time, but I was surprised when you told me""

&gt; ""You weren't surprised that your daughters were completely oblivious to the incident at the time you arrived home?""

etc. etc.

___

12: 

&gt; ""I contacted the police.""

Later, in court:

&gt; ""According to these notes, your husband spoke to the police about the incident.""

&gt; ""No, I contacted them, not him""

&gt; ""I see, if he didn't contact them, do you know why he might have said that he did?""

So easy to lead people astray. Remember the key isn't to actually catch them out. It's to make the Jury wonder if she's being honest and telling the truth, or is perhaps confused somehow.

__

The best example was where the guy told the police he was at home with his mother 50 miles away from a crime. Then they just said an eyewitness spotted someone with his exact likeness at the scene, driving a [same colour car]. Immediately the jury is wondering if maybe he lied and got his mother to corroborate the story. If he had simply said nothing, they wouldn't have been able to sow that doubt.

Doctor Who uses the multiverse theory of time travel. Moffat's brilliance shows in his ability to use internally consistent story components (in this case, the contents of the Pandorica dispersed by an exploding TARDIS) to return the protagonists to the ""prime"" universe at the end of a story arc.

Basically, though, in a multiverse scenario, it makes perfect sense for little Amelia to have grown up both with and without the crack. In fact, in series five, little Amelia had three childhoods-- with the crack and no parents, with no stars and no parents, and with her parents and no crack (the original, undamaged universe, which is restored at the end of series five).

If it's the fact that [Amy, Rory, and the Doctor now remember all three timelines](http://youtu.be/LefejNy7mWU) which bothers you, that's Moffat's literary conceit for the show-- it's the story he's trying to tell, which pops up over and over.

true,paulrpotts,null,null,"Well, yes, you can buy them by serial, but the serials are very expensive. The BBC seems dead set on over-pricing their DVD releases.

My general rule of thumb these days is that I consider TV shows on DVD to be reasonably priced at $10 or less per DVD. By this measure the modern Doctor Who series at $80 a season on DVD is notably overpriced compared to other popular shows. Series 6 Game of Thrones Season 1 (5 discs) lists at $60. Breaking Bad season 1 (3 discs) lists at $27. I found it especially interesting that Season 7 was released in 2 parts at (list) $25 each part (2 discs each part -- not too bad, but above my $10 price point) but then when released again in a single set cost (list) $80 again. ($20 per disc, $30 more for the set than buying the series in two parts -- WTF?)

Of course with various discounts, my Barnes and Noble membership card, or Amazon, or waiting for sales, you can get them down a bit, but I've never seen them discounted a _lot_. I bought a half-price set on eBay once and found that the discs were counterfeit -- discs that skipped, with a weird haze to them that wouldn't clean off, artwork that didn't match the genuine box... never again.

The classic series City of Death lists at $25 for 2 DVDs. That's not too bad, but The Creature from the Pit also lists at $25 -- for 1 DVD. That's way out of line. The E-Space Trilogy lists at $50 for 3 DVDs. The Beginning set (3 discs) lists at $37.92. The Mind of Evil (1 disc) lists at $34.98(!) The pricing has no particular relation to the amount of content. These things are just priced way out of line and it seems to me like packaging them per serial as opposed to per season, or part-season, keeps the prices high. If they released seasons, or half-seasons (at least for the years that are complete), I would consider buying them a box at a time and slowly working through them. But having grown up with Tom Baker and watched a number of the other stories from the other doctors it is really impossible for me to consider them worth anywhere near the price per hour of the modern series... my kids get very bored with them, there are some great moments but they are often tedious, for completists only, and yet cost even more money per hour than the over-priced modern series. Feh.

I bet if they released them in less expensive sets, they would sell so many more that they would earn a lot more on the whole project.

Then Police Federation (basically the policeman's union) representatives from Mitchell's constituency asked for a meeting to clarify what had happened, and immediately following the meeting told the media that he had refused to elaborate on what had actually happened and called for him to resign. However, the meeting was secretly recorded with the transcripts of that meeting showing Andrew Mitchell clearly elaborating on what happened and giving his side of the story (which tallies with what he had always claimed had actually happened).

Then West Mercia police were asked to investigate whether those members of the Police Federation had lied to the media (which if the transcripts are true they clearly had) and determined that they had no case to answer.

Then the IPCC started looking into the case and they've now decided that those members of the Police Federation *did* deliberately lie to the media about what happened, but have no way of forcing West Mercia police to take action against those individuals.

The Torygraph is always against things it deems are anti-business and prevent the freedom of the individual (as they see it). Regulations in general are seen as anti-business. Thus they are against them unless they're is a primary moral reason for supporting them ( see the article). 

I say this not as a moral judgement but as an analysis of their creed.  The Telegraph is somewhere between old Whig and Burkean Tory. So they'll support tradition and conservatism (small c) as long as its not impinging as the individual freedom of business/people to do what they like. This is because their core ideology believes that enlightened self-interest will bring positive outcomes. 

Thus, in this perspective H/S laws are unnecessary because enlightened self-interest will prevent harm from occurring. Or a person will wear a hard hat because he doesn't want to hurt his head. The flaw in this has always been that it relies on rational actors and enlightened action. But that's whole other essay I could write.

So the fed are upset that the IPCC has just decided that there was misconduct instead of querying the investigation, taking over, or asking for a line of enquiry to be followed up. It does in all fairness look like they've just ignored the actual investigation and gone with the political line.

Your plan sounds like a good one, in fact I know that my local university is thinking of the same thing - an agency that meets the specific needs of a landlord who lets to students.

1)It's not clear from this if you are going to be running a fully managed service or just a tenant find service, but either way essentially what you're asking here is how to compete with sites like rightmove, zoopla etc. I would say that most professional landlords would not want to advertise on your site. Most landlords, would expect as a bare minimum, for you to arrange for their property to be viewable on these already existing sites which are widely recognised and already have brand recognition.

Different agents do different things, for a competitive local rate, the business model I am familiar will offer a fully managed service. This includes finding a tenant, the production of a detailed inventory, protection of the deposit, checking the tenant in and out, addressing repairs, chasing arrears, production of court papers for eviction if necessary, credit checks and referencing and submitting money claim for former arrears. There are many other things I have not written down here - it is a job where you should expect to be pulling 60 hours weeks.

You will need a very good understanding of housing law and tenancy law. You leave yourself seriously open to problems if you are not familiar with the court process for eviction through section 8, section 21 routes etc. 

In terms of professional development I would suggest you need a basic knowledge of HMO licensing in the area you intend to operate as well as an understanding of HHSRS legislation. If you are running this business yourself you will need all the associated insurances and registrations.

Your idea to do a media package of every home, is in my view, a waste of time. Student will not care about what their let looks like, as long as it is safe and habitable. Your marketing strategy is aimed at the professional market - but there are agents with decades worth of experience struggling to find tenants at the moment. Landlords will not come to you for management because they like your web development skills, they will come to you because you are charging them a smaller fee - they will pay this smaller fee as a result of you offering the property to a tenant at a very competitive rate.

It will be difficult to run a fully managed service online - in my experience running a tenant find service is fine this way. But if you are dealing with tenants, landlords and other professionals on a daily basis, you will need an office. If i had to deal, professionally, with an agent that did not have an office, it would not leave me with a good impression.

I would suggest looking around for openings at a local estate and/or lettings agent and offering your service to them in regards to marketing since from your post it seems like that is where your passion is. You will pick up the legal processes and way the industry works as you gain more experience. Despite the number of shoddy lettings agents that are out there - it is a professional field with people who dedicate their entire careers to becoming experts in the same way any engineer, solicitor or doctor would.

Did I buy solar panels because I care about the environment?  Or for the subsidised electricity.  It could be argued I am simply scrounging as much as it could that I am being all environmentally friendly.  Most people would agree 43p is too generous (it is now about 14p).  Yet ask people if I'm scrounging they'd certainly say no!

The fact is, like any business transaction, things will happen, gazumping was common before, even whilst you are doing the paperwork it's common for someone to put an offer in to the vendor for an extra £5k or as a buyer say *it's not worth that much because of xyz*.

My point is that the owners would have known that they would be in negative equity when they agreed the sale price.  It is more likely they are just dicks who can't do business rather than that being the deciding factor.

Most conveyancers will charge just a little fee when it falls through like this, and my person view on surveys is they aren't worth the paper they are printed on.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"The original article in the Daily Mail never said they were using the NHS or claiming benefits etc just that there were 600,000 unemployed people. Most people don't go to a hospital regularly and the rate of benefit use taking into account population is [up to 60% lower](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/alex-massie/2013/02/the-myth-of-the-immigrant-benefit-moocher-part-two/) among immigrants than among natives. So I've always found the whole 'They're using up our resources' point to be a weak one. 

The implication of the Daily Mail article is that there are 600,000 people who are capable of working who are not. The point is that those who are children or retired or housewives etc are unable to work because they're too young or old or are raising a family while their partners are at work generating money for the economy and so they should be excluded from the statistics. 

If an immigrant family of 4 is here then according to the DM you have 1 employed and 3 unemployed people. What if the 1 employed person pays more than enough in taxes to to pay for his/her family's own use of public services? Do those 3 unemployed people look so bad now? 

If they don't and if you'd be fine with someone supporting themselves in that way then you have to ask why the Daily Mail wants to lump those 3 perfectly supported 'unemployed people' together with people who can work but don't and consume more than they produce. we should treat both cases very differently. 

**EDIT:** I would also add that the case of an immigrant family not having a breadwinner of any sort is broadly a rare case in my experience. It's hard enough to be an immigrant in the first place and to be an immigrant racking up debts without a job is basically intolerable and not really sustainable. If you came to find work in the UK why would you decide to change your mind and live in poverty on the meagre rations you get from benefits. It seems like the Daily Mail et al think the enthusiasm and motivation to travel the world in search of a better life suddenly disappears when people learn you can live on or below the poverty line in a shitty area with shitty schools, no prospects for your kids and occasionally going hungry when the sky subscription needs paying. 

If these people decided to move their families for better prospects they aren't going to settle for an unstable, stigmatised, dead end life on benefits.

Furthermore the estimations of the NHS suggest it spends [33 million a year](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ournhs/kambiz-boomla/nhs-and-dog-whistle-politics) on foreign nationals. When you compare this to the OECD's findings that immigrants bring 16.3 billion into the economy you can see that immigrants bring in 500 times more than they take out. 

It's also worth pointing out that however much immigrants pay in income tax they are paying 20% VAT like all of us. Even if, worst of all worlds, they are using benefit money, 20% goes back and part of that helps fund the NHS.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"The EU is liberal, in both senses of the word. It's economically liberal, meaning it's generally in favour of free markets and of limited government intervention; it's also socially liberal, in that it's in favour of free movement of labour, of anti-discrimination legislation, and so on.

This poses a dilemma for both traditional left-wing viewpoints, which are usually socially liberal but economically Statist, and for traditional right-wing viewpoints which are economically liberal but socially conservative.

From a UK perspective, we can see that the Labour Party (which has never been a Socialist party in the European style) has vascillated between pro-EU and anti-EU standpoints. Over the past 15-20 years or so, when the right wing of the Labour Party has been the dominant force in that party, the general economic stance of the party has pretty much been ""pro capitalism, but with a human face"". That means that the interests of the EU and those of New Labour have largely coincided, and so the party has mostly been pro-EU.  Historically, in Labour Party's has more left-wing periods, it has been much more anti-EU (or strictly speaking anti-EEC, as the grouping was known at the time).

On the other hand the traditional pro-capitalist party, the Conservatives, have if anything vascillated even more wildly between their pro-big-business and hence pro-EU wings, and their anti social liberalism (mixed in with a mild dose of xenophobia). More than once in the party's history it's come close to tearing the party apart; the differences were partly responsible for the downfall of 2, maybe 3 Conservative Prime Ministers, and the right wing of the Conservative Party's support has largely peeled off to become the backbone of UKIP.

true,Change_you_can_xerox,null,null,"The short answer is that there was no truth to Theresa May and The Mail et al's claim that the reason the deportation was blocked was because of the cat. The long answer is that the defendant was a Bolivian national who had come to the UK to study and had settled down with a British woman. A few years later he was arrested for shoplifting and the Home a Office tried to deport him. The deportation was in the first instance blocked on human rights grounds, namely the Article 8 right to a family life - since he'd settled down with his partner and the offense was comparably minor, it seemed reasonable to not force him to return to Bolivia. 

During the case the prosecution were sarcastic and flippant in their arguments regarding the status of the defendant's family life in the UK. They said something to the effect of ""And we are sure Maya, his cat, will be able to adapt to the reduced standard of living in Bolivia."" Since the prosecution were being frivolous, the judge felt the need to address this matter in his judgment - he said that whilst the possession of a cat was irrelevant in this case and in his decision, it isn't something to be outright dismissed and can be evidence of family life. In legal parlance this is known as orbiter dicta - something a judge says in a judgment which doesn't form the basis of a decision. 

What's even more absurd about the whole thing is that the case above was a first instance decision, and since the Home Office appealed, it's the appeal decision which is legally relevant - the cat case is practically meaningless. On appeal, the Bolivian man was allowed to stay, but for the reason that the Home Office hadn't followed the correct procedures, so not only is the legally relevant case nothing to do with cats at all, it's not even a human rights case.

None of this, however, stopped The Mail from picking up the story and even printing a second front-page update after fact-checkers responded with...well...facts. The Mail continued claiming that the cat DID form the basis for an immigration decision. To borrow a phrase - you couldn't make it up!

If someone has taken time over their appearance whether it be hair, outfit, whatever, to me it shows they want to be taken seriously, they have pride in their appearance and want people to think good of them, which is fair enough. Obviously the world shouldn't really work like that, but it does so people might as well get on board. :P

I genuinely believe there is a problem with the integration of Islam into the UK. Please read that carefully, it's not simply Islam, just it's ability to blend into UK culture seamlessly. 
Before anyone yells 'Islamophobia', hear me out. I won't be forced into saying that the mean* Muslim is moderate and kind. The **mode** Muslim is moderate and kind, as in the one you are most likely to meet. However, there's an extremist side and no matter how small it truly is, it brings the mean* down to a level below average. Now this is almost unique to Islam. Where are the CofE terrorists, the Catholic terrorists and the Sikh terrorists? I admit, that all these religions have their dark sides, but it seems that Islam alone generates certain individuals that are ready to speak their mind with violence. Now, I'd love to see nothing more than for this dark side to be quenched and for Islam to remain in the UK. But it exists, and whilst it exists it will only further the tensions that exist today and give rise to more unsavoury groups like the EDL or worse.

Best thing to do is have it all worked out with your mortgage adviser before hand to confirm what value they'd lend up to, a mortgage in principal (or whatever its called).

The survey I had done on the first house I looked at was very cheap at £300 (the guy had forgotten about the deal he'd left quoted on his website!), but he did an amazing job. I very nearly bought a crap property the owner had been trying to renovate on the cheap, and sell on to me at a massive markup.

The stuff you want to know about is, if any major work is required in the near future, if there are any damp or structural problems that the current owner is trying to conceal, anything above and beyond a bit of re-decorating really. Anything significant you can use to re-negotiate the price.

If no one was injured, you aren't going to be able to claim for anything. If you attempt to make a claim stating that you were injured, the insurance provider might refuse to settle and ask it be taken to court. At which point it would be you versus your wife.

For your information, if you were to make a claim you would be suing your wife. Your wife and her insurance have an agreement that they will cover (almost) any losses that occur when she is behind the wheel of her car in exchange for her monthly premiums. 

If you tried to make a fraudulent whiplash claim, things could get nasty. I am assuming that your wife has made a claim of sorts in relation to the incident, perhaps to get her car fixed. They will have written statements from her explaining that she was going 5mph upon impact. You and your wife could end up on opposite sides of a court room.

Well barring the obvious standouts (Oxford, Cambridge, ~~Eton~~, St. Andrews, etc) I'd imagine most are there or there abouts. I would probably suggest picking somewhere large would keep you right, so keep to the major cities.

&gt; Secondly, I'd be traveling there and studying there alone, as my family would stay back home in the US. That being said, in your experience, is this a good idea, or more of a pipe dream?

Britain has massive numbers of foreign students who arrive from all kinds of situations. It might be daunting but you'll be fine.

&gt; Finally, what is the process like for gaining citizenship? Like I said, I'm hoping to study there for a few years, and plan to live in London after I graduate.

I can't say from personal experience but I would imagine good qualifications and a solid promise of a good job would make the process much easier.

The proposals envisage that anyone living and working in the UK with permanent resident status would still have the right to use the NHS on the same basis as anyone else. Part of the proposal is that anyone in the transition process to permanent residency would be able to use the NHS at an extra fixed cost per year.

I am not sure if they have the levels set correctly but the principal that those with no record of contributions to the NHS should pay extra for cover for an initial period surely cannot be wrong in principal. 

One of the most contentious aspects of these proposals is asking medical professionals to check the immigration status of prospective patients to ensure their eligibility for treatment. The issuing of health cards to all eligible individuals that are routinely checked (as I described in my first post) would obviate this need for doctors to act as surrogate immigration officials (and reduce administration costs).

Hmm... works for me...  Seriously though - looks good.

I learned years ago not to judge people on how they look.  Its too easy to see someone in a ""costume"" and make a snap judgment about them.  I have found though that there is a clear correlation between being a remarkable person in some way or other and looking like a freak.  Unfortunately this doesn't always work the other way round and there are many people out there who look like freaks and basically are freaks.  Is the scruffy looking bloke in the corner the first person to Paraglide the length of the Karakorum and runs a couple of successful businesses discovering novel compounds for the Pharma industry, or is he just the local pot dealer who wandered in off the street? (or maybe hes both!)  Some of the kindest people I know look stern and a bit mean most of the time.  Its not till you get to know them you find out that they spent 5 years in Sudan during a civil war, running an operating theater in some manky town hospital for free. 

So I don't judge people on how they look, but I sure as hell judge them by their actions, what they have done and are doing with their lives.  Sometimes I get it wrong but generally I get it kinda right and can get a reasonably good handle on someone after about 30 mins.

And on that note I feel that I have to 'fess up to buying my first pair of Crocks recently... they look shit but boy are they comfy, and I couldn't care less what people think. So there!

true,blueb0g,null,null,"Well obviously plenty of people do come from abroad and stay here for the full three years of their degree, that's certainly not a pipe dream. However in most universities you're only guranteed accomodation in your first year, so you'll have to head home for the holidays (usually a month at Christmas, a month at Easter, and two to three months in the summer). After your first year, most students live out so you could stay all year in years 2 and 3 if you wanted to. 

As for which universities are good for English, the current Complete University Guide currently lists these as the top 10:

1) Durham (where I am studying)

2) Cambridge 

3) University College London (UCL)

4) Exeter

5) Oxford (bit of an anomaly, was no.1 last year)

6) York

7) Warwick 

8) St Andrews

9) Bristol

10) Leeds

I wouldn't take too much stock of lists like that but it'll give you a flavour. Any of the top tier universities are pretty equally good, though - on top of that list you have Nottingham, Birmingham, Lancaster, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Glasgow, Kings College London, Manchester, plus a load I've missed out.

When choosing a university, make sure it's not just on academic prowess alone. Lots of other factors go into making a good university, and I'd recommend taking a look at a few too. Little contractually obliged (not really) plug for Durham, we were voted to have the best student quality of life in the UK the other week. London is also a good bet but it's bloody expensive down there, bear this in mind also. 

 Make sure you start the application process soon if you want to start in 2014 (you could however always take a year out, take a look at UK unis and decide which ones you like and then start in 2015). You may have already missed the Oxford / Cambridge (commonly referred to as Oxbridge) application dates for 2014. IIRC, it's October 15 for those two, and January 15 for the others.

Get in contact with your school and get them to help you with the process. I'm not sure how international students apply to UK universities so you'll have to get on that; it may well be through UCAS (the system through which UK students apply) but you may also be able to apply directly to the university in question.

When it comes to citizenship, you need to have been living here for 5 years before applying to become a naturalised citizen. The more pressing matter would be visas, but this won't be difficult for your university years - student visas are typically, for obvious reasons, a relatively straightforward affair (but they will usually not allow you to take part time degrees, for instance). I'm not exactly sure about how you'd get along with the visa situation for the two years after your degree (when you plan to be living in London) but before you can qualify as a citizen as the job market is not exactly the best at the minute (this may well have changed in 4 years) and it can be very difficult to get a visa if you're not working or studying. However I'd imagine that the fact that you'd already have been living here for 3 years would be taken into account.

So yes, it's totally doable and lots of people do. Make sure you read up on visa and citizenship questions, and enlist the help of your school, both for applications to UK universities and for the visa process. Make sure you research all these issues and make careful decisions on what universities you want to apply to. All of them have comprehensive websites with lots of detail about their courses, student life etc. This is a very big decision you're planning on making *so make sure you are prepared.* Good luck!

I think the personal change, bringing Rodgers and the City scouts, is like a complete 180 from before where Comoli and Kenny were running us into the ground. As much as I love KK he really didn't keep up with football. You could clearly see his talents as a motivator and he could squeeze every ounce of ability out of a player for the big games but his tactics came undone against smaller opposition where there's less natural motivation. Rodgers is picking a young and hungry teams, providing players a platform to shine on. His coaching is part of this and he's adapted to the squad at his disposal.

* The educational system in Scotland is different from that in England &amp; Wales and I believe Northern Ireland is different from them both. Some differences are that in Scotland a 4 year undergraduate degree is normal, in England it is 3 years that is normal. Terminology may well be different (hence why I am writing about English universities)
* ""School"" is where you are now, Universities are almost never referred to as ""schools"" unless it is in the name of the institution (e.g. SOAS). ""Uni"" is generally used (eg. ""I went to uni in London"", ""what are you studying at uni?""
* ""Majors"" - Degrees in England do not have ""Majors"" and ""Minors"", the degree will be a named degree and all modules will be related to that subject in some way, though there are joint degrees where you end up with a degree in ""A and B"", but you can't pick and choose in the way I understand you can in the US, and have to pick one of the combos that have already been approved which would generally be a related subject. So ""English and Creative Writing"" or ""English and American Literature"" yes; ""English and Cybernetics"" not so much.
* People would say you are ""studying English"" rather than ""majoring in English"", but you may hear it described as ""reading English"", though when I was at Uni this was not that common (though I was at the University of Reading, so maybe it was just considered to open to confusion)
* University applications are done through [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) which appears to have a section for international students

You also you get people who are mixed. You will get people who generally want a job and will make what they can out of any opportunity given.

They you will get people who don't want a job or literally need somebody to follow them about all day to ensure they actually do something. Won't turn up on time always taking too many breaks and leave early.

For the first one. It is basically a chance for a company to try somebody out. Consider it a long job interview or match making. Where a company isn't sure if they can hire somebody so if you get the right person. They can play a real positive role inside a company and it can be worth keeping them around. eg the company cannot quite afford to hire somebody. So they try somebody out on sales. Now that person increases the sales and quite literally creates their own job. This happens more than you may realize. This happens because an employee is typically seen as a liability by a company.

Oh the flip side yes. Some companies will attempt to abuse the system but at the end of the day they might be giving somebody with no exp. Some exp and a reference. It also shows that yes this person can and will turn up every day and do what they are told. This can kick the person enough to get them into a job somewhere else.

As for the 2nd type of person. Well they cannot just live on handouts your entire life which is taken from other hard working people. They need to learn to pull their weight.

Oxford/Cambridge and the [Russell Group](http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/) have the best reputations. If you want to be a writer, [UEA](http://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing) is worth looking into as well.

&gt;That being said, in your experience, is this a good idea, or more of a pipe dream?

Fucktons of foreigners come to British Universities every year. You will be *far* from alone. Bear in mind that all the Brits you stay with will be moving away from home too, and while it may only be a few hundred miles rather than a few thousand, you will still have more in common with them than not.

&gt;Finally, what is the process like for gaining citizenship? Like I said, I'm hoping to study there for a few years, and plan to live in London after I graduate

[UKBA](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/eligibility/naturalisation/standardrequirements/) is a good place to start with this. As far as I know, acceptance at a British University ~= a visa for the length of your course. The residency period is 5 years, so you will need to either get a work [visa](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/working/) after you graduate or stay on in academia to make it to 5 years. 

Unfortunately, the work visa will be hard to come by, as the current government have (idiotically) put a cap of ~20,000 on the number of visas they will give to non-EU immigrants. I wish I could tell you that this will change by the time it comes to you, but in the current political climate, I doubt it will. This will likely be your main problem as far as getting citizenship is concerned.

[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html?_r=0) in 2010:

&gt; Last March, three American evangelical Christians, whose teachings about “curing” homosexuals have been widely discredited in the United States, arrived here in Uganda’s capital to give a series of talks. 

&gt; For three days, according to participants and audio recordings, thousands of Ugandans, including police officers, teachers and national politicians, listened raptly to the Americans, who were presented as experts on homosexuality. The visitors discussed how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how “the gay movement is an evil institution” whose goal is “to defeat the marriage-based society and replace it with a culture of sexual promiscuity.”
&gt; 
&gt; Now the three Americans are finding themselves on the defensive, saying they had no intention of helping stoke the kind of anger that could lead to what came next: a bill to impose a death sentence for homosexual behavior.

Their claim to have no intention of helping is ludicrous. Homophobia was widespread in Uganda and anyone who turns up there to give a talk riling people up on the subject would know that they are lighting a match next to a powder keg.

And the guy from Exodus International is just one of the speakers. Scott Lively, one of the most loathsome preachers of homophobia in the United States has also done a speaking tour of Russia pushing people there to adopt homophobic laws. There's [now a lawsuit going on against him](http://www.advocate.com/news/world-news/2013/08/15/scott-lively-will-be-tried-fueling-antigay-persecution-uganda). He's said he's [a bit sorry but he's still well proud of his work in Uganda](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/06/05/anti-gay-evangelist-scott-lively-i-dont-support-ugandan-kill-the-gays-bill-but-it-is-courageous/). He [claims he didn't draft it](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/scott-lively-defends-his-anti-gay-activism-uganda-while-denying-role-crafting-anti-homosexua) but that he's a big fan.

As for why American right-wingers would care about Uganda? Simple. They care about their social agenda. They aren't particularly bothered where they push it so long as they push it. And, thanks to a rather wonderfully rapid drop in the amount of homophobia in American society (see the unexpected but wonderful rise in states that allow same-sex marriage) they have realised that they aren't going to be able to push their social agenda on the US as effectively any more. So they discovered that hate is an exportable product.",0,1381867674,null,0,false,0,ccsccv7,t3_1oho8a,t1_ccsccv7,t1_ccs5yic,null,1429120378,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

No, unions are thugs. And thugs succeed by working in gangs. Gangs exercising power through intimidation.

To the extent that union thugs have lawyers on their side brings a level of political influence that has, over the years, bought protection from common-sense harassment laws.

The very idea that it is lawful to bring a city to a standstill while a handful of tube drivers demand an ever-higher wage hardly qualifies for a morality award.

Ultimately the problem lies with those who buy the propaganda - that strike breakers are weakening a cause; that a unilateral show of force is a ""right"". How can anybody not see through this?

No union supports individual human rights. No union recognises simple supply and demand. No union is willing to step aside for a worker genuinely content to take a lower salary and worse working conditions - yet who can argue they have a greater right to a job than another human being willing to work for less?

Either you want a house badly or you don't but don't say there aren't any affordable ones when what you actually mean is there aren't any of what you see as your dream house. Maybe that's why my generation found it easier  to buy houses...we basically bought what we could afford rather than what we dreamt of was our perfect house and put the graft and money in to make it what we wanted. Generation Y seems to want their first house to be their ideal house they just have to walk into and do nothing to and then whine and bitch because they can't afford them because a house like that usually means they're a lot more expensive than a true starter house/flat.

Another issue I have with this (and it is just an unfortunate implication) is that kids from an upper-class background who speak to their friends naturally (or are trained into it from a young age, rather) in quite a 'proper' way would not be expected to change their way of speaking in a new way for class or to be perceived as more worthy of getting a job etc. Although this may be another issue, it brings back memories of northerners, irish and scottish people etc having to be trained to speak differently and eradicate their accents before being employed at the BBC because the way they spoke naturally wasnt seen as being ""acceptable"".

The costly mistakes Kenny made were really important in forming the current philosophy employed by FSG.

true,tachyons22,null,null,"The UK is very expensive. You'll be looking at $20,000/year for tuition on average, plus $12,000 ($14,500 if your school is in London) per year for maintenance. The good (just good, so like the top 40% of schools, excluding the top 10% because they'll want better scores than what I'm about to say) schools will want to see that you have at least 600 in each section of your SAT, PLUS 2-3 AP or SAT IIs, each with high scores, as in 4 or 5 in AP and 600+ in SAT IIs.

About unis, you should find a good school for your course, which blueb0g has already done. You can then pick quite a few and search for a course [here](http://search.ucas.com/). UCAS is your one-stop shop for applying to uni, you search for a course, apply to it through their service, and receive their decision through it as well. Application deadline is mid-January, and it costs $20 to apply to one course, and $37 to apply to 2-5 courses, but you can't apply to more than 5. 

Back to funding, you're only eligible for loans from the US. There are some scholarships available for undergraduate students from the US but they are far and few between, so expect competition.

About citizenship, you need to be living in the UK for at least 5 years to apply. Time spent studying **does not count** towards these 5 years, so keep that in mind. You'll have to get a work visa, and to do so any company that wants to hire you will have to prove that there isn't a single person in the EU that could fill that position over the course of a searching for one for a month, and every application they receive from a UK national they have to give a reason why they turned down that application before they can even begin to look for non-EU workers. So you, a fresh graduate with no work experience in a field that is extremely saturated, will be competing with people not in the EU (if the job in question can even be found because there are plenty of EU English majors) that have PhDs, masters, etc. With your degree, it'll be impossible to just stay in London after you graduate. Your best bet if you want to stay with English and only look to immigrate to the UK would be to get your PhD (preferably do all of your education in the States as it's cheaper over there) in English, work for 10 years, then look for work in the UK. You have to realise that you are not a 'special snowflake' in your field, there are millions of unemployed EU citizens just like you with right to work before you. Not to sound harsh, but it's the truth. There's a reason why the UK is one of the hardest countries in the world to immigrate to.

true,AndreCompadre,tardis,TARDIS,"First off, I don't think Moffat is telling us to watch again to tell us that the Doctor simply has *one* more regeneration because the Second didn't 'technically' regenerate to the Third. I think he's pointing us to the Tenth's regeneration that he stopped, essentially using up a regeneration but staying the same Doctor. If Hurt's Doctor is a regeneration between Eight and Nine but an incarnation that the Doctor doesn't count in his numbering because of the terrible things he did, Smith is the Thirteenth and final Doctor. This also gives the 50th Anniversary and Christmas specials more importance, and jives with Moffat's recent comments that the 50th Anniversary is more about making sure there's a 100th Anniversary, which means he probably intends to deal with this issue sooner rather than later. He doesn't want Series 8 and Capaldi's run to be overshadowed by a looming sense of fear that the show might be ending.

As far as the actual limit goes, it all comes down to whether the regeneration limit is biological or legal.

If it's biological and the above assumptions about Hurt and Metacrisis Ten are true, then Matt Smith is the final. River Song may have transferred her remaining regenerations to him when she revived him in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", and he's got a few more to go. I think the comments here about the regenerations becoming more destructive are true, and it may also be possible that something radical happens with his time stream after twelve, which explains his corpse/raw time stream on Trenzalore. (Maybe it kills the TARDIS too, and he will have to grow a new one from a piece of her coral)

But I think the idea that the limit is legal is most likely. When the Doctor died in ""Let's Kill Hitler"", River didn't just give him remaining regenerations but sacrificed her immortality so that he could live again, which explains why she's now just human. And this gives much more depth to their relationship and the Doctor's love for her- she did something in the spirit of ""The Doctor"", moments after killing him, and all she asked was ""Is he worth it?""

Either way, I think that what really matters is that the Doctor may not know any more than we do.

What i like about him is that he understands the history is important and rather than trying to bring in superstars he is bringing blue collar type players that want to fight. That are good but maybe are just breaking good and might have been look down at other clubs (Sturridge/coutinho)

So yea im glad that he has learned on the job and learned fast. But i still have yet to see how he reacts when things arent going his way (when we play badly and he doesnt make any appropriate changes or when a string of bad results come in) i am afraid in how he will react then.

true,OpticalData,tennant,Tennant,"Well. You're lucky that you've chosen to do the Eleventh. Out of all The Doctor's he's probably the easiest to do.

There are two options you can go down, the first is the expensive route, it involves trawling the internet for the most accurate costume you can find, a good starting point is the Abbyshot version of the Smith jacket, while it isn't all that accurate, it is licensed, if you want a major accurate Sonic the Celestial Toystore just released one, if not I'd go for the Sonic Remote version, although it doesn't extend it looks so much better than the plastic one.

You then want Skinny jeans, Celestial Toystore also does the Matt Smith boots if you want to really cash out, go to the website anyway to get an idea of what they look like. 

The shirt was made by Paul Smith for Series 5. It's very difficult to get a hold of. 

The second option, is the cheap way (YAY!).

Go to a charity shop. Most of them have a few tweed jackets, go around all of them and pick the most accurate one, throw on a white shirt a bowtie and some slim fit jeans (Also charity store?), buy some cheap boots and you're good to go.

Matt Smith cosplayers aren't picky. The pickiest ones tend to be Ten cosplayers (like myself) and Four cosplayers (in my experience of course).

I hope this all helps. 

Ah, noticed you said new outfit -

It's A LOT harder to do, I think Magnoli Clothiers, Baron Boutique and Steve Ricks do good coats but they're VERY expensive.

Best bet? Charity shops. Google, look up tailors. Hell. Search 'Eleventh Doctor series 7 cosplay) on Ebay.

It's all out there, you just have to look. The harder you look, depending on the direction you want to go it'll either be cheaper or more accurate. ",0,1381877525,null,0,false,0,ccsg548,t3_1oj6se,t1_ccsg548,t3_1oj6se,null,1429118613,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,chaucerrific,null,null,"I might first separate ""deeds"" into process and result. The reasons and manner in which someone does something, and then what actually happens. So a traditional hero would one who has good process and good results (for all values of good where justice and righteousness are contextually sound). An anti-hero deviates from this equation—Batman has good results (criminals in jail) through questionable process (operating outside the law). 

The Doctor, naturally, takes the hero paradigm and makes it wibbly-wobbly. I really like /u/jimmysilverrims observation about the Doctor's motivations, though I might add this is often true for complex characters. His reasons for doing things are certainly gives me pause. I'm a newly minted Whovian, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but it *seems* like the Doctor's process falls in the realm of good. Means well, tries to bring light to dark where he can, &amp;c &amp;c. It's just the results don't always match up. People die, worlds end, and the survivors are left with the bitter taste of the Doctor's good intentions. It fits the anti-hero profile, but with an odd twist. Or wibble-wobble. Probably both.

So, to answer your question, I do think the Doctor could be classified as an anti-hero, but that isn't really a bad thing. ""Hero"" and ""heroism"" have such strong moral connotations. I wish there was a word for ""person whose actions reverberate on an epic scale."" Because moral actions require a fixed point from which to judge things, and I have no idea what the Doctor's moral anchor might be.

The argument is that pupils need to learn to speak in a proper manner in a professional setting. Well, this has been going on for decades, the teachers themselves used slang and they have learnt automatically, to not use it in the workplace. There really is no argument that the school puts forward, for the rule to be in place. 

&gt;All the pupils have to do is mind their language within earshot of a teacher. If they are, given your attestation, naturally able to do so, is that really a problem?

There isn't a problem of whether pupils can code switch when its required. The problem is that some people don't like this slang and it is by my opinion that I think that, this rule was enforced on the basis of preference, and disguised as a well-thought out policy when in fact, it's just what someone was moaning about because of their own feelings. It puts the teacher's needs ahead of the students. The fact is, it's a school, a place for education for the next step in life. If teachers really can't deal with minor grievances like this, they are not entitled to their high security job. It's not abuse in any manner. It's a person's choice whether they want to use language like this amongst their peers. It's certainly isn't acceptable in an essay of any sort, but if this was about not having slang in an essay, it would say ""Slang is banned from all use in schoolwork"", wouldn't it?

To me the ""free press"" is Reddit, or Tumblr, or Twitter, or anywhere else someone can express their ideas, where almost anyone can view them, without needing approval from the ""establishment.""

The first thing on the tour is going inside the stadium. There are a couple of minutes before they sit you down and begin, this is the best time to get camera shots of the inside of the stadium. Bring a wide angled lens if you have one. Later on in the tour you enter the stadium briefly at a much higher level, you don't spend time there though so be quick with your photos.

They hurry you a little bit I found, but overall the tour is great. It is more a look at ""behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge"" rather than a tour focusing on Chelsea history which I would have liked a bit more of.

On what you say about the press you aren't completely correct in that you overlook the good that a lot of newspapers do, /u/backtowriting gets it right below when talking about the sign of a free press. The freedom to investigate someone or something, the freedom to publicly use that information without consent if it is deemed valuable to the public and the basic function of informing would be compromised if the press had to constantly watch its back for attack and censorship. It is with that in mind that these laws are so contentious.

Also about what you said on the tradition of ""free press"", it isn't to be used literally and never really was. It is an overarching term for freedom of expression, something that obviously has a fine line between complete freedom and censorship and that line is being dangerously played with currently.

&gt; You cannot expect Twitter (as a collective of people) to go and investigate MPs expenses and such. 

See, I think you can. And I think they do. There's nothing special about the vast majority of ""the press"" other than that they have better funding, better connections and more influence. Increasingly we are seeing them report on stories uncovered elsewhere.

And increasingly we are seeing ""the press"" become more and more part of the government system, with an interest in maintaining stability over trying to rock the boat. While they seem happy to attack individual politicians or policies when they go against their interests (see the Mail and Ed Miliband) they usually seem happy to keep to the official line.

true,apocbz,null,null,"I think this whole thing can be solved by three simple pieces of legislation (special legislation aside from libel), and one initiative.

1. Massive fines for provable lies (not mistakes), or contempt of court (e.g. the Christopher Jefferries case. 50k + 20k in libel, plus 8 papers pay a combined ""6 figure"" sum. So at worst each paper paid 100k, at best maybe 10k. For those papers, it's small change). Stack them as well, every provable lie/contempt incident has a higher fine than the last.

2. Double size retractions. The retractions for an intentional lie, or for a story which resulted in a contempt of court decision, must be double the size they previously were and promoted at least 3 pages forward (or to front page if on page 2 or 3) from where they were. If a paper was having to print full front page ""We lied and were fined £8 million because it's our 4th offence this year"", they would be out of business pretty soon.

3. Full front page publication of convictions for contempt, or apologies in libel cases. Full front page, not buried.

4. The initiative will be to enact the current law of the land, and prosecute journalists, paps and papers when they break the law. Currently it does not happen, and if it did would make a massive difference.

My first two suggestions sound harsh but only apply to two specific cases, provable lies and contempt. The Ralph Miliband story was not a provable lie, we can't know 100% that he *didn't* actually secretly despise Britain. Simply cases where the paper can be proven to have lied intentionally, and there are plenty of those.

The third one means they can't just hide when they fuck up. Again, Mr Jefferries was front page news, but their apology was ""public"" meaning made outside the courthouse and shown on the news, not published in the paper. Most of the their readers will be unaware just how wrong their paper was.

I don't believe that any of these impinge on press freedom. In fact, 99% of DM articles would pass those tests. I just want to make it so that when a paper destroys someone's life with lies, that that person can pretty much cripple the paper in return.

Even if all it did was result in celebs being helped, I think the sheer embarrassment and cost of multiple front page apologies per year would drive papers to up their standards.",0,1381887981,null,0,false,0,ccsk62k,t3_1oj2eg,t1_ccsk62k,t3_1oj2eg,null,1429116709,33,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,33

I know it sounds reasonable that newspapers only print the facts, but how do you enforce that?  What do you do when facts are disputed?  Should the courts step in to resolve problems?

It's interesting to compare the US system in which newspapers have greater leeway to print false information about individuals.  Counterintuitive as it may seem, I think they have the better system!

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"So I guess it's important to make a distinction about what freedom of speech is.

Wikipedia defines freedom of speech as:

&gt;...the political right to communicate one's opinions and ideas using one's body and property to anyone who is willing to receive them.

I entirely and completely endorse this idea. Any person, company, publication etc. should be allowed to make their opinions and ideas known to anyone willing to listen.

What newspapers shouldn't be doing is publishing those ideas and opinions as facts, or in such a way to present them as fact, if they cannot back them up.

Do I believe that this will result in a perfect world of objective reporting? No, because there is the famous saying that there are ""lies, damn lies and statistics"". 

Even if newspapers had to back up everything they say with fact (which isn't what I'm suggesting) you'll still have 2 different publications report two different points of view. Likewise stuff like market research, opinion polling etc is open to manipulation so they should be able to find fact to back up most things.

If we stick with the Jimmy Saville thing, broadly speaking let's say a news company gets hold of the fact that someone is saying Jimmy Saville molested them.

The headline newspapers should never be scared of publishing is:

""Jimmy Saville accused of sexual assault""

What they *should* be scared of publishing is:

""My sexual assault story: How Jimmy Saville Molested Me""

On the other hand you should be able to publish whatever opinion pieces you want. If you wish to write an editorial saying ""I think he's totally done it, I mean look at him he even looks like a pedo!"" you should be more then welcome to. There's a difference between writing something that is clearly an opinion of the writer and writing something as fact that isn't. 

I'm not saying this is an easy distinction to make however.

I also don't think a press regulator should have much power beyond forcing the paper to publish an apology. I also think the apology should match the level of coverage the story was given, so if you run a front page story for 3 weeks spreading lies and it turns out it was false, your apology needs to take up the front page. 

Other then that there should be help for genuine cases where ""poorer"" individuals try to take on a newspaper that has behaved incorrectly, simply because legal costs are high and without the help fighting newspapers becomes the preserve of the rich. 

I couldn't stand the idea for example of having a news media like in the US where Fox news can basically out right lie every day and get away with it. Until a point where the country has achieved a level of general education where the majority of the population see right through stuff like that I'm not comfortable with giving people a free reign to abuse their freedom of speech.

Those workers have to unite into 'gangs' as you call them in order to make a stand, because if they did it individually, it would be completely ineffective. Of course a union doesn't care about 'individual rights', because campaigning for people on an individual basis is, as said before, ineffective - they're working for the rights of the entire group, which just happen to translate into benefits for all. They're not going to strike for the rights of a single person unless something happened to a single worker that was particularly serious, and they want the decision reversed or the issue resolved before it sets a precedent for other workers. To do that, they need to work as a group.

Dave decided not to work today because he feels like he should get paid more? I guess we're down a man for a while, fire Dave and get someone else in.

A good chunk of your workforce decide not to work today because they all feel that they're underpaid? You can't just fire most of your workforce without taking a serious hit, and rehiring may take more time and cost more money than it's worth, in the meantime, you're seriously undermanned.

Dave was seriously injured due to safety issues with his equipment thanks to cost cutting exercises on the part of the organisation? A union may campaign to have those safety standards improved to prevent it from happening in the future.

The thing is, workers recognise that striking can cause serious issues in the workplace; it causes their employer serious grief, which can threaten their source of income, and it can cost them money through their protesting - the decision to go on strike is not one that's taken lightly, and they have to be sure that whatever they're protesting for actually worth protesting for.

Also, your point is bizarre: A union should step aside because someone is willing to work for less money, or worse working conditions? That person taking a poor pay, or willing to work in unsafe working conditions undermines the point that the union is trying to make, even if it's only slightly, and if the precedent is set, that can affect all of the other workers. You can bet your ass that they're not going to be happy with people going against the unionised workers' collective cause - they're perfectly within their rights to be unhappy.

I work in IT, which is not a traditionally unionised profession, and I know a lot of people in IT who have worked for peanuts, and will remain at an organisation out of some kind of loyalty for it, despite being paid less than half of what they're worth. They tell me about how they constantly have new responsibilities thrust upon them, far beyond their original job specification, without any kind of additional compensation. I actively encourage them to ask for raises, stating average pay for these responsibilities as their source, or to look for better paid jobs.

Why? Because their willingness to work for less pay than they're worth diminishes the value of what they do, which in turn sets precedent in those organisations, and they start to offer lower pay for IT positions - so it in turn diminishes the value of what I do too.

IT often is seen as a department that purely costs the company money, rather than looking into the value it provides the organisation by enabling other departments to work, or the constant maintenance that goes into keeping things running smoothly: If your IT is bad in your organisation, things will go down regularly, and IT will look busy, as they're constantly fighting fires to try and keep things running. If IT is good in your organisation, they shouldn't appear busy, because they've done a good job setting up their systems and are maintaining them well, to the point where even when issues crop up, they don't affect the other moneymaking departments who rely on IT to keep ticking. The irony is that it's easy to devalue IT already in the second case, because they don't appear to be doing anything, despite the fact that having properly compensated, experienced staff is essential to keeping the second example running smoothly.

But Bob working for peanuts continues to perpetuate the idea that IT is somehow a profession that requires little skill, because if he's willing to do local IT support, has managed to set up the entire office network using the consumer grade switches they gave him (because Cisco is expensive!) despite them constantly needing power cycling, desktop deployments, clustered network storage setup, and set up a VM cluster for multiple servers that he also administrates, and do it all for barely more than minimum wage, it can't be that hard, right? So, I encourage others to ask for raises or leave for better paid jobs in order to, in some small part, protect my own profession. I do it as much for myself as I do it for others in my line of work.",0,1381892052,null,0,false,0,ccsls2q,t3_1oio3v,t1_ccsls2q,t1_ccscdbf,null,1429115895,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
