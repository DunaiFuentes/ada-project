(FYI as long as you drive under 85mph on the motorways there is basically zero chance that you will get stopped). You'll find driving in the UK far more hectic than driving in the US, most people don't use cruise control on motorways, and that really influences the way people drive, on smaller roads its not uncommon to have cars parked on both sides with only room for 1 car between them, you often end up in situations where you're driving head on towards someone, so enjoy that :D

York, lincoln, whitby and Durham would be good stopping places, as well as Oxford and Cambridge.

These are some woods there with a stream flowing through (this stream feeds ladybower) and several camping spots can be found.

You're not supposed to camp there but I've been several times (even with my kids) and occasionally found others there too. 

That's a good place for a day or two. If you want to make a longer camp, I'd head north of the border.",0,1374385244,null,0,false,0,cb71vd8,t3_1iqigz,t1_cb71vd8,t3_1iqigz,null,1430391994,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Anotherfuckwit,english,England,"Oh, and provisions:

Firefighters, waterproof matches (and in the UK it's handy to carry a handful of dry kindling just to get a fire started if you're not used to it)

A tarp: about 20quid or so from decathlon for a good one or you can makeshift one using a builder's tarp from b&amp;q for about £3 or £4. Really useful to hang between trees **high** above a fire because you'll want to gather round it even if it rains.

A BBQ grill. Or, if you want cheaper, a replacement wire rack for a grill pan. Use rocks you find to build a stand around your fire and use the grill to cook on. A pizza tray is also useful. If you are not used to cooking on a fire, don't take chicken! The easiest things are simple sausages and cheap nasty burgers. Another thing I used to take when I first started out were packets of 'Vegeburgers' that you mix with water and cook on the pizza tray. They're actually really tasty and you know you're not going to poison anyone. Fresh corn is delicious. Pinch a few ketchup sachets from the cafeteria at college - much handier than a bottle!

Take water with you or have purifying tablets and boil it first - you don't know about the rotting dead sheep further up stream.

Store your beers in the brook.

**Take your mess home with you!**

And finally: if you want to 'cheat' a little and have the same feel there's a couple of options: drive there and park at the snake pass inn. Use the car to get provisions whenever you need them from tesco(?) at Glossop (I once brought my kids a KFC one evening).

Or, there are campsites that allow open fires. This is how we sometimes holiday now if we want to go for a week or so and don't fancy travelling abroad. all of our meals are made on the fire (full english, steak and chips, even a full 'roast' dinner once! just google them, they're cheaper than normal camp sites because provisions tend to be poorer.

My ex had convinced them that I was at risk of self harm and rather than speak to the local policing team, and who I had been working with for years to improve my neighbourhood, or goto the trouble of calling my mobile number, which they had, they kicked in my front door.


the neighbourhood back then was full of drug dealers and associated trades so kicking in a door was a regular occurrence and they tended to be replaced the next day as the police would fund the repair as it was part of the operational budget. However in my case the cost was not covered as the police had acted in error, although a warrant was issued it was issued incorrectly as the police had rushed the gun. 


I was out of work at the time and I had a front door that was cracked from top to bottom and could be opened by just pushing it and making it fold inwards without the funds to fix the door.


As the police admitted they did not have justification to enter they could not fund the repair my housing association said they require the police to fund the repair and I couldn't leave my house as it was unsecure. 


I finally got the funds together to get the door replaced but I took me just short of eight weeks. 


during that eight weeks the police continued to conduct raids in my neighbourhood and made a number of arrests and in that time mine was the only door that was not replaced.


the principal of making good after a raid or criminal event is not one that is a requirement of the police but it is one they will tend to do but in cases when the police may be at fault they may be reluctant to make good any damage as the could be considered an admission of guilt.

Sort of like a hybrid between a secure psychiatric unit and a prison... The idea would be to use this enviornment to research and develop new effective psychological and even medical stratergies to prevent these people reoffending. 

*Obviously the utterly unrepentent paedophile who has also produced images (i.e. directly abused a child) should spend a significant amount of time in a regular criminal justice prison... but those that have been caught with images and no other criminal history would be better targeted for treatment. 

In an ideal future world, a paedophile might even 'come out' to authorities early on in their life to seek treatment - then that might stop them ever reaching the stage where they do something unforgivable. It could be incentivised by promising them anonymity while they are undergoing treatment and no criminal record provided treatment is sucessful. 

Edit: Not sure why this is getting hated - personally i'd much rather save my tax money on keeping people in prison at a cost of £40K per year, if they could somehow be reformed and returned to society.

I wouldn't exactly call them light, there are much lighter carbon lids out there, but you do get all the nice features.

Double D-ring system, internal sun visor and dedicated shell cut-outs for sharktooth (Shark bluetooth system).

The sun visor is a little short and could do with dropping another few mm, but it's one of the longest I've seen. Sadly it's UK legal spec, which is great when you are stopped by the police but crap in bright sun light. Luckily we don't get too much of that here, so it's just fine 99% of the time.

The Sharktooth system is pricey but very good. The cut outs provide a very compact system when fitted and give a good weight distribution. The battery lasts a good while and has a micro-usb jack for convenient charging on mobile phone plugs, which means you can also charge it from your bike when you are touring!

KDB is a weak tackler. He is probably going to be a winger for Chelsea. I am not sure where the whole idea that he is capable of playing deeper came from. He played as a CM in WB and sometimes with Belgium(mostly winger/CAM now), but he was more of the playmaker that didn't have to worry so much about tracking back. Totally different scenario. With that said, KDB is going to be a winger/AM, like a Hazard.

Van Ginkel has talent, but, the PL is a huge step up from Eredivisie. Also, you can only win the award once. Eriksen and Maher have already won the award the previous years. Those two are the top talent talents thats going to come out of the Dutch league. 

I can not see Van Ginkel featuring in regular matches. Perhaps he will he will get some time in the FA or CC. There is a reason why he ""only"" cost 8m. He is just not polished and it will take time for him. I would rather have someone who is experience and won't crack under pressure.

Chelsea only has one replacement for Mikel, and that is Essien. That in itself is very scary. 

Luiz is going to be playing as a CB. I think he is going to get a bigger role with his playmaking ability.

A company, to itself, has zero responsibility to the society it operates in. It operates there out of convenience and only takes so much governmental pressure before seeking somewhere cheaper and more efficient to work. It is how businesses operate.

Companies are not altruistic entities offering jobs for the hell of it. They offer jobs because they need something doing, and if it cost of the worker is more than the productivity gained from that worker, they will drop the worker. If the cost of operating the business is too much, they will leave the area. 

It's not that you *can't* just force companies to pay a living wage. If the political will was there you could do it.

true,narthgir,null,null,"Look, arguing against politicians earning high salaries is one thing, but arguing they deserve no travel expenses (like some are arguing here) is totally different.

Claiming expenses for their children to travel is questionable at best, and on the scale he is doing it is is unacceptable, but hear my reasoning out for travel expenses:

MPs simply have to be given them. Several posters here state things like ""They know London is their place of work when they become an MP"". That is simply false, MPs must represent their constituency, which requires meeting constituents and having a local presence in their community. If they all up and moved to London and never visit back (and some already don't) that would be terrible for democracy. 

If you want to say they should only get a base salary, then the MP for Inverness pays a huge amount more of his pay on travel than a London MP. How is that fair? He literally cannot avoid it, if he is to represent his constituents, he must travel home. Not only is it not fair, now the London MP is paid too much! 

Like it or not, we should pay our MPs well for a couple of reasons:

1. We don't want only rich people to be in politicians, which is already a problem. If less well off people in Scotland think ""Yeah I'd love to be an MP but I won't be able to afford the travel to and from the constituency"" then we have a major problem!

2. It's surely better that MPs are compensated by the state than by lobbyists. If a less well off MP found themselves in financial difficulties due to expenses placed on them by their job, even minor difficulties, then a few quid for a parliamentary question becomes even more attractive. Lets avoid any possiblity for corruption because it seems too fucking easy already.

As for children, I wouldn't object to them making occasional trips to visit their father. I would much rather our politicians and leaders weren't distracted by the family difficulties imposed by living apart and spending little time together. At the moment it looks like there are too many tax payer funded trips, but I wouldn't rule out any - it is a circumstance imposed on them by their job.

This does not include their Annual Leave either... Nice long periods of time at home...

Wait lets look at their other generous Remuneration for such a 'challenging job'

&gt;The pension scheme for MPs is the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund (PCPF). 
&gt;Employee Contribution rates from 1 April 2012 are 

&gt;1/40th accrual: 13.75%, 

&gt;1/50th accrual: 9.75%,  

&gt;1/60th accrual: 7.75%  pensionable salary.


than tack on the London Expenses allowance (for 2nd accommodation), generous expenses accounts, and it is only for 4 years!! (unless you get elected again)

&gt;You have a choice, you can move closer to your work.

Yes I could, but I choose not to, knew this when I took up my job. the MP could move from where he lives to a location 50% of the way between his two offices....

&gt;Not a great choice, but my point is that your job doesn't demand that you live miles away from where you work.
 His, by definition, does! Surely he has to be compensated? 

He is already compensated!! that is the whole point, he gets a London Living Allowance, Subsidised Housing, Travel Expenses etc FOR HIMSELF.


Which I accept, what I do not accept is then claiming expense for his children to travel and stay with him in London. Surely he earns enough money from his MP job (and possibly Non Exec jobs on the side) to pay for this himself?

As someone else said, we have soldiers around the world, deployed in combat zones, who knew this when they took the job, you do not see their children being subsidised to fly out to other countries to see their parents..

We do not see Oil Companies flying children out the Rigs on their own money to spend time with Parents who are out there for weeks and months at a time...

Christ most people who live in their own homes with their own children sometimes do not see them for long periods,. mainly due to the hours THEY have to work to survive...

I'm afraid I don't know anyone looking for a flatmate at the moment but maybe the info below will be of some help;


The Edinburgh Festival is about to kick off so there won't be many rooms available until late August/early September.  

In the UK, shared rooms are the exception rather than the rule.

The university has **[postgraduate only halls](http://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/accommodation)** where the monthly rent covers your electric/gas and internet charges too.  The rooms are of a basic standard but the services and quality are reliable, you'll meet other pg students and you'll not get swindled.  The cheapest private rooms the university offers is £400 per month and they're taking applications now.  If you're coming to Edinburgh alone, this is the cheapest option and you'll meet lots of people in halls.

If you want to **rent privately** then there is lots of information **[here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/accommodation-services/new-prospective/types-guides/private-housing/overview)**.  A resonable price to pay for a one bedroom flat is about £400-450 per month.  If you can find someone to share with you can get a two bedroom flat for about £600 per month so you save a lot of money by sharing.  Studenty areas of the city are Marchmont, Newington, Pleasance, Bruntsfield and (postgrads) Morningside.

**Alternatively**, you could check out the notice boards in Potterrow and KB house when you get here, although there's no guarantee there'll be any adverts posted.. and I realise that's leaving it quite late.

If you **wanted to wait** until you were here to look at rooms, you could always book a hostel for a few nights until you found something better.  I think the university offers a similar service but charges a lot more for the per-night rental.",0,1374408421,null,0,false,0,cb75dd4,t3_1iqrkw,t1_cb75dd4,t3_1iqrkw,null,1430390345,3,false,Edinburgh_University,t5_2tgwd,3

I'd rather them not be distracted by family woes and problems caused by some of them signing up to work hundreds of miles away from home for 5 year stints.

Saying that, 4 grand a year is way too much considering he travels home too. One or two trips a year would be OK by me to be honest.

Same for the military though, obviously the kids can't visit a warzone, but more family leave or flying kids to a neutral holiday location wouldn't make me freak out. I think if people are serving the country (even in the much less lethal form of being an MP) and are forced by that job to be apart from family and away from home, we should attempt to prevent that affecting their service.

I'd rather Alexander was worrying about the budget than about family problems.

I know it's not fair because those of us in normal jobs won't get that perk, but most of us don't do a job that demands you live away from your family and live a half-and-half life.

It's not unheard of, most employers know a good family life is essential in that sort of job.

EDIT: It's unpopular, but MPs do an important job so them being well treated does not bother me at all, I don't think the benchmark should be how we are treated, because most of us work in private industry and hate our employers for their shitty treatment!

Basically, I'd assume the main part behind this is that if you google 'Child Porn', it would come up with a big message saying 'This search term is banned you get not results at all'. 

Now, I don't even agree for doing this with terms like 'Child Porn', as people not wanting to actually view it, rather research the topic, will be blocked from doing so. 

However, it brings up a much more worrying option for the government. They could block terms like 'The Pirate Bay', or 'VPN, or 'Proxy', or hell, if they felt like it, 'Alternatives to the Conservative Party' (although I don't think they'd go that far, they are setting the seeds). Of course, they could do this as well under the guise of stopping paedophiles, saying that the only people who need to hide their internet history are ones doing naughty things. 

Of course there will always be a way around it, but I really don't like the idea of blocking search terms.

[His website](http://www.rdwolff.com/) includes a fairly large back-catalogue of courses on Marxism, lectures, podcasts and whatnot.

Kevin Carson is an individualist/mutualist anarchist who has written some fascinating if somewhat dry and technical works critiquing the bullshit notion of free markets under capitalism and exploring mutualist alternatives, such as, Studies in Mutualist Political Economy, [The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand](http://www.mutualist.org/id4.html) (which I would most recommend), The Homebrew Industrial Revolution, Organization Theory and Intellectual Property.  All of which can be bought or tracked down online for free if you prefer.

[Here's](http://c4sif.org/2013/01/kevin-carson-how-intellectual-property-impedes-competition/) an example of Carson addressing the same kind of area as you were above.  Edit:  It should be noted that Carson's target audience are generally the more socially aware and inellectually honest right wing libertarians, so he tends to use their language a lot, rather than the traditional language of socialism.

true,narthgir,null,null,"&gt;My problem is that in the real world, we all have to pay for everything ourselves. I lose half my salary to rent and travel. 

Yes, but does your job enforce that travel on you? It's like you ignored my entire point which I laid out and explained. The very definition of being an MP requires them to work from two different locations. They by their job description have to commute from London to their constituency regularly.

They don't have a choice. You do, you can try to move yourself closer to work - that might not be a realistic choice, but they literally have no choice, they have to work in both locations.

&gt;My answer would be to raise MP's salary to £100k and completely remove ALL expenses. Add weighting for distance from London and major population centres etc

Then I'm sorry to say your answer hasn't been thought through. There is a reason no private industry company does this for travel expenses, it is inefficient and unfair. 

Travel is variable, some years they may be recalled to Westminster regularly for votes, other years they may not be. Some railway routes cost more than others, travelling on different days or different times of year costs different amounts. No private company ever does this and they exist solely to maximise profits - they don't pay expenses for fun.

Given that **they absolutely have to do this travel as a part of their job** it is unfair to say ""they just manage it themselves"". 

Then for people living in London they get 100 grand even though they never were claiming expenses, so now you are paying them too much. That is unfair on the MPs from outside London, unless you weigh it so that it perfectly covers their expenses above 100 grand - then you are just paying expenses and have given them a huge raise.

Sorry, but that is not the answer, it doesn't even make any sense.

Every private company will tell you it makes sense to pay based on receipts, then you don't overpay anyone (bad for the company) or underpay anyone (bad for the employee).

Why do you want to treat them in an unfair way that nobody else who has a job which requires travel is treated? Because you don't like them?

I don't want to pay MPs 100 grand, I want to pay them what they are on now and cover their provable, acceptable expenses. That saves more money for the taxpayer.",0,1374417020,null,0,false,0,cb76rse,t3_1iqrkq,t1_cb76rse,t1_cb76m5x,null,1430389615,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Civil List expenditure has increased by 94 per cent in real terms over the last two decades.

£202.4m is equivalent to the cost of 9,560 nurses, 8,200 police officers, annual Ministry of Defence spending on food and the total reduction in Sure Start funding.

The British monarchy is 112 times as expensive as the Irish president and more than twice as expensive as the French semi-presidential system.
 
Britain's royal family is the most expensive in Europe at more than double the cost of the Dutch
monarchy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's worth noting that Germany isn't some magical economic heaven either. Germany has no minimum wage, which is one of the reasons why it is the economic powerhouse of Europe. Everyone seems to think Germany is magically successful because Germans are more efficient or work longer hours, but this simply isn't true, the main cost in any manufacturing is human labour and Germans get paid one of the lowest wages in Europe (almost half what people in Spain and Greece earn). 

Does this mean that the average German citizen has a poor quality of life? No, because material things are a lot cheaper to buy in Germany, which is why constantly increasing the minimum wage won't increase peoples quality of life here, and just ultimately result in less jobs. Also worth noting is that in Germany home ownership is the lowest in Europe and it's very rare to actually own your home, most people rent, which a lot of people in this country wouldn't accept. 

A few people in this thread have said that we should have stronger unions like in Germany, but the unions in the UK would **never** agree to reform UK working law in the way that Germans operate. Unions in the UK are just interested in a quick cash grab and increasing their wages, they don't see the bigger picture that reducing their wages could result in more jobs and more stable employment. When people talk about making the economy more ""competitive"" that essentially means reducing wages and in turn to make things fair then reducing the cost of things for normal people to buy and reducing inflation. 

You can't let things run away from you or it's all over. You can set the minimum wage as arbitrarily high as you like, and people will be temporarily happy, but in the long term manufacturing jobs will disappear, unemployment will rise, prices will rise and noone will be able to buy anything and be broke and unhappy.

In the first message, Brand joked about Fawlty Towers and the fact that both he and Sachs had appeared in The Bill, but was interrupted by Ross shouting out ""he fucked your granddaughter"". The rest of the message and the following three messages were all characterised by Brand and Ross attempting to apologise for Ross' outburst, but each quickly descended into farce, with, for example, Brand singing to Sachs: ""It was consensual and she wasn't menstrual"" and Ross asking to marry him.[6] Brand later said that listening to those calls it is like hearing 'two idiots dancing towards a canyon.

No, that's called direct democracy.  We live in a representative democracy.  I find it fascinating that so many people want to have their say, but don't want to take the time to learn what they're having their say about (I'm referring to voters here, not you Mr Draper).  We elect officials to make these decisions for us, not to bitch and moan every time something doesn't go exactly the way we would like it.  It's their job to learn all about the EU and the pros/cons of staying/leaving, and then vote accordingly.  If the EU was such a cluster fuck, we would have left ages ago.

&gt;You cannot cede so much power to the European union without giving the British public a vote on the matter.

We're not ceding any power - we already had a referendum about that before we joined.  The people have their say when they vote for MPs/parties.  If you don't like what a party is doing, don't vote for them.  To give direct control over the most important decision of the last 30 years to the masses is ridiculous.

I didn't mean basic in the sense of looks, I meant that it doesn't seem to have a great deal of ""extras"" above protecting your head. I know that a lot of expertise and worksmanship goes into the helmets, but I was unsure if the trade-off between a stronger shell or more comfort. I didn't realise that the Arai has the liner which moulds to your head, thanks!
I believe Revzilla is where I researched the Speed-R, so I'll go check out their reviews of the Shoei and Arai. 

I'm not overly fussed on how the helmet looks. I read online that the helmet is the most visable part of an oncoming bike, so I went for a contrasting design in the hope that it would make me a little safer. 

Yeah a lot of people have said that the textiles aren't as waterproof as they are made out to be. I'd prefer to have a decent 2piece leather suit, but the prices seemed to jump up quite a bit, so I'll have a look around and see if I can find any nice entry level leathers. Sounds like you got an amazing deal on your gear. 

Yeah I will definitely be going to a store to try out how everything fits before I buy anything.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"Here's a post I wrote on another forum about getting rid of expenses:

&gt; An MP from the south is invited to a meeting in Scotland at short notice, the costs of travel and accommodation will come to roughly £500 for the meeting, the meeting could have an outcome that will be hugely beneficial for the MPs constituents, however... the MP has just invested in an extension for their house (they have another child on the way, MPs are real people too!) and spending £500 at short notice is not something they can really afford to do, so they opt to skip the meeting. Their constituents have lost out. 

&gt; Poor example but you get the idea. Removing expenses means MPs now have a personal financial consideration when it comes to doing things, which can (and would) lead to things being skipped to save money. Okay £500 might not be much in the grand scheme of things, but when your salary is £70,000 and your take home is ~£45,000 (£3700 per month) that means a couple of expensive events a month and you're eating into the money needed to pay for your kids food and a mortgage...

Regarding the amount that MPs earn... A lot of, I guess ""poor"", people comment on how earning £60k or whatever is an obscene amount of money that can literally buy anything you want. I earn more than MPs and it is absolutely not, personally I couldn't afford to travel up and down the country every week for work without being compensated for it, if I did then I'd have to sacrifice my savings.

Businesses have zero, I repeat, **zero** obligations or duties towards someone's perceived morals. They exist as an entity to be a vehicle for something.

Businesses have two duties. One to the law as it currently stands, and one to the shareholders.

Increasing the minimum wage to a ""living wage"" will do nothing but cause inflation to sharply increase day to day costs of living. This new so-called ""living wage"" will then quickly get to the point where a new ""living wage"" is needed, because everything has risen in prices that sharply.

In addition to that, you've then got a devalued currency (currency devaluation in foreign markets is a direct and measurable result of excessive domestic inflation), and a system whereby everything produced domestically is expensive in comparison to before the ""living wage"" was introduced, even after taking inflation into consideration.

A ""living wage"" is a soundbite, and nothing else.

Pepe would come at a price they'd be willing to pay and he's got all the attributes they look for. 

We sured up our future. Our spine. You can't set about planning the future and continue to incur losses each year at vital positions. We needed a plan without Pepe and we got one. We paid what Mignolet is, at this point, worth. We didn't get forced into spending over the odds in another Torres-Carroll situation. 

I just don't see us doing that again. We proved we would rather hold out than pay over the odds (ala Dempsey) and I see that continuing. Having Reina while we signed Mignolet allowed for that.

Hopefully a performance like that is the kind we can iron out, but the real issue is how little the team has changed from last season, both in terms of performance and faces. They were beaten in every department, with no Becchio to issue a 'get out of jail free card'. Even worse is that the fact that, despite having half a season to get used to each other, the defence has not improved. Admittedly there was no Sam Byram, who is basically a wonderkid, but Pearce is looking increasingly like a liability and Peltier is underperforming in what is supposed to be his main position.

I have genuine concerns about this team and don't believe that we have the resources to change it drastically.

How much potential is wasted because people were not given the chance. Scientists artists etc.
This nation could be the greatest nation on the planet. Technology provides us with the means for every man woman and child in this country to have a standard of living far greater for the majority than it is now, and if this means that the 1 percent have one less car of have a bit less money that they would never spend in the first place then so be it.
The top ten percentile of this nation owns 55 percent of the wealth. Does that seem fair?

One look at any news outlet sickens me and provides a mass of evidence supporting the need for change.

However, the EU simply can not be accused of having an ""uncompetitive worldview"" (whatever that means).

The EU does have a role to play in setting consumer protection standards across the continent, protecting ""cultural produce"", and so forth, but it's by and large a big, positive force for the mass liberalisation of the European economy, hence the enormous borderless single market that stands at it's core.

We will be hugely influenced by the European Union regardless of whether we exist inside or outside of it's borders. I take the view that whatever is wrong with it, it's not enough to warrant us leaving and losing all influence over the bloc, whilst haemorrhaging literally hundreds of thousands of jobs overnight and effectively severing economic ties with the rest of the Anglosphere and other large economies by losing our biggest trade advantage, namely being a member of the European bloc.

Comes with the job. It's not, however, constant.

As for what to wear, she has a personal designer that provides her with designs, she chooses which one she wants.

These farmers can produce food for a fraction of the cost despite having far less capital than European farmers. If they were given a chance to compete on an equal footing, they'd quickly be able to invest in better machinery/capital and further reduce their costs as well as increase output. This would make food cheaper for everyone and increase global food production significantly.

You are only one person out of 60 million. One reason why people are laughing at you is because you appear to have inflated sense of the importance of your own opinions.

&gt; this monopoly of power the government has

The government does not have a monopoly on power. It is dependent on the support of members of parliament, who are elected by the people every five years. It is also constrained by things like the courts, the human rights act, the EU, local government, and so on.

&gt; We need a new political party that listens to the people 

The problem is that there is no coherent 'people' and no 'average person'. Actually a significant proportion of the population are supportive of the government's current economic policies -- and that's particularly true in relation to policies like reducing expenditure on state benefits. The Labour party tried a more explicitly left-wing approach in the early 1980s, and suffered one of their worst election defeats.

&gt; I want a nation where we know we are giving the youth the best possible chance in the best possible environment to do good

How is your new political party going to pay for this? As mentioned somewhere else, things like Thatcher's funeral or policy regarding Syria will not buy you many hospitals. Clamping down on tax avoidance, raising the top rate of tax, etc, will get you some of the way. But what about the rest?

The government does indeed have a monopoly of power, At least from my limited experience. There are many cases every single day where these constraints you mention are shown to have failed. The courts fail on an almost daily basis and the human rights act is a complete failure. Go into any major city and you will see severe breaches of human rights. The fact that we have homeless shows that not every human in this country has the same rights.

I agree that there is no average person and that everyone wants different thing and this is one of the most difficult hurdles in any form of democracy in that how do you represent every person equally, This is a hurdle that I alone cannot tackle. However i feel that there is alot more that could be done to represent the majority of people and allow the minorites the freedom to represent themselves. 

There are places in this country that have nothing to do with politics entire pockets of people that do not vote have no say in anything that goes on in parliment as they feel it would be a waste of time anyway to do so. Would it be wrong to try and give these people a voice?

How would I fund it all? No idea. And until I know how it can be done, none of these are sustainable policies.

Currently what is happening with farmers in Africa (and in other third world countries) will consume what they need to sustain themselves and sell the surplus food produced. They'd be able to get a far better price for this food in western markets like the EU rather than domestically where they'd get a fraction of the price. 

As a result of the tariffs imposed on them these farmers would only be able to sell their produce domestically and make a far more modest living than they could potentially achieve. Add to that western farmers using 'dumping' practices in which heavily subsidised food is dumped in third world countries undercutting African farmers completely and you can see why food production in Africa isn't as high as it could be. By liberating the market and allowing farmers to export their produce, they are able to earn far more money from selling their food, able to reinvest this into more labourers or capital (like farming equipment, greenhouses, seeds, land) and food production increases. It also enables farmers to boost productivity of their land, attracts more people to work in the industry as wages rise and improves the infrastructure surrounding food exports meaning food can move around the country more easily. This resolves the biggest reason famine exists in Africa, low food production, low farming productivity and importantly, poor infrastructure making it difficult to access food produce. Also domestic food retailers would set up and the domestic food market would grow as a result. Put it this way, you're right that more food will be exported, but a hell of a lot more food will be produced and thus people in the domestic market will get access to far more food. 60% of 100,000 tons of food is a lot more than 100% of 800 tons of food put it that way.",0,1374429816,null,0,false,0,cb7adjz,t3_1iqvv1,t1_cb7adjz,t1_cb7a0su,null,1430387916,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's a fair point. One particular problem is that so few young people bother to vote, which is why they get hammered by the government more than any other part of the population.

How to pay for things is pretty much the most important thing that distinguishes different political parties. After all, if this were not issue, all parties would promise to build huge numbers of hospitals, make everything free, and so on. So I think this is the issue that you need to resolve. 

I'm sure we could argue for a long time about how powerful the government is, although I would point out that things like the drawn-out deportation of Abu Qatada or the u-turn on the so-called 'Pasty Tax' shows that the government is not all-powerful. 

More to the point -- how would you like to make the government less powerful?

When rain forest is strip cut, burnt and planted, you get a great crop for a few years, but then the rains leech away all the nutrients, erode the top soil and what's left becomes increasingly only sustainable with massive artificial chemical inputs to the system.

true,BritishHobo,welsh,Wales,"This reminds me, not long after the whole 'Sachsgate' (I fucking hate that name for the incident, I really do) incident, there was this other thing where Jonathan Ross, on his first day back at the BBC, was chatting to somebody else on the radio, and the other person made a joke about an elderly woman he met in Spain who kept kissing and cuddling him. Ross, who knew nothing about the woman, joked that he should have had sex with her. Shit, but harmless.

Only, as the News of the World dug up in the scoop of the decade, it turned out that the woman had Alzheimers. And that was that, then. They tracked her and her family down, they photographed her and interviewed her son, and before long the story was in the Daily Mail: JONATHAN ROSS JOKES ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH A LADY WITH ALZHEIMERS, OUGHT TO BE SACKED. The fact that he had no idea who she was, and certainly had no idea that she had any sort of illness or disorder, was neither here nor there. The only thing they cared about was the fact that she *did* have Alzheimers, and so he had maliciously bullied an old woman with dementia.

There was much hand-wringing about this frail old lady, this poor old lady who didn't need all this stress, but *nothing* was said about her by Ross or his guest except that she was an old lady and lived in Spain. The papers tracked her down, the papers splashed her picture and her identity all over the place, the papers used her as a fresh scandal to call for Ross to be sacked from the BBC, and the papers put all this pressure and attention on her. If the papers hadn't gotten involved, she would never have known about it, nobody would have ever known who she was, and her and her family would have carried on with life as normal.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"It's something I doubt you'll ever get a balanced debate with on reddit because of the levels of experience people have here. A lot of people still experimenting with weed don't think it's possible for them to suffer long term effects and/or for it to lead to harder drug addiction. 

FTR: of course it's possible, if you're into experimenting with the escapism you get from weed, you're definitely more likely to experiment with harder drugs and some of you will get addicted. That's a given. 

However, from my own point of view (  ex coke head ) I've seen plenty of people get into trouble with the stuff - addiction, mental issues, motivational issues, relationship issues, whatever - and then have to attend the same groups I attended, but on the other hand I know people who've smoked for years and get by just fine.  

I personally believe that if you're already prone to or have a family history of mental issues it's going bring them to the surface. If not then you'll probably be OK, you'll probably smoke till your thirties and grow out of it. 

Some people obviously smoke way past that age and they do just fine. 

I mean I once loved the feeling I got from smoking, now I'm just not into it at all, or any recreational drugs for that matter. But that's just me, I've had major problems in this area and gotten through them.

He showed this in his stint with Hoffenheim, steadying the team and helping lead them out of relegation before getting injured.

Her role is head of state. Therefore it is her job, by one of the very definitions of the word.

She has a choice to be Queen.

I wouldn't argue otherwise.

There's a significant difference between simply walking home and parading up the same road with a significant number of supporters and bandsmen. No-one has been restricted from simply walking home, with the exception of when protests about the restriction of a parade block said road. It is obvious that simply walking home does not require any special regulations attached.

In an ideal world, parading shouldn't require regulation, beyond the notification of the Police so that any roads along the route can be closed temporarily for health and safety reasons. However in a society where a parade can antagonise those living along the route due to historical reasons then yes, regulations are necessary to ensure that on the whole the rights of both parties are ensured and compromises made.

The CAP has economically actually been very successful, and we get far cheaper food than we would have else-while without it. This is going to sound crazy but it's actually one of the main good things about Britain being in the EU. Food won't be able to be shipped around the world cheaply forever, we have passed peak oil and the price is only going one way. You can't make a shipping tanker or a plane to run on solar power and so we need to ensure our food and water supplies come to us from as locally as possible. 

However the reason I dislike the CAP as it currently stands is that it mainly goes to the two countries in Europe who need it least: France and Poland. It's blatantly cash for political favours and France rubs salt in the wound by doing a deal with the UK to spread the CAP around to other countries who need it more  if we cut our rebate. We then cut our rebate by almost half and France keeps everything and decides not to spread it's CAP around, but vote itself an increase.

To sum up my feelings right now:

1. I don't want to break the law but I don't really trust anything ""on the streets"" after my last experience, which left me like a paranoid zombie for 6 hours. The drive seems to be towards more powerful, recreational strains, emphatically not what I want.

2. I want control over what the effects are, ideally pain reduction, reduction in nausea from the NSAIDs I take, and the ability to have a good nights sleep.

3. I will tell no-one about this, except for my SO (who is actually very supportive after seeing the initial effects). My SO is not/does not want to become a user at all, and neither was I until very recently.

4. Two plants maximum, I think. I would have only one but I don't want to put all my eggs into one basket. As it happens I am a keen gardener, although these days even digging up a flower bed seems a laborious task.

5. No supply, ever. Not even close friends will know, and the shed will be locked when I am not in there. I think I'll get a vapour machine so I can dose indoors and out of anyone's way.",0,1374440268,null,0,false,0,cb7dov2,t3_1irdqr,t1_cb7dov2,t1_cb7ciqm,null,1430386354,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

If I can give one piece of advise from my father, it's: **stay active as much as you possibly can**. It's so important to keep stretching and to keep physically fit, as this really helps to reduce the damage on the bone. It's incredibly easy to stay in bed all day, especially if you get mentally depressed from the weight of everything: but that *will* do much more harm than good. Also check if you can find a local swimming pool; it's apparently a good relief from the pain. 

That doubles as a warning for marijuana, which is a depressant. It's really vital not to get stuck in the sort of ""stoner attitude"", and to stop it from giving you a sedentary lifestyle. 

I'd also recommend getting regular checkups for other auto-immuse diseases, and be on the look out for conditions such as Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Osteoporosis which can rear their head.

The top centre in the UK to treat these conditions and AS is the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath, an NHS Trust hospital. They work specifically with these sorts of things, and if you can get funding/referral they will be a massive help in the future.

Also check out the medication group known as anti-TNF's. My father recently got funding for an experimental course, and although the drugs are in early testing stages and are expensive, they seem to work well.

I'm sure you know, but http://www.nass.co.uk/ is the AS society. They have resources available to help deal with the disease.

While a grow would certainly be a good hobby, It can also be a pain in the arse. While I get the impression you can take it or leave it, if your plants went bad (can easily happen) or you smoked all their produce before you managed to grow more, you're going to be without.

With regards to your concerns about street weed, once you find a decent dealer (these do exist, not all dealers are your stereotypical gangster type) yu'll be able to get high qality weed. I smoked pretty heavily, recreationally, for the best part of 4 years, and never (If my usual guys weren't out) smoked anything other than high quality, unadulterated weed. 

Contamination with other drugs is basically a myth. Nobody will waste good drugs by spraying them on weed. You may very occasionally find that your weed has a lot of stalk in it that's no good to smoke, but good bud is really easy to come by.

I severely doubt the weed you smoked was treated with anything. Some types of weed give different highs. You can get a ""body"" high, where you feel the effects as a sensation throughout your limbs, or a ""head"" high, which affects your head, funnily enough. I often found head highs to be less good, you might feel dizzy, and can get headaches, and stuff is harder to comprehend. If you find a good dealer who knows his shit they will be able to tell you what you're buying. I'm not going to pretend it's like a butchers counter where you select your cuts of meat, but get up a good rapport with them, try a few strains, and you'll end up knowing what you like and want to buy. With regards to strength, smoking less is the key. You wouldn't drink a pint of vodka, so don't smoke a 10 bag of strong weed all at once. Start with a little, then smoke more if you still feel like you want more.

Unfortunately, I can't really offer you any advice on finding a decent dealer. I always met mine through friends or other dealers who had run out. Your friend's guy may be a good start though.

Sorry I didn't really answer your question, and sorry if this is all total rubbish, I've been drinking. I wish you all the best though, and hope you find a good solution for yourself. Weed really does work better than any OTC painkillers. I had my hand burned really bad a while back, and while I found I was still in pain, the weed helped distract me from it so it wasnt the only thing on my mind.

Allow me to give you an analogy: (something reddit loves!)

Imagine everyone around you is constantly eating shit, day in and out. It doesn't affect you in any way, and no one makes you personally eat shit, but everyone recommends you eat shit, constantly, and the only thing people talk about is eating shit. Every day, eating shit. You become frustrated at your struggle to find those whom do not constantly eat shit, but then they slowly start to identify themselves as shit-eaters. They wear buttons, t-shirts, they declare themselves shit-eaters.

And because of this you can more handily avoid them.

I suppose I wish the world didn't eat shit constantly, and I may hope that they will stop, but in the meantime all I can do is thank them for letting me know they eat shit before I waste my time.

I don't care if you eat shit. I really don't. You aren't making me eat it, and for that I am thankful. But do not place your shit-eating on some pedestal. Don't assume I am upset for saying eating shit is completely fucking inane.

Don't assume those whom do not eat shit need to grow up and learn to like it.

Forbid your child from having a laptop until they're a responsible age, make them use a family computer in a room that other family members are likely to use until then, install existing web filter programs. These are the actions of a smart, responsible parent. 

Force the *entire* country to by default accept the same level of protection given to your child, so that you yourself don't have to take any steps or make any sort of effort to ensure their own protection. These are the actions of a self-absorbed parent. These are the actions our *Prime Minister* deems the best.

Fuck's sake.

Actually I'm probably a little unfair in saying that these people are unwilling to go to any effort for their children's protection. They are willing to go to effort, they're just so fucking stupid that instead of simply installing a web filter and then supervising their children's computer use, they spent months campaigning for the entire country to change how it uses the internet.

It's like having a relative who's afraid of the dark, and instead of installing a nightlight, you go out and start campaigning that everybody in the country must have their lights on *by default.*

&gt;PM will today warn that internet pornography is 'corroding childhood'

[Citation needed]

&gt;Porn simulating rape will also be banned under new legislation

Is BDSM rape? What's wrong about two consenting adults playing out a fantasy? Does this intrinsically cover all kinds of power play? Where is the line drawn and who gave the government the authority to draw the moral line on what kind of consensual sexual fantasy I'm allowed to watch people engage in?

&gt;The Prime Minister will add: ‘I’m not making this speech because I want to moralise or scaremonger, but because I feel profoundly as a politician, and as a father, that the time for action has come. This is, quite simply, about how we protect our children and their innocence.’

If you weren't moralising or scaremongering you wouldn't couch your announcements in emotive language.

&gt;Any adult ignoring the alerts will have filters installed automatically.
&gt;“default on”

Do not want.

&gt;‘These images normalise sexual violence against women – and they are quite simply poisonous to the young people who see them.

MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T LET PORN BE THE WAY YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT SEX THEN. Children should be taught, openly, about sex, taught about porn, and taught that pornography is NOT 'real'. Just like movies and advertisements aren't 'real'. Advertisements are poison too, they normalise self-loathing and consumptive behaviour. Are they getting banned? I wonder why not. Maybe shitty parenting, victorian morals, and social taboos about sex leading to children getting sex ed from porn, is what causes the damage?


This is a stupid, moralising, reactionary idea. I don't want the government having a default on web filter. I don't want the government deciding what smut is fine smut and what smut isn't fine smut. Much like GCHQ listening to my phone and reading my facebook messages, this stuff sets in place all that is needed for a totalitarian state.

Say the Public have a (slight) aneurysm, and in 2015 the BNP wins control of the nation. They can read your mail, they can hear your calls, and they can filter what you see.

What children need is an education to understand what pornography is and how it fits into the bigger picture of human sexual behaviour - and they need that education at the right moment for them, not as part of some key stage curriculum. They also need to be raised in an enviornment where sex and pornography are not swept under the carpet and treated as morally reprehensible acts - but are accepted as fundamental parts of the human experience that simply need careful explanation.

2. A really good keeper came up this transfer window in Mignolet and if he had waited till next year to pull the trigger he may have lost him or anyone else who was at his level that was priced reasonably

3. He made the transfer risking having too many first choice keepers going into this season rather than risk having too few next season (or overpaying for a new keeper next year, he could have easily spent double in this market)

4. He preserved Reina's dignity and his true value by not directly coming out and saying he demoted him 

5. When the right opportunity came this transfer window to give both Reina and us a graceful exit, he took it. 

The more I read about it (especially with Mignolet and Reina being so cryptic about what BR told them) the more I'm convinced a lot more was said behind the scene to necessitate these moves. He may have to eat his own words but I think BR and his team may just have navigated us out of much stormier waters at only the small (personal) expense of being labelled hypocrites.

true,BlueyBirdy,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"SDCC is the ultimate destination for all things nerdy. There's a reason it's so hard to get tickets for it! Nothing in this country can compare, really.

London MCM Expo is a huge convention that has grown exponentially. While it is mainly about cosplay and buying overpriced merchandise it's still great fun. I've been going for years and it's only getting bigger and better. They don't tend to bring in superstar guests though, so if you're after seeing famous people you're better off somewhere else. It takes place in May and October each year at the ExCel Centre.
http://www.mcmcomiccon.com/london/

This year in August a new convention called Nine Worlds is happening. It's taking place in a hotel near Heathrow Airport and aims to out-nerd MCM Expo. I can't afford it unfortunately but here's the website so you can have a look:
https://nineworlds.co.uk/

If you're after a mix of celebrity guests then there's London Film &amp; Comic Con in October at Earls Court. I haven't been but I've heard lots of positive things about it.

Outside of London the MCM Expo Group do conventions in the Midlands and Scotland. Haven't been to any of them and they're smaller than the London ones. I've heard positive press about them though.

The word ""simulating"" means you can take that definition pretty fucking far if you wanted. Where do you draw the line? BDSM? Because then you're getting into very commonly viewed territory. If this becomes law it's going to get abused, guaranteed. I mean, some adults have fantasies of this this kind of stuff. So, two consenting adults make a porno depicting a rape scene that they both enjoy. What happens once the government gets a hold of it?

Of course the government would tackle it's long term dream of censoring the internet through the child protection angle, along with the ""removal of child pornography from fucking google, a thing it already isn't on"", angle. Because no-one will speak up against it since that makes you: 
a) someone who *obviously* supports child abuse 
b) someone who apparently thinks children are allowed to look at hardcore pornography
and c) someone who has to speak up against porn, something few people will actively campaign for since, well, it's porn and everyone is obviously too embarrassed they watch it in real life.

I called that they would go this route but when it occurred I didn't think it would seem so...blatant. Cameron didn't wake up this morning and suddenly think ""Holy shit! Child abuse is easily accessible on the internet and is a huge issue!"" Not only is that wrong, but he doesn't give a fuck.

1. It builds value of comic con. A big draw of Comic Con for fans who shell out thousands to go there is being able to see exclusive stuff that the public won't see for at least awhile. It sucks for us, but its part of the show. These fans can then go back to their respective cities, and tell their friends and the internet how awesome it was, and those people who haven't seen it suddenly have their interests piqued (see #2).

2. To a much larger extent, to fuel the hype train. BBC shows awesome exclusive trailer for the 50th. Tons of fans talk on websites about how much they want to see the trailer. Some of that talk seeps into the general public and gets some of them interested as well. Fan suspense builds, until finally a few weeks from now, just as the desire is about to die down, they release it, and it explodes again. Fans are now posting everywhere, with the caption ""Finally! They've released it and its soooo awesome!"" Just with the addition of that ""Finally"" people who are unfamiliar with it can see off the bat that this is a highly desired video, and that maybe they should watch it too.

Hell, I'm not even 100% sure on how Big Bang/Pandorica Opens was resolved and I consider myself a huge fan of the show. It's just becoming not as genuine or unique.

He consistently demonstrates a lack of perspective and insight. His whole article towards the end of the Mkhitaryan ""pursuit"" missed the forest for the trees. 

In this case, perhaps Reina didn't ask for a move. Perhaps Mignolet will not turn out to be a worthwhile replacement. Perhaps Liverpool did intend to sell him this summer. 

Personally, I doubt Pepe asked for a move. But it doesn't matter. He might never have. But the Barca flirting wasn't going to stop next summer. Reina may be an incredible long term servant to the club, but he would have wanted to leave to play for Barca. His boyhood club that just happens to be arguably the best in the world.

If they came, he'd want to leave. And where would that leave us? At Goalkeeper? A position that is no where near as easy as others to find quality, let alone affordable quality.

Mignolet was probably on the clubs radar for the ""in case"" situations anyways. We inquired, we got him for less than 10. Next summer that could have been 15. We can't know. Perhaps he won't work out. But when you consider that Arsenal, a Champions League club, is barely close to getting Cesar, you might say we're lucky to have gotten Mignolet now for the price. 

I really don't think Rodgers (and co) have done anything but play this expertly. I don't know how anyone could think differently, aside from if they wrongly believe Pepe is still world class (he hasn't been ""world class"" for two years, if he is still class) and if they're unwilling to give new players opportunities to prove themselves (which, for a club with no Champions League, is kind of required - we don't attract guaranteed talent). 

@Junkbond_trader explained it perfectly. 

Reina was likely to want a move to Barca, if not force one, the minute they wanted him. We'd be left in a bind Needing a replacement. Barca would likely have scoped out the situation before the window opened, alerting any club we would do business with that they could jack up the price on any targetted keeper. 

It'd put us in a bind. 

Whereas, if (and its a big if) Mignolet works out, we might be on the up ending next season, without the chance of losing players at difficult to replace positions. At the very least, limiting the number who could go (because Suarez might always go, considering his talent and the desire of clubs above us for him).

""This neo-liberal establishment would have us believe that, during its miracle years between the 1960s and the 1980s, [South] Korea pursued a neo-liberal economic development strategy. The reality, however, was very different indeed. What Korea actually did during these decades was to nurture certain new industries, selected by the government in consultation with the private sector, through tariff protection, subsidies and other forms of government support (e.g., overseas marketing information services provided by the state export agency) until they 'grew up' enough to withstand international competition. The government owned all the banks, so it could direct the life blood of business - credit. Some big projects were undertaken directly by state-owned enterprises - the steel maker, POSCO, being the best example - although the country had a pragmatic, rather than ideological, attitude to the issue of state ownership. If private enterprises worked well, that was fine; if they did not invest in important areas, the government had no qualms about setting up state-owned enterprises (SOEs); and if some private enterprises were mismanaged, the government often took them over, restructured them, and usually sold them off again.


The Korean government also had absolute control over scarce foreign exchange (violation of foreign exchange controls could be punished with the death penalty). When combined with a carefully designed list of priorities in the use of foreign exchange, it ensured that hard-earned foreign currencies were used for importing vital machinery and industrial inputs. The Korean government heavily controlled foreign investment as well, welcoming it with open arms in certain sectors while shutting it out completely in others, according to the evolving, national development plan. It also had a lax attitude towards foreign patents, encouraging 'reverse engineering' and overlooking 'pirating' of patented products.


The popular impression of Korea as a free-trade economy was created by its export success. But export success does not require free trade, as Japan and China have also shown. Korean exports in the earlier period - things like simple garments and cheap electronics - were all means to earn the hard currencies needed to pay for the advanced technologies and expensive machines that were necessary for the new, more difficult industries, which were protected through tariffs and subsidies. At the same time, tariff protection and subsidies were not there to shield industries from international competition forever, but to give them the time to absorb new technologies and establish new organizational capabilities until they could compete in the world market.


The Korean economic miracle was the result of a clever and pragmatic mixture of market incentives and state direction. The Korean government did not vanquish the market as the communist states did. However, it did not have blind faith in the free market either. While it took markets seriously, the Korean strategy recognized that they often need to be corrected through policy intervention.""

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"A pension is *part of* a sensible financial plan, it's one of the many components. Sacrificing your short term finances for a pension is a mistake however at the same time not starting a pension as soon as you can can be an even bigger mistake. You should set yourself a rough goal (for example outright home ownership and £x in a pension at retirement) and work towards that. If you can save x per month, put 35% of x into your pension (which your employer + tax contributions will make up to about 50%) and the other 65% towards a deposit. 

There are many people that will aggressively pay into their pension at the expense of their home situation (eg: they'll rent and pay every penny into a pension instead of saving for a house deposit) and then find at retirement their pension won't go very far because they still need to spend money on rent... you should retire with a home owned outright and a pension. 

Pensions are just like any investment, the longer your money is accumulating the more it will accumulate. The benefit of pensions over standard investments is that the government and your employer will heavily subsidise your pension contributions. For example every month I pay into my pension and it **more than doubles** because of tax subsidies and employer contributions. I'm **literally** getting free money and it makes a huge difference with my contribution levels.

I'm also 21 (and fortunate enough to be in a very good financial situation) so I'm currently paying aggressively into my pension, alongside saving to purchase a home -- renting at the moment. The reason I'm paying into a pension (vs. saving all towards a home) is two-fold, firstly a pension provides protection from yourself, people can be very reckless and I can't promise myself I wouldn't spend a lot of money on a whim, a pension means you categorically cannot spend that money and secondly as mentioned the contributions from my employer and the tax subsidies make it exceptionally lucrative. I get £750 ""free"" every month into my pension on top of what I pay from tax + employer (seriously, £750 at no cost to myself). Pensions are fantastic and for people our age it's very likely there will either be no state pension (we'll be expected to work until we die) or we'll be expected to live in giant retirement complexes in small flats... personally I want to retire while I still have my faculties, the only way to guarantee that now is a private pension.

If you're in a situation where you're only able to pay in a small amount per month at the moment and you plan to join an employer with a pension scheme soon then it may not be worth starting a pension now **however** the trap most people fall into is thinking ""eh, I don't need to start a pension now, I'll do it next year"" and then in a year ""whoa, that would reduce my monthly income by £100! I need that £100 now! I'll start my pension next year..."" then the next year, same thing, you get he idea. Starting a pension now is not only good for the financial benefits of starting early but because you'll get used to paying into a pension, time flies and you'll be 40 before you know it, you **do not** want to just be starting a pension at 40.

An example of how good starting a pension early is: if you were to start a pension now earning £20,000 per year and put in £100 per month (and your employer matched it) your pension fund would be worth an estimated £154,487 at retirement. If you were to start a pension at 35 with the same figures your pension would be worth £81,248 at retirement! That's basically half as much, when the difference is only 15 years out of 45 years! 45 years = £154,487, 30 years = £81,248!

Starting a pension as soon as possible is probably one of the smartest financial decisions the average person can make (some situations are different but assuming you're an average person...) and you should preach the wonders of pensions to your friends!

For me personally my pension fund is estimated to be worth over a million at retirement, if I waited to 35 to start it then it would be worth less than half! Interest is pretty much worthless when it comes to savings of small amounts, but compound interest when it comes to long term savings (what pensions ultimately are) is serious money.

People that opt out of a pension are quite literally passing on free money. It's a serious crime that people aren't taught this in school, I thought pensions were not worth thinking about until the company I work for brought in a pension adviser, it blew my mind just how much money is involved.",0,1374462582,null,0,1374462767,0,cb7kr59,t3_1iqzjz,t1_cb7kr59,t1_cb76lls,null,1430382954,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

I agree with it though, if someone has a load of child porn on their PC and they are being tried for possession of it (say the police were able to prove they are guilty because they raided the house and the laptop was on) and then they have an external hard drive that's encrypted, then it should be illegal to not give over the password to that drive if they know it, it likely contains evidence which is crucial to the case.

true,roger_r,blue,actually is banksy,"I grew up here, and it's only now that I am soon to leave that I realise what I've had all these years - Bristol is *awesome* - you'll have a blast.

Westbury-on-Trym is nice, if a little pedestrian. However it's in a good spot with convenient busses to the center, a nice handful of cafes/pubs and easy access to the first point of interest, **The downs**.
The downs is a massive unspoilt bit of parkland which stretches from the top of westbury(ish) to the sea wall on the edge of the avon gorge. It is entirely publicly accessible and is great for picnics and general hanging out with friends, sport (countless runners and joggers have beaten a track around it's perimeter) or just for a walk to clear your head from the ~~horrors~~ sorry, joys of sixth form. 

Follow the edge of the downs towards the looming grey mass of 60s(?) concrete that is the water tower and you will get to the top of **Blackboy Hill**, the main road down to the center from this side of town. Blackboy hill, which leads onto Whiteladies Road (politically correct or what?) is a long stretch of pubs, restaurants, shops and supermarkets, but I prefer what's at the bottom of it - **The Triangle**. 

All three sides of the triangle are littered with shops, clubs, bars and eateries, and a few minutes' walk away is **Brandon Hill**, which is another lovely green space with awesome views, a tower and many squirrels. 

**Park Street** follows on from the triangle and takes us into the centre proper. It has a similar selection of shops to the triangle and has your nearest branch of Nandos, amongst other things. 10 minutes across the centre and you'll find **Broadmead** and the much newer and considerably nicer **Cabot Circus** which constitute Bristol's main shopping center. Pretty much every major high st store has a branch here, as well as the monstrous cinema de luxe and restaurants galore.

Much of my time out in bristol is spent in these areas, but it's only a very superficial look at what we have to offer.

As for meeting people - sixth form is a great place to start. You're going to be around these people most days for 2 years, so throw yourself into it (although I know it's not easy being the new one in an established year group). Bristol is big but it's surprising how small a pond it can be with your peers - you may well meet people from other schools through them and it's surprising who knows who sometimes! I found it very helpful to get a job while doing my A-levels, and expanded my social circle as well as earned some money doing it, however be prepared to search around a while before you find one.

Moses looks  livelier and  a dangerous 1 v 1 dribbler, while Schurrle likes to make use of darting runs into space without the ball. He's a more intelligent player than Moses I think. It's possible though that Schurrle is really just trying to get to know his teammates and the new tactics while Moses is out there trying to prove himself right away.

Neither have looked amazing in the final third but that's an area where Schurrle has a better track record  so I expect him to pick up in that area once he settles in.

Uruguay play him as one of front three who have very little defensive responsibility. He doesn't strictly play on the right, his role is very flexible. The manager accounts this by playing 3 defensive midfielders who work hard to cover the gaps left in wide positions. This is ideal for Uruguay because it allows them to keep the front three high up the pitch for the counter attack, they don't have the midfield to dominate possession and break through defences.

A great example of this is the confederations cup game vs Nigeria. Nigeria's attacks came down Uruguay's right, where Suarez had not tracked back. However, Uruguay's goal from the exact situation i mentioned. Suarez won the ball on the half way line, and combined with Cavani and Forlan to score. Given the nature of international tournament football this is a good way to approach risky knockout games.

This would not work for Liverpool, our team is too weak defensively as it is. Many wonder why Downing is in the first 11 well he is reliable and gives us balance abd stability. Suarez is an infectious worker but he doesn't appreciate doing that kind of defending. He did play there for Ajax, but not during the season he became a star scoring 47 goals.

""That's an eternity on the internet!"" I hear you say, with a wordly grin and the look of victory in your eyes. Still, I put it to you, that if that were so, shouldn't we all be barred from mentioning Aggers tattoos in a humorous context? Shouldn't we call the Dark Lord simply Shelvey? Also, what are these songs they sing at the stadium - they are so repetitive!

No, I think that joking around about our club is a big part of what being a fan is. It's building our identity as Liverpool fans, at least in part. As fans we are taking part in the great Liverpool meme (using the word in its original sense), but we also have to build the meme to truly be part of it and so that it can grow. We tell the story of Liverpool to ourselves and each other, part of that story is our little joke about how in this transfer window everyone we sign seem to be leaning on something in the official photos they release.

We've grown our own a few times, and it's not hard but can be expensive to get started.  I'd recommend you start small, with one plant.  Look for 250W grow lights on ebay and think about getting a grow tent which will help to control the light spillage if you have nosey neighbours.  Don't bother with energy saving bulbs unless you want a small harvest. We grow inside, in a grow tent, in the understairs cupboard, usually only through the winter months as there's less chance of the smell tipping people off through open windows etc.  We grow in soil rather than hydroponics since it's a damn sight easier than messing around with pumps and ph levels.  Your local grow shop should be able to help with the specifics like plant food and types of compost to use.

I sometimes think that this country has a culture of not wanting an individual to get too far ahead or stay too far behind, no matter what the consequences on said individual's potential may be. 

Pornography addiction is a real problem which even Cambridge are beginning to study and sheltering parents across the land want to just cover it up just say it's bad with no justification. I believe there is a similar problem with cannabis, where again people have valid reasons to claim that it's healthy and others have valid reasons to stay away from it. However sheltering parents along with law enforcement just go ahead and tell you that it's bad with no justification.

I agree with educating children about what pornography is but I think parents too need to be educated in installing a filter on their child's computer if they really care. But I think one of the causes at the very root of this controversy is what I said earlier about the culture in this country of not letting an individual get too far ahead or fall too far behind. Some mothers union somewhere think they're the know-it-alls of parenting and want to implement their techniques across the land.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"&gt;Is BDSM rape? What's wrong about two consenting adults playing out a fantasy? Does this intrinsically cover all kinds of power play? Where is the line drawn and who gave the government the authority to draw the moral line on what kind of consensual sexual fantasy I'm allowed to watch people engage in?

The answer is *possibly*. The exact wording of the law is yet to be announced, but it will almost certainly be an amendment to the CJIA that extends the definition of 'extreme' pornography. For what exactly it would cover we can look towards existing laws, notably the Obscene Publication Act. The [CPS guidelines](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/obscene_publications/) list the following as potentially obscene 

- realistic portrayals of rape
- sadomasochistic material which goes beyond trifling and transient infliction of injury
- torture with instruments
- bondage (especially where gags are used with no apparent means of withdrawing consent)
- dismemberment or graphic mutilation
- activities involving perversion or degradation (such as drinking urine, urination or vomiting on to the body, or excretion or use of excreta

Interestingly (and worryingly), courts have ruled that private online conversations can be prosecuted under the OPA. So that material is already potentially illegal, even when it is a fantasy text chat between two consenting individuals. 

I will be interested to see if it will be a defence in the new law to demonstrate that a particular image or video was consensual (even if certain extracts of it may not appear to be). For example kink.com has a number of videos that may appear to be 'rape' (bound and gagged individuals being beaten and then penetrated, for example), but the site also has video interviews with the participants that makes it quite clear that it wan consensual (and enjoyable) ",0,1374482982,null,0,false,0,cb7pgay,t3_1irsvg,t1_cb7pgay,t1_cb7g9ui,null,1430380669,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The only thing that they can do is clone your SIM card, from which they can get anything that was saved to the SIM. A few years ago, this would have been partial lists of calls made/received, partial text messages (usually just the number they came from or were going to) and other basic information such as the IMEI number. 

Nowadays, most of that is saved on the phone itself, so from the SIM, they will just be able to get IMEI number and similar codes, along with (possibly) the last few masts it connected to. 

If, however, you have an SD card slot, with an SD card in, they would be able to image that and, as far as I know, it wouldn't be locked so anything saved to the SD card would be accessible. The simple solution is to either a) don't use an SD card or b) take it out.

She'll send him one of her sexy videos, and one of us secretly records him sitting at home on the computer whacking off to it. The nation watches on youtube, and he is forced in the end to marry the dominatrix and live as her submissive, and it will be like a royal wedding, but instead of a ring she'll put a ball gag on him.

This serves the purpose of demonising people that watch porn, and shaming them, when no good argument has been made that they deserve to be ashamed. Having to ask the ISPs for **permission** to watch porn is like demeaning and clearly shows the government's attitude towards people who do things they don't like is that they have to humble themselves, and that they are not the kind of citizens that the government would like us all to be.

Ultimately, if you completely ignore the technological implications and the chances to use this to censor all kinds of websites (the implications of which are huge and I'm sure will be dealt with by others in this thread), what's left behind is **not** a desire to protect the children, but rather to bully people into conforming to a national standard set by the government.

I might be biased since I wasn't at SDCC and haven't seen the trailer yet, but that's also the reason why Comic Con exclusives shouldn't be extremely unique things. Sure, show it to them first; that's fine. I understand that. But delaying the wide release for (what appears will be) a *while* after the sneak peak is not okay.

Wizards of the Coast/Hasbro did this at SDCC also. They released exclusive promo copies of Magic: The Gathering cards that could only be purchased at SDCC 2013. The limited availability meant they were sold out after the first day. Now these same cards, purchased for $65, are going for $300 on ebay. Admittedly, not the same scenario, but very similar.

Establishing a geographic barrier for certain items is only going to alienate those people who can't make it. It's difficult and expensive for many Americans to make it to San Diego during that convention, not to mention, actually getting a ticket before it's sold out. And that's just the relative-locals. The cost of seeing this exclusive trailer or getting those exclusive promos would be much higher for anyone outside of the US.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;I've no idea what you're talking about.

That's the entire problem really. But I think you effectively demonstrate exactly what I mean.

&gt;The Bedroom 'tax' incentivises people to move to houses that are no bigger than they need.

Which illustrates the point that the Tories think poor people need charges to 'incentivise' them. 

&gt;the overiding idea is that the government shouldn't be providing housing which is bigger than needed, if you want a spare bedroom you should work for it.

Except 1) their definition of 'needed' does not take into account many relevant factors and 2) there is in many and perhaps most cases, no alternative housing available. Which means that perhaps despite wanting to downsize, people can't, so they're charged.

But really that comes back to the simple idea that to 'incentivise' the poor, you take things away from them and/or charge them more.

&gt;The cut in the top rate is based on that idea too. If it's too high it becomes worth it to avoid or evade the tax, by lowering it they can maximse the income.

Except the figures don't back this up. Tax evasion is illegal and should be prosecuted anyway, not made less attractive by offering sweetners not to do it. The argument about maximising income doesn't really work either, as the first year figures which *seemed* to show this were actually an example of evasion as people moved income into the following year in order to benefit - meaning the very figure that Tories are using to trump the idea of 'maximising income' is actually a side-effect of evasion.

Either way, the correct response to 'I don't want to pay tax in your country' should be 'off you fuck then', to create opportunity and space for someone who will - especially in a market where jobs are scare and opportunities for entrepreneurs to find investment and funding are scarce, not 'oh, okay, well, how about we lower it for you then'. 

&gt;Not to defend them in anyway, but their policy reasoning is fairly transparent in this area. Incentivise the behaviour they like through financial incentives and the behaviour they don't through financial disincentives.

Except that that hits the poor disproportionately and less well off people often have far fewer options available to them, with measures like the bedroom tax frequently putting them into Catch 22 positions.

Financial disincentives are all very well when there's an alternative. 

Here's a question for you though - can you name an example of a financial incentive available to a person who is out of work that's as nice to have as a tax cut, that will improve their situation if they take it? Or a disincentive that will in any way meaningfully impact the life of someone who is in the top tax bracket already anyway?

I'd be massively surprised if you can. Which comes back to the original point where you 'had no idea what I'm talking about', which was that Tories' 'incentives' give things to wealthy people and take them away from poor people, which just seems based on a mixture of ideology over pragmatism and wilful ignorance. 

Iain Duncan Smith's 'I have a belief that it is the case' shows that the Tories are enacting ideologically driven faith-based government that is acting contrary to data and statistics, let alone compassion and certainly not out of a desire to do more good than harm.

I mean, come on, why not at least just say 'yeah, we're government for and by the wealthy, screw you guys if you're not One of Us' instead of insulting our intelligence by ignoring statistics and data.

We should be debating the merits of the government deciding which websites to block without pretending pornography has anything to do with it.

Then they ratcheted up the taxes on cigarettes to make them effectively a prohibition.

Then they introduced forced sliding doors of shame at every vendor in the country to make cigarette's taboo.

Now they want to make every cigarette brand plain white.

http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/

Here is a list of Virtual Private Network services that take your anonymity seriously, as compiled by TorrentFreak. This one was mainly compiled due to the arrest of a Lulzsec hacker when Hidemyass willingly gave information they logged about his internet usage to authorities.

While anonymity isn't that big an implication at the moment, it very well could be in the future. It's already known that British intelligence are in on the NSA's PRISM programme and we've already seen a few torrent trackers blocked by court order in the UK. Who's to say that our politicians won't go further and begin plunging our nation to the depths of China-style online censorship.

VPNs do cost money but they can be used for more than just anonymity. They can be used to bypass geopgraphical blocks for services such as Netflix, Hulu and Pandora or even improve the performance of streaming or download sites in some exceptional cases where users from your country may have a slow connection to a service.

Some good VPNs to consider are:

* BTGuard
* Private Internet Access
* TorGuard
* Proxy.sh
* Privacy.io
* Anonine
* IVPN
* AirVPN

Other ideas to consider are:

* Using Tor. It is an anonymity network that runs on nodes. Before using it, note that it's not designed for torrenting, so you absolutely should not be downloading any torrents (except maybe a magnet link) using the service as it will bog nodes down to a near halt. Another thing to note is that Tor can access .onion links, or hidden web services (many of which are illegal sites.) If using Tor, you should be very careful about browsing the 'darknet.' In fact, if the use of Tor in Britain starts to spread, it's worrying that Cameron's bill will produce the opposite effect of exposing more people to the horrors of the darknet and therefore potentially to child porn and child abuse images.

* Using I2P. It's a similar anonymity network to Tor. I don't know just how good it is but from what I heard this one is designed more for torrent traffic.

* Changing your DNS. In the case that ISPs decide on a DNS-level block, switching to another DNS provider like OpenDNS could actually bypass the filter. However, the recent blocks towards the Pirate Bay are both at a DNS and IP level.

* Use proxies. I don't know any good ones and if ISPs will take the block remotely seriously, some of the more popular ones may end up blocked alongside porn sites. Use them wisely, some may be unsafe. Many proxies leading to the Pirate Bay have been blocked by British ISPs on the threats of the BPI and other entertainment industry associations. However, there isn't such a motive to block online porn and it will likely just be direct blocks of sites such as Xvideos, Xhamster, YouPorn, RedTube, etc. It could even possibly extend to NSFW subreddits as well.",0,1374485410,null,0,1374497030,0,cb7psbr,t3_1ishyj,t1_cb7psbr,t3_1ishyj,null,1430380511,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

Honestly, it's not like TOR, your speed doesn't suffer one bit. You can also change between their servers, so you can connect in the UK, Poland, Switzerland, America, whatever. So suddenly all of those site you couldn't use because of geographical restrictions are now freed up to you. You want a US TV streaming site, you connect in the US, you want to return to iplayer, you connect in the UK. It's that simple. 

The only thing you have to watch is making bank transactions with it on, you start shifting money around and it can flag up as connecting from a strange destination with your bank and they can temporarily  lock you out of your account. As they would, if they suspect fraud. Happened to me once when I first installed it, it looked like I was moving money around in the Romania.

I accept your explanation; however, by requiring an ""opt-in"" for porn, a certain stigma is placed on the act of *opting-in*, afterall, aren't those restrictions there to *protect the children*? aren't you, by circumventing them, giving the Evil Porn to the Innocent Children?

Surely get rid of the child porn, but do it in a way that doesn't make internet users the *bad guys*. Do it in a way that cannot be bypassed by those who truly *want* to view child pornography—cutting off the source. This is the same problem with the argument that over-the-air information is gathered with the purpose of catching the baddies—the baddies know very well that they have to use encryption, and instead it's you and I whose information is gathered while the baddies go about their business unhindered.

Isn't this conflation intended? By repeating the words ""child porn"" and ""protection"" doesn't it look like progress is being made? That is surely heartening to all those worried parents, who are too lazy to police their own children. And if the government are doing such a good job on that front, why not take to blocking certain wikipedia articles that discuss child porn? After that, why not block research into childporn? I'm looking too far into the future of course, but I have to: the thought of being a thirty-year-old and having to go through the government for permission to read books and visit websites terrifies me.

Smoking is an odd choice of counterpoint. It's something that used to be thought of as perfectly healthy (to the point of being recommended/endorsed by some doctors) and then was discovered to be fantastically unhealthy. How can it be anything but responsible public health policy to try and discourage people from smoking? That is also all that has been done - nothing stops people from choosing to smoke, all of the controls are about making it less enticing to people who don't smoke. You think ""soon they will want to ban them altogether"", but I would suggest that that is not going to happen, it would be very unpopular and would cross an important line of personal choice.
It's also an odd choice because it's so trivial - can you not find a good example of where some vital civil liberty has been slowly and unstoppably eroded because of some foolish first step?

The problem with the slippery slope argument is that it assumes that we are incapable of making choices along a particular path of reasoning. That the merest first step is enough to doom ourselves to an inevitable (and usually undesirable) outcome, but this is nonsense, there are actual people making actual decisions all along the way, there is no unavoidable gravity.

The conservative government can't just magically create jobs for underqualified morons who've never done a day's real work.

I repeat, there is absolutely nothing the government can do to ensure people with degrees in media, art, sociology, etc. from sub-standard universities can get jobs.

They're just so sterile, cold, quiet, and soulless. I don't mind being on my own as long as I've got my own stuff, but there, everything at best is like a watered-down facsimile of what I have at home. No 55"" TV there, no guitars to play, no hi-fi for my music, nothing. Even the soap is just a small puck's worth, and not the satisfying hand-filling bar I have at home.

1. If people want to watch porn, they will find a way to watch porn. Simple as that.
2. How can they justify censoring something (pornography) that is totally legal?
3. Filters are easy enough to get around. All this will do is push people 'deeper' into the web, a place that nobody, never mind a child should go.
4. How will the filters actually work - block any page with reference to sex? Block facebook because somebody mentions sex there? Block all LGBT sites that mention the word 'lesbian'? 

Look at most of western europe where attitudes to sex are more relaxed - do their children turn to rape and peadophilia? Pornography and sex should be encouraged - it's gonna happen anyway so it might as well happen safely.

We'd never see a sub ten second 100m again if drugs were successfully eliminated. All of the world records in every physical field would be bogus and never obtainable again. The truth is that they don't want effective testing, they only want to catch the most excessive people. Full disclosure of the level of cheating over the past 30 years would be a huge embarrassment from which most sports would not recover. Look at baseball in the USA, it's practically joke now, any mention of the sport over there leads to an automatic jibe about drugs. Parents want their children to be inspired by athletes and they won't take them to events that do the opposite of that. This kills the sport.

Drug tests are performed on known schedules just prior to an event so using performance enhancing substances of varying degrees during training is absolutely normal and completely safe.

Well, the main problem is that people just don't trust the boys at the top, and I don't think this is to be taken lightly - I mean, they really don't, and I don't see it getting any better.  Something I'm hearing a lot is - 'it's the thin end of the wedge' (I'm predicting this will become the tagline for the rebels) - and I can't help but agree with this.  Every single day - every - single - day - *something* crops up that will be essentially an encroachment of some sort on the freedoms of the everyman, and the vast majority of these encroachments have the capacity for 'mission creep'.  In fact, most of them will require someone to put the foot on the brakes for them to stop, as oppose to just being a unique event - which is why there is so much resistance to allow them to get going in the first place.  I won't go into a tirade about the potential creep of the current bill, I'm certain you can follow the thread yourself.  *This is dangerous, that is dangerous, therefore - banhammer.*  Also, people are becoming very aware that every button pressed or mouse-click could potentially be logged somewhere, and when you implement these opt-out systems, people are fully aware that they will be on a list - somewhere - and they will be part of a data-set that is very unlikely to be helpful to them in the future.  I for one already tread carefully when talking on the web.  I left facebook years ago for a number of reasons, but one of those reasons was the fact that someone could profile me and get it completely wrong - not in my favour.  For example around six years ago, a friend (not a friend of a friend, but someone I actually knew very well) put 'facist' as his political leaning - which was a barefaced joke to anyone on his friends list - yet a couple months after that his dad has some questions to answer at his government related job in another country - the joke was swiftly removed.  People do not want to be on your lists - and they are completely justified in thinking that.  The data saved about people is meaningless without the context of the individual, yet it is used as the be all and end all to categorize individuals.  Whether you're 'in or out' of the porn list... people don't want that on their record.   

It's no secret that governments and multi-nationals around the world have been pouring billions into being the ones to 'harness' the web, and this move reeks of an excuse to get the backing of a large number of people (won't somebody think of the children!).  Can you think of anything more emotive?  'Protecting the kids' is this decades Red Scare.  You're concerned about the future of your children - but it's not porn that concerns you, or communists - it's just 'being a parent'.  You're concerned because you're a parent and that's good - but we must be careful to not delete our liberties to buy piece of mind - because it won't buy piece, because it's not porn that's the issue.   

I can however understand your perspective.  I think the person with the most power over how your child grows up however, will be you.  You can influence them academically, politically, religiously, and yes even sexually.  Sure there's bad stuff out there, but blanket banning just simply is not the fix - it's not even a quick fix, it's no fix of any sort.  Just as you can influence your child from not getting hooked on xbox and crisps, heroin, gambling, you can influence to them to enjoy healthy sex instead of unhealthy sex.",0,1374489154,null,0,false,0,cb7q9f4,t3_1ishyj,t1_cb7q9f4,t1_cb7pswh,null,1430380288,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

----------

Two US hedge funds have taken a controlling stake in part of the troubled Co-operative Bank’s debt.

Aurelius Capital Management and Silver Point Capital are understood to have built the stake in one set of the bank’s loans, putting them in a strong position as the lender works to fill a £1.5bn capital hole.

The Co-op Bank was forced to launch a sweeping debt restructuring after the Prudential Regulatory Authority identified a £1.5bn shortfall at its banking arm.
The rescue plan, announced in June, involves wiping out existing equity in the bank, which is wholly owned by the broader Co-operative Group – a holding company for a diverse range of businesses spanning supermarkets, a pharmacy chain and a network of funeral parlours.

The Co-op Group would then raise an expected £500m of debt which would be injected into the bank as fresh equity – but further capital would be generated by converting some of the existing bonds into equity.

Thousands of Co-op Bank investors, many retail, are facing large losses on the lender’s subordinated bonds and preference shares as part of the debt restructuring.

It is understood that Aurelius and Silver Point could use their controlling stake, in the lower-tier 2 bonds, to force losses on small investors, whose securities are lower ranked.

Moelis &amp;amp; Co, the investment banking firm, is believed to be advising the two American funds and declined to comment when contacted over the weekend.

&gt;What do you believe is the cause for the drop off in form from 11/12 to 12/13?

Youth. I think mental strength is one of those things that is harder to come by in young players. Confidence in someone like Walker is far more fragile than someone like Dawson, no guessing who's head would drop first if spurs went 0-2 down. Walker will be better having come through last season, I expect so see him improve on last season, repeating 11/12 will certainly be a tough ask. 

Those who imply Lennon covers for Walker will be proven wrong or right this season as I expect Lennon to get far less game time on the right (with Bale possibly inverting and the signing of Chadli + recall of Townsend).

&gt;Has Walker's game changed under AVB in comparison to under Redknapp?

AVB likes to compress the field on defence (high line) and expand on attack (glue your ass to the sideline to provide width and open the field up). Walker seemed to enjoy the freedom offered under AVB's tactics as the overlap and width gave him more time/space to coordinate on offence. 

Under AVB Walker has been required to play the high line. I believe he has been the best on field at this transition. The CB's have a harder role trying to coordinate themselves and LB wasn't standout for spurs last season. He was responsible for catching 0.5 offsides a game in all competitions this season which shows he can make the AVB high line work. 

&gt;Where do you believe the ceiling of Walker's ability is?

I believe he relies on his pace quite heavily and will be one of those players that peak at 26-30 rather than be a defender that keeps on plugging away at 30+ (Vertonghen could do this).

Ceiling wise he has shown he can work in AVB's system (12/13) and that he can be one of (if not the) best RB's in the league (11/12). If he can get everything together at the same time he will be one of the first names on the team sheet every week.

&gt;At 23 years old (same age as Obika), what kind of future does Walker have in Spurs colours (England too if you wish)?

I think that with age the mental aspect of his game will improve. Caulker/Vertonghen will be a partnership next to him for many years to come and I expect a strong partnership to blossom (Lloris too). I expect to see Walker as a spurs player for a long time, unless of course he puts everything together perfectly and spurs receive a £20m+ offer (doubtful).",0,1374489448,null,0,false,0,cb7qasf,t3_1isxzc,t1_cb7qasf,t3_1isxzc,null,1430380270,14,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,14

(b)it is of such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been extracted (whether with or without other images) solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal.

The committee took the safe, predictable, within-budget route.

In college I did an Advanced GNVQ in IT, which wasn't really that fun, but I just assumed 'computers are future herpaderp' and went for it. Following that, I applied for every computer job going. I landed a job with BT. At a BT Openworld call centre. I lasted a week. One week before quitting. It was as boring as hell. You know a job it boring when the company give you free coffee every 10 minutes. I had a bad phone call in which I accidentally asked a lady ""what is your problem?"" which she took to mean what it didn't. It was the end of the day on Friday, and I hung up and walked out, never to come back. 

After that, I bounced around in shit jobs. The job centre eventually did that thing where they arrange jobs for you. Luckily my 'advisor' was pretty cool. He didn't just find any old job. He asked me ""What do you *want* to do."" I said that I had computer qualifications. He said again ""No, what do you *want* to do."" I didn't actually know.

At the time, I was a fan of Championship Manager, and at that time 01/02 was the current game (and the all time peak of the series) and I said ""Football Coaching."" I was expecting him to let me continue jobless for a while scamming more JSA out of the system. Yes I did that, and frankly don't blame anyone that does. He made a phone call and 2 weeks later, I was working for a football team and taking coaching badges. It was weird.

I guess what I'm saying is, don't give up on what you *want* to do. Work out what it is and go for it.

Also, in my experience, employers put more emphasis on experience, rather than stick-to-it-ness. If they think that their job is not a boring shitfest, they will be confident of your retention.

There are 3 questions we must ask:

a) Why is the parenting buck handed to the ISPs? What happened to monitoring your child's online activity? What happened to explaining the difference to your kids between porn and sex? This move just further discourages parents from parenting. You want to protect your children? Then teach them!

b) Pornography damaging your children's innocence? Oh come off it. Remember that time you and your friends found a porno mag in the woods? Yeah, you do. Remember that time that you didn't turn into a jabbering psychopath because of it? It's nonsense.

c) What other 'adult websites' will fall under this cover all? Torrent websites? Alternative news websites? It's a concern because we are constantly under threat of obtuse legislation allowing the Government/Police power over ridiculous things. The Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 is a perfect example of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2000#Section_44

I'm genuinely concerned as to the future of this country. With the Obama Administration claiming that the NSA spying scheme is above the law, it's not long until we see the same shit happening here.

The fact is this: people who deal in illegal affairs that this is intending on stamping out (child pornography, selling drugs/arms, terrorism) do not operate on the same level of the web as the majority of people, and this legislation is clearly designed not to target them, but to target the population. The average joe. You think this legislation will be able to stop the silk road? The deep web? No. Of course not.

true,thafman,num23,,"&gt; What do you believe is the cause for the drop off in form from 11/12 to 12/13?

The decline of Scott Parker. Scotty *lived* in the right channel covering for KW, with 'Arry gone and a new system under AVB Kyle has no one to cover up his defensive shortcomings. 

&gt; Has Walker's game changed under AVB in comparison to under Redknapp?

He cuts inside a lot more, not too sure that this is for the better.

&gt; Where do you believe the ceiling of Walker's ability is?

He's an excellent footballer, for me the most underrated aspect of Kyle Walker's game is his forward passing; he plays lovely through balls and generally shows a good understanding of the play infront of him of the play in front of him (see for example his pass to Gylfi that led to Bale's 3rd at Aston Villa). I can see him being one of the top 5 in world football at right back, but it will require him to massively improve the defensive side of his game.

&gt; At 23 years old (same age as Obika), what kind of future does Walker have in Spurs colours?

Our starting RB for the next 5-10 years hopefully.

Unfortunately in these cases neither the 'install Web parental controls' nor the 'use in a common room' is very helpful.

Now, Virgin Media is absolutely hopeless, offering nothing in terms of configurable parental controls at the network/router level. If I was typical parent I would have been flummoxed. As it was, configuring the mobile devices to use OpenDNS servers and shoving them on a separate guest Wifi was all that was needed. But that would be beyond some people.

If the government campaigned for ISPs to provide simply configurable opt-in filters I would support that, because I suspect there are people struggling out there with mobile devices. Opt out? No.

1 Who will decide what counts as ‘pornography’, and how?


Pornography is everything that gives a politician, cleric or judge a boner.


2 Do you understand and acknowledge the difference between pornography, child abuse images and images depicting rape?


See number one.


3 Are you planning to make all pornography illegal?


Only until people find joy in it. When the junior anti sex league is ready we will unban it.


4 What about Page 3?


Don't mess with the freedom of the press to make and break politicians. Yet.


5 What else do you want to censor?


Everything but the truth. There will be special government agency to decide what the truth is today.


6 What happens when people ‘opt-in’?


I will ask daily mail to kindly label them child rapists. Also will suspend the UK libel law for the Daily mail. Then I will offer a ritual sacrifice to the daily mail shrine in my office so the deity will bring more votes to me.


7 What was that letter to the ISPs about?

8 Are you going to get the ISPs to block Facebook?


Facebook? Book with faces. We hadn't had such things in 1695, haven't kept up with the recent trends.


9 How do you think your plans will go down with US internet companies?
I will delay the tax pressure and they will cave. Too much PITA to chase the money to fund health and education anyway.


10 Do you really think these plans will stop the ‘corrosion’ of childhood?


No but it will give is critical tools in being able to delay or outright prevent developing of critical thinking and free thoughts.

I wrote a letter to the Guardian (unsurprisingly, unpublished) pointing out that many of these laws are simply means to discriminate against 'perverse' sexual minorities.

We only need to look at the language used to ban homosexuality last century to see that the protection of children has always been the bluntest, most sure of tools to ostracise those whose sexual acts make us feel 'icky'.

Given the sheer number of rapists who, we must assume, **don't** have a predilection for 'extreme' porn, we'd have to follow the current 'logic' down to banning all depictions of sex if we're going to truly protect people.

As Alan Moore said: 'Fiction and fact: only madmen and magistrates cannot discriminate between them.'

We have laws against rape, and child rape. What we need is more effective prevention and policing of these things, rather than witch doctor logic and cries of 'somebody think of the children!'

It's rather unsettling how reactionary and conservative our current society and government are becoming.

I agree with a lot of what you're saying here. There is a very murky freedom debate going on here and one which has brushed up against another messy social issue (especially in the UK): sex and porn.

First, there is a clear technical point. That is, by age 13 most kids are way more tech smart than there parents. It was true for me growing up. My parents put all sorts of the ""latest"" blocks in place and I got round them (to be fair most of them were barely a block of any sort). I'm sure as our generation grows up we'll be smarter than our parents with this stuff. But our kids will be smarter than us. They'll always find a way around. I know that a parent should probably go and learn how to out-internet their child, but the realities of parenting, work etc. are that this is not going to be a possibility for most families. The kids are too smart and the parents are too busy. This alone doesn't legitimise the proposal, but it is a factor.

Second, every kid aged over 10 that I have worked with in the last 2 years has their own smart phone. Most have their own ipad too and probably a laptop at home (I work in a camp environment so I have no idea). This is the norm that a parent would be fighting against to impose the responsible suggestions above. Of course a responsible parent should put up this fight, as some of the families I have worked with do. But for many trying to change the situation - no internet devices in your bedroom etc. - would be a monumentally difficult battle. Again, not forgiving this, just saying that the realities of being a ""responsible parent"" are not that simple and many of us would capitulate like so many ""lazy"" parents.

My final point is the most important issue here. The above is about the logistics involved in providing safe internet use for your children. The more important question is why do we want the internet to be safe? What is the damage being done by exposure to pornography?

I'm not one to lament the current generation as many do. In fact, I believe that we have an intelligent, motivated and caring generation on the up (though I mostly work with kids from high social-economic backgrounds so that definitely moves the scale). The only area that they really differ from our older generations is their huge exposure to sex and pornograpy. When I was 13 (I'm 26 now) I first found porn on the internet. A pictures downloaded on the old p2p networks. Now I've caught kids of 10 with hardcore porn on their devices. That is fucked up.

The damage is so nebulous and unseen. Porn is part of the many hidden and subtle things that forge our understanding of sex and gender roles beginning from the colours we dress boys and girls in and culminating in the horrid and extended sexism that still prevails today. Porn can alter part of how we think about sex, relationships, intimacy etc. It doesn't have to, but it certainly can and I believe it has played a part in the continued sexualisation of kids, especially girls. I've seen it first hand: the crap these kids come out with, the way they behave and the clothes they wear. It's genuinely worrying. 

I truly believe that we do need to control the exposure of young kids to porn, as I'm sure we all agree. I'm not suggesting that this is the best thing to do, but something has to be done.

That got out of hand. I think I'm just putting off doing something useful for the day... maybe I'll look at some porn now.

I like to think that, as someone who is technically pretty savvy, I am well placed to protect my kids from the darker sides of the Internet (both in terms of technical restrictions and emotional contextualising), but when I really think about the various angles, I realise that it's going to be incredibly hard. I therefore worry that if I'm not sure that *I* can do a good enough job of it, some/many/most parents will be completely lost because they aren't necessarily even aware of what is out there, let alone how to either block their kids from accessing it, or properly contextualising it.
It's very easy to lay this all at the door of parents, and that is certainly the first place to be laying the responsibility, but I think they at least need very very easy access to tools that will provide at least protection against the most common avenues. ISP level filtering seems likely to provide that common-case protection and having it be opt-in covers the parents who are not savvy enough to know that they need such a thing or how to get it.

I used to visit New Cross to buy it directly from the shop; and yet even at the time, Moore was not really any different to Ben Elton in his approach - make 'insightful' commentaries/ jokes about the current bunch you don't feel you should follow (because after all, democracy is only for those who agree with *you*, right?)...then studiously avoid addressing how they got there, which (for Moore) made his 'commentary' look hopelessly out-of-date even on release.

Either that or he wants to make children more repressed and less familiar with their sexuality. Being repressed is a personality flaw. NOT a feature!

You do provide the internet for your children *in your home*, but we are hurtling into an age of hyperconnectedness, so to actually take control of the entire surface of their internet access is going to become increasingly difficult.
When a little LCD and an ARM SoC with a wifi chip and an OS with a web browser is cheap enough to build into almost any toy (which is no more than a few years away from being true), many of the toys/devices they have will be capable of accessing the Internet. They will be able to find wifi they can either use openly, or can easily obtain the WPA key for, in ever more places, so unless you follow them 24/7 and look at all their little screens, I think the reality is that they will be seeing all sorts of things you don't know about.
It's easy enough to say 'well I just won't get them those toys then', but I'm not sure that is going ot stack up in reality when this stuff is truly ubiquitous.

true,LizGould42,,Pub band keyboardist,"I still say that there should be an amnesty across all sports to allow people to confess doping without punishment, and expunge the records to start on a clean slate. Where someone has a victory and there is suspicion of doping, then their records should be marked as 'possibly gained by use of drugs'. 


  Plus, I'll ask you a question- what exactly would you classify as performance-enhancing drugs? Would you class an asthma inhaler (it's steroid and acts to affect lung function) as one? Or cold medication? Cough syrup? Coffee (or any other decaffeinated drink)? I used to actually be an amateur cyclist and I can tell you that all the things I mention (yes, including coffee) were strictly controlled because they were classed as potentially being performance enhancing. 

Also, drug testing is only as good as the people who develop the tests, and this kind of thing costs millions of euros/dollars/pounds to do. It may not be a case of people not wanting to do something, but that they can't. Drug tests only have a finite ability to detect any drug. All it takes is some research and development and viola, you've got a new drug the tests can't pick up on. 


&gt;Full disclosure of the level of cheating over the past 30 years would be a huge embarrassment from which most sports would not recover. 

I doubt this would happen. People have a strong tendency to believe in something and to perform actions based on this belief even when the illusion is shattered. Prime example is WWF wrestling- most people KNOW it's choreographed and planned beforehand, complete with backstories and rivalries, but the fact of it is that people STILL pay to go to shows and to watch matches on TV. Why? Because it's good to watch, it looks impressive and for kids, the wrestlers are almost real-life superheroes.

In fact, contrary to most of the bollocks being bandied around by so-called experts, I think internet porn does a great deal for family unity by giving those in a long term relationship (men and women) an outlet for sexual fantasy and desires that isn't cheating on their spouse (or paying for a prostitute).

I don't know what the evidence is statistically for reductions in rape but I wouldn't be surprised if internet porn also curbed these urges in certain men.

If you put an opt-in on porn there are countless men who use internet porn secretly who would subsequently be found out by their spouse if they opted in. Either those men have a very frank discussion with their spouse (and let's remember the British are not good at having such discussions), or they just accept that the outlet is no longer there and go back to cracking one off to the Freemans catalogue or going through the humiliation of buying top-shelf magazines from local news agents.

It's very easy to find out how much you'll be left with after tax and other deductions. Simply search for ""UK income tax calculator"" -- [here's one that's reliable and easy to use](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/tax-calculator/).

Vacation time is a minimum 4 weeks for a full-time employee (I believe this minimum is enforced EU-wide). Companies can insist that public holidays (called Bank Holidays in the UK) come out of your annual leave allowance, however very few actually do this. So usually you get your 4 weeks annual leave, plus the 8 bank holidays.

Sickness days are separate from annual leave -- although a little-known ruling is that if you're sick during pre-booked annual you can actually claim back your leave days. Most companies allow you to have one or two days off concurrently due to sickness with you self-certifying (e.g. a bad cold), usually if you're off more than 3 or 4 days in a row they'll want some kind of medical proof (a doctor's certificate or similar). This policy will differ from company to company, however.

Usual working hours depend very much on the industry and type of work you're doing. If it's office work it'll be typically a 37.5-hour week, 9.00am - 5:30pm (allowing an hour for lunch) but again different companies will have different policies. The European Working Time Directive applies which means you can't be compelled to work more than 48 hours a week ([with a few exceptions](https://www.gov.uk/maximum-weekly-working-hours/overview)).

Relocation fees are entirely at the discretion of the hiring company. If they want you badly enough they'll probably happily pay out a couple of thousand to ensure you're able to come and work for them. However as I'm sure you're only too aware there's a large number of Europeans looking for work these days, so it's far less likely this sort of package will be available than it was ten years ago, say.",0,1374492767,null,0,false,0,cb7qr7y,t3_1it00s,t1_cb7qr7y,t3_1it00s,null,1430380055,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I tend to think that this sort of thing happens because people generally value their opinions more than facts, which is why when (say) the coalition get voted in, we then get years of people complaining that the country really should have followed *their* opinion rather than the majority (right down to the supposedly can't-fail arguments along the lines of 'well, it's because you're all capitalist' which usually fail to add anything to the debate at all) - with the outcome being a game of of not even bothering to contribute much until that situation changes to your favour (this includes Milliband and Balls)

According to [this BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17894176)
*""""Sites like The Pirate Bay destroy jobs in the UK and undermine investment in new British artists,"" the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) said.""* 


However why and how the court came to this conclusion was irresponsible. They did not fully know how the website was effecting artists they did no credible experiments or observations. They acted on the interest of their corporate pressure and passed the rule. The effect of torrent sites on artists is still unclear and is evolving. Also, for the sole reason of 'keeping jobs and getting money to artists' this is a joke. The entertainment industry especially swallow up a lot of the money that would otherwise go to artists. It is clear that the internet has greatly effected these industries, but there's a number of ways they need to adapt/change and a number of solutions that can be explored. I feel, directly limiting content and websites by law is the worst possible 'solution' for it. 


&gt; GCHQ / NCA. So something we all knew was going on is now confirmed. Everyone spies on everyone else, if you don't like it, change the system of government to something more libertarian.



Yes, we all had an idea. But the proof is here now and proof and media exposure is what is sued as a leverage to make change. People aren't satisfied with their bill of rights being impeded secretly by their government. They have full freedom to demand it stops. As for 'changing' the system, this kind of thread and the subsequent facilities to have place to inform people on it is vital before it's taken to government. People need to understand what's happening.


&gt;Automatic opt-out porn filter. A ridiculous argument - you have to be 18 to b uy the same porn from a newsagent magazine shelf or Adult Shop, and that's been the position for nigh on 40 fucking years. Why is it ""censorship"" because they are applying the same rules to the internet ? And seriously, it's one phone call and you're done.



What's ridiculous is that this was implemented as an automatic opt in. Allowing a minority dictate how the internet is used by the majority is bad practice and similar actions like this in the future could be detrimental. 


The internet is one of the few remaining platforms for free speech (with the exception of being arrested for facebook updates).

No 10 consists of two seperate areas covering about 100 different rooms. The first and by far the largest area is an extensive complex of government offices and meeting rooms. In principle, I can't see any reason why you couldn't FoI to see if the internet connection(s) for this area are de-restricted... However, presumably the government has some kind of IT infrastructure policy for central government offices (of which this is one) so you may find it is actually already filtered on-site, like a school or library would be. This is probably to prevent staff from inadvertently installing a virus from a dodgy website/email rather than to stop them looking at porn though.

On the third floor of the building is a **private** flat which the prime ministers family theoretically occupy. However, it is unclear what the IT arrangements are for this area - it might have a private internet connection paid for by the Camerons which of course would not be available under FoI any more than your or my connection can be - or it may be part of the entire complexes IT  infrastructure.

I'm also not sure to what extent the Camerons actually live at No.10. The flat area is supposedly quite small (you may recall Tony Blair famously lived at the larger No.11 flat and the then childless Gordon Brown lived at the smaller No.10). However, the Camerons also own at least two properties themselves - one in Notting Hill and the other in a village called Dean in Oxfordshire).

Edit: Also, while FoI covers public expenditure, it would **not** cover private reimbursement for expenses. So for example, if Cameron pays for the internet and reclaims it in his expenses then the specific details of his connection is **not** covered by FoI (since it was paid for privately and simply reimbursed). However, you could request to know how much they were reimbursed and when and what the breakdown was for.",0,1374493532,null,0,1374494058,0,cb7qvgc,t3_1isv6j,t1_cb7qvgc,t3_1isv6j,null,1430379999,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Living in Australia is horrifically expensive compared to the UK, whether you're on a low wage or otherwise. A typical beer (a schooner which is 425ml compared with a British pint being 568ml) costs in the region of $7.50-8 here in Sydney, which is around £4.50 - £4.80. A pint is usually $9.50 upwards (£5.70) and my local craft beer pub, a pint averages $11.50 (almost £7).

I've been on a reasonable wage here and have been making about $75,000 but almost half of that goes out on rent. Despite all that, I've been able to make it work and have been able to live. I haven't been able to save but I can live and have a good life here. I remember when I first moved to Australia, the price of bananas went through the roof. It was literally bananas.

Here it is: sorry for the length:

Dated: 07/09/2012

&gt;Thank you for contacting me about the proposed opt-in procedure for pornography on the internet. You are not alone in sharing your views on this matter with me. Indeed, I have received a large number of messages and letters about this, all absolutely identical. Your message has been sent on your behalf by an organisation, and not by you individually – the message I receive states: sent by [name=gmail.com@sendgrid.info] on behalf of [your name]. This is the reason that I say that your message was not sent by you personally. This kind of automated emailing, and the sheer volume that I am receiving, means that I am not able to answer every constituent individually, something I regret.

&gt;MPs are adopting various approaches to dealing with these campaign emails. Some are simply posting their response to their websites rather than email back, and this is something I am considering doing. I would rather respond personally and individually to each of you, but as these campaign emails are being sent by automated means, and the fact that I am receiving hundreds of them within a very short space of time, forces me to adopt this solution.

&gt;In order to respond to you in a timely fashion, I am sending this generic email. I realise that this is an impersonal way to respond but I am very keen to answer your concerns, and to let you know my thoughts on the matter. To write to each of you in turn would take many weeks and, alas, put at a disadvantage all those other constituents whose cases I must consider. This does not mean I do not value your views. I do, and I am grateful to you for sharing them with me.

&gt;I believe that the internet is, by and large, a force for good. It is central to our lives and our economy and the Government has to be wary about regulating or passing legislation which might stifle it. Nevertheless, the advent of the internet has brought a number of problems, such as the proliferation of pornographic material on the internet.

&gt;The Government is therefore committed to ensuring that children can use the internet safely without access to unsuitable adult material. Some safeguards are already in place, with the managers of websites featuring mature content having a legal responsibility to indicate clearly on their front page that their site is unsuitable for anybody under the age of 18. In addition, if a website charges for access then any adult content must be placed behind a credit card barrier to reduce further the risk of children and young people accessing it.

&gt;Moves are underway to strengthen and extend these safeguards. For instance, on 28 October 2011 a new code of practice on parental controls was launched by the four major Internet Service Providers - BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin. This code means that new customers will be presented with an unavoidable choice of whether or not to activate parent controls. Through regular information updates, existing customers will also be offered the opportunity to activate parental controls.

&gt;On top of this, the UK Council for Child Internet Safety is working on the adoption of a system whereby customers are always presented with an unavoidable choice about whether or not they want filters and blocks installed on their home internet service, through an approach known as ""active choice"". The Department for Education is now consulting on this proposal, and on what more can be done to keep children safe online.

&gt;I would like to emphasise that these proposals do not seek to impose unnecessary censorship on internet users; they merely give parents the tools they need to ensure their child's safety online.

&gt;I do hope that this information helps and thank you again for taking the time to contact me.

This email was sent on behalf of James Arbuthnot. I replied with this email:

&gt;Hello

&gt;I'm not sure who sent this email - Hilary J Hunter or James Arbuthnot. Your comment about how my email was sent on behalf of an organisation now seems ironic considering your email was sent on behalf of someone else.

&gt;Irrelevant of this, your email was extremely vague and I would like you to clarify for me your intentions.

&gt;Please select the following statement that you feel best describes the progress being made:

&gt;a) You are actively seeking to install default DNS server blocks put into place by ISPs that customers will have to 'opt-out' of, flagging them up on (and inevitably recording) a database as users who would prefer to have their internet service un-censored.

&gt;b) You are taking into consideration the fact that (as stated by yourself) that thousands of people have put forward their views that an 'opt-out' system is presumptuous and you are now moving forward with allowing customers to contact their ISPs to install censorship services on their service, and their service alone.

&gt;I understand that these statements are bias, but the intention is to emphasise my point. I disagree with having users request their service to be uncensored, and that requesting a block rather than having it on by default is a more fair way of running things.

And they replied with this:

&gt;Thank you for your message. I am sorry my reply confused you, and hope to put this right.

&gt;I am afraid you are more technically minded than I and I think that the best thing for me to do is to send your comments and queries on to the Minister, for comment and reply. Once I have his response, I shall come back to you.

**TL:DR** My MP isn't 'technically minded' and had to ask his support team for help, yet these are the people making the decisions. He never replied.",0,1374494045,null,0,1374494524,0,cb7qyg6,t3_1it0bl,t1_cb7qyg6,t3_1it0bl,null,1430379960,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Hitman__Actual,null,null,"The three things that get people caught growing cannabis are: smelling, telling, selling. 

You've already said you won't sell, good, keep it that way. 

Next up is to not telling anyone you're growing, as it puts you in a powerless position if anything untoward were to ever happen with a friendship or relationship. A friend might ask for a little bit... then another little bit... then when you get bored of giving him free weed because you're own supply is dwindling, then he has a decision whether to dob you in to the police or not. If you're growing cannabis, no-one really needs to know about it, so keep it that way. 

Thirdly, smell - as someone else has said, you'll want a carbon filter, as cannabis STINKS while it's growing/drying. 

Also, you mention you have a shed - you might want to consider growing inside your property instead. Due to the heat generated by the lights you'll need, a shed might show up as suspiciously warm to a police helicopter flying over - i.e. if a suspicious car is in your area and the helicopter is around there anyway, they'll make a note of the warm shed and follow up on it with a knock at the door whenever they're quiet and not dealing with stolen cars etc. The police don't send the helicopter out to ""look for grows"" as you may hear elsewhere, that's too expensive.

For selecting a strain, and looking at legal issues, and how to grow/what equipment to use, I'd recommend signing up at www.uk420.co.uk and doing a lot of reading on there - it's a site that is dedicated to the UK based ""home grower"" so any people on there who appear to be dealing, or growing enough to be dealing, get hounded out and banned fairly quickly, meaning it's a great resource for ""percy"" (personal) growers, which is what you'll be. 

There will DEFINITELY be a strain available that will help you without getting you high, but you;ll need to do a few test grows until you find that strain, and again, more reading required. 

And as for the legal stuff, you'll likely get a caution if you've only got a few plants. If I were you, I'd keep a record of exactly what you're doing with your grow, so that if you ever were caught, you'd have evidence to back up your reasons for growing and the fact you weren't selling. Also, if you're growing 1 or 2 plants, you might as well grow 4 or 5 as the space will be available and the lights/fans are on anyway, so grow more than you need when you DO grow, and you won't need to grow all the time, if that makes sense? So you can do 1 grow a year, take the equipment down for 9 months, store your weed and do the same the next year (as opposed to having it running all the time, thus increasing your chances of getting caught)

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Alan Moore in the introduction to the book. 

Exactly - so why add a whole section to the intro in the later comics (notably removed from the collection you get today) about BP shares inducing facism? It's not like it was in there as a comedy or even as self-deprecation.

&gt;But it is an 80s book through and through.

I don't really get (or more accurately, never got) the 80's feel - nobody in the 80's was seriously considering repatriation or any number of other 'fears' presented in the book; if anything, it was still dealing with issues from the 70's (which I'm sure made concluding it all the harder, without it feeling dated). I knew what hacking was from the age of about 12, so to present that as a plot device of the kind where it's the last thing anyone would consider is again, a 70's concept (and was wisely kept out of the film).

For the sake of a story, I don't mind that kind of thing any more than I do Flash Gordon presenting a hopelessly out-of-date impression of the future - as long as nobody actually starts talking about it as 'prophetic'....like the OP!

conversely i've had many friends who's parents blocked everything or who decided to watch this stuff at school so obviously had to force their way around filters and blocks, they were always successful.

if a kid wants porn they will find it, this just stops people randomly stumbling across it by not realizing typing 'shaved bear' into images might bring up some weird stuff (i wanted to see [this](http://i.imgur.com/AGCKA.jpg) picture) which a little education could easily fix and some very basic parental blocks/ safety search.

The /r/RestoreTheFourth movement garnered national press in a way that EFF simply has not done, even during its most high-profile (and brilliantly executed) court cases. You're right to identify that the 'movement', in its current state, is a mere pipedream, but I think it would be cynical to assume that nothing more could come of it given the incredible scope for community-sourced input and expertise.

The power of the ORG lies in their collective (particularly legislative, they're no advertisors) expertise; the power of a movement is in its unique ability to raise to national level the debate about topic X. Goals will be defined, objectives and ethos written-up, this is simply the structure of the grassroots movement, I think.

My own ideas, for example, as I'm sure is true of yours and many others with an interest in the debate, are certainly not *wishy-washy*. The point is that we have to come to them communally if ever we hope to be more than a group of individuals moaning about GCHQ.

true,digit0,null,null,"&gt;Firstly, it's a simple switch to turn off the filter, so implying that everyone will suffer censorship ""for the sake of the children"" is a bit of an exaggeration.

Having dealt with 02's and Giff Gaff's idiotic porn blockers I can assure you it is anything but simple. You have to provide your drivers licence or passport (plus pay a fee). It randomly stops working locking you out of content and then you are forced (at least by 02) to pay an extra fee to have it resolved, this is done at their leisure.

&gt;Secondly, the tired trope about parents being ""bad"" if their children are able to access porn. Do you have any idea how hard it is to install filtering software at the router level, to block all smartphone/tablet/notebook access? My guess is that &lt;1% of households would be able to install and configure it.

The logical answer to this problem is to create better systems for parents to impose on their children, not to penalise the majority of the population for it. Your kids are not my responsibility.

&gt;Thirdly, the argument that children should always be supervised. Unfortunately it is now 2013, and much access is being done using smartphones/tablets etc through wifi. The idea that 3 children with mobile devices can always be monitored isn't realistic.

Far from a utopian past free from the perils of pornography, I recall that pornography was widespread in print-media, often Dutch in origin and equally 'hardcore' as current material. Telephone booths in London were usually covered in it (along with prostitute calling cards), and people turned to dark and seedy shops (often affiliated with crime and drugs) for it - places that make pornhub look like a fucking church.

I also don't see an argument for why an unrestricted internet is unworkable - the internet has existed for 20 years without government regulation like this. To suggest it requires it now is baseless.

This is precisely a step towards a chinese system. In effect this is a default-on/opt out version of the great firewall... yes the fact an opt out exists and that *currently* it would only cover an as yet undefined 'adult content' isn't perhaps as far-reaching, but changing the goal posts probably wouldn't require legislation... it would be easy for subsequent governments to implement changes that would drive this much closer to a chinese system in practice. As I said - this isn't a killing blow, but its the framework on which to deliver one.

&gt;  If the majority of people are happy that rape, child rape and other harmful sites are taken down, then that is what the public wants. 

That isn't how our democarcy works. We don't get to vote by majority rule on every little decision. Our democracy works at a higher level by voting for politicians we think represent us - and it is them that make the decisions. But I think in this case Dave might have not his finger quite as tightly on the pulse as he thinks he does... while this move might please a lot of elderly voters who don't understand the issues involved, it is also going to upset a LOT of predominantly men in their 20s-60s when they have to do the 'call of shame' to their ISP. The obvious aim here is that many people (by far predominaltly men) that currently view pornography will no longer be able/willing to. It is putting up an 'incentive' block on viewing pornography. Perhaps worst of all is that this isn't going to help children at all - but rather deny them the proper sexual education they ought to be reciving through their parents and schools in a supportive environment. After all, why bother to teach little Johnny about the complexities of pornography if *""well, he can't access it!""*

Legal pornography itself **is** legal, and those individuals that desire it and those buisnesses that provide it are as entitled to use the internet for that purpose as anyone else. After all, the government don't own the internet, only *some* of the infrastructure used to provide it.

I recently worked in Sri Lanka where sexual issues have historically been fairly repressed and are only starting to be addressed now.

0. Filtering is at the subscriber level rather than the device level. So this will block all ""adult content"" for all people in a family, or none at all. 
1. It's easily circumvented by web proxy. Need to block all websites which host proxy lists including new ones, plus sites which allow users to host a proxy site, all download sites which host circumvention software, all sites which host discussions about circumvention techniques and to block secure communications with said sites.
2. This move will drive more users to the Tor network, where they can find child porn, drugs, get involved in credit card hacking and so on.
3. The chilling effect this will have on all forms of discourse.

Sites which rely on advertising yet cater to British people will have to strictly moderate content or risk being placed on the blacklist.

What you call hysterical is the reaction to the right to freedom - hard won by many nations in Europe and the west - that many other countries in the world do not have access to, directly from schemes such as these being proposed, being removed. They would think us mad to give away our freedoms so easily and quickly on the back of protectionism of small but loud groups.

It is crass short sightedness to believe that the reaction to these pathetic proposals are hysterics, ""because people want to watch porn"".

Back to the original post that was bestoffed:

***

**You are wrong.** You were mislead. You see that their supposed intentions are stupid, yet you still believe their words.

In reality this has nothing to do with child protection. It's about having *the legal capability to filter things*. Child protection is just the most convenient excuse and the one you can least object to.

The same happened in Germany (the argument though was ""child porn"" rather than child protection of looking at porn) - luckily the public outcry blocked the program (for now).

In Denmark such a blacklist already [exists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Denmark). Let's look at the steps:

1. We block child porn.
2. We block sites that could contain child porn (Pirate Bay...)
3. We block sites that sell drugs
4. We block gambling sites
5. ""In 2012 Internet service providers (ISPs) and copyright holders in Denmark agreed on a framework where all ISPs will block access to copyright-infringing content if one of the providers is ordered to do so by a court. The Danish Ministry of Culture plans to work with ISPs and rights holder groups to ""formalise"" the agreement in a ""written Code of Conduct"".""
6. ...

The situation is very simple: Once you filter *something* it is very easy to either openly or secretly filter *something more*. You just change a small part of the law or, better even, just some minor administrative regulation. Or you just, you know, do it and when someone complains you say it was an [accident](https://torrentfreak.com/google-facebook-and-8000-other-sites-accidentally-dns-blocked-120302/). Also take a look at the list of sites [blocked in Denmark](http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Denmark:_3863_sites_on_censorship_list,_Feb_2008) or [Australia](http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Leaked_Australian_blacklist_reveals_banned_sites) (at your own risk, hello PRISM). Or just at this passage from an [ArsTechnica article](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/03/first-rule-of-internet-censorship-hide-the-block-list/):

&gt; In Finland, for instance, a man who runs a website arguing that the blacklist approach is ineffective was called in for questioning last year after publishing ""a list of a few hundred censored sites."" His own site was then placed on the blacklist, which means that visitors from Finland are greeted by a message saying that the site they are trying to reach contains illegal images.

**EDIT**: as this comment/criticism keeps propping up - my argument is *not* that this is a slippery slope but rather that the slippery slope *happened* in at least one country very similar to the UK. Denmark without a grain of a doubt is a democracy and, if anything, more democratic than the UK. Still it happened there and over time progressed from one to the next. If they had started with ""we will implement a blacklist for copyright violation/gambling"" this measure would never have been accepted by the population. And of course the process has not ended yet. The whole time mistakes *were* made such as the one that blocked Facebook (there are better links than the one I posted, it was made to show that this is not an error-proof system), sites that were not child pornography were blocked and the same things *with very high likelihood* will happen in the UK too.

Alternative approaches (opt-in list, providing free filtering software to parents, ...) were not suggested. I think it is quite likely that they were not suggested for the simple reason that they don't provide the same opportunity for future extension.

**tl;dr**: I believe the supposed ""reasons"" for this measure are nonsensical. Instead, this is a foot in the door for internet censorship. No matter whether you are for child protection (we all are) or even fully against porn, this will make it much easier to get future measures of censorship past the radar of public attention. Many sites contain somethign that *could* be defined as porn. Many more sites *link* to something that *could* be defined as porn. This is not a conspiracy theory or slippery slope argument but rather something that *actually happened* in Denmark, a country very similar to the UK.

Anyway some fun information about the current ""royal family""

Lets start say a 1000 years ago. The house of Stuart https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart They had some good wars against the bankers during their time. They went to war 2 times because of the money changers ripping off their people.

Now our currently royal family is from this blood line https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha and changed their name in 1917 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family. Why was it changed ""This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family's strong German ancestry;""

even better ""The new name chosen, Windsor, had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Windsor

The Royal family is not British, they are very rich people (elite banking core group) that decided to take the next step in their progression of grabbing more power for themselves. We are not their people, they are not ours.

true,i_sideswipe,null,null,"&gt; Do you have any idea how hard it is to install filtering software at the router level, to block all smartphone/tablet/notebook access? My guess is that &lt;1% of households would be able to install and configure it.

It's remarkably easy. All three of the routers (two commercial, one ISP supplied) I've used in the past 8 years have had parental controls built in. Even all of the ISP supplied routers my mum has used over the past 10 years has had some variation of these controls. Yes you need to supply them with the blacklist, but that is relatively trivial. 

There are also numerous free and paid for web filters for desktops and laptops, and some even have smartphone versions. A quick check of the Android and iOS app stores reveals at least reveal several free and paid for web filters. These are no more difficult to install than any other application.

&gt; Thirdly, the argument that children should always be supervised. Unfortunately it is now 2013, and much access is being done using smartphones/tablets etc through wifi. The idea that 3 children with mobile devices can always be monitored isn't realistic.

This is part of your responsibilities as a parent. If you're worried about your children having 24/7 access to ""questionable"" content, why then have you given them a smartphone or tablet device? The other approach you could take is to install one of the web filtering apps on their device and/or restrict when they have access to wi-fi at home. If you're worried about them using their smartphone's dataplan, then get your network provider to disable data on their device.

&gt;Secondly, the tired trope about parents being ""bad"" if their children are able to access porn.

Really the problem is not that the parents are ""bad"", it's that they are using some bad parenting techniques. Really the proper way to deal with this is proper education of the child in question. This fits in with the increasing over sexualisation of young children. Rightly or wrongly, kids are being exposed to sexual content on some level earlier, however the education surrounding it is not evolving to deal with this. Sex education both in school and at home needs to significantly improve in the UK. 

As long as it was filmed consensually there is absolutely nothing wrong with porn in general. It's only a few steps removed from mainstream acting, and there is for example no widespread call for the blocking of action films where the villain shoos up the place. 

Imagine for a second another scenario. The government is mandating that all homes in the UK must have child-proof locks installed on all cupboards, cabinets, drawers, etc. I don't currently have children, so why do I have to go through the hassle of installing and using, even as an adult I find some child locks hard to open, these locks throughout my property? 

Continuing with that analogy. If you do have children, then it is obvious that yes most parents will install child-locks in at least some locations throughout their house (eg, medicine cabinet, cleaning supplies, etc.). In terms of the internet the tools already freely exist to restrict your child's access to the seedier websites. As with child-proofing your home it should be your responsibility as a parent to enact, rather than the government having to enforce it top down through your ISP.

true,i_sideswipe,null,null,"&gt; Do you have any idea how hard it is to install filtering software at the router level, to block all smartphone/tablet/notebook access? My guess is that &lt;1% of households would be able to install and configure it.

It's remarkably easy. All three of the routers (two commercial, one ISP supplied) I've used in the past 8 years have had parental controls built in. Even all of the ISP supplied routers my mum has used over the past 10 years has had some variation of these controls. Yes you need to supply them with the blacklist, but that is relatively trivial. 

There are also numerous free and paid for web filters for desktops and laptops, and some even have smartphone versions. A quick check of the Android and iOS app stores reveals at least reveal several free and paid for web filters. These are no more difficult to install than any other application.

&gt; Thirdly, the argument that children should always be supervised. Unfortunately it is now 2013, and much access is being done using smartphones/tablets etc through wifi. The idea that 3 children with mobile devices can always be monitored isn't realistic.

This is part of your responsibilities as a parent. If you're worried about your children having 24/7 access to ""questionable"" content, why then have you given them a smartphone or tablet device? The other approach you could take is to install one of the web filtering apps on their device and/or restrict when they have access to wi-fi at home. If you're worried about them using their smartphone's dataplan, then get your network provider to disable data on their device.

&gt;Secondly, the tired trope about parents being ""bad"" if their children are able to access porn.

Really the problem is not that the parents are ""bad"", it's that they are using some bad parenting techniques. Really the proper way to deal with this is proper education of the child in question. This fits in with the increasing over sexualisation of young children. Rightly or wrongly, kids are being exposed to sexual content on some level earlier, however the education surrounding it is not evolving to deal with this. Sex education both in school and at home needs to significantly improve in the UK. 

As long as it was filmed consensually there is absolutely nothing wrong with porn in general. It's only a few steps removed from mainstream acting, and there is for example no widespread call for the blocking of action films where the villain shoos up the place. 

Imagine for a second another scenario. The government is mandating that all homes in the UK must have child-proof locks installed on all cupboards, cabinets, drawers, etc. I don't currently have children, so why do I have to go through the hassle of installing and using, even as an adult I find some child locks hard to open, these locks throughout my property? 

Continuing with that analogy. If you do have children, then it is obvious that yes most parents will install child-locks in at least some locations throughout their house (eg, medicine cabinet, cleaning supplies, etc.). In terms of the internet the tools already freely exist to restrict your child's access to the seedier websites. As with child-proofing your home it should be your responsibility as a parent to enact, rather than the government having to enforce it top down through your ISP.

No offense but that's bullshit.

I remember a feeble attempt they made many years ago to block the HBO/Cinemax/etc other channels from my room (but still had it on the main TV in the front room) so I couldn't watch any skin flicks or scary movies when I was younger. They had the cable company come out and install filters on the line to my bedroom to prevent the channels from reaching it. After getting caught a few times removing the filters, my parents started checking them every day to make sure they were still there. Eventually, one night I took the filters off, took them apart, and ""reprogrammed"" them to block a different channel I didn't care about. Reprogramming at the time simply meant moving 3 hex screws to different positions to block a different part of the spectrum (old analog days). I put each block on the back of my TV, and adjusted the screws until a channel I never watched became the blocked channel. The blocks went back to where they were originally located that night, and for a couple years my parents had no idea.

Oh, the old 'no offen**C**e but' argument. Sigh.

&gt;The ""Western"" nations fighting for ""freedom"" in various ways almost all had laws limiting and prohibiting various ""morality"" issues (gambling, pornography, prostitution, drugs etc) and that was never the issue. 

Indeed they did, another example of authoritarianism by the back door. We got rid of a vast majority of these issues post WW2, although some such as current drugs laws cause more trouble than they deem to solve. And now we have reprisals of censorship and spying. Yay!

&gt;Political freedom, the absence of repression of dissent, disappearances, selective use of law, genocide, racism, forced labour and expropriation etc - those are the things people fought for. 

Not everyone fought for all of those ideals at the same time. And post those events the vast majority of the societies have worked to remove them as much as possible, in support of civil liberties. Which you seem to not have any problem with them being removed again. This law removes your civil liberties.

&gt;Not the right to immediate instant access to all manners of pornography for free without any hurdles from the comfort of your own home

Again, missing the point I had made - it's not about access to pornography - it's about 1) what is deemed as pornographic and 2) who deems those things pornographic. This can and will be abused.

Blocking seems reasonable, but there are a few problems with how it's being done:

 * Should probably be opt-in, not opt-out.
 * It isn't a ""porn ban"", it's a ban on ""adult content"". What is ""adult content""? I saw something saying that ""pro-anorexia"" and ""suicide"" sites will be blocked. There doesn't seem to be any real list of the categories to be blocked.
 * Web filters are probably either blacklist based, or look for keywords in domains or page content. The former is practically useless. The latter, which is probably more likely, is quite terrifyingly prone to false positives. I remember when I was in school, when web filters first started to exist, a piece of work was blocked for having the word ""black"" in it - because that's racist. The BBC has even reported that some people on filters already (maybe mobile networks) have been blocked from accessing its news stories about the porn ban! Presumably due to the ""porn"" keyword.

Making it opt-in only (remember, having kids is opt-in...) might help for some of this, but the filters could still be crippling for (as Dave says) ""legitimate"" use of the internet by adults.

Gary Hooper? His wage demands priced him out of the move, Nick Thompson said so himself.

Darren Bent? Non-starter, will demand more than Hooper

Carlton Cole? Similar ratio to Sagbo (Sagbo: 4.1 goals a game for Evian, Cole, 4.3 for WHU, and 15 of his 48 league goals for them came in the Championship), he doesn't create as many changes as Sagbo (Sagbo created 34 last season, while Cole created 11), he's older (Sagbo turned 25 this year, while Cole will turn 30 later in the year), his wage demands will likely be higher, which would probably eliminate any savings made by the fact he's a free agent and that doesn't even consider the signing on bonus. Also looks to be signing for Palace anyway. 

Bendtner? Wages too high once again.

A high scoring championship striker? Austin failed his medical, Jordan Rhodes won't go for anything less than £8m, Glenn Murray is a Palace player, etc. etc. 

Danny Graham is the closest to a 'well known name' we were ever going to get after the let down with Austin, and we've got him in a very good deal that sees him go back to Sunderland if he's shite. 

We were always going to have to look abroad, and Sagbo looks like a decent player who might not score prolifically, but brings something we don't have to the team

Because it's their responsibility to make sure their child doesn't come into contact with things they deem inappropriate, just like anything else? Just add it to the list, it takes a few minutes to do. Why should it suddenly NOT be the parent's responsibility when it comes to this one issue? Those poor luddite parents seemed to manage when it came to getting dirty TV channels blocked out, what's the difference? You wouldn't ban all cinemas from showing violent films, you'd say don't take your kids to see them. If you don't want to take the appropriate steps when raising a child, don't do it.  

I'm effectively being told what I can and can't look at based on the fact that someone has a child somewhere, whether I do or not seems to be entirely irrelevant. How is that not a punishment? I shouldn't need to ask to do something perfectly legal in my own house.

Of course, Cameron apparently asked the ISPs to allow him to say that he was implementing a default-on system when in fact the ISPs are doing the exact opposite, so this whole issue is probably moot and just a piece of populist nonsense. You'll still need to opt in to the blocks when you sign up, but Cameron wants to tell people that you won't, so it makes no difference.

They have gone full retard with their announcement, banning BDSM porn, enforcing a filter, and making the filter on by default all at once. Predictably, this has caused a lot of outrage among tech savvy UK citizens and as we can see, there is already a petition to stop the filter.

But now everyone in panicking and getting angry at the current measures, I put it to you that this was their plan all along.

What the final law that actually passes will be is a watered down bill which, say, might make the filter opt-in, and only ban super violent porn. The people will think this is some sort of victory and that they've won against the government, but mostly, they will be relieved, because the initial draconian proposals are now not as bad as what was first reported.

However, the government will have done what they wanted to do in the first place: put a filter on the internet and ban porn they dislike. The people will be less outraged because the actual law will look like a watered down version of the original proposals, yet the government still get their way. And make no mistake, even if a watered down version is passed, they've still laid the ground for just as much censorship in the future.

The /r/RestoreTheFourth[4] movement garnered national press in a way that EFF simply has not done, even during its most high-profile (and brilliantly executed) court cases. You're right to identify that the 'movement', in its current state, is a mere pipedream, but I think it would be cynical to assume that nothing more could come of it given the incredible scope for community-sourced input and expertise.
The power of the ORG lies in their collective (particularly legislative, they're no advertisors) expertise; the power of a movement is in its unique ability to raise to national level the debate about topic X.

true,Lord_Yaxley,scot-scottishborders,Jings Crivvens Help Ma Boab,"I don't think I was describing a utopian past.  Just a different situation.  There's no real need to use mocking adjectives such as 'utopian'.  Porn was certainly widespread in print.  But if you remember correctly, it was all softcore.  If you were getting hardcore, it was illegal, and because you had certain means of access.  Now crucially, this meant it was very very difficult for children to access (ie. they couldn't go down the local newsagent and pinch it)

&gt;I also don't see an argument for why an unrestricted internet is unworkable - the internet has existed for 20 years without government regulation like this.

This isn't true.  Images of child abuse and people being encouraged to commit suicide has always been illegal.  Societies rules have always applied to the internet; the web does not exist in a vacuum, and there are many, many people each year sent to jail, or fined, for illegal activity online.  The web has also evolved into something it wasn't 20 years ago.  And people have changed too.  The web is no longer the preserve of an elite few.  Society has a duty to continually review and apply regulations where appropriate.  If we were to take your argument, and apply it to the banks, you surely see why it doesn't make sense.

I'm sorry, I don't buy your argument regarding China.  We can and do regularly change laws and punish politicians for making mistakes.  If 'Dave' has got it wrong, then the majority can create petitions, protest, lobby their MP's and ultimately vote him out.

&gt;it is also going to upset a LOT of predominantly men in their 20s-60s when they have to do the 'call of shame' to their ISP.

Again there is a lot of misinformation going on here.  The opt in and opt out occurs online.  Users will be presented with a screen that offers the choice.  There is no call of shame.

&gt;but rather deny them the proper sexual education they ought to be reciving through their parents and schools in a supportive environment.

I cannot agree with this.  Whether you like pornography or not, to say it is representative of a normal sexual practice is not true.  Sexual education has a place, a very crucial place.  But kids should not be learning about sex from youporn.

&gt;Legal pornography itself is legal, and those individuals that desire it and those buisnesses that provide it are as entitled to use the internet for that purpose as anyone else. After all, the government don't own the internet, only some of the infrastructure used to provide it.

But it's not being taken away.  It's still going to be there.

Political figures. Doctors. Lawyers. Pretty much any profession that relies on client relations and personal reputation. Do you realize how incredibly damaging to a doctor...say, a pediatrician,  if 'concerned mothers' catch wind of this?

Some people cannot simply throw away thir profession to make a point. This is a very annoying catch 22 situation, in which heavy support from practicing liberal professionals (doctors/lawyers) to such a cause would certainly favour changing the public opinion...but such professionals are severely discouraged precisely of that public opinion.

These people are the exception not the rule though but because of the media's reaction to the religious conservatives all of a sudden every slightly devout, but very English, Muslim girl who wears a headscarf (comparable version of religious expression to wearing a cross or Yarmulke) is put in the same group as the nutters who are locking up their wives or beating their daughters. The result of this being that minority groups (even the moderates) withdraw further into their communities and cultures as the majority does not accept them, thus exacerbating the problem.

I do disagree with the ""no one is making people come to Britain"" sentiment though. The global economy is making us come here. Many people come here after they have studied because they know they will earn better with a degree here than in their home countries (imagine you had to choose between living in the UK broke or living in China with money), meaning that the UK is actually inadvertently taking advantage of other country's education systems. 

Now none of this is British people's fault at all, it's just life (the government and the banks though, different story). You guys just live in a cool, successful country that many other people want to live in and the UK does actually benefit from people wanting to live here. It just put's you guys in the awkward situation of now you have to deal with hundreds of other cultures and all the issues that come with that (kinda like culture shock in your own country).

But overall you guys do great with with all us foreigners even with Nigel Farage being a dick all the time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Dear Name of MP

I write to your as my MP, in reference to the Governments' Planned public consultation on the issue of introducing additional safeguards, to prevent children from accessing content of an adult nature - namely pornography - on the internet.

Such measures being put forward for the public's' views include a so-called ""Opt In"" scheme. This scheme / system, which is favoured by some campaigners, would see Internet Service Providers [herein referred to as ISPs] be forced to block access to ""inappropriate adult content"" by default, with customers having to register their interest in viewing said content, either when they sign-up for an internet service, or later on.
Proponents of this measure believe, in good faith, that it will prevent young children and impressionable young adults, from accessing material that isn't appropriate for them. Not only do I personally disagree, I believe such measures actually have the potential to cause more damage than potentially envisioned - that by introducing measures that are designed to prevent children and young adults accessing these types of material, that it might simply serve to draw their attention towards them.

Hence my reason for writing to you.
Simply ""blocking"" access to information has been shown in the past to be highly ineffective - due to the nature of it's inception, the internet has been said, much like life, to ""find a way"" - indeed, due to the very nature of both the underlying technology upon which the modern internet is built, and the ""surface level"" - i.e webpages that we browse, the internet as a system is designed to facilitate the distribution of information, even if parts are broken - which measures such as those being proposed would do - they would, in affect, ""break the internet"" for users.
For an example of how blocking access to content has been shown to backfire, allow me to draw your attention to the recent High Court ruling, that required all UK based Internet Service Providers to block access to a well known file sharing website, on the basis that said site was facilitating the distribution of copyrighted materials. Starting this week, ISPs have started complying with this court order and ""blocking"" access to the site.
Which, if you follow the logic as put forward in the High Court judgement, should mean that the website is no longer accessible to users, and that the copyright infringement levelled at it, has ceased. It has been reported this week that since the High Court judgement was handed down, the site has seen an additional twelve million users access it - in other words, by raising the profile of the site, it has only encouraged more people to use it.
The same thing will happen, if this proposed ""Opt In"" scheme were to be introduced, with regards to adult content [in this instance, pornography]. Children are naturally inquisitive, and are prone to testing the boundries of what they can and can't ""get away"" with - if they find out that a certain website is ""out of bounds"" - a website they might not have known about previously - what's to say they might not try to circumvent the ""block"".

Which as any I.T. professional - or your average Pirate Bay user will tell you, will be ridiculously easy. In order to realistically introduce a blanket ""ban"" on anything - sites that infringe copyright laws, extremist websites that espouse hateful vitriolic notions, or - in this case - access to pornography, it would necessitate the introduction of a national ""Firewall"" that would rival the system in place in communist states such as the Peoples Republic of China, and North Korea.

I'm sure you'd agree, that's not a list the United Kingdom should be joining anytime soon - countries that devote countless resources, to block, on a national level, the content its citizens can access.
Not least of all, because parents / guardians who're concerned that their child[ren] might seek out such content can block this access themselves. It doesn't require intervention from the Government for a parent to block access to certain ""types"" of website - they can do it themselves. Typically using the bundled software that came with their internet service.

The problem, it seems, is that some parents aren't technically ""up to speed"" to do this.
If that's the case, surely the solution lies in education, rather than attempting to block something, and hope it goes away? What better barometer is there, when it comes to judging what a child is ready for, than their own parents? It strikes me that this already happens across a variety of other areas:
For instance, we have a legal age at which people can buy - and consume, alcohol. And yet if a parent decides their child can have a small sip of wine with their Sunday dinner, that's seen as OK.
The same applies with films - 12A films can be seen by children under the age of 12, provided their parent deems them mature enough - and emotionally capable of understanding what they're watching, and the context.
Surely the same view should be taken when it comes to pornography. Educate parents how to filter the sites their child[ren] can access - and when they decide certain types of site are appropriate, allow that access.
Otherwise - were an ""opt in"" or ""blanket ban"" type system introduced - what would be to stop a child going to a friends house, whose parents have decided to opt in?

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Yours Faithfully,

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;yes it is, but why would you oppose making that responsibility slightly easier for them to manage? the only reason is that it slightly inconveniences you, which you have to admit is a bit selfish.

Because the raising of their child is not my responsibility. 

Answer this question: why should parents not do it themselves? Just look at television - graphic films depicting rape are on TV, and you can watch without opting in to see it, so would you stop that system too? Or would you say to parents, 'don't let your child watch it'? 

It won't make it easier to manage - people will work out how to get round it in seconds, and then you'll get people browsing on completely unrestricted VPNs meaning they can access all sorts of weird stuff that no one wants to see. If Cameron genuinely cared he wouldn't cut funding to the body that investigates child abuse online. 

&gt;I'm sure you also would like to see benefits removed from those parents who don't work too right?

Stupid analogy - many reasons people are out of work with kids, losing jobs etc., benefits are fundamental to allow people to survive. Also many reasons people have kids when they're out of work. Also, I'm happy to pay taxes to help people live

&gt;you're not, you can look at what you want, just takes 1 call.

Yes I am - I'm not free to do what is legal, without first clearing it with some third party, who have no right to know what I'm doing. If i was 'free' to look at it, I would be able to do so without restriction. This is a restriction, no matter how small. Also, I've phoned ISPs before, and if Virgin are anything to go on we're looking at around £20 in phone bills just to sort it out.


P.s. You say there's a dissonance between people wanting page 3 banned and hardcore porn available. If this block comes in, would you say that all adult mags, papers etc., need to be removed from all public places?

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; If you were getting hardcore, it was illegal, and because you had certain means of access. Now crucially, this meant it was very very difficult for children to access 

Hardcore pornography was widespread and yes whilst technically illegal, police enforcement was along the lines of ""confiscate if caught with, but otherwise turn a blind eye"". I recall seeing a stash of extremely graphic shemale porn on a hill in a certain park in London of all places, I guess in the early 90s. Far from being hidden, this stuff was - quite literally - widespread.

As I said before, the majority of it was European in origin and sold by dodgy newsagents and 'bookshops' - the latter of which were usually run by gangsters as part of a larger drugs/crime operation. They were very dangerous places that have largely disappeared. Ironically, I belive the law was actually quite complicated - with different laws governing what could be **produced** in the UK vs what could be legally **imported**.

&gt; The opt in and opt out occurs online

The initial opt in has been proposed as an online splash screen... however, that does not mean that making future changes will be online. For example, I can restrict adult content on my orange iPhone using their app on the phone itself, but to turn it back on I must call them or go online using a PC. What is to say, the female partner in a couple may see the splash screen and 'opt-in' only for her husband to have to subtly make the ""call of shame"" later on.

I'm all for protecting children, I genuinely am, but this is a sledgehammer approach. Its like preventing road deaths by banning roads.

&gt; But kids should not be learning about sex from youporn.

TO clarify the obvious, nobody here is advocating that pornography be used as a means of sexual education. I am saying that by assuming you have ""protected"" children from online pornography, you are unlikely to then sit them down and educate them about what it is, how it can be used safely and what context in which to understand it. When they do eventually come into contact with it, they will be ill-equipt to understand how it differs from normal sexual behaviours, and how it can be safely integrated into a healthy sexual identity... those are the things sexual education should teach children. But instead this is a backwards move to a sort of 1950s *""Dont talk about it, deny everything""* repressed approach to sexuality.

&gt; But it's not being taken away. It's still going to be there.

As I said, the measures will inevitably create a sort of incentive block to accessing pornography. Not everyone who views it today, will view it under an opt-in system... particularly I suspect those of the older generation who may not be able to reconcile 'opting in' with their significant others. It is an assualt on a legal practice, being carried out in the name of children who it won't even help.

&gt; Society does have a duty to prevent child abuse images being distributed

That is a seperate issue that has been compounded into this, but actually has **nothing** to do with child pornography for which extensive legislative measures already exist. This is about 'protecting' children from **legal** pornographic material on the internet. Clearly illegal things are illegal.

&gt;  Again, your porn is not being taken from you, it's only content that is already illegal that is being taken away.

Ahhhhhh, I think this is where you're confused -- there are two seperate measures going on here, both being discussed on reddit:

* A 'default-on, opt-in' system for ""adult content"", a term yet to be defined. The inferance is this means **legal** pornography, but it could actually include a vast amount more - from 18+ youtube videos to sites like reddit, imgur etc. Assuming it would be implemented like existing default-off ISP level filters or mobile phone restrictions it would include swathes of the internet. In effect, what you would be able to access are things like Facebook, google, buisness websites, ebay/amazon etc.

* Added pressure on ISPs and search engines to prevent objectionable search requests related to **illegal** content. These would bring up a splash screen with helpline numbers and a warning that the search is not allowed.

I dont have a fundamental issue with the latter move provided it does not exclude legal search results - although as experts have said, that objectionable content is already almost entirely inaccessible through sites like Google who actually do a lot to prevent it - and instead is located on unsearchable/uncachable websites, virtual private networks, the anonymous Tor network or accessed via difficult to trace IP proxies.",0,1374505846,null,0,false,0,cb7txuo,t3_1it0bl,t1_cb7txuo,t1_cb7t4b3,null,1430378541,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

you can't - graphic rape on TV must take place post-watershed, which is there to protect kids. this porn block seems to be exactly the same principle.

6 year olds will? 6 year olds will actively try to access hardcore porn?

you've really not demonstrated this. if you think parents need to take responsibility before having kids, why should you have to pay for those kids in the first place? the logic is identical.

you don't have to clear it, you just ask.

they don't know what you're doing. but of course if they wanted to, as your ISP I'm pretty sure they could find out.

you are free to get pissed all day if you want. you still have the restriction of having to go to the shop to buy the alcohol. 

&gt; If this block comes in, would you say that all adult mags, papers etc., need to be removed from all public places?

no, that would be akin to removing porn websites from the internet, which this doesn't do. this is more akin to the watershed, or putting porn mags on the top shelf, or banning kids from sex shops.

* 2006-07: ""His first half season at Liverpool saw injuries limit him to four first-team appearances during Spring 2006.""
* 2007-08: Misses practically entire season with metatarsal injury.
* 2008-09: Ostensibly healthy, 15 starts in the Premier League.
* 2009-10: Out for a month with surgery on a recurring back issue.
* 2010-11: Misses a few matches after a concussion in mid-August, other injuries keep him out until December, knee injury in early-March rules him out for the rest of the season.
* 2011-12: Out a month (late-Feb to early-April) with rib injury.
* 2012-13: No major injuries, essentially plays a complete season.

Some injuries may have been unlucky, some injuries a result of his passionate style of play, but the fact is that Daniel Agger has been injury-prone one way or another. At least, seemingly more so than other players of his importance/caliber.

That being said ... Rodgers' new medical staff has seemed to work wonders with players like Gerrard and Agger. If the likes of Gerrard and Agger finish another season playing a majority of matches, I will be even more impressed with the medical staff.

Perhaps Rodgers' confidence in the medical staff (if the 33-year-old Steven Gerrard can start 36 matches, why can't the 32-year-old Kolo Toure?) is one of the reasons why the pursuit of a centre-back hasn't seemed to be a big of a priority as once was thought.",0,1374506556,null,0,1374506803,0,cb7u6hh,t3_1itd2o,t1_cb7u6hh,t3_1itd2o,null,1430378428,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;6 year olds will? 6 year olds will actively try to access hardcore porn?

Would they anyway? I don't see your point here. If you're saying 6 year olds might stumble on it, they won't. It's very hard to, unless you go on sites like the Daily Mail or the Sun. And if you're letting 6 year olds online unsupervised, then my point is proved.

&gt;you've really not demonstrated this. if you think parents need to take responsibility before having kids, why should you have to pay for those kids in the first place? the logic is identical.

No. Financial and moral responsibilities are different. You could be poor, on benefits, but still be responsible enough to not let your kid watch TV unsupervised, go online unsupervised or without parental locks, hang around drugs dens. I think you've equated poverty with a lack of morality, which is repugnant. And as I've said, what about parents who have kids, then lose their jobs, or parents who were poorly educated about birth control and contraception? I'm not going to punish people for that.

&gt;they don't know what you're doing. but of course if they wanted to, as your ISP I'm pretty sure they could find out.

Oh really? So I'd want the block removed to watch Seinfeld online, would I? 

&gt;banning kids from sex shops

This is more like making you apply for a permit to enter a sex shop, just in case a kid wanders in.

&gt;they can opt out and watch porn.

And leave the kids free to see rape fantasies? You monster!

p.s.

&gt; graphic rape on TV must take place post-watershed, which is there to protect kids. this porn block seems to be exactly the same principle.

It's not the same principle. The film will come on regardless, this block would stop the film from being shown unless you opt-in (although this won't be what happens, according to the Guardian, you'll still have to opt-out of porn at the sign up).

Also, the watershed is pointless unless the parents are responsible enough to ensure their kids don't watch it. I know I used to stay up and watch late night stuff, or go round my friends house whose parents didn't mind. It's probably why I'm such a degenerate these days, come to think of it.",0,1374506753,null,0,1374508075,0,cb7u8xj,t3_1it4uw,t1_cb7u8xj,t1_cb7u2rz,null,1430378397,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So no, I literally cannot see what horrendous implications could occur from having to opt in to view pornography, I can't really see it being that big of a deal to have to opt in to view more ambiguous content either. You realise that if there is a list and not just some switch it will be so long and contain such a high proportion of the population it would be utterly meaningless as a tool of repression (not that there is any evidence there is a desire to ""repress"" people who want to view ""adult content"")? Maybe some ISPs will use this as the excuse to _charge_ for such content, but in the end, people had to pay for porn before the internet, doesn't seem like a big deal to me.

Blocks on the internet are sketchy at best and blanket-blocking key words that might suggest pornographic or adult content will pick up a lot of websites that are not actually pornographic at all.

I can see your points, and you make a convincing argument.  I think there may be a bit of confusion all round and the government do not seem to be doing a good job of selling it, even to the likes of myself who may be more inclined to offer a sympathetic ear.

I often get accused of having a 'think of the children' attitude here on Reddit.  And perhaps it's because I am a little older than most, and that I do have children, but, and this is the thing, someone *does actually have to think about children* at some point.  And not just children, but vulnerable adults, the older generation and less web savvy users.  

I think this is a balancing act.  For me, asking people to 'opt in to a web filter' is going to be like speaking Chinese.  They won't have a clue what you are talking about.  They go online to look a pics of the grandchildren abroad, buy cheap DVDs and see what the weather is like.  The majority of porn users, because of their demographic, are web savvy enough to opt out of a filter.  And that's why it makes sense to me.

Well then their parents should have taken the appropriate measures to stop it.

&gt; if you don't want to be inconvenienced at all because of other people having kids, then you wouldn't be cool with your taxes paying for kids, child benefit, etc etc.

Well, frankly no, you brought money into it, I never mentioned that I didn't want to assist parents financially, if you want to view it like that. Why wouldn't I be happy that my taxes might buy food or nappies for a kid? I don't see that as an inconvenience at all, quite the opposite. I wouldn't stipulate where that money had to be spent, however, or how they should live, and I'd expect the same in return from them. Financial assistance and 'moral' assistance are two different things. I don't want a moral code forced on me, I'm happy to be financially inconvenienced (if you can call it that). I don't think there's a massive contradiction there. 

&gt;these parents will be aware of the risks and likely more active in doing something about protecting their kids. if not, the situation is as it currently is, which you seem to be cool with.

So ultimately it DOES come down to the parents. I am 'cool' with it as it is, just like I'm 'cool' with parents telling kids they can't watch certain films without wanting an opt-in service on tele. And I think, as this generation grows up, you'll struggle to find parents who aren't aware of the risks and will know how to take the appropriate steps. This is a heavyhanded, inappropriate idea that might well do more harm than good.

Kids will always have the possibility of stumbling into porn. At a very young age, it might be concerning. When they're going through puberty and such I see no cause for major concern.

In 2005, Child Porn was banned, and a filter was initiated.
Soon after, file sharing sites were added to the filter because they might be used for Child Porn.

Once file sharing sites were added, any file sharing site at all could be added including sites that only shared MP3s. This was all passed after the initial legislation banning Child Porn specifically. The filter changed at this point, and it was too late for people to fight it. The law was initially to ban child porn and the sharing of child porn, it now reaches to ban file sharing.

2011 - Websites selling drugs and unlicensed gambling were added to the banned list. This was not opposed because they are obviously seen as bad by the general public, so to fight it seemed silly.

2012 - ISP's will block any copyright infringing content if ordered to do so by the court. ANY copyright infringing content.

Once there is a filter in place, it is extremely easy to openly filter more things (Drugs, Gambling) or secretly use it to filter things the public didn't know they were able to filter with the laws already in place (file sharing, copyright data)

Look at Denmark, originally a law was passed to filter websites with child porn. This was unopposed because child porn is bad. Now any file sharing website is banned because it might have porn on it, even websites that only have music. They have also expanded it to block selling drugs, and by proxy information about drugs, and unlicensed gambling. The newest law says the government can ask an ISP to block any website for copyright infringement and they must oblige. Its getting more and more oppressive, and harder and harder to fight. Once the framework is there, its much easier for them to slowly gain more control over what you can and cannot access.

I did a little soul searching before I bought the bike...i needed to know I could trust myself with a fairly powerful bike.

Insurance is a massive consideration...I ended up striking lucky with Carole Nash and paying around £400. But you've got to laugh at some of the shit you get quoted (11 grand for fully comp Ducatti Monster 620 that was worth 2.5k.) a 250/300 will likely be cheaper, but it may not.

No you wouldn't. You'd just need to know that there does exist pornography on the internet. 

Also, what on earth? Most people don't know who their ISP is? This is absurd. You have to choose your ISP. We should not legislate on behalf of such obliviousness.

&gt;likewise I was not aware that phoning up your ISP to ask for your porn back was an invasion of your civil liberties. 

The precedent this sets for our government becoming comfortable with censoring the internet and the fact that Cameron has said that there are certain words (undisclosed, of course) that are so abhorrent and disgusting that search engines should block (or return no results for) is concerning for civil liberties. That kind of filtering would transcend the blocks.

&gt;so we shouldn't do anything about it, even when we can?

Not for things like this, no. You keep trumpeting parents ignorance about the most basic of things that would help them block pornography from their children. How about I return the favour. What if someone wants to watch pornography but is too ignorant to know how to get around the block?

&gt;who's unplugging the internet? 

You know what I mean. Not at the expense of the free market that the internet is.

&gt;yes, particularly young kids. no one thinks its going to stop 17 year olds accessing porn. 

It will if their parents block it, or no-one knows how to remove it and the teenager is not allowed to put it back on by the ISP.
