Clara: ""Who's that?""

Doctor: ""Never mind. Lets go back.""

Clara: ""But who is he?""

Doctor: ""He's me. There is only me here, that's the point. Now lets get back""

Clara: ""But I never saw that one. I saw all of you, 11 faces, all of them you. You're the 11th doctor.""

Doctor: ""I said he was me, I never said he was the doctor.""

Clara: ""I don't understand.""

Doctor: ""Look, my name, my real name. That is not the point; the name I chose is 'The Doctor'. The name you choose is like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.""

Clara faints

Doctor: ""Clara! Clara! He is my secret.""

John Hurt: ""What I did, I did without choice...""

Doctor: ""I know.""

John Hurt: ""... in the name of peace and sanity.""

Doctor: ""But not in the name of 'The Doctor'.""


Now if you followed the lore from before the new series, and all the hints going through the new series, especially the episodes that directly reference and involve Gallifrey (ie: Voyage of the damned, Sound of drums, End of Time w/ Sir Timothy Dalton) knows that the doctor discarded his original name after he stopped the last Great Time War by doing something terribly horrible (8th Doctor), or possibly the events prior to him stealing the TARDIS. This is probably the telling of that event that started him on his Journey as ""The Doctor"". There is also some debate of him being 'The Other' (one of the founders of the Time Lords - Along with Rassilon and Omega) by being re-Loomed some ten million years later to the House of Lungbarrow as the Time Lord who would become known as the First Doctor.

First off there is no top level ""Science"" category, only factual (which gets you everything from ""The Apprentice"" to wildlife programming to old dodders talking about taking drugs in the 60s.

One level down from that, there's ""Science and Nature"", where you get a shitload of programmes about squirrels and nothing about rovers on mars, exotic matter research, bioengineering, nanotechnology, the Higgs boson etc. Once in a blue moon you get a Horizon program that is actually about the forefront of scientific discovery and not in some way related to aforementioned squirrels or psuedoscientific research on cats, or dogs, or freaking babies.

Though keeping up the act for very long can have effects on one's mental state to the point where they do develop mental problems which weren't there before. Especially when the act goes on at all times, and when a person's around others enough so that they don't get much time to mentally rest from the strain of the act. It becomes worse when overly stressed because the person essentially then has to hold back mental resources that normally would be applied fully to decision making to doing that and maintaining the illusion of the false personality. 

Though sometimes the exact opposite can occur and the act actually influences the underlying natural personality to the point of having some change on the outlook in one's normal resting state when not around others.

It's one thing talking about supply and demand when we're talking about the price of apples - if I don't like what's on offer I can choose to buy peaches or a Dell instead.  

I don't really believe it's meaningful to talk in the same way when the buyer's alternative is to sleep on the street. 

There's a limited amount of land here in the UK, there's green belt and planning permission preventing one from building a home practically anywhere. Jobs are in the cities, and realistically one needs to be within 60 - 90 minutes commute of work.

So demand resolves itself that realistically we all have to either buy or rent somewhere to live.

The property buying and rental markets will always be in a balance whereby those who don't buy cause increased rental demand; increased rental demand increases the value of property as an investment.

The problem with this is that servers aren't unionised and that many states have *at will* employment laws, which mean the employer doesn't have to give a reason when dismissing an employee. 

So if a server was to demand the restaurant make up for poor tips it would be illegal to sack them, but it would be legal to pay them the money and tell them in a week's time, ""sorry, we've given your shifts to the new guy, don't bother coming back"".

Yes, generally American tipping culture does now pay servers better than minimum wage and is considered ""beneficial"" to them, but only because it's a self-perpetuating cycle - people feel obliged to tip because waiters depend on it, restaurants don't pay minimum wage because servers get tipped.

Revealing that he's the Master (or another Time Lord) regenerating when we thought he was the Doctor. In the next episode, the real Doctor turns out to be a quaint &amp; innocuous observer we were introduced to but thought to be nothing more than this season's Wilf trying to keep tabs on the Master while looking like a bumbling incompetent person. Of course, it comes when the Master is about to execute a huge mass of people that the act is set aside and the Doctor is revealed to do something amazing at the last second and save everyone.",0,1371526933,null,0,1371527172,0,cal0p4b,t3_1gj7wz,t1_cal0p4b,t3_1gj7wz,null,1430773397,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

If a profit can be made from it, then it can likely be done more efficiently by a private companies (who are more agile and less prone to bureaucracy). 

Government exists for the essentials in which there is no profit - police, fire and medical emergencies, for example. 

I'm not sure if I wholly agree with this view myself, but I believe it's fairly widely accepted as a modern post Thatcher/Reagan view of the world - followed not only by the Tories but by New Labour, too.

The purpose of student loans, however, is not to make a profit (IMO).

5 decades ago, only people with rich parents could afford to go to university - it was then (1962) that student grants were introduced, so that the same opportunities would be open to all.

For the first time a kid from a council estate had the opportunity to become a doctor or a lawyer - previously those occupations had only been available to those whose parents could afford to support them through university. 

So student loans should be a not-for-profit enterprise that we use to subsidise social mobility. ",0,1371527195,null,0,false,0,cal0s9f,t3_1gibst,t1_cal0s9f,t1_cakgy3s,null,1430773356,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Then again, I sometimes get the wrong idea myself - though unlike a lot of people I can at least admit it when I realise. Usually, anyway.

I don't think Aspergers is unique - there's lots of people out there who're oversensitive or having a bad day, lots of people who look or sound stressed/angry/whatever when they aren't, and different people may have a different idea of what the context actually is.

I also don't think that this would be another Torres situation. Torres' main attribute to his game was his pace. After his ACL injury at Liverpool, he lost his step. Take his speed away from him, and your left with a very average player as we've seen. Cavani isn't coming off any significant injury, his pace isn't his main attribute and he's a very well rounded player. He could fit into almost any team out there. I think we should buy him regardless of the price because I think he'd make it all worth it.

Jack Cork is a good player, he needed to go to the Championship to gain confidence and to grow.  Keeping him at Chelsea for 3 years would have been a diservice to everyone.  He would not have improved or adapted.

To say he would have challenged for a starting place at Chelsea this season, is incorrect, who would he have replaced? Luiz, Lampard, Ramires, Mikel?  After that there is Essien and Romeu.

In my opinion part of the reason why season 7 was so disappointing is that it lacked the strong and brilliant story arcs that Moffat laid out in the two prior seasons. For instance, the Ganger two parter and A Town Called Mercy were both good, however only one of them had the game changing moment for the series long arc.

&gt;The Spaniards want around 8m Euros (£6.8m) for the player, but Liverpool anticipate that can be negotiated down to £6m in the next few days. They remain confident a deal will be completed.

He expects us to compromise at a deal of £9mill for Mingolet:

&gt;Sunderland goalkeeper Mignolet has emerged as a major target in recent days, and though the clubs are still some way off in terms of their valuations of the Belgian international, a compromise worth around £9m is expected to be struck.

He expects the same with Ilori:

&gt;A similar situation exists with Sporting Lisbon defender Ilori, with the Portuguese side asking for in excess of £6m for the 20-year-old. Liverpool have so far offered around £3m, but expect to make progress on that front, though the player is currently on duty with Portugal’s U20 side at the World Cup in Turkey.

He reveals a deal for Mkhitaryan will take a little longer, although confirms that he's in Donetsk to speak to Shakhtar officials:

&gt;A deal to bring Shakhtar Donetsk star Henrikh Mkhitaryan to Anfield, however, is likely to take a little longer. The ECHO revealed on Monday that the Reds will face a fight to land the Armenian, with a number of top European clubs also monitoring his situation.

&gt;Mkhitaryan is valued at £20m, and the initial noises from his camp have been promising. The Reds, though, view the 24-year-old as an “ambitious” target, and hope the absence of European football at Anfield next season will not be a hindrance to any deal. Mkhitaryan is understood to have flown to the Ukraine on Monday to speak with Shakhtar officials about securing a move away from the club.

Also reports Aspas signing may not be done until the opening of the transfer window on July 1th:

&gt;Liverpool are bemused, meanwhile, by reports suggesting their £7.7m deal to sign striker Aspas from Celta Vigo could be delayed, or even blocked, by a dispute with the Spanish Football Federation over the player’s paperwork. The Reds announced a deal had been agreed in principle for Aspas last week, and are adamant the move will be finalised once both the English and Spanish transfer windows open at the end of the month.",0,1371541250,null,0,false,0,cal47fx,t3_1gkmgl,t1_cal47fx,t3_1gkmgl,null,1430771671,25,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,25

All I've seen is overwhelming support for the strikers, so again, striking hasn't lost them support as people understand their frustration and the reasons for their decisions. 

Out of curiosity, what level of education did you get?  What do you do for a living?  I have two degrees and two postgraduate certificates, but I earn about £10 an hour because I work in the voluntary sector.  I have a relatively low wage not because I don't work hard enough or, by your figuring, because I lack intelligence or hard work but because that's the nature of the sector.  By your rationale, I've put a huge amount of hard work and development in to my education and employment however I find my vocation lies in this sector.   That said, the wages are very low, the cost of living very high and I need every penny and if someone cut my wages by even a pound an hour that would be a significant chunk out of my wage packet. 
Have you possibly considered that people might be happy to do their job, don't want another one, but just want a living wage for doing it?
Also, as someone who's role is to help people find work, I can tell you these magic higher paid jobs you think exist in abundance simply don't. You do understand the mass unemployment right now right?

The average UK temperature was 3.7 °C above normal meaning it was the warmest April on record since 1910. In central England, it was the warmest April for over 350 years.

Maximum temperatures were well above average, by as much as 6 °C in south-east England.

Do away with housing benefit at a saving of £20 billion a year and use the money instead to build a crap load of cheap government owned housing with cut priced rental costs and the possibility to buy the property cheaply after a decade or so of living in it.  With one fell swoop you're providing instant competition to the rental market rather than paying to inflate the market by lining private landlords pockets.  And secondly you would provide competition to the housing sale market to bring down prices without their being a complete price crash.  Such a scheme would also give a huge boost to the currently suffering building industry.

As it currently stands we have too many people searching for not enough homes.  The housing benefit system as it currently works does nothing to make rent more affordable for those at the bottom end of the market because all it does is mean that land lords can afford to increase rental prices.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I get what you are saying, and there are a couple things.

First off, people here (and all message boards in general) like to debate, so regardless of the player (excluding maybe Messi) people will find pros/cons and voice them for no other reason to have a conversation.

Secondly i think it speaks to who we are as a club and a fanbase.  I think we can all agree that we are a great club, but none of us are under any delusion as to how much money we have as a club.  When you look at City, United and Chelsea in particular their fans there is a true sense of entitlement (it can be argued rightfully) amongst the fans.  Those clubs can afford to pay whatever they need to get any player and the fans know this, when a major player spurns them it aggravates them because they have top notch clubs with more money than they know what to do with.

Then you have Liverpool who's fan base has a sense of entitlement based on historical performance but are coming to the realization that the new owners are running the team under a different business model than before.  They still believe that they should get any player but are coming to grips (slowly, but it is happening) that they aren't going to compete for the top players as it currently stands.

Arsenal fans feel entitled because their team continues to make CL, they make money (plenty of it) and like it or not are fairly well run. Their fans feel they should compete for every player and those players should consider themselves lucky to play for them.  however the club is run differently and sticks to its path so the fans bitch and whine that they aren't signing Cavani.

Then you have our fans, we are all painfully aware of who we are as a team, we are aware of who our owner is (personally i am convinced that Joe Lewis is just Bernie from Weekend at Bernie's down in the Bahamas), we know our chairman, we know the club finances and we know our history.  We are in all effects a fan base of realists (you could even say pessimists), we know we have a good team that should be playing in Europe but we are also all aware that we can't afford the wages of Chelsea, United or City.  We know we play attractive football and are always looking for a bargain but we are also painfully aware of our wage cap.  We would love to grab any player on the market but we know that we have never spent over £16.5m for a player.  

 As a result i think we end up with a large proportion of people ( i fall into this group as much as anyone) who look at a signing like Sneijder and say ""what a fantastic player"" and then think for a moment and realize his wages would be outrageous, his transfer cost would be massive for a player approaching his 30's, he has had injury problems, the Dutch national players think he is a prima dona etc. Instead of coming out and saying ""we are unlikely to be able to spend for a player like him"" we tend to rationalize through our understanding of the club and say ""he is expensive, older and plays the same position of a couple promising youth"", i think it is almost a defense mechanisim so we don't get disappointed.

We barely tolerate the Leandro fucking Damiao saga that seems to end every window without him here.  Could you imagine if every year we ended up disappointed because we didn't sign Sneijder, Lewandowski and James Rodriguez....people would be suicidal.

&gt;Defence officials issued a confidential D notice to the BBC and other media groups in an attempt to censor coverage of surveillance tactics employed by intelligence agencies in the UK and US.
&gt;
&gt;Editors were asked not to publish information that may ""jeopardise both national security and possibly UK personnel"" in the warning issued on 7 June, a day after the Guardian first revealed details of the National Security Agency's (NSA) secret Prism programme.
&gt;
&gt;The D notice, which was marked ""private and confidential: not for publication, broadcast or use on social media"", was made public on the Westminster gossip blog, Guido Fawkes. Although only advisory for editors, the self-censorship system is intended to prevent the media from making ""inadvertent public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations and methods"".
&gt;
&gt;The warning was issued by defence officials in the UK as the BBC, ITN, Sky News and other newspapers and broadcasters around the world covered the surveillance revelations disclosed by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The leaks, reported extensively in the Guardian and also the Washington Post, have made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a week.
&gt;
&gt;However, it is not clear what impact the warning has had on media coverage of Snowden's revelations relating to British intelligence. William Hague, the foreign secretary, who is reponsible for GCHQ, was not asked when he appeared on Monday's BBC Radio 4 Today programme about reports that the spy agency was involved in monitoring communications made by foreign delegates at the G20 summit in London 2009. Instead the subject was discussed in an item aired towards the end of the programme at 8.45am.
&gt;
&gt;A BBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the D notice, but pointed out that the broadcaster did cover the G20 surveillance story on its radio news bulletins. She said the BBC believed it had ""afforded the story"" what the broadcaster described as ""the appropriate level of coverage"" among other significant news items, ""including the ongoing G8 summit, the sentencing of Stuart Hall, the Co-op Bank bailout and the Ian Brady hearing"".
&gt;
&gt;According to the Guido Fawkes website, the warning said: ""There have been a number of articles recently in connection with some of the ways in which the UK intelligence services obtain information from foreign sources.
&gt;
&gt;""Although none of these recent articles has contravened any of the guidelines contained within the defence advisory notice system, the intelligence services are concerned that further developments of this same theme may begin to jeopardise both national security and possibly UK personnel.""",0,1371550016,null,0,false,0,cal5duq,t3_1gko93,t1_cal5duq,t3_1gko93,null,1430771115,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

For a few decades the system is geared to benefit someone who speculates with borrowed money rather than saves money. I.e. the rate someone saves will always fall behind the rate someone will be able to borrow. This came to ahead in the late 90s when tax relief was applied to interest on mortgages and loans. If you buy a house, you pay the mortgage (the principle and interest), you only get a small benefit compared to a buy to let landlord who can get an interest only loan and then charge a tenant enough to cover the rent and get tax relief on 100% of the payments they make on their loan.

To them it was a no brainer, but now you have to compete with someone who doesn't plan on ever owning the property outright, someone who not only will compete with one house you might buy, but every house you could potentially buy.

It's not just housing, but for most of us this is where it's most apparent. If you work for the AA, Topman, or Boots you may know what I'm talking about. They are owned by companies that have loaded them up with debt and now their operating costs are being squeezed. They technically make little money but only because they owe a large chunk to the company that owns them and the companies only just manage to cover the interest on their loans.

true,duckman273,1953,Juan Mata,"&gt;Ahh stuck being Joe Allen and Gylfi, both who really impressed at bigger clubs. 

It seems like you're being sarcastic, but Allen was pretty much Liverpool's best player at the start of the season and then he still played well when he was played out of position due to Lucas' injury, his form really declined when he injured his shoulder. Sigurdsson had a bad start, but he's been a good player at Tottenham even though he's been played out of position to allow Bale to play in the centre and this isn't that relevant considering that after January both of them were in great form, which is why McEachran didn't get much of a chance, why else would Liverpool and Tottenham have bought them?

&gt;Frank Lampard's replacement.

I don't think he is, he's nothing like Frank.

&gt;To say he would have challenged for a starting place at Chelsea this season, is incorrect, who would he have replaced? Luiz, Lampard, Ramires, Mikel? After that there is Essien and Romeu. 

Seriously did you watch him this season? He and Schneiderlin formed one of the best midfields in the league. He's a far better midfielder than Luiz, is better than Essien or Romeu right now, is also much more suited to the 2 man midfield than Lampard and while he has a similar workrate to Ramires, he's able to consistently pass the ball over 5 yards without fucking it up.

Anyway, McEachran clearly has the *potential* to be a brilliant player who can start at Chelsea, for a creative player like him who relies entirely on technique and is not at all physically gifted he's doing very well.

One thing we mustn't do is get into a stand-off over the transfer request like we did with Alonso. That saga lasted the whole summer, with Xabi finally handing in the request right at the end of the window, meaning we didn't have time to replace him.

I would argue that Alonso leaving without being replaced is the single largest factor in our decline from where we were in 2009 to our current position.

The idea that a player who is agitating to leave through comments to newspapers is entitled to a ""loyalty"" payment is distasteful, but it's better to get things done early and get the replacement in. Losing Owen without a replacement, then Alonso without a replacement, are two things that have cost us incredibly dearly over the last decade.

London has a far larger footfall, but given its location, it is hard to imagine it has a smaller cost. Also, reading through the donation page, there is no mention of the money going to particular museums, in fact the way that the donations across the group are mentioned, it implies there is no policy of money raised in one location going to that location. Becoming a patron is a different thing, but I don't think it is the donation option you initially mentioned? I'd love to visit MOSI of an evening, but aside from the occasional beerfestival in the power hall I am unaware of any happening. As to the cash? I suspect if it was a matter of ten grand, selling a train, a car, or some other holding would cover it. Which implies that the deficit is far more serious. 

**Engage speculation mode**

The way that this announcement has been managed has been a shambles from the start. This implies big problems all round. To announce one museum is safe, and therefore it is down to NRM and MOSI, is just more of the same. Like it or loathe it (and I loathe it) MOSI is the better candidate to close. The NRM is a historic site too, more suited to the display of its collection, and MOSI never made full use of the site it does have. Which is not to say I approve. It is pure speculation to say that the London site is subsidising the Northern ones, aside from the grant in aid which was withdrawn from MOSI by the government, forcing the merger last year.

It's outrageous how many of our new builds get sold to investment companies, foreign investors and private investors so they can bleed dry the young couples that actually want to live there.

Another idea - and one that I accept is COMPLETELY unworkable - is mandate 100% interest mortgages. I can't compete with people whose parents give them £50k towards their first property as I get naff-all from my folks. This would reduce prices because people could only borrow money that they could prove that they would repay. Anyone that did have savings could again invest elsewhere which would be good for the economy. And it would help social mobility because having a rich family wouldn't give you such an advantage. And it would help the young who could commit to longer repayment periods (and therefore lower annual payments).

Why do you think interests rates are currently low? It is to give people with mortgages more disposable income to spend on the high street and online. A new car, and house extention etc. This expenditure fuels the economy. You plunge millions into negative equity the money has to go on clearing that dept not on fueling the economy.

&gt;Would plunge people into debt how?

What do you think negative equity is if it is not dept. Sure a mortgage is already dept but it is secured against the asset. If the asset depreciates and the loan stays the same then you are effectively in dept with no asset. That is what I'm trying to say here.

* Two eastern-europeans who more or less together spent every day I was there watching Manga on their laptop. All day.

* One eastern-european who sat in a corner all day, unless the occasion arised where someone would sit down next to him, at which point they'd both look in his bag, then he'd leave for ten minutes and the visitor would go to the toilet for half an hour. What could be happening there?

* A Caucasian woman who booked time every day to watch Tantric Yoga videos on youtube - 'the path to orgasmic meditiation'

* One turkish-looking guy who watched Dexter every day, despite the video pausing to buffer every ten seconds, to the extend that the picture was stationary more often than not. He watched *whole episodes* like this.

* Queues of people waiting to use the toilet and nothing else, including some that obviously wash out of the toilet too.

* A black kid who insisted on listening to a really shonky amateur rap group on every machine *though the speakers*.

These are just some examples - nearly every machine was used like this. The people using them all had iPhones, and other things to illustrate that this was not a cost issue. And the people not using the machines were either using the study area to sleep, or browse FB off of their own laptops. We also had the obligatory woman that brought her child in every day and did that wonderful childcare method you see on the bus where the child screams/ runs riot and is dealt with by....looking out of the window.

On top of that, we had signs on each machine that needed to be reinstalled saying 'broken, engineer on site, please don't touch' - and people would come to us holding the sign saying 'does this mean I can't use it?'

The staff aren't paid nearly enough to do anything about any of this, but they did give me some stories about how, when faced with no youtube, they'd have visitors who were obviously on benefits shouting about 'how they paid taxes for this'.

&gt;No no no, this only affects people who are selling houses, if you're living in it (which most people do after they buy a house) it doesn't affect you (financially) in the slightest.

What utter rubbish. Sorry but it is. Why should people who buy property be stuck with it? Its called a property ladder for a reason. Maybe you have children and need a bigger property. Maybe you think 3/4 children should share a bedroom but most people would disagree. Maybe you get a job in another part of the country and need to move, what then? Maybe people should just commute the extra hours and fit it into their day? Maybe you want to move from the city center to the suburbs or the country. Just because your personal circumstance mean you don't need to move does not mean you stifle social mobility and freedom of movement on everyone. That is totally wrong and unjust.

&gt;I don't see how falling house prices would increase interest rates.

You have totally missed the point I'm making here. Falling house prices and interest rates are unrelated but the point is the same. If people are spending their money clearing extra debt then they are spending less in the economy, thus starting a vicious cycle. That is why interest rates are low and that is why your plan to plunge everyday people into negative equity would cause the same damage to the economy as raising interest rates.

I don't want to see us scrambling to find a replacement for another key player *after the season has started* (I should have said that, not 'at the end of the window').

Why would you want to do pre-season training based around players who aren't going to to be there? What's the evidence that Perez pays more in August than July? Brinksmanship is more likely to leave us over a barrel with a player leaving for much less than his worth than to get us a higher fee. 

There's so much value in getting this stuff sorted out early that it's worth paying a bogus loyalty fee, or accepting a price that's a little lower than what you imagine Ian Ayre(!) might negotiate a month later, just to have it done in time for preseason. Having your best player leave *after the season has started* and scrambling around to find a replacement has never served us well in the past.

true,mrdotwill,null,null,"Well there are estimated to be at least 920,000 empty homes in the UK [(Source)](http://www.emptyhomes.com/statistics-2/empty-homes-statistice-201112/).  I can't estimate how many extra homes could be made by redeveloping empty commercial property but I think it's safe to say it would be a few hundred thousand.  So we do a lot to combat housing shortage by getting these back in use.  A tax on keeping properties empty would be a good start.

An important thing to remember is that falling house prices while good for the young, the poor and the housing benefit budget would be bad for others.  Most property value doesn't just sit around it is somewhere on the markets.  If it's mortgaged then the banks are packaging the debt and selling it or if it is owned outright it is part of a corporate or private property portfolio and its value ends up being invested somewhere.  If prices were to fall this would be bad for the banks and bad for the super rich as well as normal people with mortgages.  With the interests of the rich at the heart of government policy this means falling house prices won't happen on purpose.

If they did fall, especially if they fell sharply we would be in a similar situation to when the whole credit crunch thing started in America.  People would be screwed over and have their homes repossessed by the banks, the banks profits would go down and they would demand another bailout.  The people would also need bailing out but the banks hold the real power over the government so they would get one and the people (especially the poor) would have to pay for it with more austerity.

Of course you could do the reverse and bail out the small mortgage holders.  The money would go to the banks via them and normal working people would be spared some pain but the banks would prefer we just give the money to them directly.

I am rambling and should get back to the actual question.  How would I solve the problem?  I would start by sticking big taxes on empty properties and second homes, lets clobber those causing the problems to help those suffering from them.  I would then either massively change or replace council tax.  Band H (the highest band) is for properties worth £320,001 and up.  So somebody with a small house in London can end up paying the same as somebody with an enormous mansion elsewhere.  Let's tax the super rich and cut it for the poor.  Then lets buy up and build more council houses.  Why should housing benefits end up as profits for the rich rather than just going to provide for the needy?  Then lets bring in rent controls to help people stay in their homes.  It would hit big property owners profits but far more people who are far worse off would benefit and as a crazy leftie I think that is a good thing.  If house prices fall and those with mortgages start having trouble let's help them out rather than the banks.  Buy up the debt now it is cheap and restructure it with the homeowner.  Make it so they can pay and keep their home.  If they really can't pay then buy it back from them to add to the amount of council housing.  If possible rent it back to them so they can stay in their home.   Oh and lets stick giant taxes on owning massive amounts of land.  In the 21st century the Duke of Westminster shouldn't own huge swathes of the most expensive areas of London and we certainly shouldn't be subsidising this to the tune of £9,200,000 a year [(source)](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/britains-land-is-still-owned-by-an-aristocratic-elite--but-it-doesnt-have-to-be-this-way-483131.html).  Lets either take back land from the aristocracy outright or stick such huge taxes on owning large amounts of land that it becomes impossible to do so.  Lets democratise property ownership, get it into the hands of normal working people.  That way what the people want they can get.  Lets have a very low tax on small amounts of land say 2 hectares, double the tax rate each time the amount of land doubles.  So you pay 4 times as much for 4 hectares as you would for 2.  Land will be redistributed amongst the people and so will wealth and therefore power making us a far more equal and democratic society.

Obviously these are brainstormed ideas by somebody who isn't an expert on running a country and would need to be done slowly and sensibly.  My point is that while the rich hold the majority of the wealth and power there is an incentive to keep prices high.  I don't think this is good for the majority of people in the country and would put in place extremely progressive taxes to reverse this as quickly as possible with an eventual goal of doing away with private property and inequality all together.  How to structure a society without private property is a whole other rant.

Little off topic but here we go https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-housing-survey-2009-to-2010-household-report  It makes for grim reading.

Sadly it doesn't break down that much.  But it does show the disparity between those in big city areas, and those outside.  Also we have to take into account that a number of people who are only declaring one person to get their concil tax cut fradulently.  This is such a problem my council have been sending rude letters, they even questioned mine because the phone line was still in my former housemates name.

However, we can look at rents, mostly that £20k you can't have your own flat live and commute in London.  Unless your lucky enough to get benefits.  This is quite something when you consider that in the context of the UK median wage.  Effectively, London has a high level of inflation, this is very unfair for those on the bottom end of it, as ultimately they are taxed when compared to their disposabled (ie net - rent, - transport) a higher proportion of their income.  A good houseshare in London is normally around the £500pcm mark.  I know couples who have a combined income of about £40k who feel it is their only option if they are going to save money, and have a social lifestyle they want.

The sad thing is, I know couples who can't break up, despite the fact they should, because they are both in a £1000pcm rental agreement for 6 more months, for a one bed.  Admittidly there are cheaper one beds, but I guess being a romantic at heart I could see the desire to have someplace *nice*.

We have the other thing.

Whilst the rail investment thing has been a complete mess, which the synic in me attributes equally to corruption and incompitence, I doubt bringing it all in house is the awnser.  The government doesn't have a great *track* record on this.

I would suggest the costs for that are an *un-known*.  Trying to wiggle out of some of the PPI deals would be a great way of saving money.  Sadly el Brown really appeared to not give a damn when he autohrised a lot of them.  It is problematic thou, because in theory, they are a useful cost saving benefit.  Last time I was in A&amp;E and rather unwell, I was in a corridor connectd to a rather brilliantly designed machine which was caring for me entirely.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;The complaints about loans are because the government is changing the deal after the fact - that's outright robbery, even for the government.

No the deal was made up front.  It allowed for this explicitly in the paperwork.  One good life lesson that doesn't cost £8k per year right there.  Ok, that is harsh, but ultimately who should pay for the cost of education?  Those who aren't in the 50% who had it?  I'm off the view that we need to be realistic about how many people go to uni.  We have a glut of graduates in areas that aren't in demand.  We've had a network of schools and guidance types who have been useless.

However, I find it funny that you consider raising interest on borrowed money, which has been entirely spent to benefit that person, outright robbery.  Yet cutting income tax isn't?   I mean lets get the language technically correct (as it is the best kind) it is re-setting it closer to what it was before.  Is it not robbery to be told your loosing 10% of your income?  I fail to see how being taxed directly for use of services is outright robbery, yet being taxed because you earn money isn't.

Then we get corperation tax, which represents around 10% of the total taxable income to the Tresury.  Personally I'd sooner see that rate at 0%, and tax all CGT as if it was income tax.  When you consider that income tax makes up 50%+ of HMRC income, loosing that 10% for the chance of stopping people fiddling tax with dividends would probably, instantly plug that whole (not to mention we would tax people who profit from overseas interests more, making a double Irish harder).

But anyway, my point is still valid, you've gone from education being taxed fairly, to the whole ""tax these other people more, not me!"" argument.  I find that a lack of belief in the ascertion we should spend so much on education, if you aren't willing to pay yourself.",0,1371559880,null,0,false,0,cal6uw7,t3_1gklbk,t1_cal6uw7,t1_cal6q54,null,1430770422,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,smaclver,null,null,"&gt;If you think Aquilani was a suitable like-for-like replacement for Alonso I won't argue; we can agree to differ.

I never said that, he wasn't like for like, he was a replacement however. He wasn't a great replacement but I think he'd have had a much different career here if Rafa had kept his job, Hodgson didn't even consider keeping him. To be fair, I think Aquilani is a gorgeous player, no way near as good as Alonso however, and probably too artistic to play his best football here. 

I think we got screwed harder with McManaman than Alonso personally. Don't get me wrong, Xabi's my 3rd favourite player that I've ever seen, but I believe he left because his relationship with Rafa had broken down and £30m was good money for a 27 year old. Perhaps the club could/should have done more to keep him and repair their differences but alas.

Obviously I'd rather we completed all our business on 1st July and had a full preseason with the whole squad. But how realistic is that really? We're not in control of what Real Madrid do, if they bid £40m in July and we value him at £60m, do we really value a full preseason at £20m?

All we can really hope is that the club do sort out their replacements early and have them ready, or that they dig their heels in and either keep him or at the very least get an inflated fee. Having to replace Suarez late on isn't the worst thing that can happen, and hopefully we'll have learnt our lesson from the Carroll deal (ie don't pay £10m than your absolute upper limit).",0,1371560344,null,0,false,0,cal6yc6,t3_1gkr72,t1_cal6yc6,t1_cal6oxx,null,1430770376,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

You just cannot ignore those numbers. I'm not sure about on here, but Downing gets an incredible amount of shit. If he had an 'inho' at the end of his name and we had signed from the La Liga a couple of years ago, he would have been a firm favourite. 

It's going to be incredibly hard for any upgrade to come in and better those figures, especially when you consider he played left back for 5 matches.

&gt; Because this is a favoured chant of xenophobes and racists, which the protesters were accusing Farage of being. Turning the tables and all that. It was a clumsily made point, and I'm not defending it

An interesting argument. Strawmanning someone (Farage doesn't argue for people to ""go back to their own country"") and the using the strawman against them in an ironic way when we are all apart of one soveriegn nation - is moronic, not clumsy.

&gt; The Union Jack being the flag of the UK. Not England

You don't say? It represents Scotland's union with England though. I think we all know what they were referring to - don't start that sleazy shit again.

&gt; Well then I would say you're a bit clueless. I'm not a political party leader spouting off in national newspapers

Sleaze refers to dishonest or immoral behaviour. It doesn't have to involve a public official. 


Look - I may of been strong in my choice of words to you. But it annoys me when people don't allow others to have an alternative point of view without smearing them. It's intolerance - and we don't allow it when race is involved or gender - if we stop allowing people to hold a point of view and express that point of view what are we? Intolerant. Farage says nothing racist or extreme. He never calls for violence or hatred. He simply holds a point of view that many on here don't agree with.

So call Farage a racist or a bigot - call anyone who supports UKIP a looney or a closet racist - do that all you like. But understand that when you do this; you stop listening to people and instead cast innacurate assertions at them - that's when you are no longer communicating. You are merely vocalising your own prejudices.

And the protesters were a group called Radical Independence. You really don't see any reason for them protesting a symbol of the union other than 'they hate the English'?

&gt;Look - I may of been strong in my choice of words to you. But it annoys me when people don't allow others to have an alternative point of view without smearing them. It's intolerance - and we don't allow it when race is involved or gender - if we stop allowing people to hold a point of view and express that point of view what are we? Intolerant. Farage says nothing racist or extreme. He never calls for violence or hatred. He simply holds a point of view that many on here don't agree with.

And I stated that I thought Farage should have been allowed to speak. I do, however, find most of his politics abhorrent, and not just on the immigration issue.

&gt;So call Farage a racist or a bigot - call anyone who supports UKIP a looney or a closet racist - do that all you like.

Well, that's what I'm saying. If the club is in a position to say to Suarez ""Transfer request by July 1st or you're staying"", then do that, and tell every club in Europe ""If he's still here on July 15 he's not going anywhere"" and can actually act like it's in control of things, that's great.

What I don't want to see is a situation like with Macca, Owen or Alonso where it seemed like we were confident that the player was here for the next season and then ""o noes it's out of our hands, off he goes"", and I don't want to see a panicked non-replacement or inferior replacement. I expect the transfer committee to be mostly looking at defenders right now, and a last-minute ""quick quick we need to replace a 30-goal-a-year forward"" is the last thing they need.

I think the lesson from Carroll is ""only buy the kind of player you actually want to use"". My understanding is that Chelsea were effectively negotiating with Newcastle, and we sold Torres for £15m plus Carroll, which if Kenny had had a use for a target man would have been reasonable business. It was rumoured at the time that something like £30m plus Sturridge was also on the table at one point; I guess I don't ever want to find out for sure that that was true.

Anyway, I think the current transfer committee won't be buying us a target man we don't know how to use, andwe have a better chance than in previous years that any Suarez money will be spent on players that ""fit the profile"".

The paperwork made it clear that the rate wasn't fixed for term.  What is odd thou, is that the SLC isn't regulated by the FSA, I mention this because I was planning on suing them, to then find out I was completely stuffed was, well I'll be honest, no suprise at all.

This was going on for people like me, we had the rate of interest pegged at something quite illegable to me, it wasn't CPI or RPI calculted dayly monthly or annually, when I thought I'd closed it all off, another £220 came from no where, despite having a letter stating a zero balance.  Obviously all of this was covered in the contract.

The problem is simply one of scale.  None of those other countries encouraged so many people to go to uni.  It is rather elitist to have just 3-5% have a degree isn't it?  Problem is that by having 50%, it means that your really bottom drawer if you don't have one.  Before, in my parents days, my farthers lack of a degree never held him back, now adays, it would.

Which is kind of why I'm in the cut back number of uni places view.  Also be careful as to funding, unis love trying to build 200-400 people lecture teathres, very profitable business that.  We have to be honest about the massive expansion at uni level we've seen, places that aren't even second rate have doubled or trippled in size.  The uni I went to, firmly second rate at best, has doubled apparently.

As to the rail aspect, it seems to me that privatisation has had some benefits.

I won't cry too much if they lose some future profits. Back on topic, maybe in house control of the railways is't the best answer.

&gt;The problem is simply one of scale. None of those other countries encouraged so many people to go to uni.

This is absolutely false. The German constitution guarantees students the right to enter university, so if anything their problem is greater than our own. However, their universities aren't privatised, so the government still has some control, and so can limit the expense and the courses run, etc.

&gt; Before, in my parents days, my farthers lack of a degree never held him back, now adays, it would.

Indeed, it's the same with mine, although my dad couldn't easily apply to work at Google now for example. And in science you just could never do it without a degree.

I think we need to nationalise the universities, because as I much as I dislike the government, at least that means we can control the costs rather than getting ripped off with stupid courses and inflated prices.

&gt;We have to be honest about the massive expansion at uni level we've seen, places that aren't even second rate have doubled or trippled in size. The uni I went to, firmly second rate at best, has doubled apparently.

I agree, but you have to be careful, as lots of these universities do excellent research, despite not being so highly rated for teaching. Like Plymouth, Brighton, etc.

&gt;My attitude of distain comes from people wanting everything, and no awnser in how to pay for it other than well we tax them. The kind who think taxing corperations is a good idea.

Well taxing corporations isn't always a bad idea, they benefit a lot from the infrastructure that we all pay for and should contribute to that, some industries also receive bailouts and so on. 

But other nations pay for it very well, I think we are just being ripped off by the universities and the government. And that's nothing to be proud of.

&gt;The Union Jack is as much a symbol of Westminster and England as it is the British Isles.

Glad you brought up the Orange Walk hijacking the union flag because they also did that with the red hand of Ulster. Now, as you probably know the reason it's a red hand is because two giants made a bet of whoever touched x piece of land first gets to keep it, so one of them chopped his hand off and threw it. Similar to the Iona monastery myth. Hence the red, bloodied hand.

No one with ANY hint of awareness of the wider world or self-preservation is going to hop into Eire and fly that flag saying: ""It comes from the story about the giants, it has nothing really to do with the The Troubles!""

What flags were originally created for, or what they originally represented are not always what they end up representing. North of the border if it is flown by Scots it can sometimes mean unionism, it can also be a symbol to shove in the faces of any Catholics that are bigoted enough to get angered by it. As a tri-colour would anger your protestant more British than the British prats.

It does however also represent England as well. In this case it represents both unionism and Little Englanders like Farage.

I don't think he is one of the weaker players in our 11. That is why I gave him an 8. His job is to create chances, and as you can see, he has done his job exceedingly well. 

At the end of the day, the rating is my opinion. Most people have an unjustifiably negative opinion of Downing, probably because of his price tag, which is not his fault. It is also not his fault Coutinho did better, or Suarez did better. The scored do not have to be relative.

But they didn't encourage it.  When I was looking at uni, in the midst of Blairs great leap forward, it would spelled out, if you don't go to uni, your thick.  If you do something vocaional, your thick.  Oh your incredibly dislexic, spell with the age of a 12 year old, but did Further Maths.  We'd better make sure we give you the exact same advice we give everyone.  Go to uni.

Polytechnic or anything that wasn't the elite univeristy was frowned upon.  The 6th form college I attended desperately worried about its leauge table apperences, I was even pressed into *just interviewing* at Oxford despite having no interest in the course.

Germany has a long herritage of splitting people into tiers that better reflect their accumen and let them do things they will be happier doing.  We by contrast have this idea that you can't help the elite, must ensure those who aren't accademic *get the same chances* which normally translates as suffer misserably whilst being reminded how thick they are, all day, every day.

Personally, I wish my parents had stayed in Germany.

&gt;Well taxing corporations isn't always a bad idea, they benefit a lot from the infrastructure that we all pay for and should contribute to that, some industries also receive bailouts and so on. 
Ah you mean like charging some kind of 'rate' on them, we could call them commercial rates, and make them respective to the size of the impact of the harm they do to the local area.  That way a supermarket would pay more than a corner shop.  Yet both would pay irrespective of profit, because the harm they do isn't dependant on a profit.

The best way to tax business, is to tax consumers of it, VAT is a great one, it doesn't effect B2B much, is very hard to legally dodge.

If we abolish CT there is no argument for having CGT.  Why does my accountant tell me that I should wait 2 months to pay myself some bonus, because I can take it as dividends and pay less tax... Why the hell!  Can't all my income be taxed the same?  Wouldn't that be easier!  Sure it might cost me a bit, but I'd be happy if that was the way it should be.

I mean if we really wanted to raise some cash, whilst saving hundreds of millions, legalise it..... (the story about the vietnamese gangs and missing children yesterday on the beeb made me even more angry about this).

&gt;But other nations pay for it very well, I think we are just being ripped off by the universities and the government.

Absolutely, some of the universities are just shameful.  I don't think they were better under some halcyon glory days of state ownership, which was mostly a nepotistical love in, huge areas of research ignored etc.  But we really should control what we as tax payers are willing to fund, and in what volume.  Quite frankly how many Surf Science graduates do we need?  It might be a very interesting course, but I don't think we need many people doing it.  As it stands, such things are not controlled.  If a uni thinks up a sexy and profitable course, they are advantaged to sell it over a more complex, yet demanded by industry one.

However, until we do away with the snobbery about those without degrees, or worse yet those who had internships, we aren't going to fix anything.  Tories can't do this, because they would be being a bunch of elitiest cunts busy trying to create a ring around Oxbridgeshire, Labour can't do it because they would admit that their last social mobility experiment was childish wishful bullshit.",0,1371566665,null,0,false,0,cal8oj7,t3_1gklbk,t1_cal8oj7,t1_cal7vpz,null,1430769562,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;You two seem to have this misconception that every home owner is some sort of house market gambler after a quick buck. We're not, and most us cannot soak up a £20k loss over a few years as you seem to think. Its totally unrealistic. People need to be able to get out of mortgage easily (not as you seem to think with a chunk of dollar in your back pocket) but simply because people don't want to live in the same house and in the same area for as long as it takes to pay off your mortgage. I.e 25-30 years. Peoples lives and circumstances change much more regularly than that.

You can soak up the loss if you don't move, that you don't want to move is irrelevant. Just like if I want to own but can only afford to rent my wants are irrelevant I either rent or live on the street.  You are placing your ability to buy *another* house over that of someone to buy their *first*. 

Why is your ability to move to something of comparable value to what you paid for your mortgage more important than someone else ability to buy rather than be force to rent which is effectively throwing money away? You have to remember you have an asset, it might not be worth as much as you like but it *is* an asset and when is all said and done if I pay the same money in rent over the years as you do in mortgage you are clearly, vastly, better off that I would be. 

As you pay off more on your mortgage you own more, as I pay rent I effectively own less. Many people are losing valuable time of paying off a mortgage because the prices making it incredibly hard to get on the ladder so they rent for longer. And you want us to feel sorry for you because you might end up *owning* something worth less than you agreed to pay for it?

Seize all the land that the landbankers are holding onto for investors.

Then build houses on it and Long Term Let these properties.

After 20-25 years when the 'mortgage' (the cost of building the property) is paid off the income from these becomes pure profit for local authorities.

To off set this, maybe for every X amount of years you are in the 'Rental' and a 'Good Tennant' you get a little something into a housing pot, allowing you to use this as a deposit to purchase your own property in the future.

This way the Authority gets an income from the rental being paid, th Tennant gets a little something saved to become a home owner and everyone wins...

Not sure of the legality because of the EU, but if the UK market is artificially inflated due to foreign investment (which it is btw), Uk workers will find it harder and harder to compete against the more wealthy from other countries even if those countries are significantly poorer, those that invest in foreign uk property are outliers in their own country but there is enough of them to inflate the UK market,

Government needs to reduce or put penalty on foreign investment if it can.

as for people complaining with mortgages etc, if something isn't done soon workers will start needing more money and increased wages to be able to live in the community they serve (teachers nurses police etc) and that has the same  economic effect.

As long as you can continue paying the mortgage and don't need to move anytime soon, 'negative equity' remains just a bad, but abstract, phrase. 

Admittedly, it's not ideal - she is, in effect, *tied* to the house - however it remains a good long term investment, even if she can never move.

The motivation SHOULD be to learn, but usually isn't because many kids don't think like that. The ones that do have a particular kind of parent and it's unfair to just say the only kids who'll be motivated have this kind of parent, that's just giving up on a lot of kids.They want to play video games or in this case look at porn, so the inspiration to learn has to be translated into their language for it to be effective.

* Increase in population
* Increase in desirability of UK property as investment vehicle worldwide

Supply diminishing factors:

* Legislative restrictions (greenbelt, etc.)
* Capital requirement restrictions (incredibly, incredibly difficult to build houses if you don't have easy access to a lot of money)

&gt; Rangers are seemingly now restricted to taking a vastly reduced offer from a chancer or – yet again – loaning out a senior player with a view to a permanent move further down the tracks. Remy meanwhile is limited to said loan spell, starting World Cup year in the Championship, or hoping that the charges come to nothing in time for him to catch the tail end of the extended transfer windows in the refuse skips of European football – Russia and Turkey.

As attractive as the idea of Rémy starting the season at QPR is (assuming he's innocent), he is on a substantial weekly wage that I think the club realistically needs shot of for financial reasons. They probably need the transfer fee on the balance sheet as well. That said, I imagine they will be left with one or two high earners come September; if he was one of them (again, assuming he's innocent) I wouldn't complain. We'd still need to address the issues up front when he left in January though. Having an ace up your sleeve for only half a season won't be enough.

Maybe we could work out some kind of loan deal as specified above that includes a future purchase and bundles in a year long inbound loan of a decent young striker.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I like the daily show myself and watch it fairly regularly. The main reason I like it is not because it's particularly funny but because it normally does a good job of pointing out how ridiculous some of politics is which is pretty cathartic. I get annoyed hearing of stupid things done by even stupider people and to hear people laugh like crazy of over how stupid those people clearly are...it's like a cold beer on a hot day, I just relax and feel better knowing the world isn't all bad. I think we can all see that most of US politics is silly and it seems obvious but there not really anyone else doing that in the US and I get the feeling that by showing how stupid it is he has a real effect of politics. Thinking back to times like when the bill for medical assistance for 9/11 first responders was on the cutting room floor after the Republicans stopped it, you can see that the moment Stewart mentioned it the Republicans denied they were hurting 9/11 firefighters etc and were forced to support the bill and it got passed. 

When he gets serious he is at his best ([see this interview from 2004/2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE)) I think he would do best as a more sober political commentator as the actual humour is not exactly sophisticated but then again it's not like he claims to be that serious. His show, like Cobert's, is a comedy faux-news program/talk show. It doesn't have the adversarial quality of HIGNFY or an audience as OK with being offensive (we are surprisingly good at that, Stewart is bleeped up until 11PM I think, and can you imagine him doing a Jimmy Carr set?). The reason they are given so much hype is because no-one really criticises US politicians. The mainstream news places are either completely benign and stuck in the cult of special effects like CNN that they have become a station that broadcasts people sitting in studios chatting about nothing or they are so partisan they are written off as crazy (Fox News and MSNBC). Stewart is one of the only consistently sensible people in news and he's not in news, he's a comedian. That's why he is estimated highly and why I watch him, not because he's particularly funny. We have our own TV for that. 

EDIT: I should probably make it clear that I don't like Colbert much either, I only watch Stewart. But that's mainly just down to his style. I feel like the points he is trying to make could be better made seriously. He only ever seems to point out that the view he is parodying is crazy but not what should be done which is always going to be the case with that style. But then, once again, it is comedy and I feel awkward holding him to the same standard as a hard hitting current affairs program.

People need to be taught how to cook properly again and how to cook meals that satisfy not just the need for calories, but also the often overlooked aspect of hunger... taste.

A meal with complex flavours can satisfy hunger with far fewer calories than a bland meal can, and that is often the problem with ready meals etc.

But all this is for naught if people are simply happy being overweight, or at least resigned to the end result.

You obviously never lived through the 1980's. 10% or more interest rates would see hundreds of thousands if not over a million people made homeless and their houses repossessed.

&gt; This will also make it much harder to sell houses at these inflated prices which will cause prices to drop. People will then be able to afford houses with a minimal mortgage.

ROFLMAO what a fucking clown you are. In the 80's mortgage interest rates were in double figures. Sure the houses were cheap but not many people could afford the mortgage payments. In my case it meant the first house I was looking at buying in the mid 80's for £30k had mortgage interest payments 2/3 of my take home pay.

A £100,000 mortgage, the typical amount a family with one income earner on an average salary could qualify for, at 12% interest rates would more than double to £1062 a month leaving them less than £650 a month to live on.

With Iraq and Afghanistan winding down (from a deployed military perspective) Obama is likely to get a peace dividend that he can chuck at the US economy to spring it back into life, he'll be remembered as the president that brought the troops home, no longer will people see coffins draped in the Stars and Stripes and people will be placated.

The last thing any sane US president would want is to intervene militarily in Syria. Sure they've been an enemy of Israel for the last 60 odd years, but Israel knows where they stand with the Baathists in charge (they're still technically at war, which plays well domestically with Syrians by taking their eyes off the Syrian regime, but at the same time The Assad cabal knows that any military action on their part will likely end up with their arses being handed to them) even if you take the opinion that Iraq was ""all about stealing oil"" Syria just doesn't have the same amount of resources as their eastern neighbour, there are a few minor gas fields but that's about it. The only strategic use that Syria has is that it would provide a very handy route to the European markets for Arab oil, bypassing the need to traverse the Arabian Gulf with huge tankers.

The US knows that by intervening they are increasing the likelihood of a theocratic Islamic regime, however at the same time people have long memories and accusations of ignoring the problem (such as what happened in Rwanda and, to a lesser extent, Bosnia) would not play out well domestically (either here or abroad)

I get the feeling that Cameron, on the other hand, sincerely believes in intervention being the cure-all for the Assad regime, which is misguided, and that by intervening in Syria and bringing about the fall of one of the last properly fascistic regimes (as in  Baathist ideology being derived from Italian fascism) he will get a boost in the popular vote come 2015.",0,1371575741,null,0,false,0,calbtdg,t3_1gi3jg,t1_calbtdg,t1_cakru7n,null,1430768014,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Once machines drive us everywhere there will be no more issues around drink driving, and it will be possible to work, read or relax in the car - your own personal train. Who cares if you're stuck in traffic for an hour if you can just watch a tv series?

Furthermore, there may actually be less traffic with machine driven cars, they will be able to plan routes better, drive with higher traffic densities. There will be no rubbernecking to look at accidents (if they even still occur regularly when all cars are machine driven), and we probably won't even need traffic lights any more, as automatically driven cars will be able to plan interleaving gaps in the traffic before the cars reach the junction so they don't need to slow down very much.

We haven't really seen Sturridge or Coutinho in a team without Suarez (Even when he was banned he was still training) so it's hard to judge how they'll do with out his influence. But let's assume for next season the get 15 and 5 respectively. With a hopeful 10 for Mkhitaryan there's your 30 goals. But our two january signings scored 13 for us last season so they also need to replicate that. So the real total to reach is 43 goals. 

This is where Aspas and Borini come in. Do they have that many goals in them, probably yes. But all it takes is an injury or two and you attacking options dwindle. I can see what you mean by us needing another striker but it shouldn't be someone who's looking to play every single game and score 25+ goals because there simply isn't enough room in the team to keep everyone happy, especially if there are no long term injurys as this restricts one unfortunate soul to sporadic starts and substitute appearances. Good examples of this are the Man Utd debacle, RVP put Rooney out of position and there's talk of him leaving. Even sometimes in the season just passed with Sturridge and Suarez, it took Suarez's ban to get Sturrdge consistent games.

A Soldado or Benteke is out of the question but someone like Borini; young, hard working and ready to wait for his opportunity is ideal.

That's what I ate for my tea this evening. I use the gym three times a week, and where possible walk as much as I can. It's a one off [ok perhaps I'll have it again in a few months] bit of self-indulgence, that's ridiculously unhealthy, tasted nice, and which I'll regret in the morning.

If you eat that kinda crap regularly? It doesn't matter how physically active you are, you're going to experience the detrimental side-effects of it.

As others have explained, far more succinctly than I can - it's a combination of self-motivation and education. The above plate and glass of crap ['cause lets be honest, it is] cost me **£3.59**. 

For an initial outlay of a few pennies more [actually less, if you're prepared to buy value range chickens] you can cook a chicken, with all the trimmings. That will feed you for longer than one evening meal.

The problem, is that an alarming number of people don't know how to cook. During the winter I live on carrot and potato soup. It costs less than *thirty pence* per litre to make, and pretty much cooks itself.

Cardio is a great way to lose weight - when I bought my first exercise bike years ago I wore X**L** shirts - I now wear slim-fit X**S** ones, but giving a person equipment, or access to it, won't make them become healthy.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"Ostensibly, this is already happening. Consider it is not just about replacing jobs, but also reducing the need for further employees with growing businesses. I am currently involved in a project for a security company that will, essentially, allow the company to grow without requiring a bunch of 24-hour control room staff which, ordinarily, would be required. Then, we're going to sell it to other security firms, including the big ones.

Rather than consider the more visible jobs - such as GPs being replaced with IBM's Medical version of Watson or Taxi drivers replaced by autonomous car-sharing, consider instead the more mundane automation that is already happening and destroying things like middle-management (who can be replaced by metrics, reporting, or - in the case of Amazon - wearable computers for warehouse workers). It is not just that computers will take over jobs, it is more that our systems are reconfiguring themselves to communicate with each other through purely technological means, resulting in no need for the majority of human workers because their jobs are *no longer necessary.* 

Why have managers when you can plug the workers they would have managed straight into a metrics system? Why use an accountant when your entire payment system and all your debts and credits are electronic anyway and your systems can just produce accounts from those? Do we go to the bank any more, or do companies just send payments via BACS / EFT? 

As I said before, our systems - corporate and educational are based on Industrial Age principles, where we had to create machines out of people to manage an empire. As components of larger systems that require hierarchy, delineation, separation of responsibilities, people are not really all that efficient. Computers are.

The traditional thought is that, for every automated job, this creates enough unemployed to create new industries to provide services to those that have been further enriched by the automation (efficiencies thereof). This may well be true, but not if access to capital or funding is as difficult as it currently is for start-ups (particularly in the UK). This also assumes that the benefits of greater efficiency are bestowed upon those who wish to spend their money in the country where they just made the majority of their workforce unemployed.

true,ravniel,num11,,"I don't think that's necessarily the case.  

First, I think people forget how much Levy has spent in the past, sometimes with a lot less reason than this (let's recall that by some estimates our record transfer is still David Bentley).  He's been attempting frugality for the last few years but that doesn't mean a summer spree is beyond us by definition.

Second, we've got a lot of money coming in.  As has been reported ad nauseam, the latest Premier League TV deal is a monster.  I don't think people have paid that much mind because it doesn't seem like an advantage (every PL club benefits equally), but whether or not it increases our *relative* spending power it definitely increases our *raw* spending power.  That's before player sales come into it.  We could definitely sell Huddlestone and Parker, and there's reported interest in Adebayor abroad; there are probably more we could move if we decided we wanted to.  And if players of this quality were incoming we would probably want to.  Plus, a lot of dead weight has already left our wage bill (some of it after years of gumming up the works).  Our squad size is the sanest it's been in years.

Third, this is a crucial fucking summer for Spurs and I think Levy must realize that.  Let's leave aside the obvious fact that this striker problem has single-handledly kept us out of the Champions League for three years now (the last two of which were eminently doable), and it's time to fucking put it to bed.  Besides that, the vultures are circling around both Bale and AVB and we need to put on a show.  If we're not prepared to get serious about Champions League qualification they're both wasting their time, that's the honest truth.  And getting serious about Champions League qualification means making some serious signings in key positions, giving us the quality to make sure we don't miss out by one fucking goal for the third consecutive fucking season.

I know this subreddit has elevated Levy's recent frugality to something approaching an identity, so this isn't likely to be well received.  But I genuinely believe *two* - yes, two - strikers plus a box-to-box midfielder like Paulinho is the *minimum* we can afford to buy unless we've decided we're comfortable in the Europa League.",0,1371581830,null,0,false,0,cale6jh,t3_1gktzh,t1_cale6jh,t1_cal8nl9,null,1430766898,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

He's a recycler with the ball, probably the most efficient recycler in the Premier League. It's not his job to look for killer passes, it's his job to be open to receive the ball, and maintain possession until he can lay it off to someone else. 

It's a job he's actually brilliant at most of the time.

He is constantly getting the ball and then using his really strong upper body to shield challenges until he can find someone else that is open. It's a vital role in a possession based offence.

His ability in defence is second to no other midfielder on the squad. Constantly plugging holes left by our tactic of sending the CBs marauding. Also picks when to give away yellow cards pretty well too. He's a really good, disciplined CDM. 

I think his form in the second part of the season has left a lot to be desired, it seems like ACON made him lose his sharpness, but form dips from time to time. I'm sure he'll be back to his good  reliable self after a decent pre-season.

4. Lay it on a flat surface (I chose the palm of my hands a few times) and light a flame near the hole.

From the away end looking out onto the pitch, which is behind the goal, to the left is the previously-described Grandstand, to the right the new Flybe stand, which is rather chilly to sit in and personally a bit characterless. Directly across the pitch from the away end is the Big Bank, which is covered all-standing which has a great atmosphere and will be where most of the home noise will be coming from during the match. Wikipedia says the capacity of St. James Park is 8541, which seems about right. If you have any more questions about the ground, public transport links, etc. don't be afraid to ask. I might not have made it sound that appealing but as you may or may not know, Exeter City FC is one of the few clubs left that is 100% fan-owned and has the smallest budget in the whole of the football league - a far cry from Tony and Co.!

* Moving train, I was in Turkey Easter of GCSE so when I was 15, overnight train from Istanbul, sharing a compartment with three mates. We were delayed during the night so in order to save time the driver decided he wasn't going to stop at our station as the were only a dozen or so people who wanted off there. We managed to convince them to slow the train to a walking pace, they wouldn't stop, so it came to the flat land outside the station and we threw out our bags and jumped out after.

* Russian mafia, when I was 17 I stayed with a Russian family, as did five others, as we were doing it at A level. Now, in Russia there's an 11pm curfew for under 18s, which most people ignore. However, my friend's family, lets call her A and the family's daughter P, were very strict about this. One night we were out at a pub and planning to stay later, but P disagreed with this and said she and A had to leave, though A didn't want to. We said we would make sure A would get home safe or she could stay at one of ours (the families offered) but P refused. P then phoned her dad who worked in middle management (this is important) and complained that we weren't doing what she asked. A little while later the second nicest car I saw when I was there (nicest belonged to a factory owner) turned up outside the bar and a man got out the back. He was middle aged, average height, balding, a little paunchy. He came to ask why we weren't listening to his daughter, at which point the driver got out the car. He was a good few inches taller than me (I'm 6'3"") and stacked. The father started arguing with the Russians amongst us and it reached the point where he said either A went back with him and P or they wouldn't finish school (because they'd die first). A then said she would go back with them, the next day she moved to stay with another family and we never heard from him again.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I used to regularly watch The Colbert Report when it was on British TV. Ever heard of FX? Neither had I; it necessitated a hunt through my Sky TV guide when I was about 17.

We need to remember that Stephen Colbert is a character. He is a parody of big-time ultra-conservative American news anchors (think Bill O'Reily, Glen Beck). In the UK, we tend not to have these kinds of shows. Yes, we have tonnes of conservative voices (Sky News, BBC occasionally, Daily Mail), but nothing like they do in the US. 

I think this is a barrier to anybody outside the US understanding Colbert. We simply don't have an appreciation for what is being parodied, so it looks like a white guy in a suit reeling off jokes. Understood as a parody, it gives *some* of the comedy more depth.

Comparisons to HIGNFY are not fair. HIGNFY comedy tends to be derived from the news itself (or Paul Merton saying something silly, which I love btw). Colbert Report satirises the way in which it is delivered. If we did the latter in the UK, it'd be rather dull. It only works in a US context. Regular segments in the Colbert Report point out hypocrisies in the media, both liberal and conservative.

Occasionally, silliness aside, Colbert (and Stewart) can make a real journalistic point. A serious point that is missed by the media for whatever reason (e.g. political). I can't actually think of one (because it's been so long since I've seen it), but I do remember real news issues being discussed, under a layer of satire, of course. 

Ignoring jokes about alien stockbrokers and ""truthoscopies"", Colbert can make a real and important point.

Awarding of grants is decided on ""benefit to society"" by people who have little to no expertise.

The situation is especially bad for post-docs, as universities are trying to claw back some of the money lost in the government cuts by charging industry an 80% surplus to fund a post-doc. Industry, unsurprisingly, has started collaborating with universities on the continent instead.

Then there are the brilliant researchers from India and China who take their talents to the US or Europe because the UK has already reached its immigration cap for the year.

None of the rest of his family had anything approaching Titian hair or a sense of humour, and they used primroses as a table decoration.
It follows that they never understood Reginald, who came down late to breakfast, and nibbled toast, and said disrespectful things about the universe. The family ate porridge, and believed in everything, even the weather forecast

I think part of it may also be her hair, as when her hair is looser curls and lighter, it makes her face look a lot lighter but when it's darker and tighter curls, it makes her face look darker. Part of it is also that she's very ash-toned, with no pinkness (which usually stands out on paler white skin).

There is never any discussion of the real pros/cons with Salmond -- Indepenence is just one giant pro with no drawbacks what-so-ever, and that's clearly not going to be the case in such a complex situation as this.

I don't know if Scotland should be independent or not, but I do know that behind the charming smarmy grin, Salmond is a real force for evil in this world. His blind obsession with indepedence and his willingness to do or say anything to achieve it is frightening... I think it's the knowledge that even if Salmond knew a post-indepence Scotland would see a fall in living standards, influence etc. he would still push for it, because he is so ideologically married to the idea.

One of the things that scares me the most, is what happens if he loses the referrendum as polls suggest he will... is he going to stand up and accept the result or is he going to denounce it as being rigged or unfair.

**Carra**, *Skrtel*, *Coates*, *Reina*, *Suarez*, **Carroll**

Lets assume £20m for Skrtel and Coates, £10m for Reina, £45m for Suarez, and of course, £15m for Carroll. Total potential income: **£90m** (give or take a couple of million)

**Ins** (**Confirmed**/*Rumoured*)

**Toure**, **Aspas**, *Atsu*, *Alberto*, *Mkhitaryan*, *Ilori*, *Mignolet*

Let's assume £7.7m for Aspas, £3m for Atsu, £6m for Alberto, £22m for Mkhitaryan, £7m for Ilori, £9m for Mignolet. Total potential expenditure: **£54.7m** (Give or take a couple of million)

**Total profit: £35.3m**

If this all happens, we'd lose 3 CBs and pick up 2, so yes, a decrease *for now*. This may of course change over the remaining two-and-a-half months of the window as we look at other options. We could definitely pick up another defender or two in this time. Papadopoulos rumours have cooled off a bit right now, but we could still pick up him or Alderweireld, or even someone else who hasn't even been mentioned.

We'd lose a goalie and replace him with another. We'd still be short of quality back-up keepers though, but we have Jones I guess.

We'd lose 2 forwards, 1 of whom wasn't in our squad last season anyway. So essentially we're losing 1 forward. In his place, we'd be picking up Aspas, as well as possibly Alberto, Mkhitaryan and Atsu as further attacking options. Net increase of +3 players in attack.

No real changes in midfield right now, although I may be completely forgetting someone.

Our focus, after signing these players, should be to use the profit from any Suarez sale to bring in a quality starting CB, our 3rd addition in this area to make up for the 3 departures.

If all of this happened, we'd have a pretty solid squad imo. 3 strikers potentially vying for the ST role in a 4-2-3-1 system, competition for the wide spots in our forward line of 3, several options for the AM spot in that line of 3, two strong CMs (Gerrard and Lucas) backed up by other strong options (Allen, Hendo), and several new defensive players.

Of course, this is all conjecture and speculation. It all might happen or barely any of it might happen. But I don't think we'll be decreasing our squad size; that would be exactly opposite of our goals for this window. We seem to be getting the bulk of our business done early, but I definitely don't think this will be it. After this week, we still have over 2 months left to make further changes. In this time, Shelvey may go, Assaidi may go and we'll hopefully replace them, or use the proceeds to address other areas (such as competition for LB, perhaps).  We'll see.

If there are some minuscule few like that, the majority of people and the company owning the public transport would want to correct the wrong and put them in their place collectively, saving money in the long run.

&gt; ... and depend on anybody else other than myself. What's wrong with that?

Unless you build the car yourself and extracted all of the fuel yourself, **you are going to have to depend on someone. Why not make it cost effective?**  

Instead of spending money on your own car which you must fully maintain yourself + insurance and tests, save and spend less money on public transport where collectively, if more people thought like you for ""privacy, convenience and comfort"" **loudly for public transport**, the quality would vastly improve because you would be voting with your hard-earned cash. (If you are doing these things, keep going and don't give up!)

**If everyone wanted their own private cars, there would not be enough space for all of the cars on the roads.**  
The only options then would be:

* **Make the cars smaller** (which would probably reduce their size to a (lobbied) improved bus seat size anyway). 
* **Make them function as a ""car-pooling"" system.**  
If that is the case, it wouldn't be any different from a bus service in the long run except everyone is paying huge amounts of money for the tests, purchase, insurance and maintenance of said driverless vehicle.

They have travelled many thousands of miles, and, as yet, have been at fault in no accidents, though human drivers were at fault in two minor ones. They are being tested on the roads in a handful of countries, and many manufacturers are already including computers capable of controlling an increasing number of functions in an increasing number of situations into higher end commercial models.

Cold fusion power is not nearly so close to commercial.

____________________________________________________________

I'm still on the fence about Suarez. Massive talent, bags of goals, but he's missing half a dozen matches at the start of the season anyway and I'm losing (well, lost) my trust in him to not do something stupid again.

£40m? No way. £45m? Okay, let's talk. £50m? Deal done I think. That's some serious money that gives us so many more options in the market. We could buy that much needed starting CB with that. Or we could divvie it up and buy cover for other positions, or a combination of the two. To be honest though, I'm not convinced there even is enough serious interest in him right now. AFAIK, Real Madrid haven't mentioned him for a while and I haven't heard anyone else, other than Bayern, even being linked with him (and that was a while ago).
____________________________________________________________

Anyway, I'm actually a lot more concerned about what we do defensively this summer than whether Suarez stays or goes, tbh. If Suarez stays, fantastic. If he goes, we'll make do with the millions we get for him.  Defensively, however, we still need another couple of additions, regardless of what happens to Suarez. The Suarez money will help obviously, because if we don't sell him then we'll be dipping into our original transfer kitty anyway. If he does go, we'll still probably finish the summer with a net profit, no matter what.

&gt;I have just seen ""three tons"" of evidence that tells me it's all true. Saying no more. Apart from I now believe it again.

true,Dancing_Koala,null,null,"&gt; Why would it need to be much different? The only difference I could imagine would be if the manufacturers were forced to cover the cost rather than the drivers but I can't really see it.

Don't you see that as a huge risk to the manufacturer? The pay out would be huge don't you think?

&gt; Can't even manage one for cyclists so probably not.

Then, can you see the potential problem in a world of a ""mixed human-driven + driverless"" world?  
To use my emergency services example, you would have to have the automated cars move out of the way plenty of time before any human cars would notice the emergency service vehicle. Passengers of the automated cars may be annoyed that they could have reached a destination faster if they had just driven a human-control car themselves. 

Even in this example, I am discounting:

* the reaction time to position for the automated cars to assess the ever changing position of human cars unaware of the emergency vehicle (which are not traceable), 
* the recalculation of building a new path network for the automated cars to recover again on their regular route to their bespoke destination.

&gt; All sorts of stuff to do with liability I'm sure.

Does liability include ""accountability"" in your answer?

&gt; Automated vehicles could get warning well in advance of approaching emergency services and arrange with other vehicles to be well out of the way in plenty of time. ES vehicles themselves probably would not be automated for quite a while after as speed is a much higher priority than comfort there.

* **Who owns the ES vehicles?**
* If the hospital does, who is held responsible if an accident occurs?
* If the hospital does, **are all other driverless cars owned by one personal owner** (like you for example)?
* If you are the owner of the driverless car, don't you think that (insurance-wse) you would be liable for any accidents done with your vehicle and not the manufacturer of your vehicle?
* If the hospital does not own the ES vehicles, how much do you think it would cost the hospital to own a fleet from a said seller / manufacturer?  
Do you think it would be business-viable to be at the mercy of price hikes for owning such ES fleet?",0,1371603238,null,0,1371603430,0,callv1n,t3_1gl3d7,t1_callv1n,t1_calih0v,null,1430763209,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mr_Smartypants,null,null,"&gt; How do you insure against such ""less frequent"" accidents?  


Fundamentally, similarly to how we do it now, but we'd have to pay less...


&gt; Where in your opinion would the majority of faults lie (in terms of responsibility)?




Regarding ""fault"", I imagine this would depend highly on the particulars of whichever system manages the traffic.  The only way accidents could happen would be things simply breaking within this infrastructure.  No one has fault when things just break (unless some negligence is invovled--then it becomes a civil mater to recover injuries).

&gt; Where do public services lie?

Not sure what you mean by this question.   Physically, they could be the same places they are right now...

&gt; A person has had a heart attack and calls 999. How would the person reach the hospital? Could you explain in detail your views of events happening in terms with dealing with this crisis?

It would probably make more sense for a hospital emergency vehicle / ambulance be dispatched with paramedics to the location of the injured person so treatment could begin sooner (i.e. the same model we currently use, but with automated driving).

This is where response times of ambulances could dramatically improve.  For example, if a centralized traffic management system is being used, a route could be cleared and the ambulance would never have to wait for some moron to get out of the way at an intersection.  It wouldn't even have to interrupt regular traffic too much; all that's needed is to maintain a clear path within some radius of the vehicle.

See [my local manifesto](http://edinburgh.pirateparty.org.uk/manifesto/) and the [Pirate Party UK manifesto](www.pirateparty.org.uk/media/uploads/Manifesto2012.pdf)

&gt;2. What will you actually do if you get into office?

I will push for as much of my manifesto as possible to be enacted by the Council.

&gt;3. Why should you personally get voted in?

If I was a councillor, Edinburgh people would have better and more affordable housing, and better transport. This would make their lives better.

&gt;4. What are the weaknesses of your party and political position?

We care about having policies that actually work, instread of just looking good and chasing votes like the Liblabservatives.

&gt;5. What are your best case and worst case scenarios if elected?

Best case -- Edinburgh, Scotland, the UK, Europe and the World all elect lots of Pirates, ushering in a new era of peace, prosperity, unrestricted file sharing, and rainbows.

Maybe it's whiplash from the idealist Doctor but she cheats on her husband, doesn't tell him, gets annoying in general, and I'm not a fan of her acting. Also good to know, the show as a whole is **a lot** darker than Dr. Who. Not just in content (cus, I know, it's supposed to be ""Dr. Who for adults""), but in mood and tone. The endings to each story might have a silver lining, but hardly ever end on a positive note. And finally, the last bit issue I have is that Jack is just not the same person as he is in Torchwood. Idk if the doctor has a good effect on him, but he is **much** harder to like than his Dr. Who persona. Ok, maybe I dislike the show a bit more than I thought....

And I also struggled with Matt when he started. Tennant was/still is my favorite, I think because his emotional performance and personality made me see him as more human, thus I could relate to him more. None the less, he grew on me a lot. I had mixed feelings about the Ponds when they were around, and I still kinda do with Clara. I mean, I like *her*. She is witty without making it feel like she is trying too hard, like I felt occasionally with Amy (Plus I have a crush on Jenna-Louise Coleman). The problem I have with her is clearly a Moffat issue. Mainly that he has made her into a 'Mary-Sue' who saves the day inexplicably at the blink of an eye, and her story lines are way to rushed.

It would be a little over complicated, heart wrenching, and difficult to continue the show the way it is. But knowing the way Moffat writes, I can see tons of arrows pointing toward something like this. I think I'm going to call that it is going to go something like: 

""The doctor, as Hurt, realizes (in a yet to be revealed plot point) that the Time War is the only way for existence to go along the path that it is. If the Time War occurring is a fixed point, AND the 8th doctor saw Hurt's doctor do something to start the war, then he *HAS TO* go back and start the war. If he didn't then 1) whatever horrible result he finds out about, will occur. And 2) there will be an event like when River made two fixed points, and things went crazy. Hurt said he did what he did ""... in the name of **peace** and **sanity**"". Going back to start the war would kill many, but it would ultimately end in **peace**, and prevent things from becoming **insane** again. From 8's point of view, he doesn't know or care why Hurt would do something like this so he disowns him as a 'Doctor', and ends up running from both his past and inevitable future 'ending', trying to be as pure and good as he can.""
