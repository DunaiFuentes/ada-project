'Tracey, 22, thinks EU membership is a terrible threat to UK business and immigration is a net loss to British employment figures'
Does she really, now?

Before anyone jumps on the obvious, I don't think the models are thick or incapable of a political view, I'm saying the Sun makes all that shit up, because they're not going to print views that they don't agree with, whilst not turning down a great pair of tits just because they're leftie tits.

true,dsruix,tennant,Tennant,"Geez, someone really is a bundle of fun isn't he. I don't have an answer for 23. I'm looking out for one. I'm speculating about the origins of 23. I hit a roadblock with the father thing, but it doesn't mean that I can't stop thinking about why 23 seems to be important. I don't need an answer until an answer appears. Perhaps it really is Clara's a really nice girl. The point of speculating is to figure out an answer to a question. As for being born on the 23rd of November and being 23, those 2 events were highlighted to us by your spoon feeding Moffat. If there's one thing about Moffat and many other suspense authors and directors, it is that nothing is ever highlighted for no reason. Whether it's a red herring, or chekov's gun, or some silly far-reaching pop reference.

It seems you're the arrogant one. I don't put myself above others, I'm asking that you don't. I'm asking that you don't put your ability to watch and accept the answers you are fed as the end all above those who don't. Regarding 124, did it not strike you as interesting that the typo came at the end of a very important phrase? Moffat spoonfeeds us in the way rtd didn't because rtd was far more subtle about things. nonetheless, the lingering camera on the various numbers is reminiscent of the lingering camera on the crack in season 5. Admittingly, the importance of 23 probably doesn't compare to the crack. But it seems to be about the same importance as Clara always wearing red. In any case, I've given you plenty of reasons why 23 seems to me to be important and I understand that you don't believe so and we can agree to disagree. 

Now, your behavior and your penchant for unwarranted insults is terrible. Essentially, you are telling me that I cannot speculate about 23 because I am stupid, arrogant and 23 has been answered in this and this way and I don't have an answer. Basically, you're saying I can't have an opinion that differs from you in how I look at the series because you think I'm stupid and arrogant, which are based in the fact that I won't change my opinion to the opinion you have on the show. Do you see why your train of thought is dangerous? You should also realize that I have been nothing but civil to you in my discussion with you. Mildly sarcastic, perhaps, but have you seen how you are addressing me? 

Btw, I'll have you know that while 1+1=2 seems to be the basic block of mathematics, there is a whole proof behind the formula. iirc, there's even a proof where 3 is the answer. In other news, people have been speculating about mass and the origins of mass for a long time. They finally got their answer in the confirmed higgs boson. Yet, even this answer is as yet incomplete. There is also speculation that in pockets of deep space , the laws of physics don't function in the same way as in our universe. People are always questioning the already answered. Hell, it's the reason why literature and science and history etc exist as subjects of study. It's why historians and literature scholars can disagree about the same historical event or the same novel or film. world war 2 was primarily a result of: a) Hitler b)world war 1 and the treaty of Versailles c) appeasement. All of these contributed, but there are so many opinions on how much weight is attributed to each reason. Godwin's law fulfilled. Where will we be if we didn't allow people to speculate about the non-dietyship of the sun? Or that the world is flat? Or that the earth is not in the center of the universe?

It seems like an impossible quest, because of so many thousands of years of this kind of objectification (women are still treated as property in many, if not most, cultures - think of things like dowries).

Is it people's perception of the job that makes people think they can be rude to you? People are rude to me at work, but I just assume it is because they are scared or in pain. Maybe it is just because there are people out there that are rude arseholes?!

But even so, why would someone be rude to someone who is about to give them tasty treats?!

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"One of the main differences is that when questioned by the police, although you have the right to remain silent it's not an absolute right. As the caution explains: ""you do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.""

In plain English that means if a case comes to trial and you bring up something in your defence which you didn't immediately tell the police about, the court is allowed to consider it of lesser importance.

In terms of stop and search -- in general you should always co-operate with the police if they ask to search you. The police will have to give you a reason why they're searching you and you're allowed to ask them questions while the search is underway. In most cases you don't *have* to tell them your name and address but as others have mentioned failure to act completely in accordance with their wishes is likely to make them view you with even greater suspicion.

If you're considering getting involved in anything ""political"" then Green And Black Cross has an excellent [guide to your rights on protests](http://greenandblackcross.org/legal/resources/stopandsearch) which contains a lot of information about stop and search in the UK.

Most important of all -- don't get convicted of any kind of serious offence as your visa will almost certainly get rescinded, meaning you'll be deported after paying any fines / serving any prison sentence!

true,Jethadys,null,null,"It seems like you're missing the point oncocerca is making. Oncocerca showed that there are cons to being either gender. So it's fine to say that *some* advertising objectifies women, but to then say ""so women have it worse than men"" is fallacious, you haven't proven that. You've shown one area where women and men aren't treated equally (favoring men) and a counterargument showing the other way round came up. The statistics about divorce &amp; children highlight instances that are *extremely* unfavorable to be a man for.  

Good News: Advertising changes with every decade, and the ads of the 1950's are almost absurd to look at through today's lens. That bodes well for the future for women in advertising, and while change could (and should in this area) always be faster, I think there is a good trend in advertising for reducing the objectification of women. Recent ads/videos that try to pander with female objectification have been hit with some pretty harsh backlash by online communities as of late. 

I will say that as a guy I have to treat kids like little bombs, and ignore/avoid them completely. If a kid needs help, they better go find a woman, because the last two times I've tried to help a kid I got glares, was pushed, and had a cop threaten to arrest me. That's what being a guy is like, I have to actively avoid ~10-15% of the population of Earth for fear of hysteria.

EMMA ALBERICI: Finally, Minister, I wanted to hear your observations on the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. Do you agree with John Howard's views expressed today that she was the greatest British leader since Winston Churchill?

BOB CARR: I think she's certainly - the word 'great' has got some challenges, but I think she was certainly the most significant one in that she produced a realignment of politics. She forced my side of politics, the social democrat parties to think more deeply about the role and function of the State, of the public sector. And forced Labor parties around the world to consider whether government could remotely pretend to be the answer to many of the problems it was assumed it could be. I also think she was right in joining Reagan and denouncing the old Soviet Union as an evil dictatorship. On those big things she was confirmed. On 100 other things I would pick arguments with her and I recall one conversation I had with her in her retirement where she said something that was unabashedly racist, where she warned Australia, talking to me with Helena standing not far away against Asian immigration, saying that if we allowed too much of it we'd see the natives of the land, the European settlers, overtaken by migrants. I couldn't believe it. It reminded me that despite, yes, her greatness on those big questions, the role of the state, the evil nature of the communist totalitarianism, there was an old fashioned quality to her that was entirely out of touch and probably explained why her party removed her in the early '90s.

EMMA ALBERICI: You must have been extremely taken aback by those comments, not to mention Helena as you say?

BOB CARR: I was astonished. Helena fortunately was out of ear shot. I remember one thing she said as part of that conversation, she said, ""You will end up like Fiji."" She said, ""I like Sydney but you can't allow the migrants,"" and in context she meant Asian migration ""To take over otherwise you will end up like Fiji where the Indian migrants have taken over."" I was so astonished I don't think I could think of an appropriate reply. I think we moved on to other subjects pretty quickly. But I don't say that in any way to diminish the respect I felt for her because of the boldness of her political leadership. She deserves credit for that and that should be upper most in our thoughts today.

It looks nice, for a start, but a couple of problems. Firstly, I'm not sure what your third word is meant to say because you have a line coming out from the consonant boundary as well as two dots in it; dots and lines don't work on the same letter, plus you have two connecting vowels on the same consonant which doesn't work either to my recollection.

Similar problem with the second word; I interpreted it as ""love"" even though the V line contacts the L, which shouldn't really happen.

The penultimate word is probably trying to say ""and"" but it was hard to tell if your internal consonant had two lines or three.

On the final word, your first consonant has both dots and lines again, plus the final consonant (the lower left divot) has what looks live five intercepting lines, which has no equivalent letter.

Other than that, try to make your consonants noticeably bigger than the vowels; your K in the fourth word is barely any larger than the vowels surrounding it.

I say I didn't know what your third word was trying to say but I'm pretty sure I know what the entire message does actually say, and it's rather sweet. Just needs a little fixing for ""you"", ""forever"" and ""always"".

It should be noted that the American advice of ""never talk to a cop"" won't fly here. If you annoy the officer, he or she will find a reason to arrest you. Start immediately going on about your rights as soon as they say ""excuse me"", and you will annoy them. Usually that entails a night in the cells and release the next morning without charge, but remember, you will be on a visa, and putting that at risk. Don't start banging on about your rights ~~until~~ unless you *actually* feel like they're being violated.

Police generally come in twos, a nice chatty one, and a quiet surly one. Co-operating with the nice chatty one is generally a good idea. If the quiet surly one gets involved, things are going badly. The quiet surly one is usually the bigger one. It sounds a bit of a cliche, but it's obviously working for them.

I hear a lot of scare stories about American police, though I've never dealt with them myself. My experiences with British police have been generally positive, even when I was stopped and searched (didn't have anything I shouldn't).

If you *are* stopped and searched, the officer will first ask if you have anything on you you shouldn't have. If you do, *give it to them*. Depending what it is, you may get away with a street caution.

Sure, it's a lose-lose for men. No matter what happens, if it's good or bad for women, or good or bad for men, **it is wrong** and **it's men's fault**. To tell you the truth it's getting a bit tiresome lately. Your argument fails immediately considering that marketing nowadays is mostly done *by women, for women*.

Also, this whole ""objectification"" idea is pure bullshit, it's a postmodernist made-up feminist term aimed at bashing men, with no actual meaning. What it *tries* to mean is that some people do not look at / treat other people as ""complete persons"" all the time, they focus on ""parts"" of that person for some ""selfish"" reason. Well guess what, all people work like this, even you. You ""objectify"" the cashier because you don't look at him/her and think s/he's a person with dreams, goals, etc. You only want your change back and be done with shopping. You don't walk around the streets wondering about people's qualities or personalities. This is only natural. But leave things to feminists and immediately they transform this into something to bash men with. Men look at women, and sometimes ""in a sexual way"", boo hoo. We are a sexual species, in case you didn't notice, we all have urges to reproduce, women as well as men. There's nothing wrong with it.

But the real irony is taking this bullshit theory to the level of saying that pictures somehow victimize women. I wonder how much of a ""victim"" is a model *who wants to be a model* and gets quite generously paid for letting others take some pictures of her. In fact some of these models earn more in a week than an average ""patriarch"" in a year. And how a picture victimizes other women, but no picture can victimize men ever. Feminists have already won the victim olympics, too bad men never showed up to begin with.

This is nothing more than the bashing of natural male sexuality. *Look, the evil menz dare look at wymynz!!!* Men are so evil even their eyes are capable of hurting women, the ""male gaze"" causes real damage to anything it wonders upon. Come on, get the eff out. We have taken this hateful bullshit seriously long enough, it's time to let it go. Yes, men sometimes look at women as potential intimate partners, or even just to appreciate their beauty.

true,boocrap,null,null,"This is a great post, I've noticed through personal experience and online that US citizens are very quick to jump to talking about their rights and in many ways they are justified but only in that context. My experience with British police has been a mixed bag, generally because of chance and my involvement in the Student Movement. However satanspanties advice about co-operation is critical, I have met and witnessed police who are in a sense hired thugs. The local policeman doing the rounds however is usually just tired of being a part-time social worker by association and just wants a straight answer and in many cases doesnt want to nick you. Pains me to say this but forget about your rights, just be co-operative. 

Sorry for the long post but a couple of months ago we had a poster who was an American Student living in London not far from where i live who had taken his hunting knife unknowingly into a nightclub and been arrested on the spot and charge with owning an offensive weapon. His response was ""its legal where I'm from"" well in West London thats a serious offence and that is woeful ignorance of the law. It hadn't helped that he had insisted that he being American meant that he wasn't used to these sorts of laws. I put it to him thustly, unlike in the States I'd rather be caught with and eighth of weed than even a small knife in London, the whole cultural relativism thing will not wash with police.

On a side note its highly unlikely but if you do witness a policeman behaving inappropriately it is usually a good idea to try and get his number and report it straight away. The IPCC is an awful regulator but what they are hot on is low level ""bad-cops-being-bad"" sort of thing as its easy to discipline and makes it look like a problem of the individual rather than systemic I mean they are shit hot on it. I was once quite roughed up by to policeman who  had approached me from behind, not announced themselves and arrested me for resisting arrest (I had no idea who my assailants where so lashed out in defence). As soon as my innocence was obvious (it was a shop lifitng incident I had no part in and a cctv video showed that I clearly wasn't involved both police (bearing in mind I had been playing nice because I thought I was going down for whacking two officers) where taken aside and I was asked by another officer if I wished to make a complaint and I did.

That's not what I took from the article. What I took away is that Thatcher killed compassion and love in this country and she won't be getting any either.

There are pangs of nostalgia, yes, because for me she's all tied up with Hi-De-Hi and Speak and Spell and Blockbusters and ""follow the bear"". What is more troubling is my inability to ascertain where my own selfishness ends and her neo-liberal inculcation begins. All of us that grew up under Thatcher were taught that it is good to be selfish, that other people's pain is not your problem, that pain is in fact a weakness and suffering is deserved and shameful.

true,hebsevenfour,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"My other half is from Kentucky, and has been in the UK now for ten years since coming here to do a degree. She misses the US a lot, but doesn't want to go back. From talking to her the pros of the UK are: 

Work/life balance - we get significantly more holidays than the US. Most employers give 25 days, public sector will often give 35, and you can add bank holidays on top of that. 

Cultural awareness - the US is quite insular (her words, not mine!) compared to the UK. 

Health care - you can change jobs without worrying about your plan, and if you get sick you can get treatment. Doctors aren't trying to sell you anything or promote a particular drug. 

The negatives are:

The weather - it is a bit shit. Often grey, often rainy, and summer seems to remember to turn up once every five years. 

Culture shock - It takes time to fit in. Sense of humour is very different from US, people are not as forthcoming or outwardly friendly. Standard customer service in shops and restaurants is at a level that would probably get you fired in a day in the US. 

Disposable income - the UK is just more expensive. Wages are not as high (for graduates, better for minimum wage) and stuff just costs more. 


She didn't say this, but personally I think the biggest difference is religion and television. Unlike the US the UK actually has a state religion (Church of England), but people are basically secular. Politicians don't even talk about religion as it makes you look a bit weird. Television, we don't have 20 minutes of adverts for every 30 minute show! That drives me mad when I'm in the US! Oh, and tea. Tea is a big deal here. A very big deal.

true,Samuraisheep,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Interestingly, one mate of mine, a proper leftie, in his heyday all Red Wedge and right-on punch-ups, was melancholy. ""I thought I'd be overjoyed, but really it's just … another one bites the dust …"" This demonstrates, I suppose, that if you opposed Thatcher's ideas it was likely because of their lack of compassion, which is really just a word for love. If love is something you cherish, it is hard to glean much joy from death, even in one's enemies.

I.e. if you get joy from death, you don't cherish love.

&gt;Perhaps, though, Thatcher ""the monster"" didn't die yesterday from a stroke, perhaps that Thatcher died as she sobbed self-pitying tears as she was driven, defeated, from Downing Street, ousted by her own party. 

&gt;The blunt, pathetic reality today is that a little old lady has died, who in the winter of her life had to water roses alone under police supervision.

Pointing out that she was just an old lady when she died. 

&gt;Is that what made her so formidable, her ability to ignore the suffering of others? Given the nature of her legacy ""survival of the fittest"" – a phrase that Darwin himself only used twice in On the Origin of Species, compared to hundreds of references to altruism, love and cooperation, it isn't surprising that there are parties tonight in Liverpool, Glasgow and Brixton – from where are they to have learned compassion and forgiveness?

Those who were alive when she was in charge haven't learnt compassion and forgiveness because she ignored the suffering of others, therefore they can have parties upon her death.  


That's how I saw what he was saying anyway. As for the paragraph you quoted, to me it sounds like he's saying her death isn't sad for most of us (which doesn't automatically mean it's something to be joyful about, just that most of us aren't bothered either way). The last bit just seems  to say that most people are annoyed (and resentful) because other people are asking for respect towards her now she's died when her and her government didn't give respect to those she ""annihilated"".

Do you know of any of these specialist schools?

The highs of the years before and in which Thatcher came into power (1978 and 1979) weren't equalled again until 2001-2002.

Specifically, what these figures show is that during Thatcher's time in power, the lowest 5th percentile national weekly incomes after housing costs for those in and out work: 

* were roughly the same in her 1st year as before coming to power, that being a historic high (107.16)
* fell in her 2nd and 3rd years (104.69, 101.77)
* rose and then stayed roughly the same between her 4th and 6th years, but not to the high they began on (102.40, 102.26, 102.76)
* rose in her 7th year, again not returning to the high they began on (105.65)
* fell in her 8th and 9th years, to the lowest point in 15 years (104.28, 100.49)
* rose in her 10th, to around what it was in her 3rd-4th year (102.03)
* fell in her 11th and 12th, to the lowest point in 19 years (97.10, 95.54)
* then after Thatcher they continued to fall until 1994-1995 (down to 84.46), rose in 1995-1996 (to 91.38), didn't move much until a rise in 1998-1999 (to 99.37) and continued to rise more-or-less until 2004 (to 109.01).

And this still only shows UK and GB figures. Given that it's argued her policies had disproportionate effect in the north of England, we'd need to see the numbers for individual regions to properly ""fact check"" those arguments.

She's not so much passing judgment that white people are better than people of different ethnicities, but pointing out that it is important to be able to integrate people into British society and culture.  That in itself isn't strange, nor should it be controversial.

If someone were to say it is important for immigrants, regardless of their origins, to be able to assimilate, integrate and be allowed to feel at home - then it wouldn't be controversial.  

Likewise, if someone were to say that Europeans tend to have more in common with other European cultures - then that too wouldn't be that controversial.   Western people from western countries share more 'western values' and find it easier to integrate into other western countries.  That's not talking smack about non-Western cultures, or passing judgment that the people from them are lesser.  It's simply to say people that have more in common get on better.

Combine the three and the sentiment she expressed holds true; it's only controversial in that she used the term 'white' which modern sensibilities set spidey-senses tingling - and rightly so - but take in context of the day, it wasn't racist.

It is fair to say that if it is important for immigrants to be able to integrate and to feel that they belong, and if there is only so many immigrants a nation can take in at a time, then it is a valid opinion that one might want to take in those immigrants that will integrate, and will be assimilated, easiest.  That is Poland and Hungary, and British  Rhodesians wanting to leave the newly forming Zimbabwe.

The fact that none of this was picked up until now suggests that it's not the kid who needs to understand the internet. This is the type of stuff a basic background check should pickup. The bit the kid (and many, many others) failed to understand is that the things they put on the internet and forget about stay there. That it's not private and limited to her intended audience alone.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"Basically, the gist of what I am saying is that the Conservative Party does not promote the non-privileged or non-wealthy to its highest positions of power.

That, I am arguing, is the general rule. You can point out a handful of figures such as IDS, Thatcher and Major who you argue make my argument inconsistent, but I don't buy that because... 

The black and minority ethnic representation in the party is appalling. 

The opinion held by the typical Tory (constituents in Kensington and Chelsea or Oxford) of BME people, the working class, the underclass and the disabled - basically, anyone who isn't middle class or aspiring to be wealthy - ranges from mildly bigoted to openly bigoted. 

I'm talking about the Richard Starkeys, IDSs and Camerons of this world, and their core supporters. 

And that's connected to the lack of representation of women in the Cabinet and in historic Conservative governments, and feeds through into their policies. 

IDS, Thatcher, Major and anyone else you care to name, I'm sure, will be white, and certainly earned (and owned) nothing close to the financial profile of the average taxpayer when they held any kind of important role in the party. 

Making it to highest eschelons of power is not as easy to do as an immigrant, or a woman, or with a disability (can you find a Tory equivalent to David Blunkett?). 

Sure, there are the odd examples such as the ones already mentioned, but they belie the fact that the typical Tory who ascends to power is white, middle or upper class, private school educated and grew up with people from that same social group.

true,arselona,null,null,"This is excellent, even though on a base level I am indifferent to Thatcherism, believing that her doctrine was a result of larger geo political forces: privatization (IMF), economic revival (north sea oil revenue), Pinochet and Mandella (cold war backdrop)... 

As I was young during her rule I can't truly connect with the points that brand brings up about sentiment in much the same way that I find people of my age or below ridiculous for having such strong positions on something we never felt.... But I understand them, and it highlights an important point in that, is this my own apathy a result of individualism?

Personally I feel that there is a lot of selective revisionism that lacks context (as I highlight above) on both sides of the divide, and I prefer to view her as net neutral.

A lot her decisions were inevitable and would have followed regardless of who was in power. She just accelerated the process and visibly relished confrontation which is one of the reasons why she evokes so much hatred and lionisation.

I got down voted to high heaven in the initial aftermath of her death for suggesting that a left wing circle jerk would follow, and within 20m it had hit us.

Personally I think her main failing was to shut down so many industries without providing an alternative. It's easier said than done but its important to remember that, as Brand says, empathy goes a long way and for those most effected they felt that they were attacked when in reality I don't think they were. I think they were handled with the cold unbiased conviction of an accountant.

Industry was not a fairy land of joyous prosperity, but it gave people something to do, somewhere to go, someone to be... An identity, which is after all the key component of being and individual. However, by failing to find alternatives she failed to address a problem which still plagues Britain today.


Looking at the reaction and street parties, you would think that a dictator just died and we were free, but she was repeatedly voted back into office by the public, and it was her own party which brought her down over Europe... (ironically, many of her points have been vindicated today), the majority of the public didnt reject her via ballot.

true,SplurgyA,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Being male or female, you'll have some bad gender specific experiences, but don't pretend being female is worse - it's different.

Being female is definitely more difficult. A woman who is bossy will often be labelled a bitch, any woman in a position of power will have the fact she is a woman scrutinised (do not be surprised if this includes comments about her appearance), women are more likely to face sexual harassment, women are *far* more likely to be raped, women often face lower wages for doing the same amount of work, I mean I could continue. But I will not. I do not see how you could claim men and women have it equally as bad when there is clearly an undercurrent of misogyny in our society. Now, society has gotten better for women recently, but until quite recently, for example, a man could not rape his wife. As in if she was married to him, there would be no way for her to say no to sex, because she was his wife and therefore consented at all times. Also, look at the recent Steubenville trial - a girl got raped and the media focused on the ""bright young futures"" of the rapists whilst people took to social media to call her a slut. 

I mean, if you think gender equality has been achieved you are very sorely mistaken. But you are so mistaken I do not think there is any way I could convince you otherwise. At the very least just look at how women are addressed on reddit and compare it to how men are addressed - a woman will often be harassed for gonewild pictures, if she is in a photo that damn picture of ""how a man takes a photo vs how a woman takes a photo"" will be posted, I just...

Similarly, police in town of an evening, which is when I see them most often, are usually pretty bored of babysitting people who can't hold their drink.  It's okay to be drunk and say hello to them.  It's not okay to be a dick.

In fact, a lot of the time, if you see large numbers of police about, usually nothing has actually happened, they're just there to nip it in the bud before it gets serious.  This is very common around bus and train stations and town/city centres on football match days, as well around the actual football ground.

To reiterate, I do find that people who are being disrespectful to the police themselves will almost always get arrested pretty much immediately.  I don't think many of them are actually charged with anything serious, it's more about the police showing to onlookers that they are in control of the situation.

Honestly, I don't think you really understand what civility is, but whatever. You claim that postmodernity isn't important here when it really is at the crux of what I am trying to say. Postmodernity is the end of the metanarrative, the end of the 1 true answer. That's exactly what I'm saying. That your answer might not be the answer for everyone else, hell, I'll go ahead and claim that even Moffat's answer is not the end-all answer. That you refuse to accept that others might see more significance in certain aspects of a show really does make it seem like you're really describing yourself Mr. boy who thinks he knows it all and so refuses to see otherwise. You seem to analyse media as a book with an answer key that answers all the questions ever brought up. This is what postmodernity tells you it is not. 

If you've followed my thread of argumentation, you would have realised that I've been trying to help educate you on the need to let other people have their own opinions on things.

true,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"There is a stark difference between something said in an online game to some friends - as long as the people involved understood that it was a joke, even if it came out it would be incorrect to assume any sort of guilt for those actions. I often say extremely politically incorrect or just plain ridiculous things in private conversation like that and it's totally meaningless.

But what you've got to remember is that Twitter is not private communication, it's public broadcast. It's akin to standing in a crowded place and shouting things through a megaphone - and in that situation I am pretty sure you wouldn't be saying nigger very much, would you? :P

And this is what people are missing a lot of the time. We can't just think of the internet as a dump truck that everything is piled on, mixed together and indistinguishable in context. It is instead a series of pipes, and it is extremely important which pipe you are putting things down; it is important that you understand where that pipe leads before you put anything down it!

So what you say really isn't true - things that people post on Twitter *are not equivalent*, for example, to the exact same thing posted on your Facebook if your Facebook visibility is set to your friends and your Twitter is set to public. In the eyes of the law this matters *a lot*, and and courts *do* actually understand this concept of private and public online communication, and they apply it quite well in most cases, albeit too extremely in a lot of cases too.

So still, all parties have a lot to learn:

The general population need educating on what posting something on Twitter actually is - public announcements. Don't say anything you wouldn't want thousands of people you've never met before to hear!

And also the public prosecutors need to learn how to differentiate between a harmless joke and something that *actually* causes distress, alarm, etc.

But you've got to remember, the way ours laws work - if someone in a public place announced that they are going to blow up Robin Hood Airport, and everyone present took it as a joke then there is no problem. But if someone was actually alarmed by this and contacted the police, that is when the issue occurs. If you're going to write something that is to hundreds of thousands of people, you need to be careful that you don't say anything incriminating, racially offensive, etc.

In short, I wouldn't worry about jokingly calling your buddy a nigger in an online game; and though someone properly motivated could use that against you if you were running for a public office for example, that is just the unfortunate effect of political smear tactics.

This is not an argument, this is a conclusion.

A man who is bossy will be labeled a dick.  

&gt; women are more likely to face sexual harassment,  

Men are more likely to be accused (wrongly) of sexual harassment  .

&gt; women are far more likely to be raped  

Now you're making things up, unless ""far"" means not even twice as likely (probably less because male rape goes unreported more often).  

&gt; women often face lower wages for doing the same amount of work  

This has been explained by the phenomenon that [women don't like to haggle for a higher salary.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2012/02/26/why-women-dont-negotiate-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/)  

&gt; I mean I could continue. But I will not.  

You haven't actually made a valid point yet, so you should've continued. Preferably with real points.  

&gt; Now, society has gotten better for women recently, but until quite recently, for example, a man could not rape his wife.  

In specific places. Also in these places a wife couldn't rape her husband (there might be somewhere in the world where this isn't true, couldn't find one though). Two way street.  

&gt; Also, look at the recent Steubenville trial - a girl got raped and the media focused on the ""bright young futures"" of the rapists whilst people took to social media to call her a slut.  

And everyone rallied together to tell them what giant piles of shit they were. People trying to justify a crime isn't new. They're going to jail by the way, so *neither public opinion nor the law* agreed with that.  

&gt; I mean, if you think gender equality has been achieved you are very sorely mistaken. But you are so mistaken I do not think there is any way I could convince you otherwise.  

Not with that argument, since you *haven't made one* that is based on anyhing but vitriol.  

&gt; At the very least just look at how women are addressed on reddit and compare it to how men are addressed - a woman will often be harassed for gonewild pictures,  

Finally we agree on something! People mentioning gonewild while not on porn subreddits should really just shut up about it. It is pathetic. There's nearly endless porn on the internet already, don't need to ask 50% of the population to add to that out of the blue.  

&gt; if she is in a photo that damn picture of ""how a man takes a photo vs how a woman takes a photo"" will be posted,  

Pictures including women strategically placed have been used as linkbait often, but I agree that this has gotten out of hand as well. Sometimes it *is* a legitimate complaint (in advertising and such, YouTube videos are a big example), but on Reddit people are just being absurd. So I guess we kind of agree here?  

&gt; I mean, I do not see how you can rationally say women do not have it worse than men in our society. They really do.  

Come on.  

Basically what I agree with is that all the default subs for Reddit aren't very friendly for women, which is (one of a giant list of reasons) why I unsubbed from all of them. They're full of poor content, bad comments, and worse attitudes. You'll see the same thing on 4chan or YouTube (or other large forums), but how much of it is from that true mindset and how much is from trolls trying to spark a reaction I don't know - not that it really matters as neither is good/acceptable. 

Most of what you said is hyperbole though, and the absolute statements of ""I'm right because I'm so right"" aren't really conducive to making a real justification for your beliefs. My thoughts are that it's a grass-is-always-greener sort of thing, men think there's no way women can have it worse than us, and vice versa for women's thoughts.

One moment.  Googling Brass Eye and Pedophile.  I am sure this will end well.  Ok back. Very funny sketches.  

I don't see the hypocrisy.  Charlotte whoever is 15 in the article and they are condemning a comedy show about pedophiles.  Thinking 15 year old girls are attractive is not pedophilia, sexual interest in prepubescent children.  Charlotte whoever is definitely not prepubescent even if she is young.

&gt;Certainly wife beating or wife spanking was often considered acceptable, even necessary 

Yes.  That was quite true until fairly recently.  Funny how that changed with the rise of women in the workplace and easier divorce.

It's fair enough that you should think things through and plan, but people don't. And people don't always expect redundancy either. Very often, people can feel quite secure in their work as the higher ups say nothing and redundancies come out of nowhere.

I would actually have sympathy for you, because in that situation, you should never have been allowed to sign up for such a mortgage. Phone companies should also be made to more stringent checks on those taking out two year contracts too, but they aren't.

It's part of the reason why I refuse to take out a contract myself and have been with giffgaff since their early days. I am in quite an unstable line of work, but I seem to be the only one who doesn't have an expensive contract for a flash phone.

But that is still where the difference is - something that no one reports will go completely unchecked anyway, and when someone does report something only then is there potential for it to go further - and that is the part where the public prosecutors and police need to show more common sense.

&gt; this wasn't something we even had to do deal with until recently, why is it suddenly such a problem?

But this part is not true, and that's sort of what I was trying to get across here. The laws have barely changed and all the internet has done is made reaching 1000s of different audiences a lot easier. The reason it's ""suddenly such a problem"" is simply that - more people saying more things to more audiences raises more cases.

Plus the internet has made sure we are made aware of these things when they do happen, too.

But really nothing of substance has changed, the police can get involved when someone is overheard down the pub too, and sometimes it's serious, sometimes it's a waste of time and sometimes they will take it further when common sense says they shouldn't.

What you mentioned earlier is important though - on the internet we often leave a solid copy, which lends solid evidence the the police and prosecutors when a case does get to that point. Whereas ""down the pub"" unless you were recording the conversation it's your word vs. theirs, and whatever witnesses may have been present on each side.

&gt; The idea that we should curb the freedom that the Internet provides, in order to assuage the concerns of a few curtain-twitchers who trawl Facebook and Twitter to find things to contact the Police over maddens me.

If you're mad about it now, you've been mad about it for 400 years too, that is really my only point here. If you don't agree with the law then so be it, that's fine. I don't particularly either.

&gt; What makes me feel worse is the fact that you think that's legitimate.

So it's a little unfair that you claim I think it is **legitimate**, I'm not defending the police or prosecutors, I support much broader freedom of speech laws in the UK that would stop people getting in trouble for these things no matter where they say them.

All I am pointing out is that nothing is really new here, and people arguing about ""what people said on the internet"" is really missing the point - if we want what you are and aren't allowed to say to given groups of people to change, then we need to change some of our laws that have been in place before the internet even existed.",0,1365600272,null,0,false,0,c9cac6g,t3_1c1v26,t1_c9cac6g,t1_c9ca30h,null,1431608024,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Sneaky_phil,welsh,Swansea,"There are several methods for collecting crime data in Modern day Britain. First- Police recorded crime. This is crime which is recorded by the police directly. Second you The British Crime Survey ( now the crime survey for England and Wales to better reflect the geography of the survey) households are asked what crimes they have been a victim of over a 12 month period. The final method of collecting Crime Stats is self report studies, individuals are asked what crime they have themselves committed.
All these have advantages and disadvantages. But to make a long answer short, the police use discretion when recording crime.

The thing is that these are current laws, they've been updated multiple times over the last century, and it's what the public has consented through our democratic process. We've elected people to make these laws for us, and the only way to get them changed is to elect someone who promises to change them or put extreme pressure on the people who currently have the power to.

Of course we have a shitty democratic system that doesn't allow us to be represented as much as we would all ideally like - and we're too stupid to vote yes when we get a chance to take any steps towards remedying that situation. So here we are, badly represented, screwing ourselves over, and it's all just a big shitty situation that we are unfortunately going to have to deal with for decades to come.

And that's the real reason this is all depressing to me - not that people are screwed for life over something they wrote online, but that we have little recourse to do anything about it and change that in the forseeable future.

There is no free market theory. I believe what you're referring to is Classical Economics or Monetarism.

No they don't. Keynes believed in the free market and most of his economic theory was based on the idea that people (and therefore markets) don't act rationally.

I wouldn't say the number of seats you win in an election, or the number of votes you win to be invited to form a cabinet for government is a true indication of whether you're liked or not in general, people may have voted for you because your policies at the time seemed pertinent, or the best of a bad bunch, sometimes it's a case of better the devil you know, and sometimes it's just because there are no better options.

I get bemused sometimes by other comments I've seen on this whole thing that have this air of ""Oh I knew she was going to be bad the whole time because she's a tory"" about them...nobody has a crystal ball here, and nobody did back then.

I'd venture that all any politician can do, outside of the intelligence they gather and the statistics and analytics they undertake to be proactive, is react to current affairs in the most appropriate manner at the time.

I think that sometimes when you're faced with a tough decision, you're going to make an unpopular choice - and that choice will either upset the 500,000 people on the left, or the 500,000 people on the right, and at best you've pretty much got to gamble, and that gamble has to pay off and get you re-elected.

Sometimes, the gamble doesn't pay dividends and then that makes you a bad politician and an evil person. If it does and world events take a turn that means you end up winning out and everyones happy, then you're the greatest leader that ever lived.

Case in point: At several moments during WW2, Churchill was asked by Hitler to join him, and the odds were OVERWHELMINGLY in favour of Axis forces, but he said ""no thanks chap, I'll stick with my tea and cake"", and had we been crushed by the Luftwaffe (luckily we weren't due to some freak occurrences and some dopey decisions/arrogance by the Nazi supreme command on certain battle tactics) then he wouldn't be celebrated has having brought us through a war, he would have had his grave danced on for being a belligerent old fool who got millions of people killed by a psycopathic new world order when he could have just said ""oh go on then"" in the first place.

My point is that it's very easy to look back and blame everything on a leader, and that is unfortunately the responsibility that leadership comes with, but it's very short sighted to look at things and not realise that it could have gone either way, and that person had to make tough choices - and tough choices are really lose/lose choices.

My personal view?  I get a bit tired of ""the pit was shut down so my Dad had to sit on his arse at home all day and we've been poor ever since"".

People these days have industries that are wiped out and they just have to retrain. I know people who have lost jobs in industries that have been decimated due to the internet and online spending - they had to go out and find work so they could survive - the resources in the 80's weren't so scarce that you couldn't take a normal paying job elsewhere and learn accountancy or estate agency or become a librarian or a milkman or drive a bus or clean bogs or whatever it is you need to do to look after your family and re-train your skillset so that you can move forward - forced or not, whether it's a government decision or a personal decisions or just the fact a giant sasquatch came and flattened your entire industry - you have to go and do something else, it's just life!

I've worked in various jobs, and in ANY of those jobs had I sat down with 300 other workers and said ""we don't get paid enough, pay us more or we'll not carry on doing this work"" the answer would be ""fine, fuck off and we'll get somebody else to do it"" which is exactly as it should be - holding an entire country to ransom just doesn't wash - it just strikes me as a ""I want fairness for everyone"" argument, but....downing tools and holding everyone around you to ransom is NOT community spirited, it's NOT fair, and it's NOT appropriate.  In fact, it's tribal ""As long as MY community is fine, the fuck everyone else""

Hey, maybe I'm wrong - but that's just how I see it, and just as hypocrite uncivilized buffoons are so proud to make no apology for their shameful taunting and celebrating of the death of a frail old woman suffering from dementia, I make no apology for my opinion.

**AND PLEASE NOTE** I am not going to be defined as a 'tory' or a 'liberal' here because I don't think it's relevant. And also worth noting that I do not champion the deaths and demise of hundreds of families who suffered as a result of CONSERVATIVE POLICIES (not just Thatcher policies!) during that time, as it would be callous, immature, pathetic and unfair for me to pop open a bottle of bubbly and say ""thank fuck, another bunch of uneducated idiot coal miners wiped off the face of the earth, lets hope society moves forward with less stupid northerners"" - wouldn't really be in good taste would it?

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"The decision to sink the Belgrano would have been taken to issue a very strong message to the Argentinians to back off - they had surrounded the islands with naval vessels and although outside of the exclusion zone that warship apparently presented a threat. The Argentinians had sent a message which was intercepted by our intelligence concerning an attack due the following day.  Recent events show us (North Korea) that plastering your battle plans all over the world is bluster, but a coded message?  Probably more likely to be serious.  Was it serious? We don't know, and if you had no crystal ball, you'd have to decide whether you'd risk being the victim of a massive strike and potentially losing your grip on the islands, and risking the lives of hundreds of soldiers (lets not get into the semantics of WHY we needed to defend the islands here, focus on this incident) so you'd have to choose between fire or be fired upon. Thatcher wanted to demonstrate British military might at the time, which is further evidenced by the decision to fly ONE Vulcan bomber all the way there to blow a hole in the runway at Stanley (presumtion is that some motivation for this was a move by the RAF to avoid further defence cuts as were seen in the 1970's).

So, she decided to sink it.

Debating what is 'right' or 'wrong' and the 'shoulda woulda coulda' of a situation like this is perhaps helpful to avoid further issues, but in a military situation when you've got very little time and tensions is high, you have to make decisions, and I think that anyone who is suggesting that ANYONE at a senior level in the military or in the government didn't take into account and weigh up all of the facts that they had at their disposal at that precise moment in time (remember kids, we still don't have time travel, clairvoyance and future-seeing powers) is probably a little misguided.  Did the cabinet have all of the information?  Maybe not - maybe they were supposed to know more, but some civil servant failed to mention it, or it was lost in translation, or they forgot, or it was deliberately done as a political move.

All of these things are carefully calculated and executed on a scale we can't imagine and with information we maybe still don't have. Was it wrong to kill 300+ people in cold blood?

They may be paying for it all on finance or buy to own like brighthouse, perfect home etc where you basically rent it and can give it back when you want (althought the prices are inflated so they make a profit), without all the details you will never know how they manage it all,

(Forgive me, but I get tetchy at people asking for donations, putting up adverts and the like (especially due to Blogtor) so there's a big bit on that.)

1)You've named your site, facebook, etc ""TARDISArchives""...so why is your url ""DoctorWhoFanNew""?

2)You're missing a fair bit of news on the site.

3)
&gt;But the people who pay for the site, domain and videos are students who don’t earn as of yet

As am I, but then I pay for a domain and hosting that costs over $100 a month due to the needs of the site through donations and regrettably adverts. But I've just looked it up and you guys can't be paying over $7.17 on average per month. Not when you're hosting the site on a free service that you only pay for the extras. And for the videos, yes I can understand the need to pay for the equipment...but since you already seem to have some of that, I'm guessing that it's funding them ""in retrospect"", which are all hosted for free on YouTube. I admit that I'm finding it a little hard to believe that two people can't muster up $7.17 a month, if that. But at the end of the day, I think ads might work better. Especially as there's not much to keep up and nothing unique. Work on content first, then ask for donations. 

4)You're not using Wordpress to it's fullest potential. If you scrap that and move to Blogger's free hosting, you could save a bit of money there. Especially as you wouldn't need to pay for either the hosting nor the ""use of the domain"". Just the actual domain. And you'll get better SEO. I wouldn't mention it if you didn't ask for donations. A lot of it could be done cheaper, but it seems the easiest way out is best?

5)
&gt;Ok, so you should check back to tardisarchives.com to see any if any posts have been made and then link them on the Facebook page.

Why are you getting others to do this? Judging from the number of posts, wouldn't it be better to either get the poster of it to post it out? Or do what the majority of other sites do and get it done automatically?

With all the talk lately about Margaret Thatcher reducing the power of the unions, one would think that the NUS as a union is a great idea to represent students. However, students can't strike.

true,coriny,eng-GreaterLondon,London?,"Free market theory is the extension of market theory (markets being a subset of evolutionary-type optimisation algorithms) that posits the concept of an idealised market being one that follows a specific set of assumptions. I'm working off the top of my head so I'm only remembering the two most important:
* That all actors are rational (act to maximise their own benefit)
* That complete information is available to all.
* That the information is precisely correct, and that all required information can known immediately.
This is meant to create a market which all always reach the optimum stable equilibria. However, both of those assumptions are always wrong in real world conditions - for instance ""spite"", which would appear irrational, is well documented in human economic interactions.

Another consideration is that for evolutionary optimisation techniques to work the problem landscape must be favourable to the method used. A simple example is if the ideal point (i.e. the minima) is surrounded by mountains - then evolutionary methods are very unlikely to find the best answer.

There are other interesting examples where the market will never find even a semi-stable optimum and will keep cycling through unstable states.

We see many of the same effects in evolution - where we can see the design is not optimal, but the set of changes required to go from ""working well enough"" to ""optimum"" are insurmountable for undirected evolution (I come from an evolutionary biology background).

So markets are great, and a powerful technique, but they must always be observed and regulated to identify where they are failing. Most importantly we should be aware that they are not correct for all types of problem. For instance, lack of good information fundamentally undermine health care markets.

true,UncleDuster,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;There was and remains no evidence at all that the Belgrano presented a ""clear and present"" danger

Absolute rubbish.

FACT: The Belgrano set sail as one of two task forces *specifically launched* to act as a pincer movement to attack the British fleet.

FACT: On 1st May (the day before the sinking) the British intercepted a message from the Argentinian Navy ordering all ships to proceed to attack the British fleet.

FACT: When attacked, the Belgrano was very close to the Burwood Bank, a shallow area which the Conqueror would not be able to track the Belgrano through.


To put the sinking in context, the Argentinian aircraft carrier which made the second half of the pincer had not been located by the British. They knew it was out there somewhere to the North and (along with the Belgrano) its orders were to attack the British fleet. There was no intelligence that the Belgrano was heading back to port. To fail to disrupt this attempted attack on British forces would have been a dereliction of duty and could have resulted in countless British deaths and the failure of the campaign.

AVB and operates in a similar manner to Mourinho. Therefore it stands to reason that they will dislike him just as much, especially if he picks a better performing player rather than some cult hero, which angers Madrid fans.

AVB is not stupid, and is likely to avoid taking the Madrid job because he would probably end up getting the same abuse and crap Mourinho is getting.

If for some reason AVB was stupid enough to consider the Madrid job, I expect Mourinho (who seems to care about his friends) would tell him to catch himself on and sit tight at Spurs.

While not especially prevalent in today's game, loyalty must count for something. AVB was at a really low point, and we can along and gave him a chance to stay in the same country, same league, and manage a top team despite the huge dent his career took beforehand. Many fans welcomed him right away, others took a while to come on board, but I think most love him now. If he is any sort of decent man, he will repay that faith by sticking with us.

Finally, If Mourinho heads back to Chelski, I bet AVB would love to go up against him. Honestly, win or lose a Spurs/AVB vs Chelsea/Mourinho match would probably be incredible.

There is also non-direct influence. Suppose a case involving France has the court say that France cannot, ever, ban scientologists from meeting in a public forum.

The thing to remember is that both directed judgments and domestic judgments **can never change the law**. A domestic court may only declare that a current law contravenes ECHR. The ECHR can do this and also award damages / a remedy timetable, **but the UK does not have to follow it**. 

In both cases a part of the HRA 1998 allows a Minister to amend parliamentary statute **without** going to Parliament, so long as the amendment does no more and no less than fix the violation.

Sometimes it's the Doctors. 

I don't at all mean this in a nasty way, as I've been told this by Doctors:

* A guy who was on disability / whose JSA is about to lapse comes in and asks for a sick note
* If he gets one, his benefits will extend for a good period of time, so long as he gets a new note every time the old one lapses.
* As I understand it, certain types of illness require thorough examinations, but the more wooly ones don't.

Just to be clear I'm not saying things like depression, chronic stress, etc shouldn't be treated as serious or worthy or a medical excuse, just that they are much harder and more subjective than a broken limb. 

* The sick note is obtained from a GP's surgery. One of two things will happen here:

* The individual will ask at his local surgery who the GPs available are, and wait for an unfamiliar name. This will almost inevitably be, at worst, a locum, and at best a trainee / ST1. 
* Many non-resident GPs will be more likely to give a convincing individual a note because they don't want to be written up as insensitive or incompetent on appraisals.
* Many experienced GPs (including the friends I know) will simply write one out anyway unless there's a glaring flaw in what the person is saying. 

The reason? Turning down a legitimate claimant is a ball-ache, and depending on how much of a stink they kick up, can cause a lot of hassle for the GP. Giving a workshy scrounger an extension is bad for the country and welfare system, but carries next to no risk for the GP. 

I have no idea what percentage of people who exploit benefits do this, but the GPs I know frequently bring this up as one of the most unnecessary and frustrating parts of their jobs.

Say they were very small, with 3 manned checkouts and 1 person on self-scan, plus 2 stacking shelves and 2 out the back. You'd also have the manager and assistant manager, who between them would probably cover HR duties unless it was covered by a regional store.

8 positions, covering 7am-11pm (16 hours) needs 16 people each day. Some can work Mon-Fri, others just Sat, others are given say Mon+Sat and the option of overtime. It gets complicated, and to cover the store you might need 30 people easily. Security may be contracted, and would probably take 2-4 people.

Clean-ups in a small store are usually covered by the shelf-stackers, etc., but in a larger one you'd need a dedicated janitorial team. A supermarket with a large computer system to run the tills may also have an in-house IT person, any large supermarket has an HR team of 1-3 people, and then management for each section of the store. None of these people work 2-3 shifts, 7 days a week, so most need duplicates.

true,oh_papillon,tennant,Tennant,"There's that, and the fact that Clara A) had the leaf, and B) was willing to give it up to save all those people. Does anyone else find it intensely interesting that at only age 24, Clara has many objects of sentimental value (the book, the leaf, her mother's ring), while The Doctor, who is over a thousand years old and has not only seen, but taken part in so many things, has nothing?

I know that he refers to his sonic screwdriver as the only thing he has that has value, but even if he chose to give it up, I don't think it would have done a damn thing. Aside from the monetary value of Clara's ring, the ring and the leaf have no purpose aside from containing sentimental value, bestowed upon them by Clara's mother's existence, her death, and Clara's sorrow at her death. This is exactly the kind of stuff that works so well as currency on the Rings, and also serves as the Old God's favorite food. In contrast, The Doctor's sonic screwdriver is a tool, and the value placed upon it by The Doctor comes about solely because of its usefulness, not because it reminds him of any particular deed he's done or companion he's lost. I think this is part of the reason why he doesn't want to give it up: it won't do any good because it has no sentimental value. While he's done amazing things with it, it's just a tool.

And while the leaf certainly represents the infinity of things that could have happened differently in regards to Clara's parents meeting and falling in love, this is not what the Old God feeds on. Clara herself informs us that the leaf is important because it represents the infinite potential held by the days that her mother never got to live. What I think is that there's a certain kind of infinity tied up in past events: anything that has ever happened could have happened many different ways. However, that infinity cannot be fed upon by the Old God because once something has definitively happened, every other possibility is forever excluded and all that's left is what happened. Suppose The Doctor went back to a certain point in time and space three different times and and influenced an event there three different ways. The history of that place would only record one version of those events, but due to the fact that The Doctor ages at the same rate no matter how far forward or backward in time he goes, all three versions of that event will be there on The Doctor's time stream, one right after the other. All of The Doctor's memories, everything that's ever happened to him, can be counted as having definitively happened, and that is why the Old God cannot feed on the infinite things that did not happen in his life. 

Tl/dr: The Doctor's life and memories did hold A LOT of meaning, but that meaning was ultimately finite. Clara's leaf defeated the Old God when The Doctor's memories did not, because it represented an entire future that could have been, not a past that could have been.

Cech; Azpi, Iva, Terry, Ake; Ramires, Lampard; Moses, Oscar, Beny; Torres.

Ake deserves a chance. Our lack of a left back may open him up for another first team chance. Obviously Torres with Ba cup tied and injured. Moses played very well in the first leg and Oscar and Torres connected well on Sunday in the second half. Mikel could sub in at half for Ramires allowing both to not tire so they can start the semi. Same for Luiz and Iva here. Terry can play the full 90 especially after the first leg.

For the FA Cup Semi against City:
Cech; Azpi, Iva, Luiz, Bertrand (if healthy); Ramires, Mikel; Oscar, Mata, Hazard; Ba.

We obviously have to have our best midfield set out for City. Cahill being out is really putting pressure on Azpi as he's our only real RB with Iva covering in the middle. Hopefully Bertrand will be back by Sunday as well. If Torres form continues on Thursday, I wouldn't mind him subbing in at some point to make sure Ba is totally healthy.

&gt;The 50th anniversary series finale of the new Doctor Who finds Matt Smith getting killed and regenerating... into 12th Doctor Josh Radnor! 

&gt;Meanwhile, on HIMYM, Ted finds a mysterious pocket-watch that he put somewhere in his apartment for all this time. He is eventually convinced to restore his Timelord consciousness and realizes that he's the Doctor! He retrieves the TARDIS from where he parked it all this time ago (it's the apartment - no way they can afford a place that's actually that big on the inside) and Lily, Marshall, Robin and Barney become his new companions as they set off around the galaxy to have humorous half-hour adventures! 

&gt;Barney meets up with Jack Harkness and they depart on a mission to bone their way across the galaxy (Barney eventually becomes a recurring character on Torchwood *[Torchwood had not been cancelled for good yet when I wrote this]*). The remaining four set off to track down and destroy their Doppelgangers, actually Gangers remotely controlled by malevolent forces. (The hardest to kill is, of course, Mexican Wrestler Ted, who is the Doctor's equal and opposite).

&gt;The plot comes to a head over the course of the next two seasons, and in an emotional finale Radnor!Doctor finds out that he has impregnated the new companion he picked up after Marshall and Lily left to settle down as Amy and Rory's neighbors *[after Angels Take Manhattan this works even better, because NYC]*. But the villain (probably Fenric) who's been pulling the strings the whole time has the Doctor on the ropes - he's captured Robin and The Mother and has put them in their very own version of the Two Streams facility, where they are aging before the Doctor's very eyes - he sees his twins born in an instant, growing up in a flash, missing their entire childhood - merely a sped-up dramatization of the anguish that an immortal Timelord must always go through when dealing with those of shorter lifespans. 

&gt;The Doctor sacrifices himself in a last, desperate effort to destroy Fenric's machinery - it works, and Old!Robin steps out of the machine and manages to kill Fenric herself with her Canadian savagery. But sadly, the Doctor is dead, having never met his children. But wait! What's that? He's regenerating into.... THIRTEENTH DOCTOR BOB SAGET!

&gt;Desperate to acquaint his already-teenage kids with himself and his past, Saget!Doctor leads them into the TARDIS, its interior now based on the house that he had back when he was Ted.

&gt;Churchill's funeral was the largest state funeral in world history up to that point in time, with representatives from 112 nations; only China did not send an emissary. Only Ireland did not broadcast the service live on television in Europe, where 350 million people watched, including 25 million in Britain.[224] By decree of the Queen, his body lay in state for three days and a state funeral service was held at St Paul's Cathedral on 30 January 1965.[225] One of the largest assemblages of statesmen in the world was gathered for the service.[1] Unusually, the Queen attended the funeral.[226] As Churchill's lead-lined coffin passed up the River Thames from Tower Pier to Festival Pier on the MV Havengore, dockers lowered their crane jibs in a salute.[227]

I believe state funerals have to have a Parliamentary act passed to grant funding, so something was probably mentioned...

British intelligence had intercepted message from Admiral Juan Lombardo ordering *all* naval units to launch a massive attack on British ships. It was moving away at the time but most likely about to turn round to launch an attack.

&gt;She personally approved the Hillsborough cover-up 

'her precise role, and all the views she held, in the immediate aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster remain unclear.' They remain *unclear*, she did not definitely order the cover up. Also, it wasn't her that killed those 94 people.

&gt;she resolutely refused to come to any arrangement to prevent the deaths of the Maze hunger strikers

Governments *never* negotiate with Terrorists, regardless of political leaning.

&gt;So she hasn't quite reached the death tally of Bin Laden but you could well argue she's well on the way there.

A hilarious conclusion to a ridiculously inaccurate account of history. How dare you compare a PM to a leader of an organisation who has killed hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed countries across North and Africa and the Middle East.

Similarly, Hitchen's idea that refusing citizens the automatic right to own firearms is an insult to their intelligence or integrity is ignorant of the facts. Most fatalities due to firearms in the US are not premeditated. Even non-homicidal crimes supported by firearms (armed robbery, rape, kidnapping, etc.) do not intend to use them, and it is only when something goes wrong that fatalities occur. Neither the intelligence nor integrity of those who have caused death by gun have much to recommend them, and there is no perfect way to predict who those people will be.

Most anything else that you can ban has a practical use. You can't ban kitchen knives or cars, despite how many accidental deaths they cause, because they are crucial to many reasonable activities. By contrast, you can ban public access to various dangerous chemicals, as the only reasonable applications they have are industrial. What applications are there for firearms? Some farmers and landowners in some areas have a case for culling the populations of some animals, but beyond them there is no everyday use for guns.

There's lots of reasons though. From a purely selfish one, the Israel/Palestine conflict has been the number one recruiting tool for islamic terrorists, which has a direct knock on for UK foreign and domestic interests. I think most people care more from a human perspective though. As with South Africa, it's relative easy to understand and be appalled by the situation in Palestine, in a way that the isn't as immediately apparent in Syria or the DRC. The solution also seems maddeningly obvious in Israel/Palestine, which adds both to the frustration and the interest. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm horrified by the lack of attention paid to the DRC, but it doesn't for one second excuse the actions of Israel, and it doesn't make people's interest anti-Semetic.

The situation in Syria seems more maddeningly obvious to me than the one in Israel. Palestinians are treated abhorrently in Israel and yet are still treated better, in many cases, than they are in the rest of the Arab world. By all means, protest against Palestinian's treatment in Israel, but to have it as the focal point in a global battle against oppression that many people seem to use it as, is, in my opinion, misplaced. What is happening in Syria, in DRC and in places across the world is (IMO again) equally or more clear cut and heinous.

I am not saying that all anti-zionists are anti-semites. Likewise, you could not say that none of them were. Anti-Zionism, whilst a legitimate philosophical viewpoint in some ways also offers a convenient front for generations old prejudices in many people. 

I struggle with all of these ideas. I am not going to get involved in a long argument about it. I am Jewish (non-practicing, but culturally and ethnically). My father is Israeli. I do not go to Israel to visit my family for political reasons. There will come a point when I am no longer able to see my grandmother because of this. So it is personal for me. Never a good place to be having a political conversation from, I accept. 

If you were to ask me if I was a zionist, I would be forced to say yes, in the sense that I believe in a Jewish homeland. Do I believe that it *needed* to be where it was eventually put? No. Do I agree with the treatment of the Palestinian people by Jew and Muslim alike? No. The question it comes down to for me, and I understand that it is a personal one, is this: Where were my relatives meant to go at the end of WW2? Most of them that survived weren't welcomed in this country. Or in the States. Or anywhere. They couldn't return to their old homes. And the world, to them (and to me in fact if I am honest with myself) seemed tainted with a hatred going back millenia. (My maternal grandfather was intensely grateful to the British, but even he did not buy into the revisionist history peddled by many, where somehow, WW2 was fought to protect the Jews) Where were they supposed to go? What were they supposed to do?

I don't have answers. Sorry for going on.

Every year the welsh government assigning the funding per university for full-time equivalent undergrads. (they count part-time and evening students as fractions).

Previously this funding was all one big block per uni, but from september 2013 that block is both reduced, and split into a ""core"" and a ""margin""

the ""core"" represents funding for the number of undergrads the university is allowed to recruit in the usual way as before.

the ""margin"" represents a top-up where funding is only made available where the university recruits students that meet strict criteria on high grades, etc. This is counted separately from the core allocation.

Basically, think of the ""core"" being what we had before, but cut massively. Then the margin is a bit on the side for universities that recruit high-achieving students - most likely to be from more well-off backgrounds.

Note that the Doctor's adventure with Amy and Rory and the asylum was just after (in his timeline anyway) escaping the Silence. This adventure was the first time he met Clara. 

If you also note the Silence's ability to ""suggest"" creatures to do things, it is possible that they tricked the Daleks into capturing the Doctor and bringing him to Clara.

Then Clara, as part of the Silence's plan, erases the Doctor's ""existence"" (I use that term loosely), so only the Silence have data on him. 

Now remember that the Doctor was alone for a while after the Angels Take Manhattan episode. It is possible that the Doctor ran into the Silence, who suggested that he go to Victorian times, where the Silence know another version of Clara exists. His curiosity is piqued and he finds Clara again.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; You realise that they are as much to blame, don't you?

Of course. Those that don't play the game get locked out of it. 

&gt;  Why is it that difficult to accept that the media would have been there to create their own account? 

Of course they cannot be everywhere. However, sources should always be cited, even if it's ""bystanders said"" or ""a police spokesmen said"". When they simply leave it as ""there were reports"" then imho the related information should be taken only at face value. 

This information is essential to make sense of it. Say for example the reports had been 999 calls from local residents. This justifies the police's actions 100%. If on the other hand the reports come from an unnamed spokesmen and actually describe what happened *after* the police intervention then they are not relevant to the debate. Furthermore, if they are something they found on twitter then they are quoting a body of people that thought Cher had died because of a hashtag misunderstanding! :-)

By telling us where the reports are coming from they give us a measure of how accurate they are likely to be. 


&gt; So just because they haven't mentioned a source, is not evidence that the police are manipulating the truth, because they wouldn't of been able too. 

I'm not saying we should convict them based on what we know. Just that they have ""prior"" for this sort of thing and their actions fit a suspicious pattern that is well known to us and as such we should be wary of jumping to conclusions.

WRT to your second paragraph, I agree with most of what you are saying. My only argument is that we don't know for certain how crowd was behaving. Particularly at the time that the police first appeared at the sidelines, I really do doubt that people were smashing shops and making graffiti under the police's gaze. I don't agree that it being after midnight automatically means it should be shut down immediately. I'm not arguing that clamping down is wrong or illegal, just that it isn't always the best course of action in a town known for rioting.

An amazing amount of stuff was in public ownership: gas, water, electricity, telecoms, railways were flat-out state monopolies. Road haulage, local buses, long distance coaches and ferries all had dominant publicly owned operators. Coal mining, steel making, ship-building, car making, the list goes on. (The pubs in Carlisle were privatised before Thatcher, though). 

And the unions were rampant. Their own worst enemies. The British Leyland vehicle factories became a national joke there were so many strikes. So, that all did need fixing. Of course, it didn't have to be fixed in such a brutal, off-hand, callous and worst of all _negligent_ way.

There were manny issues and proplems with the Tennant era that ruined it for me. For one, there were rarely good episodes. Furthermore, RTD had a fascination with writing boring companions and acting as if they were gods (Rose) as well as taking classic villians and ruining them. (The Master/Davros)

Furthermore, his tone was always far too dark. Frankly by the time the specials came around his era was old a wilted. Series 5 was written entirely to fix the DWU after RTD had smegged it up, and series 6 was a fascinating and cler story. Series 7 is turning out to be the best series sense Series 1 in 2005.

You see, the thing about Doctor Who, as well as the reason that it's lasted so long, is that Doctor Who adapts. It moves on, it changes. RTD's inablititly to do any of these things is precisley why his era grew sour quickly.


Doctor Who is on an all-time-high and has the best Doctor then it's had sense Tom Baker. I think that it's time that you give it a chance and start getting hyped up for the 50th. Go watch the Classic series, when you'll see what good Who is.

""

www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp

Neither of those have happened.

Also, the only thing that drives economic growth is spending. The idea behind government spending is to increase total spending, and that's what it does. It increases spending by an exponential amount compared to what the government actually spends. That's called the spending multiplier.

It's a basic economic concept that the state can use fiscal policy to shift the aggregate demand curve out and return an economy to equilibrium.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_multiplier

This also works with taxes. If you cut taxes, you increase aggregate demand. However, due to the marginal propensity to consume being less than 1(Marginal Propensity to Consume + Marginal Propensity to Save = 1), tax cuts actually have a much smaller effect on aggregate demand than increased spending does.

It doesn't increase solely the amount of government spending. It's actually an exponential amount that it increases.

As explained by the link I pasted before, ""For example: a company spends $1 million to build a factory. The money does not disappear, but rather becomes wages to builders, revenue to suppliers etc. The builders will have higher disposable income, and consumption may rise, so that aggregate demand will also rise. Suppose further that recipients of the new spending by the builder in turn spend their new income, this will raise demand and possibly consumption further, and so on.

The increase in the gross domestic product is the sum of the increases in net income of everyone affected. If the builder receives $1 million and pays out $800,000 to sub contractors, he has a net income of $200,000 and a corresponding increase in disposable income (the amount remaining after taxes).""

It is true that this can increase inflation, but during a recession this actually helps to put an economy back in equilibrium(where aggregate supply and aggregate supply intersect with supply), and due to the Phillips curve, which shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment, we know that increasing inflation is coupled with decreasing unemployment.",0,1365629813,null,0,false,0,c9clc9l,t3_1bzomy,t1_c9clc9l,t1_c9cejoh,null,1431602698,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2
true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"The major contention here is that you seem to believe that it was wrong for Mrs Thatcher to abandon subsidies for steelworking in Sheffield, resulting in unemployment. 

This was a dead industry which was not profitable, and without mass sackings, an infusion of technology and a shift to high skill approaches rather than relying on lots of expensive workers the industry was doomed. There was no hope, no future in that. Your father would have been working a dead end job filled with pain and agony, and the state would have been paying him to do so despite the fact that no-one was realistically going to buy the steel at an uncompetitive rate. She was right to do so, and there are few reputable economists who would claim that we should have kept on subsidising dead industries.

On coal, she closed fewer mines than Howard Wilson did. Yet again, coal either required fewer workers who were better trained or wages comperable to china in order to be cost effective, neither of which anyone was willing to accept.

On nationalised industries, well, this is an area of contention, but Labour had the option to renationalise them and didn't. This was because they recognised that it wasn't cost effective to do so, as the state shouldn't be running airlines and the like when private companies can do similar. She was seeing whether or not these industries were actually fit for service in the modern world, those which weren't shouldnt have had good money thrown after bad.

You seem to hate low tax rates, but the later half of the 1970's had resulted in massive amounts of capital flight and the labour government discussing the deployment of tanks to keep people in the UK. She stopped skilled labourors jumping the sinking ship, and got confidence and investment back into the uk economy.

I am not an ideologue, and I am not ignorant of the social costs of her policies. I believe they were, on balance, worth it, and that the cost was unfairly burdened. I do not, however, believe that it could have been avoided.

She made the poorest richer, and increased the amount that the richest paid in tax. She achieved more on South Africa than the majority of countries because she realised that dialogue was more effective than lecturing. 

You assert that she was not a feminist and that she achieved nothing for women. The ignorance of this statement astounds me, considering the number of female leaders, most obviously in Africa, who have come forward in the last few days saying that she proved to them that with courage and dedication they could rise to the top. This did more for feminism than any action undertaken by the vast majority of feminists, and a hell of a lot more than your sociologist mother has achieved.

Stop assuming that your opponents are ignorant of Thatcherism, and start thinking that they might know more about it than you do. You see to be exceptionally small minded and only willing to consider things in an exceptionally narrow dynamic in order to create an enemy to simplify the world so that its more comforting, which requires you to ignore and disregards the mountains of good to focus on the valleys of failure.

People can disagree with you and be right. I accept a number of the points that you are making. But by ignoring the context of the situation you belittle a great individual who achieved amazing things, albeit at a high social cost, which distorts the discourse and only leads to more bitching and bad debate.

Overall, I enjoyed the show. It's a varied experience, the show changes a *lot* over its four seasons. Season 1 reminded me of Series 1 of Doctor Who - a bit campy and rough around the edges, trying to find its stride. Torchwood however is aimed at an older demographic *which they won't let you forget* over the first season, shoehorning expletives into the dialogue and sexual scenes into the plot wherever they can, to borderline ridiculousness. It hits its stride in that format in the second season: The writing's better, the dialogue's more natural, etc.

I thought season three was really good. A major departure from the first two seasons' episodic format, season three is a mini-series, one story over 5 episodes. I thought it was well-paced and suspenseful with a good story arc.

It's my understanding that the community has mixed feelings about season four. It felt like they tried to recreate the success of season three - they had (I thought) a good premise, but I thought they stretched it out and diluted it more than the story could bear. There's definitely a lot of complaints (myself included) about the pacing. There's also a lot of sentiment among long-time viewers that Starz' involvement made the series too ""Americanized"", among other complaints.

true,Mr_CrashSite,null,null,"I really appreciate the time and trouble you have all put into your replies. You say steel and mining were 'dead' industries and deserved to go. But both of these industries are thriving globally. All you are saying is that British workers were paid more than Polish or Indian steelworkers, so they had to be sacrificed to market forces. In time nearly all our manufacturing industry has disappeared this way, with politicians reduced to telling the workforce that they must pay themselves less and make themselves competitive. Now we are buying Chinese goods because Chinese workers earn a fraction of our workers' wages and we're willing to buy from the lowest bidder. That what globalised capitalism is all about.

But there is another way. Germany has a sound industrial base and is the strongest economy in Europe. How come? 1) Government investment in education for all (not just the top 50%) so they have a skilled workforce at every level. 2) Investment in industrial research and development through tax relief 3)  A culture which doesn't seek profits at all costs. 4) A co-operative, and mutually respectful attitude between management and labour. 5) a high wage economy with generaous contributory benefits.

Our Anglo-Saxon belief in rugged individualism is not the only way. There are other narratives and other histories which have been systematically denied a hearing.

 You presumably dislike IDS, Thatcher and Major for their politics and their policies, not because of their family backgrounds, so why base your criticism on the latter?  You have a hell of a lot of points to choose from which make for a far more substantial argument than inventing monied backgrounds for them.

See how changing a couple of words shows that argument to be complete bollocks?

I'm no fan of Thatcher, as a lot of my family come from what were mining villages, as well as other reasons (although I will admit she did do some good things too).  But people should be able to express their love/hate/indifference to the woman regardless.

&gt;But to a significant number of people Thatcher was important, and out of respect for them this is not the time to have that discussion. 

A lot of her policies were also important to a large part of the North, Scotland &amp; Wales.

&gt;I'd just let the funeral go ahead, not disrupt it and then in a few months we can reflect on the realities of her time in power without the emotion of death.

If you think waiting a few months would calm the vitriol of people who hate her or lessen the adoration of people that love her, then you're extremely naive about the polarisation of opinions Thatcher has always invoked in people, especially those who grew up in the 80's or earlier.

So either feasting on minds (and why Clara, she wasn't extraordinary until after she took some knowledge back from them?) is part of the Silence's plan or records of his existence aren't really gone.  

Personally, I think they used the erasing of all record of the Doctor as a way to close the Silence story and then they moved on and it's much easier to make him seem bad ass if every bad guy in the universe knows he's bad ass so they just chose to ignore a bit of recent history.

It was done too soon in one fell* swoop and with no replacement.  These communities had nothing to turn to because mining was all they had, but she didn't care and chose to not provide anything for them.  These are the 'facts'

Anyway - I don't hate Thatcher because I wasn't alive to form an opinion of her.  What I can do however, is sympathise with those who don't want to glorify her after her death.  I don't agree with the attitude that everyone should have to pay respect and forget everything **she** did (because she could have done things differently to soften the blow) now that she is dead.  Some of these towns have never recovered and neither have the people, to be suddenly told to forget all that seems very wrong (of course I don't condone celebrating publicly either, especially from those who have simply been told what to think of her).

It may be true that the unions had too much power and these industres weren't making money but you can't deny that the way they were sold off and shut down did in fact destroy lives.  This was something Thatcher could have affected - but of course she chose not to because she was the 'iron lady'; it's every man for himself out there so lets not help out those old mining communities because it doesn't benefit us Tories in the south.  Besides there's 'no such thing as community'.

- I do have respect for Thatcher in that I in some ways admire her intentions and how she set out to do what she thought was right. I'm more against the government at the time (I doubt all of the controversy of the miners and the shady business with the Faulklands were entirely down to her) and 'Thatcherism' in general.  It also really does seem a shame what it (apparently) did to community spirit and that I'll never see how things were before.

He's a Championship winning manager (fun fact: if this comes off, we will have had the title winning managers of 10/11 and 11/12 consecutively) who took Reading from mid-table relegation flirters to consistent promotion challengers. That's exactly what we need.

I did write a critical post on him a while ago, but my views softened almost immediately when I looked around and saw that the other realistic options involved taking on someone like Owen Coyle, who is even more of a gamble. So I've been almost completely sold on the idea of McDermott taking over, but the Andrew Hughes interview ensured my full support, as Hughes spoke about how McDermott is, in his opinion (having played for Reading while he was around), tough enough to handle the Leeds job.

This is far preferable to continuing with Redders, who seems defeated already, I must say. McDermott will be able to get a look at the players in meaningful games, he hates Michael Brown (think Reading away last season), and actually plays with wingers.

That said, i think Real will look at trying for a ""big name"" coach, i think they will look at AVB and Klopp and settle on someone like Ancelotti for a short term period.

Other thing to keep in mind is...will AVB want to move? I'm not saying that he wants to stay with us forever (though i would have no issue if he was with us for year and years to come) but following Mourinho puts alot of pressure on any coach but being the ""protege"" of Mourinho really puts pressure on you and puts you in his shadow, everything you would do would be because of the work Jose did before he got there.

Tottenham have been unsuccesful in securing a long term replacement for Berbatov since his departure so many years ago.

Due to Levy and Lewis's rigidity in terms of their financial goals, we have largely purchased strikers who don't fit into our desired category. Cacafogo is right, between them last season, Ade, Defoe and Dempsey scored quite a few goals. Having said that, did anyone realistically believe that Dempsey could be the player that would push up into Champions League football and then give us the firepower needed to be a European force again? I doubt it. Did we ever really believe that when IF we are to secure Champions League football again, Defoe will be the type of striker we need? Again, I doubt it. While yes, we've purchased strikers and some of them have had very impressive stats, stats and goals aren't everything. We've known for a while that we need a better class of striker and it just doesn't seem to be coming.

I agree with almost everything you have said. However, I don't think this is all that true.

It dominates the beauty and fashion industries, both primarily focused on influencing women's spending. 

What I find even more fascinating, is these idealized measures of beauty  designed to target women don't seem to line up with what men find attractive. This is noticeable in the difference between models chosen for magazines like [Sports Illustrated](http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/722/442/KateUpton2013SportsIllustrated_t653_original.jpg?1360710786) versus magazines like [W](http://www.trendnista.com/images/2010/nov/coco-rocha-for-w-magazine-0.jpg). 

Please don't interpret this as trying to refute any of your other points. It's just something I find interesting. Women are constantly bombarded with overtly sexual representations of what they ""should"" look like in order to be considered beautiful (for men?), but those images don't seem to correspond with the reality of what men seem to find the most attractive.

I gave up half way through as this seems like a very biased and prejudiced account totally lacking in what I would call balance. I don't think all her supporters were mindless victims of her conniving.

I'm too young to know what life was like before hand or what direction britian could of taken.  My dad worked in education ( as I suspect you mum does )  and hated Margret thatcher as his income was cut relatively. I've met people who say the unions needed cutting back ( in fact people I know on the continent complain how hard it is to get things done today with unions around )  and I've met people who say she took jobs away from the north and never replaced them.   But MT didn't exactly inherit [a perfectly working system.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent).

* The scarcity of housing is not just a factor of the housing sell off. Higher divorce rates, more people living single lives, moving out of home sooner, less people ""staying at home till they get married"",   more people having second homes  have all contributed to a massive increase in demand and yet the space available for building has barely changed due to green belt laws.  In fact the housing price boom started under a labour , blair government with changes in the letting laws - the buy to let boom was a blair thing.  To lay the blame for ""creating an almost continuous housing bubble, based on scarcity"" purely at MTs door is factually wrong. 

* And if you are going to criticise her take on the hunger strikes why not consider this quote from MT
""Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims""  [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_sands)

Remember that these KILLERS and Killer enablers were striking for treatment above that of the ordinary criminals because they thought their killing was justified. Drop the romance.  The IRA killed a lot of people. 

* ""Meanwhile, she had given her personal support to the fascist, Pinochet, and the apartheid regime in South Africa.""

Both very bad governments but there was a cold war and they were picking what they believed was the least of two evils. It's not like the Soviets were perfect. But then academics always seem to brush soviet crimes aside. 

* ""It didn’t matter that she had no other woman in the Cabinet. Clearly there was none good enough""

small pool of women to pick from not a factor at play?

* Norway has large oil revenues spilt between 5 million people ( [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway) ) britian has it split between 60 million people. It's hardly comparable when cash is spread 12 times as thin. 

* British Steel, British mines, British shipbuilding were all open to international competition which without privatisation might have meant either joblosses - with stikes and sympathy strikes or subsidisation.  British telecom was about to get a massive efficiency gain through modernisation and new equipment which would have meant job losses that the state probably didn't want to be held responsible for. Also ship building and steel were never highly profitable and could hardly be called ""the family silver"" and government still gets revenue from gas and oil comes from the taxes levied on them.  

Overall I think that this must be very one sided as there is a willful ignorance of basic facts.  This piece of sociology seems to meld a pseudo psychological profile with a politically biased rant and call it  sociology.   I mean has your mum interviewed people who liked thatcher?  Has she listened to both sides of the debate? Is she actually researching objectively or just getting something off her chest?   I know thatcher wasn't perfect and I can't comment objectively on whether she took the right path or not. However at least I try and look at things from both sides. If your mother is an academic perhaps she should do the same.  As a one sided polemic this is great but as an over all picture I find it very hard to believe it's complete.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8965405/Belgrano-was-heading-to-the-Falklands-secret-papers-reveal.html

TL;DR - belgrano was going to attack the falklands. britian knew because they had broken the cipher. 

&gt;She personally approved the Hillsborough cover-up

Citation needed. Also she did NOT order the deaths unlike bin laden. She would have most likely covered up to prevent riots. had riots occurred they would have had to be put down by the police. Not a good situation and would have probably caused more deaths.

&gt;assassination squads that killed IRA terrorists

&gt;she resolutely refused to come to any arrangement to prevent the deaths of the Maze hunger strikers

so on one hand they are terrorist of the republican army and  should be treated like soldiers during prisoners of war ( which what they were striking for ) and not common prisoners BUT when they are killed they are ordinary citizens and not soldiers in a war. It seems like you want to have your cake and eat it on that one. 

besides  out of all the IRA people they could have killed they must have chose these for reason. It wasn't like we ran death squads.  Perhaps the assasinations would have prevented further death.

Oil is it's still bloody high. $ 100 a barrel compared to $40 about 10 years ago. 

----------------

As for high oil prices when you are both a consumer and an exporter - yeah it's a mixed blessing.  The problem is unless you sell at a subsidised price to the population then the although the oil industry makes money the exports bring in money ( good for domestic demand ) but push your exchange rate up ( bad for exports and your domestic makers have to compete against cheap imports). If your country is buying at an unsubsidized rate they are paying a lot for energy AND competing against a high currency ( the imports are relatively cheap and your exports are expensive  ). 

In fact economist call the natural resource causing a decline in manufacturing the dutch disease.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_disease

It's a debatable phenomena but oil and it's effect on the economy is complicated especially if you are a consumer and an exporter.  But basically in Britains case the high oil prices were great for the oil industry but manufacturing probably suffered against cheaper foreign rivals.

I think if you choose to follow a profession where your actions, your personal actions, can have such a lasting impact on so many millions of people you cannot expect to have those impacts (and the feelings they cause) wiped from you. You need to be responsible. 

She ruined people’s lives. Whether or not it was for the better overall people suffered misery under her. Her death is symbolic for the passing of that time, and people are going to voice their thoughts on that.

If Hitler (I know, Godwin blah blah) did not kill himself but was, lets say, imprisoned and then finally died 20 years later, many people may and would have celebrated that fact as well. It was be unlikely for people to say ""oh, but he is an old man now, this is not nice"", because to the people who suffered he would always be the cause of that pain.

The rest above is North. The best part.

It's good when a politician believes strongly that what they fighting for is the right thing and they have the guts to try and make it work. I think in this respect people of all political view points are usually on largely unfounded and unexplored grounds. I don't think there are any social or economic models that are completely fool proof or without failings and it usually takes many years to discover the more subtle and wider effects of policy, therefore we can't be sure about political ideas until they are tested. Then again some 'political experiments' are often more obviously reckless and dangerous than others with sometimes severely devastating social effects. Given that, I think it's important that strong leaders like Thatcher, yes have the courage in their convictions, but also be ready to listen to criticism and to critically evaluate their own policies without simply not giving any fucks. I think that can be a real danger with some politicians when it comes to their ideologies.

Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;

Or close the wall up with our English dead.

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man

As modest stillness and humility:

But when the blast of war blows in our ears,

Then imitate the action of the tiger;

Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,

Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;

Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;

Let pry through the portage of the head

Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it

As fearfully as doth a galled rock

O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,

Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.

Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,

Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit

To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.

Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!

Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,

Have in these parts from morn till even fought

And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:

Dishonour not your mothers; now attest

That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.

Be copy now to men of grosser blood,

And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,

Whose limbs were made in England, show us here

The mettle of your pasture; let us swear

That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;

For there is none of you so mean and base,

That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.

I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,

Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:

Follow your spirit, and upon this charge

The worst thing about all of this is how ignored people with misgivings are being treated not only by the media but also by many Britons. Look on Reddit, plenty of people complaining about how annoyed they are that Thatcher's death is causing controversy in terms of certain reactions (""Waah, look at all these people talking bad about her, tut tut tut, leave her alone she's dead""). Some people have a right to be annoyed. Just because you or me weren't affected doesn't mean others were. There isn't any kind of representation going on here.

It's a shame the British media and government have been so biased about her death. She is being celebrated as possibly the greatest Briton ever, even by so-called leftist parties like Labour and the Lib Dems. That's massively unfair. This is all going to backfire on Labour and the Lib Dems, not that the Lib Dems haven't already destroyed themselves.

I dunno about anyone else but I can sympathise with people that got fucked over by her. It's a shame the entire system and possibly the nation is set up to marginalise them, even when they're significant in number. No doubt if any protests arise at the treatment she is getting they'll be hounded as sore losers, terrorists, vagrants, dumb poor idiots, stupid northerners etc.. by the national media.

Especially the BBC, they've really let themselves down in terms of their massively pro Thatcher bias.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;It started with massive austerity and streamlining of industry in order to get the competitive and in the euro, plus they now benefit from the euro in that they are able to export at very competitive rates. Granted, there is better attitudes between management and labour, but that is a two way street. They did not have a winter of discontent. They did not have coffins lying in the street. What you want can now be achieved if we want it to, but only because Thatcher broke the monopoly of power the unions had over Britain.

You're confusing two periods in history. Germany in 1970-1989 and post unification Germany. Those are two different things. 

Germany from 1970-89 had nothing to do with the Euro. Germany 1970-1989 had a much smoother transition from mass heavy industry to what it is now. This was because they ran their industry in co=operation with large unions such as IG Metal. Thus it did not START with massive streamlining. It was managed transition with for a lot of the large heavy industries. 

They also had a decentralised financial sector that was based around local federal banks which were committed to working with industry in partnership. 

One could say that the UK never really had those two things, labour relations were antagonistic and Thatcher made existing tensions erupt into outright warfare. Banks were centralised around London and once the finance industry was unleashed it operated globally rather than locally. 

We could have managed down the crisis, and slowly transitioned our industries into a position where they were smaller but existed at a sustainable level. The idea that ALL of our industry was unprofitable and ALL of it had to have the forces of monetarism unleashed on it  is pure fiction. Germany proved this by being able to maintain three wholly German companies in the Auto Industry, steel production till the late 1990s and other industries. Even Italy managed to keep hold of FIAT and keep it ticking over somehow. 

Germany post-reunification went through large amounts of spending on the east and by the early 2000s started carrying out major labour relations reform. THIS is where the Euro helped Germany.

So when he lost Amy and Rory, 11 felt like he needed to redefine himself. In a way, he regenerated without regenerating. His personality has changed quite a bit, he is no longer as aloof. He's a lot more open and honest; he wouldn't admit to Amy that he had ever been a father and on his first trip out with Clara he openly admits to having a granddaughter.

Maybe I was just too heart-broken over David Tennant leaving the show, but while to fully enjoy Doctor Who you have to have to be a little whimsical and ""out-there"", I found that not only did the plot start getting ridiculous (the whole Amy, Rory, River bit was beyond weird for me), but Matt Smith doesn't do a good job of being both the witty, smart-mouthed savior of universes, and the angry god of righteous vengeance and level-handed justice.  Sure, throughout the story they've tried to paint the doctors growth away from this ""character"", but it was what made me love Doctor Who and David Tennant was amazing at it.  


As for the story style, I fully agree that the 9 and 10 style production of independent one or two part episodes was fantastic.  You don't always have to watch them in order (which honestly for me gives it more of a time-traveling feeling because they're generally non-sequential).  Also, I feel like part of the Doctor's persona is that he's constantly tumbling from one grand adventure to the next.  Having all the episodes subtlety linked for the finale naturally creates awesomeness and only makes me want to re-watch all the season to see what hints I can catch.  Having each episode lead to the next kinda kills any of this... In the same breath, while the episodes are loosely linked, the focus becomes less on how some plot issue is going to be resolved but more on the journey.  Sure the season finale wasn't always AMAZING, but that wasn't the point.

Politics is not a process independent of wealth. The backgrounds of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dictated their belief in growth and social mobility. Thatcher's background motivated her belief in the market. Cameron, Osborne and Boris Johnson being former Bullingdon Club members means they will callously scapegoat the underclass and the disabled for a crisis that their friends in the financial sector created.

Had our trades unions shown some restraint, so might we.

Before Thatcher came to power, there was such a thing as ""sympathy strikes"". One union representing one industry went on strike, another union representing a totally different - unaffected - industry could (and often did) call a strike. The unions also had power to call strikes without a ballot of their members, and when they were on strike they'd essentially bully anyone who wanted to work into joining them. Meaning that even if 70% of coal miners thought there was no point in going on strike, they'd still do it.

It's not as if Thatcher simply took one look at coal mining and steel working and said ""Close it down"". There had been repeated attempts for many years to modernise the nation's industry and those attempts inevitably would have meant reducing staff and increasing efficiency. Every time the subject was raised - down tools, everyone out.

The options facing British industry were simple: Compete on a global market - which will mean changing how the business operates, whether you like it or not - or die.

There was no ""Carry on as you always have done"" option; that was synonymous with ""die"". But that's precisely what the unions were demanding.

We can say with the benefit of hindsight that maybe a 5 or 10 year modernisation plan would have saved those industries, but how do you put such a plan in place when every time you open your mouth to discuss it, all your staff walk out on you?",0,1365670615,null,0,false,0,c9cxkqy,t3_1c35vq,t1_c9cxkqy,t1_c9cm9zf,null,1431596860,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

If any of the nationalized industries that were closed had in fact been profitable, private companies would have entered the market to resume operations. Gaps in the market are always closed where potential profit exists.

&gt; Germany proved this by being able to maintain three wholly German companies in the Auto Industry

Can you specify three **nationalised** German auto companies? Or were they, in fact, private companies that would have eventually closed operations if unprofitable?

In other words... it was just 10-15 years after Thatcher closed the UK steel mills that Germany was forced down the same path. That's the time period for an industry winding down resistively, but winding down nonetheless. If anything this just strengthens the argument that Thatcher simply accelerated an inevitable demise instead of allowing it to drag on and drain another decade or two of national subsidies.

Yes the line does have to be drawn somewhere. Someone needs to weed out the bull shit.

Papers tend to be short on information period. Or they cherry pick it support a claim.The other day the daily mail was saying we are spending 90% of GDP but we are really only around 70%.

If I had to read a paper it would probably be the times. Right now it's a mix of all of them online.

The British coal industry was unprofitable, and only continued because of government subsidy.  Margret Thatcher's crime (in the eyes of the coal miners) was to cut them off from that subsidy.  If it had been the fantastic industry the miners claim it was, and would still be, then it would have been able to pay its way on its own.  Equally, if was just lacking management, it would have been able to find a private buyer who saw the potential to make some money.
