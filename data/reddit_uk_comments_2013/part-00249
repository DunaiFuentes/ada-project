That's the areas I'd ideally like to improve on. As in there are substantially better players that could fill those roles. I'm sure there's a better number 10 than Coutinho, but considering his age I think he deserves to be there. He could easily become of the best in the league in a few seasons.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; I remember the insurance company my mate worked for, they were always having skips delivered and just piling tens of thousand pounds worth of PC equipment in with no care.

Large companies also do this.  IBM orders all of it's machines from IBM (now Lenovo) as you'd expect.  However they can/could only order the standard bundles that anyone else could unless there was a massive amount of additional paperwork done.   So in comes pallets of TFT displays and another pallet or so of inkjet printers none of which are needed.

The manager who ordered the machines can't give these things to charity without sign-off from significantly further up the food chain, which would get him/her noticed in what IBMers consider a bad way.  You as an employee can't help yourself to these unwanted items, it's theft of company property.  

What the manager could authorise was a skip and a couple of people from Johnson Controls to smash every display with a hammer and throw it in the skip.  Then hose them down.  All under the watchful eye of security to make sure nobody takes anything.

This is only logical! Considering they are showcasing this specific episode in cinemas and there WILL be people going there who have got no clue about the series at all, this is their chance to get even more people interested in Doctor Who. 

My advice is: Don't try to catch up on what happened before. If you try to watch only ""The Name of the Doctor"" (the latest aired episode) you will spoil a HUGE part of the current series for yourself (not to mention that, if you want to understand The Name of the Doctor, you would have to watch even more before that) if you decide after the 50th, that Doctor Who is worth your time, and you want to continue watching it. Go in there completely blind. If you enjoy it, start catching up, watching the series in its whole, and AFTERWARDS watch ""The Day of the Doctor"" (aka the 50th anniversary) again to see how different it is from the first time, now that you understand all the references.

""Consensus reality"" is built on trust.
I know of people who opted out of consensus reality and decided not to use social feedback in their thought processes. They are not happy people and doctors force them to take neuroleptic medication.

Anyway I am not that busy but the world is exceedingly complex. I would say I am of average dumbness. I enjoy thinking a lot, I see no way out of the necessity of trust.

If I read something on the BBC I generally assume the facts are more or less correct, if I read something on Press TV I don't feel I can make the same assumption and if I read it on the Blaze.com or SWP.org.uk I assume it's heavily manipulated (or even outright not true) to serve an agenda.

When I go on the ONS website, I figure they are telling the truth when they describe the details of how they came to their conclusions and the methods used for collection.

If I buy some tobacco from a small dodgy looking corner shop with bongs in the window I don't trust that they bought it through legitimate channels. If I buy the same thing at Tesco (which I generally dislike) I assume they did go through legitimate channels because I doubt their legal department would let them do otherwise.

When we're talking about ""the government"" I don't even get it. There's a tonne of bits of government, they all do different things and have different agendas.

When talking about ""spy agencies"" which everyone is overreacting about lately - honestly, I watched the questioning thing, nothing they said was untrustworthy per say. There was not much rigour to the questioning, but if there had been it would have been all answered with ""I can't talk about that now but I'd be happy to discuss it in closed session"". 

I never really got any of the fuss about this topic to be honest. I want ""total electronic penetration"" - because to me the alternative is the equivalent of having police no-go areas online. OK the intelligence agencies are not policing agencies (and a good thing to!) but if something is inaccessible to them it's most certainly inaccessible to the police!

Anyway, I am a pretty cynical person by nature, but I think that an assumption of distrust is a very dangerous position to take because it becomes its own self fulfilling prophecy. Most people and most organisations are not inherently malicious. Lots are selfish, few are malicious. Selfish people can build up trust in situations of mutual self interest in which there are many. Automatic distrust prevents the seeking and development of opportunities in which mutual self interest holds, it means assuming ulterior motives and prevents successful co-operation.

I actually feel that low trust is probably one of the biggest social ills of our time (although I think it's an effect not a cause). ",0,1385026538,null,0,false,0,cdjjjzw,t3_1r2imj,t1_cdjjjzw,t1_cdj6tr3,null,1428569544,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I chose Canal House for the first one because it has a lot of seating (outside it was August 2011) and is easy to find.

For the next two I chose The Major Oak on Pelham Street based on feedback to have somewhere more central (i.e. more central than the canal house). But one time they started showing football and it wasn't that good so we moved on to Pit and Pendulum (no room for a large group) then the 2nd time I think we went to the Angel on Stoney Street. That was good that time as I recall but is a bit of a dive pub in some peoples opinion. 

The last one I did I chose The Orange Tree and booked the back room (which they roped off for free). I was only able to do this because it was a Thursday night. That worked quite well in my opinion because we were all in one room together. 

As mentioned I always organise them for week nights (in fact always Thursday) BECAUSE the town is way too busy on a Friday and Saturday night to have a coherent group (of strangers) meetup and socialise in a meaningful way.

1.  Cheques.  The issuer has up to 6 months to claim the cheque was written in error /under duress/stolen cheque book and get the money back.  A cheque clearing is not a guarantee that you won't be scammed. It costs about £20 to cancel an issued cheque; well worth it for a scammer getting substantially more than that in goods. 

2.  PayPal can and will usually find in favour of the buyer.  Great for buying crap from China, piss poor for selling stuff. 

3. Bankers Drafts.  The bank will charge for them to be issued and there are incidents of fakes being used.  However if it's not a fake then the money is yours when you've got your paws on it.

3. BACS/CHAPS transfers.  Banks will take an exceptionally dim view of someone trying to reverse these as the person sending money has to be present and directly authorise it.  Works internationally and the details they require is: Your name, your bank, your account number.  Not enough for someone else to play with your money.  CHAPS (same business day transfer) will cost extra though.

4.  Western Union Money Transfer.  LOL.  Fuck no.  Shouldn't see this outside of the US based scams.  Either way: LOL. Fuck no.

Now contrast that with a case where you voluntarily let this guy in your home and handed over the goods, albeit under false pretenses, then you can see they're less likely to be interested in investigating non violent stuff at the same relatively small value.

As far as PayPal are concerned the guy hasn't done anything wrong (they ruled in his favour) and would need the police to prove he committed a crime (something they can't do until they get the info from PayPal...quite the catch-22) and thus produce a warrant/court order before they hand over their customers details to a third party.

What cookie jar? What do you think they're doing? Is there any evidence for it? An assumption of bad faith is just as blind as an assumption of good faith...

&gt;I don't trust a government that illegally detains journalists, illegally detains and tortures suspects and constantly tries to erode our right to free protest. I don't trust a government that has to smuggle internet censorship in ""wont somebody think of the children"" laws.

You're acting like there is only one possible narrative here. Clearly that isn't true, the narrative you're speaking is only one of many possible narratives that can be superimposed upon these events. Of course within that narrative government is inherently untrustworthy - that narrative was purposefully constructed to make that point. But why would you pick that narrative specifically out of all possible narratives, why do you trust the pedlars of one story over another story?

Like you said, you're life has nothing to do with any of it, you're not involved, you don't know the people involved, you have no human anchor to make judgements by, you only have stories fed to you, and lots of people are selling different stories for lots of different reasons, the assumption that the narrative you bought is benign is no less blindly trusting than the assumption that the government narrative is benign.",0,1385031965,null,0,false,0,cdjkbkl,t3_1r2imj,t1_cdjkbkl,t1_cdjk1pq,null,1428569187,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Yes because 24 transit vans to carry the same load that one artic can is more efficient distribution. You would have a constant stream of transit vans throughout the day doing a total of around 200 deliveries to a single Tesco/Asda/etc supermarket to do what is achieved with 7 or 8 artics.

true,Tastecard,England,London 1980 Honda CX500,"Agree with this - Similar situation happened to me although I had fully comp. The bike was returned and I was quoted around £3.5K (Metropolis in Vauxhall, the vampires) to put it back to new. I did a bit of research and realized if I was happy to live with one or two scratches I could fix it all myself for £800, so I did that. 

I did tell the insurance company and they wanted to send someone to look at the bike, I told them I wasn't claiming and they said they would still send someone. I went along with it but didn't arrange a time. I spoke to a few people in insurance and they said they wanted to value the bike in case something else happened and then they only need to pay out the deflated cost. 

My situation doesn't really apply to yours but in the future when requesting a quote you are asked if you have any claims, not have you had a bike stolen. For me the cost of my excess and the subsequent claim was not worth the increase in premium. 

Remember that nothing an insurance company does will help you as the customer unless you are sold that as a benefit of the policy (hire bike, legal costs etc).

I would read the policy because there may be a clause stipulating that you need to inform them regardless. My insurance company knew because they were the first people I called after the police.

Congrats on getting it back though, I am told that in London there is a less than 5% chance of that happening to big bikes.

Just as an example take the NUFC match....In that match Eriksen was credited with 9 chances created....most chances created by any single player in a single game in the PL this season, well that sounds amazing.....but if you dig into the statistics just a little you will see that of the chances Eriksen (who by my account still played a good match) created 4 chances were from free kicks (actually this would partially fit into the lack of finishing but really fall under our complete inability to convert on free kicks for the past 3-4 seasons) and only 1 chance was incisive.

You can also take a look at our possession statistics, we have a huge amount of possession in every game....but we also have one of the highest % of passes to and between our CBs in the league which inflates possession figure but doesn't help progress our team in attack on the field.

So the stats from a top level can actually not tell the full story.  This doesn't change the fact that we aren't converting when we have the chance but it also doesn't change the fact that we seem to get to the 18 yard mark and stall out, our movement becomes poor and we have trouble opening up opportunities for our players to score, compound that with the fact that when we do get chances we don't convert and you see our over-arching problem....

Our attack is struggling to score and despite what eveyone says it isn't as cut and dry as a single issue that needs to be solved....we aren't finishing, we aren't creating as many top quality chances as you would expect and we are abysmal at set pieces (which we have been poor at for several seasons)...

So with some fancy Maths - 1% of smokers die from smoking.  Them's pretty good odds.  Does anyone know the percentage of people who die from driving every year? (amount of drivers:drivers killed in vehicle accidents).  I'll bet it's more than 1%

Reading a little further down from the first source link - 

&gt;About half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their addiction. 

So with 10 million smokers, 1% of which will die from smoking this year, there's only 4,900,000 to go.  At about 100,000 per year, it'll take 50 years for half of the smokers to die.  I think most them will die from old age before they die from smoking.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; I agree we have been poor at converting chances (really who can argue that we have been bad at finishing?).....but the stats may not tell the full story.

For sure the total amount of chances created dont tell the whole story however the clear-cut chance statistic was IMO the more intersting one which does help tell a lot of the story! The reality is that we have created a lot of good chances. Look at this video of the chances we created vs cardiff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUt5svWnBAk

A lot of good chances with extremely poor finishing. We simply should have scored more in that match as we should have in a lot of our matches this season if not for poor finishing


&gt; In that match Eriksen was credited with 9 chances created....most chances created by any single player in a single game in the PL this season, well that sounds amazing.....but if you dig into the statistics just a little you will see that of the chances Eriksen (who by my account still played a good match) created 4 chances were from free kicks

This is actually not relevant at all.. Think about it, the other contenders for creating the most chances in a single PL match since September 2011 (the record eriksen now holds) take their teams set-pieces aswell!! Mata, Cazorla last seaon and Ozil now for Arsenal, Silva, Rooney, Gerrard and Baines (Who was the the person who created more than 9 chances in a single game in September 2011)  all take their teams set-pieces too!! So it works both ways.

&gt; we have trouble opening up opportunities for our players to score

Evidently the stats tell otherwise however.. In the matches vs Hull, Arsenal and everton we had this problem however in every single other match we should have scored more if not for poor finishing. Also an interesting link between those three game is that Eriksen wasnt playing in any of them!! People are remembering those performances rather than the fact that in the vast majority of our matches our chance creation has being good",0,1385038563,null,0,false,0,cdjle48,t3_1r4rua,t1_cdjle48,t1_cdjl3du,null,1428568687,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Baines will need to start getting forward, I can´t be the only one who has been really disappointed with his offensive contributions since West Ham?

Thankfully we have no new injuries, and we have Altolin and Hibbo coming back, tho I strongly doubt any of those will play, so it will probably be the same XI from  the Crystal Palace game, with Barkley starting over Osman.

Liverpool doesn't seem to to have a leftback fit atm, so they will likely play 3-4 centerbacks, with either their LB or RB going slightly forward to create more of a back 3.

true,DrPubertybeard,eng-lancashire,Lancaster,"&gt;Reddit is meant to be a community of free-thinking, reasonably intelligent people who seek common interests, yet even this sub has turned into a circlejerk beyond the usual hivemind standard.

Firstly, Reddit isn't **meant** to be anything. 

Now, I haven't noticed examples of these credible anti-Labour articles being posted but that's probably more through my own deficiencies rather than me questioning their existence. I haven't personally noticed blatant political downvoting.

I don't particularly see any issue though with a general consensus being established in a subreddit for their political slant. I wouldn't go to a meeting of the local branch of the Conservative Party and then complain when they were mainly Conservatives; I would expect that.

And since there is a general political tinge to this subreddit, it would be natural to see these articles upvoted. If you only check out the top few posts which pop up on your front page then of course you're going to see the more popular political posts; but why don't you directly visit the subreddit rather than just waiting for posts to appear on your front page?

If you have issue with politics being in this sub-reddit, then campaign for the mods to remove allowing political posts.

Plus, rather than throwing a strop; why don't you try contributing the kind of things you want to see. Be the change you want to see rather than saying woe is me.",0,1385040651,null,0,false,0,cdjlu7t,t3_1r4ux6,t1_cdjlu7t,t3_1r4ux6,null,1428568478,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

it's not. paying for sex is a bit different though. and drug fuelled sex orgies with prostitutes is too. and, in the words of the rent boy who outed him ""He seemed to be using his status to get young men off their heads for sex.”

yes, not that that's any of your business. but i didn't pay for it, didn't pay for it with co-op money, didn't do it with multiple rent boys who I'd got off their heads, and wasn't the head of a multi-billion pound bank at the time, or a methodist minister, or on the board of a drugs charity.

De Bruyne is a player that needs games &amp; confidence to perform, which is clearly showing now, but everyone who knew the guy knew that this would happen if he'd get benched.

Basicly, KDB was told by Mourinho specificly that he wanted him to stay &amp; that he'd have a position in the team. After that KDB has a great pre-season and is a starter in the first PL game of the new season. He's instantly awarded MotM.

The next table game, away on manu, Mourinho tries a weird strategy with 4 attacking midfielders. The entire squad plays poorly, but apparantly it's all KDB's fault since he gets benched the next game and doesn't get off it anymore.

He was a moderately successful pop star, you'd hardly expect him to be poor unless he blew it all on drugs and high living.  In fact, certainly in his heyday, he used to insist on maximum prices for his albums, which may have been a gimmick, but it was more than most of his contemporaries did.  He's been involved in a phenomenal amount of activism, to what effect, who can say, but he's been on what I consider the right side of the argument considerably more than half the time.  Who knows what his tax situation is?  But I agree that I'd be surprised to find he was shirking that social responsibility.  Likewise, I've no idea how much he gives/does for charity, but then charity is broadly a right wing/liberal response to inequality and poverty, and is - at best - ineffective, and - at worst - counter-productive.  It certainly does nothing to change the system nor address structured inequality and inequity in society, so I'm not that interested in that aspect of things.

He's just been so alarmingly terrible it's hard to believe he was ever the confident and exciting player he showed the world when he was at Porto. I think we have a few other choices available but they will mostly make us change our shape again:

Could this mean a big chance for Flannagan?  At least until Kelly is fit enough to start? He was pretty reasonable against Arsenal, didn't make and big errors and kept his cool in the face of the pressure of that match.  He looked nervous and shaky going forward but more minutes can make him more comfortable on that end.  

Playing one of our CBs as a fullback really hurts our style when we play with 4 at the back because whichever flank he's on loses the ability to be dangerous going forward down the touchline.  Maybe a second personnel change is made and Sterling/Moses plays in front of the CB to bring natural width and pace back to that side, but who the do you displace from our attacking players to make room for that?

We may have to run with 3 at the back for a spell here and hope to reinforce in January.  That young spanish LB looks particularly enticing (his name is escaping me right now... the office is out of coffee :( ), it would be nice to see us show some ambition and chase a player like him.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"&gt; Wat. Source? The EU debate has been huge since entry into it (as the EEC) and the disastrous effect it had on the British car industry (among several others) that just couldn't compete.

What disastrous effect is that? Britain has done very well for itself both with and without the EU in this respect, largely owing to the fact that the UK drives on the left and so it's easier to keep right-hand drive production facilities in the UK so the end user is nearby. Cuts down on shipping costs. Not only that, but your contention is not in the least supported by the data in the slightest. 

The UK's greatest production year was 1972. [However, every year between 1996 and 2005 has been almost as high.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_Kingdom#Production_data) Furthermore, I find it somewhat ironic that this thread is on the front page of /r/unitedkingdom at the exact same moment as [""UK car production picks up pace""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1r4sf7/uk_car_production_picks_up_pace/), based on the BBC article [*Pace picks up for British industry and car production*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25030372).

Lastly, I'd draw your attention to the recent declaration from Nissan UK: ""Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC.""

I believe that if I had called up to complain about the cock-up and been a dick on the phone, they wouldn't have gone so far out of their way to help. The lady commented on the phone how refreshing it was to handle a complaint not entailing an amount of abuse. Good manners and politeness, even when someone else has messed up, will go a long way to helping, especially in regards to a relationship with your bank.

Picture, if you will, the year 2010 - it was summer, and I was working in Boots in Guildford for all of my sins. I looked out of the windows from the shop floor, longingly, and bathed my thoughts in imagined sunshine and fresh air.
Suddenly, a hand rested on my shoulder from behind. Startled, I spun around to see a mass, a beautiful white, gleaming mass of hair. Everywhere. As I begun to orient myself, I clocked the faux-fur leopardprint coat she was wearing. Intrigued and terrified in equal measures, I uttered ""Can I help you?""
In her hand, raised up to my face, there was a small tub of blush. She gave me a toothy smile, which showed poorly cared for teeth - this thought was enforced by the putrid smell that emanated from her oral cavity as she spoke: 
""Yes. Would you be able to tell me whether this blush matches my lipstick?""
My eyes widen in horror as I focus on her *bright red lipstick*. My mind screams at me, wonders - ***WHY ARE YOU DRAWING MY ATTENTION TO THAT PART OF YOUR FACE OH GOD***

I weakly tell her that yes, I think that the colour of blush matches okay. The rest of the conversation was a foul-smelling blur.

1. For those looking to mark titles as spoilers with the fancy tags, you add those tags AFTER you make your post (which is non-intuitive!).  After you submit the post, look for it in the community by clicking on the ""NEW"" view of the community (one of the menu selections near the top of the page), and then find your post (hopefully!) and click on the small gray bold text that says something spoiler like, which will appear on your post only, next to the text that normally says ""comment  share save hide report"".  (It's also where the NSFW tag is on some other communities.)

2. What if you want to link to a torrent that is totally legal, and related to Who?  For example, if I made a podcast/audio thing and I shared it as a torrent on the great public library in the sky, how would I share it without being automatically deleted by the Cyberman of Reddit?

3. There absolutely needs to be more than one discussion for these epic episodes coming up, because Reddit can't handle large discussions (you can't see the earlier comments generally).

Because it makes a really good sound bite. Yes, it's far more accurate to say:

The chemicals used in processing tobacco and inhaled, principally, by the person smoking it can increase the chances of cellular mutation in such a way that the mutated cell is beyond the bodies ability to terminate (i.e. cancer).

Well it's more accurate than Smoking causes Cancer at any rate.  But regardless that won't fit on the pamphlet in 72pt font will it? And you'd have to explain to people basic biology at the same time all the while they're nodding like an idiot and have a glassy look in their eyes. 

The list of things we ingest every day that's carcinogenic is really god damn long... and includes burnt food.   Although you've got to admit, the crusade to stop people Bar-b-qing in the summer is going to be hilarious to watch.

He was confident going forward and so powerful on the left.  Him, Fernando, and Cristian Rodriguez rolled United in the champion's league a few years ago in a very impressive display.  He was pretty well sought after when he was at Porto and for good reason.  He really looked like he could go on to become one of the best LBs in the world.  Once he left though, it all started going downhill.

At Lyon he was ok at best, especially compared to some of the other talent they had on display for a time.  He put in a shift there for quite a few years but I don't recall him ever looking like one of the standout players.  I can't help but feel like if you asked some Lyon fans what they think of him they'd say he was alright, nothing spectacular.

Valencia fans don't speak very highly of him.  They say he's insanely frustrating to watch and you can't really rely on him at all.  From what I've seen of his time there they're pretty much spot on.

Since coming to Liverpool he's done absolutely nothing to convince me he's a solid option at all.  He's only had bad games except for Fulham where he was largely uninvolved and invisible, probably more protected by how bad Fulham was than how well he was playing.  For me we need a more intelligent, energetic, and aware fullback on each flank than what Cissokho offers. Our fullbacks do a lot for our width going forward so having the ability to play that incisive pass and get in a good cross is crucial and I don't think he can do either of those things particularly well. He was great in Portugal and reaonable in France, then quite mediocre in Spain and now looks like he's getting run circles around in England.

Otherwise Walkabout is a good laugh and also affordable. Slug and 60M Postcards are a little pricey, but cosy.

Vodka Rev's can be a really good night, if you drink somewhere else beforehand, and it's the same end of town as Walkabout and Bar:Me.

A bit nearer the Landsdowne is now Orange Rooms which is quite nice, but a similar upper price range to Revs. 

If you're on a stag-do; then there's also 3 strip clubs - Wiggles (recently in the news for getting ""too close"" to patrons! haha), For Your Eyes Only and Spearmint Rhino. 

Some places like Walkabout will sometimes give discounts to Stag groups - find their Facebook page and send them a message! 

Along that same strip is a place called Camel and Taboo - both are naff, don't get tricked in. Camel is only decent if you want to keep partying past the typical 3am club closure, as they're open until around 6am.

If you want any more info, just PM me.

Well, I remember for Fylde that the alternative events were published side by side on posters with the ""going out"" events, so the option was definitely there. I imagine County would've done something similar? There was a big push from LUSU last year about making sure people knew that these options were available.

&gt;You said you can't debate with me because we disagree with each other

No. I said that we can't really debate because we have very different world views. That is far beyond anything as mundane as disagreeing about stuff. 

If you want to debate me you would have to let go of some of the fundamental premises of your reality and I don't think that's likely to happen as a result of a reddit comment thread, certainly not as a result of interacting with me. 

I debate with people who disagree with me all the time but if they have a very different worldview it might not be much fun or even impossible. Hence the comparison with someone who thinks the world is flat. I couldn't be bothered to qualify a bunch of ideas about the roundness of the Earth just in order to have a ""debate"". 


&gt;There was a time when I was honestly waiting for you to seriously back up the challenge you made to me...now you're just honest-to-god entertainment.

I didn't challenge you. Whatever I say to you is being filtered by your mind to mean something different. If that's entertaining for you, great, it's been worthwhile typing.

true,IntellegentIdiot,null,null,"I think charities get away with a lot simply because ""it's for charity"" is a catch all excuse for anything. Few of us question the value of our donation. I would like to see us get away from the idea of charity and think of charities as businesses who we pay to do a job. You're not donating to Oxfam, you're paying Oxfam to fix an unspecified issue in the third world.

I would ask two questions of any charity: How much actually goes to the cause and how effective is their spending? If only 30% of your cash goes to fighting malaria and you spend £20 per person you help, clearly it's not as good as a charity that spends 75% and only needs £5 per person to do the same thing.

A third question I discovered recently is: are they able to grow if they got more money? If the suddenly got an extra £5m next year would they be able to use it effectively? I found this on a site I stumbled across recently [Givewell.org](http://www.givewell.org/) which gives a very thorough breakdown in what it believes is important in selecting a charity and of the charities it recommends it gives a very thorough breakdown of what they do and why that's important and why it's effective. It's clear that the site is run by an intelligent and thoughtful group of people and even if you don't follow their advice it's food for thought at the very least.

Lastly, if your aim is to do maximum good, ask yourself whether there's a charity that could do more good with that money. Clearly most charitable causes are laudable than others. As nice as making a child in hospital feel good, saving a few lives in Africa is surely better?

true,TheMountebank,null,null,"PayPal and Gumtree are both crap at cooperating with investigations. Actionfraud are fairly useless too (they're effectively just a filter, screening out cases that won't go anywhere or are low value, and passing the rest on to local police). £500 is a lot of money to most people, but fraud is so common that anything under £1000 is generally considered ""low value"" and not worry devoting many resources to.

Chances are that this guy has provided false details to both you and PayPal. Unless he does this kind of thing a lot (enough for Actionfraud or PayPal to notice the pattern), the  chances are he won't get  caught. 

I'm sorry to say it, but this might be a £500 learning experience. My abbreviated &amp; too-late advice is:
1. Avoid Gumtree. Hive of scum, villainy and fraudsters as far as the eye can see. 
2. Do your transactions on cctv. I know a guy who sold a lot of his stuff and would always hand things over in the local Sainsburys because they had good CCTV that would capture the buyer's face. 
3. Cash payments. Unless the payer is willing to wait a week or so after the payment is made via bank transfer, PayPal or whatever to get their products. Count the notes, examine the notes - be familiar with the security measures on them, a UV keyring costs about a pound and could save you a hell of a lot. The payer might be/act offended and I know we're British but £500 is more than worth a couple of minutes of embarrassment going through their bank notes while they harumph awkwardly. 

Good luck convincing someone to take up your case, and I hope you get your money back. ",0,1385052286,null,0,false,0,cdjq3wx,t3_1r4oc7,t1_cdjq3wx,t1_cdjjq3s,null,1428566415,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever the wanted to. You had to live- did live, from habit that became instinct- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.

They won't be watching everyone all the time. If you're a good citizen and keep your head down you'll be fine. But if at any point for any reason you get on their radar, they'll have a wealth of information on you. Perhaps they can find a reason to arrest you, more likely just something to blackmail you with. Most people have some secrets they wouldn't want to come out. And if this sounds a bit conspiratorial and far fetched, and you trust the government not to abuse this power, remember the government can change, in the future a more authoritarian government could come to power and the tools for oppression will already be there for them.

Certainly I think some people hope that is the outcome.
I am not sure it's the best outcome. People who have to pretend to play by the rules are much more constrained than people who have no such limitation even if they are not as constrained as the prima facie rules would suggest.

It also begs the question of whether there really is the kind of moral equivalency some like to suggest (I posit not really, but I also am not of the ""omg russia ebil"" school of thought or anything - they have different values, different values have different concrete consequences, morality is subjective ultimately).

The problem lies with while BR is the OVERALL boss, the academy is technically a separate entity run by different management (borrell and frank) and although their is mutual respect between melwood and the academy their is a lot of internal politics and disagreements, the academy is fully capable of managing and running itself so outside 'influences' on decisions are not always welcomed.. the last one I remember their being big drama over was when Rodgers brought in Neil to the academy in place of Steve (borrell and frank staff) that was already here. 

Now with Borrell and Frank gone BR has full control over the academy and Melwood and can develop and make changes to things however he see's fit, while I think this is a BIG gamble it's not entirely a career suicide mistake, he could end up improving things now that he can add his own influence and set the direction of development in whatever way he likes, he also no longer has frank and borrell to fight him on it either. 

only thing im really worried about is talent spotting, those guys had a real gift for finding the real deals from the hype and im still not convinced of BR's scouting abilities yet.

but dont make the mistake that he's not emotionally invested, he loves this club, loves the people and loves the city, everything he does is what he believe will improve the club. ",0,1385056659,null,0,false,0,cdjs3y9,t3_1r4p5k,t1_cdjs3y9,t1_cdjrheo,null,1428565482,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

I think we just have better players everywhere but left back.  I also think Baines is the best LB in the league though, so it would be awesome to have him.  Especially with the way our system allows our fullbacks to attack, it's perfect for him.  It's a shame to miss out on Lukaku but you can't really fit him in without dropping one of the forwards (or Coutinho) and I think Sturridge is just a little bit better than him.  Suarez goes without saying, he's the best player in the league.  Henderson is perhaps a little bit of a personal bias to pick him over Barkley too but I give the edge to Hendo, I think he's just a little bit more refined and rounded at this point.",0,1385056986,null,0,false,0,cdjs9c7,t3_1r5fhe,t1_cdjs9c7,t3_1r5fhe,null,1428565412,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

1) small claims court vs the scammer - This can be effective as long as the address/person is verified. And if they have money.

So now do I spend more and order them to court, or write my losses off? They don't always have anything to their name which makes retrieving payment difficult (unless they're working).

2) small claims court vs paypal - I think they'd need to have a UK registered address. I would argue its 50/50 if you'd win. I would argue that Paypal have not fulfiled their duties as an intermediary to ensure a diligent investigation process has taken place and thus are in breach of contract for not providing a fit for purpose service. Paypal may or may not defend it. Although they may have in-house litigation team I'd imagine they're measured on costs avoidance and simply settling at 50% would probably be good for both sides.

3) Chase the police to take action - Maybe cynical, but I rarely hear them chasing this sort of thing up unless the scammer has a pattern of fraud reported against them. But you never know..

Well I hope they come up with something (politically as well as scientifically and economically) viable that's not going to make stuff worse but... not like we've got a tonne of time left.

&gt;While discussing ethno-demographic issues, are you a subscriber to the sub-Saharan Africa time-bomb theory?

In a really harsh social darwinist kind of way I think generally speaking these kind of things sort themselves out in the end. Obviously the suffering involved is not good though. Like we have Attenborough saying ""don't feed them"" but realistically, even for the big powerful west food is not a limitless and priceless commodity. And food prices are one of the big things predicted for turmoil in general anyway.

Africa has a lot of actual resources, but it also has a lot of as yet undestroyed nature. ""Buisness as usual"" will probably lead to a much more exploited Africa and much less undestroyed nature. Short term population issues will eventually stabilise, those who didn't die will forget those that did.

&gt;Is it total madness that I've just considered that having tougher militaristic governments may be a benefit if there is a population crisis?

It's as much an effect as it is a possible solution. A negative feedback :P

When people dismiss these kinds of things as you're doing now, I've found they *normally*(!) don't have a full appreciation of how poorly we deal with rape as a society. I don't want to turn this into an essay and you can obviously do your own [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#United_Kingdom), but it isn't just that people don't want to hear songs that mention rape, it's that...

* numerous surveys suggest that rape is *heavily* under-reported because victims are scared of not being believed, ashamed of what happened, terrified that they're going to have to relive the entire experience multiple times with anything from a few to a courtroom full of strangers and worried that they're going to be accused of crying rape, of asking for it, of being a slut etc. etc. etc.

* numerous other surveys suggest that people's attitudes towards rape can be pretty varied (even that one wiki link goes into that) and that the fears rape victims might have that I mentioned in point 1 are not at all unfounded, and that due to fuzzy conceptions of what is and what isn't rape (blurred lines, you could obviously say), people can be raped without the rapist or their friends/peers thinking that rape has occured.

* the evidence also shows that the 'stranger in the bushes/dark alley' conception of rape only constitutes a minority of cases and that most rapists are known to the victims, if only from the night of rape when they met at a party, a bar (say, a SU bar) and alcohol/other drugs are often involved, making it much more difficult for the victim to speak up without being subject to all the nasty shit from point 1.

* it's a very difficult crime to prosecute even if the victim gets over all the hurdles so far, because barring obvious evidence of forced sexual contact/violence (which itself can obviously be passed off as rough sex/fetish/whatever by the rapist) or witness' (who might not be inclined to support the victim as per points 2 &amp; 3), it's mostly one person's word against the other. That makes conviction even more difficult, meaning guilty rapists can go free to rape again (one study indicates the majority of rapes are committed by a small minority of repeat offenders).


In light of this, it would obviously be good if we had more public promotion of healthy, evidence-based attitudes towards rape that encourage victims to come forward and tried to get the conviction rate somewhere above the ~1% (from report to full conviction) that it is now. And it would obviously be bad if a massively successful pop song contributed towards the warped attitudes from point 2&amp;3 and the fear from point 1. 

**tl;dr**: Now, having said all of that, I don't feel I'm in a position to say whether or this this specific song was worthy of being banned because I've luckily managed to mostly avoid hearing it, seeing the video, being involved in the controversary around it etc. So I'm not saying that this was the right choice, but I am saying that it definitely, definitely isn't 'completely moronic'. This is a really serious issue that doesn't really affect any other crime in the same way and it's worthy of debate, not dismissal (as you pointed out asking for responses rather than downvotes).",0,1385057129,null,0,false,0,cdjsbm9,t3_1r53xz,t1_cdjsbm9,t1_cdjpqhv,null,1428565382,-3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-3

Frankly the filtering on the site should be on par with or better than Monster of Jobserve.  I should be able to filter out positions that require a driving license (car, HGV, etc.), self employed positions, part time positions and obviously it also needs what industries to look in.  Even the twee little job points would let you filter by hours per week and industry yet the 'replacement' won't. 

It's also expected to deal with people who have various disabilities and long term injuries, so the rejection dropdown should have a ""Position is too physical for my capabilities"" and as it's regularly thrown military positions at me it needs ""Position not suitable due to beliefs"" in the mix as well.

They based their decision on the grounds that it was ""dangerous and unsafe for students"" which in my eyes is fucking ridiculous. 

It doesn't even mention rape (blurred lines) nor does it advocate it or the attempt of it so why these people have decided that it's such a pressing matter is fucking beyond me. In the song it quite clearly states that the girl is grabbing him in a sexual manner also so it's not just him doing typical ""uni lad"" behaviour. To say this is trying to resonate with a weird, steroid version of masculinity is a bit far IMO. It's a song about sex but I mean it isn't just those types of males that like to dance and have sex. 

I'll admit the video is a bit much but aren't all pop videos by both male and female artists? Isn't 70% of pop videos/songs now days just about partying and having sex? Lady gaga has topless men dancing in her videos and some of her lyrics are about her wanting to get wrecked by a guy. 

No ones forcing anyone to listen to the song and I think the fact that an overplayed pop song is a main problem for them shows that they've got too much free time, or they don't know what they're doing. 

As for nirvana I assure I am fan but regardless of what the song means these are actual lyrics from it; 

""My favourite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
I appreciate your concern
You'll always stink and burn

Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again""

Good song but I mean to the average listener what would you rather here? A sleezy but fun song that doesn't advocate rape or rape me by nirvana which says over and over again (regardless of meaning) ""rape me rape me rape me"".

true,squirrelpocher,num1,,"as a Heat fan I understand the concept of associating the last decade with Chelsea, but two things:

1) you don't ""buy players"" in the NBA. there is a salary cap everyone offered the same amount of money to those players, they chose miami for other reasons than money (in fact they all left money on the table. most players, at least they used to, chose chelsea/city soley for the increased money). not to mention the owner actually gives a damn about the team and doesn't fire coaches every 6 months.

2) this completely disrespects the Hardaway/Mourning Heat of the 90's that were always near the top of the Eastern conference in Wins.

a better example would be a team with a good history, even a championship, who stumbled for a few years, and then suddenly became world beaters (so if Leeds ever becomes dominate again, that might be a good comparison?) but I wouldn't say chelsea.

as for spurs in the NBA. in terms of how they run the organization it is definitely Daryl morey and the Rockets, in terms of personell/history I would go with the warriors, some homegrown talent with a few imported big names (Iggy/lamela).  plus both have a history of run and gun.

if we were doing this last year it would have been the Nuggets hands down. no stars just a depp good squad with a brilliant coach and a great GM (unfortunately the GM/coach left and so did their best player).

**The ability to escape from reality** This has got to be one of the coolest powers. So you watch TV, Movies and play games to escape from reality, but what if you actually could escape? What if you could become part of the game, show, film or book(if you like to read)? I imagine this would be similar to when people plan out interactions of scenarios inside their head, except you play a more direct role in acting out. You see, hear, feel, smell and taste everything about it. Anyone who appears in these realities would be the same as they would be in real life or they would hold the personality of whatever character they are. E.g. If you're in a world with The Doctor, it's actually the Doctor, an alien time traveller and not Matt Smith/David Tennant/any of the other actors who play him.

 They didn't even have the decency to watch CCTV footage, it was virtually impossible for anyone else to have stolen it since the plane was airborne for most of my journey.

The government and all its predecessors are one and the same thing, we live in a country where power is handed down the elitist generations and is inaccessible to the common man.  It really doesnt matter who you vote for, by voting, you are morally signing the ""terms and conditions"" of control.

Capitalism is power
Capitalism is greed
Capitalism is the cause of most corruption

It is the glue that holds our love for mankind on the stocks.

Im sure there are people more qualified than me to make suggestions on what should replace it but to briefly outline what I think.

An arachistic type state with a series of communities which ""govern"" themselves by use of the voice of the people.... think of living in a community where decisions are made by constant mediation or referenda...  in basic terms... people would go to local meeting once a week to discuss current events on ""policy"" or issues... and to debate and then vote on fundamental changes.

all these communities would work together when required for transport issues and trading requirements.  there would be no need for the word profit. just one gigantic middle class where success is no longer measured on property money and belongings but instead it is measured in love, love for one-another and one's self and of the course the love one's work.  there will be nobody in authority but there will be people of authority who have the right skills in order to manage the processes required but never to lead... there would be no higherarchial system of such.

I live in Yorkshire and there are three agencies I have worked for that have assessed my skills for temporary roles. These are Reed, Brook Street and Search Consultancy.

One card you could play, if you're willing to do it, is say you're willing to do call centre work. It gets you the administrative experience and the high staff turnover in most sites gives you a sort of advantage if you really want to get the experience in the office. The downside is that the shifts can be pretty ghastly. Some people really love that aspect though. However, having worked in a supermarket, you can play on how you have served customers in difficult situations in a face to face environment and stress how you can adapt this to a telephone environment.

I don't think it is impossible for you. I know people from a variety of backgrounds who have shifted into admin based roles, the only difficulty you face is the route you pick.

What I don't advise is that you just fire a CV into an inbox at an agency and leave it. You want to ring them up and ask to speak to someone who handles temporary administrative work or a temp controller as some sites call it. Try get an appointment to assess the skills you think are strong, like typing or Word/Excel. Talk to them about what you're looking for, do a bit of research into what the agency offers if you want, but you want to convince them that they will make money from taking you on and sending you out.",0,1385061349,null,0,false,0,cdju9kn,t3_1qrchi,t1_cdju9kn,t1_cdjkkxw,null,1428564476,1,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,1

true,ohiotech,sontaran,Sontaran,"The short description in IMGUR doesn't do the work justice. It is a short description because it is also carried over from my Pinterest, so a better explanation of the work follows....

I went to Hobby Lobby and...


*
Purchased a plain wine box.  
*
Some little wood strips for miniature doll houses that are used for making fake flooring. I used my own craft glue.  
*
Some miniature Christmas decor  
*
A couple of tiny jars with corks.  
*
I then went over to the section with the clay sticks and purchased a pack of blue clay.   
*
Some blue spray paint.  
*
Gold colored paper.  
*
And some glow in the dark acrylic powder I had... just laying around. Seriously, I did.  


I cut the lid down in size because I was able to use it as a faux base, as well as the actual lid to the gift box. I then cut the seam down the side of the wine box and cut out the bottom. In hind sight, I would possibly leave the bottom of the box attached to one side of the box wall for fit when closed.  


I measured and cut out the strips to make up the trim along the door frame and windows. I also used half of the gift card boxes and stacked them on top of the lid of the wine box; with the little jar on top filled with the glow in the dark powder. The blue around the jar is the modeling clay.  


Then I painted, and painted again. While paint dried, I worked on origami boxes for the gift boxes, molded the clay around the jar after I filled it, and made baby feet (explained below). I used a card stock for the gold craft paper, and each box contained a gift from someone in the family to my wife. Yes, those are edible ball bearings as a nod to Fear Her.  


I also went to the printer with some photo paper and made the windows, Police Box and Public signs. 


In putting it all together, I glued the boxes, one to each wall, to create somewhat of a cantilever effect, blue the beacon in place, and then wrapped it in the Christmas decor after I glued on the windows and such.

These pictures don't do it justice, and I promise to find a way to get better ones and add them to the album.

I've got some other Who stuff I'll be posting as time goes on. I just joined, and oddly enough my first post was a TARDIS emblem I created in the BF4emblems subreddit.


I like to think that it turned out pretty well. If I had to do it all over again, I wish that I had more time and I would have been able to add sound effects for when you open the gift box, and a diorama, but all in all... I won't be doing one of these again for a while. Oh, and the pink and blue baby feet? I found someone on ebay that created food grade molds of baby feet, went to Hobby Lobby and got some Candy Melt of appropriate colors, and made baby feet to fill clear ornaments also found at HL. Since my in-laws always call my two youngest kids Sugarfoot, I thought that it would go over well... and it did. But the cupcake was my fav.


Be well!

There is not, and literally cannot be, anything objective about the perception of art.  Perception of art is by its very definition a subjective evaluation.  You might not like Davies.  You might not like Series 3 and 4 (although how anyone can dislike the run of episodes between ""The Silence in the Library"" and ""Journey's End"" is beyond me).  You might think Moffat captures perfectly the essence of the show, and has perfect characters and have loved every moment of series 5-7.  You are absolutely entitled to that opinion, but making an ""objective assessment"" of a TV series is absurd.

What you mean to say is, ""In my opinion, Davies is by far the worse, and after Series 1 and 2 he just started writing fanfiction.""  Objective evaluations *require* a universal standard against which something can be measured.  There is no such universal standard for the quality of a TV series, proved by the simple fact that lots of people (myself included) disagree with you.  

An objective evaluation is something like ""Water boils at 100 C at STP.""  This is a fact.  It is repeatable.  It is an absolute physical property of existence which can be verified and repeated.  It is immutable and unaffected by opinion.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"You obviously didn't read the article, which said that only about a third of the population increase is due to net inward migration - the other two-thirds is simply having more babies born than people die. Furthermore, the rate of immigration to the UK is quite substantially lower than many other European countries, whose populations are still growing much more slowly than the UK.

EDIT: Also, third-world? Not really. Here's a breakdown of immigration in 2010 by country of origin:

1:  India (129,000)

2: Poland (62,000)

3: Australia (60,000)

4: USA (53,000)

5: China (52,000)

6: Pakistan (50,000)

7: France (40,000)

8: Spain (36,000)

9: Ireland (34,000)

10: Germany (30,000)

11: Nigeria (23,000)

12: Bangladesh (23,000)

13: Philippines (21,000)

14: Italy (20,000)

15: New Zealand (19,000) 

That's 652,000 in total. If we consider India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and the Philippines as 'third-world', that's a total of 246,000, or 37.7% of the total figure. I'm not counting China because there's no way to separate people from Hong Kong, who probably make up a large chunk of those numbers. Also bear in mind that over 300,000 people left the UK that year, so total net inward migration is around 250,000. [source](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/jun/26/non-eu-immigration-uk-statistics).

There's probably some wider economical reason behind this but I agree. 

Although I suppose if you have certain practical skills picked up from courses at college supplemented by your own interests (such as vehicle mechanic stuff) you can set up your own business. Once you have the practical knowledge you just need a place to work from so you'd look for units to rent if you had enough saved for a deposit, or try for a loan if you didnt. That's probably the easiest example though.

personally I'd say I'm financially capable of starting something small-scale, as I'm lucky enough to have a fair amount of savings and inheritance stuff. I wouldn't know where to begin with the rest of it through.

My Dad has his own business, but he's just self-employed. It started out from his hobby whilst he was in his old job. He used to collect postage stamps (my Dad is a fucking cool guy ok) and now he deals them to other collectors, buying and selling at a profit, advertisements in stamp magazines, etc. I showed him how to work the internet and now he sells like mad on eBay.

So sometimes they can work on the express track, and leave local open, but not always.  For example, I lived off the A line in Upper Manhattan, which is just a single track and they did a huge refurbishment of it, which required it to be shut on weekends and some late nights.  So what they did was run shuttle buses that followed the route.  I believe these were free.  

They try to get the most work done on the weekend, and it can be insanely difficult figuring out what is running and what is not, so they made this site: http://mta.info/weekender.html

Another good program they came up with was giving you weeks advance notice that certain lines would be closed 10pm-5am for a week to clean and fix that line.  That way they rotate the work around the city so affects as few people as possible.

I don't think that the perpetual strain caused by ever-more-outdated transportation and utility infrastructure is something we should be comfortable with. Whilst the quirks caused by streets designed for horse carts are certainly characterful, they're usually at least as inconvenient. As towns spread based on no plan in particular, estates of hideous and inefficient Barratt homes spring up, increasingly far from the amenities the residents need, cultivating reliance on cars. Roads designed to carry long-range travellers become part of the daily commute for thousands more than they were ever designed to hold. Widening schemes and underground piping and wiring upgrades lead to demolitions, homes and places built for socializing end up converted into ad hoc mini-supermarkets. The inner cities of 'organically grown' cities are often very nice for the people who can afford to live there, because that's where all the money is.

1) weekend running means 4 trains per hour, maximum. Imagine the congestion on the platforms when you've got a train every 15 minutes, and then imagine that but you are surrounded by drunken people shoving each other.

2) maintenance work is essential. So expect closures on the lines, frequently. 

3) 950 jobs are being cut, late night tubes will give an additional 200. If everyone is willing to change jobs there may be 750 jobs cut out of 5,500. That's a lot and that figure still relies on the fact that staff will be happy to take demotions and retrain completely 

4) Currently most tourists and people who aren't that technologically proficient or comfortable using a ticket machine will use the ticket office, leaving the passenger operated machines free for frequent users. Now think of the queues that you see at the ticket offices in stations like Victoria, Waterloo, Green Park, Kings X etc- they'll be using the ticket machines now so even if you don't need to use a ticket office, everyone who does is suddenly queuing in front of you during the rush hour peak.

A lot of those rises affect specific things like imports, capital gains, petrol, tobacco, etc.

For one, your personal allowance has gone up meaning you're now physically ~£593 better off than you were in 2010, assuming you earn over £9,440 (to get the full benefit, you'd still be better off if below) and less than ~£32,000 each year.

The government paid for most councils to freeze their council tax rates - effectively a cut at the rate of inflation thus 3-4% better off each year.

I think the NI payments have increased but not so much that they cut off the benefit of the personal allowance.  The same goes for VAT (which btw only really applies to things you buy after the things you need to survive upon which it's not really taxed - the effect being the richer you are the more you proportionately pay and vice versa)

And on top of this, capital gains tax increased from 18-28% for higher and additional rate tax payers - something that affects the rich, not the poor nor even middle (due to another personal allowance), in their investment, etc.

The reduction in corporation tax isn't something to help rich people as such - they don't put all their cost reductions into their wage - they also want to grow their earnings (and company) which often involves hiring more staff or paying certain staff more to keep them.

Ultimately, it's actually a complete fabrication that the poor are paying more in the current government.  They are in fact paying less and if you read the actual facts and understand tax it's not something that can be argued against.  What can be argued is they're getting less *overall* due to a reduction in services after the cuts.

It's also worth mentioning that the reason the poorer are more cash-strapped now is not tax but rather the anomaly that we have a lower rate of unemployment than we realistically should - what it means is that while there are less unemployed, those employed on low-wage jobs have had their hours cut so the work's being spread across more people.  That's the problem of the day, but of course it's much easier to ignore that simple truth and blame the nasty party's fabricated anti-poor tax policies rather than arguing for more on the wage front instead.

Who is paying is middle-earners, especially those who earn ~£35,000 due to income tax changes.  Surprisingly no one seems to give a shit about them despite making up the backbone of the skilled employment in this country.",0,1385066186,null,0,1385066373,0,cdjwj25,t3_1r4gvi,t1_cdjwj25,t1_cdjuo6d,null,1428563401,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,DeathByCocktail,,Rye Manhattan,"I started by selling books at car boot sales when I was 18 and a student (I'm pushing 35 now), buying cheap mixed boxes at auction through the week and selling at the weekends, often not going to bed after I'd been out clubbing. That said, I had some help as my parents are antiques dealers, so I already had a bit of an ""in"" to the industry- connections are incredibly important in my business. I did it on the side for a few years, along with uni and other jobs, until going full time in 2006, although I've had to diversify into antiques and collectibles since the arse all but fell out the market for everything except the top-end stuff a few years ago if you're not selling in massive volume. It was an enormous leap, as you suddenly lose your safety net and chances are any savings are tied up in stock. 

The last few years have been rough for the industry, and I've seen a lot of dealers sell up or retire early. There's also been an influx of people who have watched too much TV and tried to make a go of it, with no business sense or real idea about the industry, who only drive up auction prices for the items we used to be able to turn quite easily. That said, this year has seen an upturn and I'm admittedly lucky, in that my girlfriend is in a fairly well paid job, so we can keep doing our respective things even if it means we both frequently work 12+ hour days. I think that KayJustKay hit it on the head- you need to find something that you love and are good at, and then find your USP and figure out how to be the best you can at what you do. It's horrible and worrying at times but I've done the corporate management thing and would never want to work for someone else again if I could possibly avoid it.

I don't have the links to hand as I'm on mobile but there are some government schemes to help startups, and I've heard good things about them. Have a wee Google and see what's on offer.

&gt; Imagine the congestion on the platforms when you've got a train every 15 minutes, and then imagine that but you are surrounded by drunken people shoving each other.

It's from half past midnight to 5am, how bad can it be? It's hardly rush hour. If the pubs don't change their closing times, nothing much will change anyway.

&gt; maintenance work is essential. So expect closures on the lines, frequently

Right, like every night of the week, except Friday and Saturday.

&gt; there may be 750 jobs cut out of 5,500

That's efficiency. No point paying people that aren't needed.

&gt; Now think of the queues that you see at the ticket offices in stations like Victoria, Waterloo, Green Park, Kings X etc- they'll be using the ticket machines now

Hopefully the most touristy areas will still have ticket offices, everybody else will adapt. With auto top up there's no real reason for the 90%+ of travellers who are residents to queue up at all. Except the 20%, hopefully less? who can't afford having £10 taken from their bank account at random times and need to budget by hand.

This was about 3 years ago...ish. I make short film/video style things and I once dragged two of my friends up to a place called the Wenalt to shoot some little shitty thing, the Wenalt is a hill located on the outskirts of Cardiff. We used to go camping there every now and then, prime dogging area, dodgy on times but a good laugh.

[Here is the dogging site, looking down at the field.](https://maps.google.co.uk/?ll=51.541201,-3.222969&amp;spn=0.00452,0.008256&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.541302,-3.222996&amp;panoid=owkwv15LEHqa1k78Cw7fHQ&amp;cbp=12,230.04,,0,8.25)

So we walk up there and there is this clearing and normally it is empty, but this time there is this camp, and it looks oldie worldie and we were very puzzled, there were some portable toilets and two security guards in a car. We couldn't work out what it was and decided to set up camp the security guards didn't seem to mind so we just carried on. Now we are sat around, not doing much and we are trying to work out what this is, when one of my friends comes up with the idea that it is some really hardcore larpers and they'll come back, we'll join in on their celebrations and have some fun, he was a little off.

Anyway, cut to about 10 at night, and my friends, who didn't bring food, get hungry and walk back down the rather steep hill to the spar. So I am left there, bored and midges start to swarm, so I try to get a fire going, but the dead grass around is a bit wet. I try for about 30 mins when one of the security guards comes up to me and gives me a newspaper and I strike up a conversation with him. I ask him what it is and he says Merlin, no elaboration, assuming I knew what he meant. On this field churches and youth groups sometimes go there for event days and I thought, ""Merlin? Must be for some sort of youth group thing."" So I finish the conversation and build a fire, go to bed.

The next morning I hear this almighty BEEEEEEEEP like a fog horn that wakes me up. I stumble out of my tent and there are like 50 people all buzzing around a couple of lorries (one of which beeped us), loads of filming equipment and many people in costume. The guy in the lorry that beeped us said ""Sorry to wake you boys!"" and we packed up. Everyone was dead nice and no one was angry that we were there, and we hung round for 10 minutes and then went on our way.

It is absurd to me that one of the dudes who I tend to agree with the most out of anyone in this subreddit is such an asshole in disguise. Oh well. 

You seem to be very interested in my academic background on stats, so here it is: I've taken 2 different stats classes in college (a fundamentals and economics-centered one), lots of calculus, lots of economics. Accounting and finance too. I'm a numbers guy. That's my background. So don't patronize me by saying that I don't know what chances per minute means or say I'm American, whatever that implies. (I am). 

I know enough about statistics that you need to look inside the numbers and methodology. I believe they counted corners taken and FKs taken as chances. Eriksen botched 4 of them. So 4 of the 9 chances he created or w/e were bad fks or corners. He played well, I'm not saying hes bad. But he wasn't as mind blowing as the stat would suggest. You seem to be making the conclusion that Eriksen is playing on the level of Silva, Ozil, Suarez, etc this season, when the truth is that he isn't. Your defense is a questionable statistic, while mine is careful viewing of like 1200 odd minutes of Spurs play this season, some with him and some without. 

What I'm getting at is that this stat that you bring up would suggest that Eriksen is a savior of sorts. I'm simply arguing that he hasnt been that way entirely YET. No big deal, I'm patient. But anyways, something is off with that stat if it counters common sense about Eriksen.

Yes, as they counted chances created from set-pieces for the other people mentioned... And in fact The proportion of chances he creates from set-pieces are no more than Silva and less than Mata! His chance created from open play per minute are actually more favorable  towards the pro-eriksen arguement than the other...

Your defense is a questionable statistic, while mine is careful viewing of like 1200 odd minutes of Spurs play this season, some with him and some without.

I never said he was playing at that level!!! His general influence of games hasnt being as good as them (Actually it has beinfaround the)same as Ozil who has being very poor in recent weeks however the fact that there is a clear correlation between these great players and the stats created per minute stat and that Eriksen is among this group is telling of his class....

You think the French Gov is going to let it's Nuclear capacity walk out the door completely? 

State-onwership is a bit of  a red herring to be honest when it comes to organisational efficiency and running. There are always other factors that complicate an organisation and prevent profitability. 

In our case it wasn't the state-ownership itself that caused the problems - it was the poor state of our labour relations which manifest wider issues of identity, class and society ( which continue to this day) 

It was easy to blame ""state-ownership"" , but that really was never the problem. As EDF and many other organisations prove - a state owned firm can be just as profitable and non-state owned one. A firm like GM or Chrysler proves that if you do a terrible one of running the company being private ain't going to save you.

Contrast the adversarial approach to labour relations in the UK with the collaborative approach taken in - for example - Germany where they have two boards, one for management and one for the workers.

[""It is often wrongly interpreted that Scotland is subsidised by the rest of the UK, because public spending is £1,200 higher per head than in other parts of the country. However, on average Scots generate £10,700 per head in taxes compared to £9,000 per head in the rest of the United Kingdom, meaning Scotland actually receives £500 per head less than it contributes back from Westminster. Furthermore, in February 2012, the Centre for Economics and Business Research concluded that ""Scotland receives no net subsidy"" from the United Kingdom treasury.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland#UK_Government)

The fact that Scotland contributes £3 billion in defense spending but only get £2 billion back in contracts, and that Scotland is receiving a share of nation debt that, largely, is run up by England should also be taken into account, as well as various other spending that goes South; HS2, for example.

The Scottish economy is actually doing better than the rUK's. The Scottish government has been pumping money into the construction industry through urban regeneration, a lot of new public buildings and investment in industry. But in the rUK the economy seems to be held up by London's housing bubble.

I've already talked about my thoughts on the academy issue on the other post so I wont mention that here but on the Will Hughes issue of course he's going to say that, if he came out and said 'yep, were going for it full steam ahead' then suddenly all these other clubs would be like well we want a slice too! and start a bidding war with the only ones benefiting from it all is Derby.. also if we dont land him for whatever reason he then looks like a dick head.. 

he praised the player and gave a backhand compliment to derby for their good job of developing him, he said exactly the right thing.

right now we dont need him and he is at the right place developing, but we're planting the seed so when we're ready (if we choose) we have a lot more pulling power over other teams that may also be interested, this is all a game of chess and BR is 2 steps ahead.

EDITED FOR FORMATTING:


Brazilian tells Alyson Rudd of his love for the English game, his battle with the language and when to join the attack
As he enters the room, which has a glass-panelled door, his brother, with exquisite timing, nudges it shut so that Sandro’s nose is flattened. It is not the classiest arrival, but the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder does not mind. He grins. Indeed, Sandro is an accommodating chap.

He performs keepy-uppy in a confined space, he plays the guitar and sings for SoccerAM. He grapples with the concept of a dilemma for Sky’s Fantasy Football Club and then, when I eventually sit down with him to tell him that’s enough fun and games, let’s be serious, Sandro immediately stops smiling and gazes earnestly.

He must be a dream to manage. No wonder André Villas-Boas trusts him. This is a man who listens, who does as he is asked. When he was 12, the manager of his youth team told him to give up his role as the striker. This did not upset him because his knack of scoring for the team had vanished.

He had more reliable qualities in any case. Sandro was identified as a potential physical presence, one who could provide the space for other, more reliable centre forwards to score the goals. He was transformed from centre forward into a holding midfielder before he was even a teenager.

“I started as a striker, at 10, 11, 12, and I stopped scoring goals and my coach said to me: ‘Go to attacking midfielder’. Sometimes I would go back to mark and get the ball from the other team. My coach said: ‘You are strong, you are tall, you can play here, as a holding player’. And I enjoyed it, so I started to play as a holding midfielder.”

Sandro is pleased, he says, that it has become a fashionable position, that most teams feel the need to have at least one holding player.

“We have to have one guy to fight, to protect, to say to another player: ‘You can attack.’ The other player doesn’t have to worry, it allows other players to be more free, to enjoy the game. They know if they lose the ball someone will be there.”

Sandro joined Tottenham from the Internacional, the Brazilian club, in 2010. There was a buzz around his arrival, but it took a while for Harry Redknapp, the Spurs manager at the time, to make him pivotal. Sandro was confident that he was in the right place, the right league, but he had to adapt.

“First, I love the way the Premier League is played: it is stronger, of course, than in Brazil. I love this way. I prefer to come to England; I thought for me it would be great because I want to play strong. If I play in Spain, if I do something it is a foul. But here it is not, you can play and enjoy more the game.

“It was hard in the beginning as there was a lot of difference to Brazil. In Brazil, there is more passing and here you have to take the ball and go forward. Football started here; it has a lot of history. I love it. When I was in Brazil I watched a lot of games, so I was expecting it, but when you are here it is harder than it seems on the television. I learnt step by step, game by game. Now I am confident with the [English] style.”

The partnership that usually looks the most flexible in the Spurs midfield is when Sandro plays alongside Mousa Dembélé. It probably works so well because of the lack of conflict. Sandro knows his place.

“Normally he [Dembélé] would go forward, he has more confidence with the ball and could score the goal. I sometimes go, but it is not my job to go; it is my job to help the defenders. Automatically I stay [back].”

The word “automatically” is the only one for which he turns to the translator for help. Sandro grapples with the English language in the same way as he approaches a football match: it is hard work, he has to concentrate, he keeps it simple, but does not give up when the right vocabulary is not immediately accessible.

Is his role in the team a cerebral one? “Of course, all the time you are thinking. I have to think all the time: ‘Oh my God, this guy will run this way’. So I have to think fast, I have to go the ball to make a tackle to clear my area. I prefer playing with the 4-3-3. I stay in the middle to protect and have two guys to pass the ball to. Sometimes I go [forward] as there is protection.”

On Sunday, Tottenham face Manchester City and there is no need for Sandro to try to use “dilemma”, his new-found word. The plan is clear-cut.

“We have to go there and not be afraid,” he says. “We have good players, so we do not have to be afraid. Tottenham could beat anyone. We have to think of ourselves as a top team and be fearless.”

*Two neighbours who in live in other flats in the building — who the Telegraph spoke to alongside the MP yesterday — both said that it was the first time they had met her.*

*Several neighbours were familiar, however, with Miss Tonks, a marketing expert who works for Kids Industries, …  She was ill in bed in the flat yesterday and did not answer telephone calls.*

*Challenged by The Telegraph as to why Miss Tonks was apparently living at the taxpayer-funded apartment, Mrs Main confirmed that her daughter paid no rent and insisted that she stayed there only “two or three times a week”.*

*Miss Tonks, who has kept the surname of her late father, appears on the electoral roll at the St Albans property and, in 2008, registered the address with Companies House when she took on a directorship with Kids Industries. By law, addresses lodged with Companies House must relate to the “usual residential addresses” of the director.*

This Flowers guy seems to have been sacked for having had porn on an employer's computer, or at least he was known to have had porn on this computer at some time. 

It's the act of having smut on an employer's computer that he's being censured for, not the act of possessing it alone. 

Having said that, I do think the emphasis on the *gay* adjective is pretty dodgy - what difference does it make if the porn is gay or straight? The only question is the (in)appropriateness of having it on a laptop supplied by an employer.

I rather feel like the emphasis on the gay nature of this smut is prurient - it's the sort of distinction that was important back in the 80's, or whenever it was that it was still illegal to be gay.

They're lucky they haven't been kicked out altogether. The rest of the club are banned for two weeks and have been pulled out of this year's Varsity fixture, which is basically the highlight of their year.

General consensus seems to be that the two that put on the presentation did so without the knowledge of anyone else present, but the football club and the dance group at the social have both been criticised for not intervening or reporting the incident themselves. I'm not sure if the university officials are actually aware but the presentation was apparently made for the football club's tour last year, so it wouldn't have been new for some of the people there.

Having a brief involvement with the club last year in a playing capacity only, I can safely say that it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. From the initiation ceremonies to the socials, too many of them are nothing but trouble, and are a danger not only to themselves, but to others as well. I can't even remember how many establishments they got banned from as a club or as individuals last year, but all of the bannings came about because of stupid behaviour in the name of 'banter'.

Think of it as having a 7.5 GBP note, a 3.2 GBP note a 1.7 GBP note in your pocket (the inputs).

Now, you don't want to give your friend 12.4 GBP (the total sum of the inputs available for you to spend), so Bitcoin creates a transaction (the long character string you get when you send Bitcoins) with three inputs (7.5 GBP, 3.2 GBP and 1.7 GBP) and two outputs (11 GBP and 1.4 GBP).

To see the struggles of the show initially to gain traction, but then to watch the highs of the success they had in the three years to the lows where Bradley/Hartnell utters that [tear-jerking line](#s ""I don't want to go!"") really just helps you to connect with the legendary people behind the creation of Doctor Who, and tugs at the heartstrings like nothing I've seen in a long time. All the performances are top-drawer, and Bradley stole the show with an award-worthy portrayal of the initially grumpy Hartnell slowly become a more warm and grandfatherly figure for the nation.

I thought [that](#s ""Matt Smith's cameo"") was just superb. To those who thought it ruined the moment, when I watched it I immediately thought it showed that Hartnell knew in his heart that the show would continue strong as ever (thanks to his timeless contribution to the show), and a legacy would be built based around what he started. More like a touching afterthought than a tacky CGI moment tagged on to the end, it was a shock to everyone, but I guess it'll probably be one of those things where the audience will be split 50:50

All in all, a well-produced docu-drama by the ever-exciting Mark Gatiss, taking us through a fantastic journey of the first three years of a teething Doctor Who, and I loved every minute.

Sure, we've seen Nine, Ten and Eleven all be badass and a bit dark in their own way, but look at what actions the Doctor took, especially in the first half of Season Seven.  He did things that made New Whovians come to forums exclaiming and protesting that ""That's not the Doctor!  The Doctor wouldn't DO that!""  

But he does.  He has.  Earlier Doctors did, with much more frequency.  They were manipulative, dark and in some cases could be just plain nasty - even to those who considered themselves his friends.

My personal opinion is that this was just paving the way for those protesters to see what the Doctor can do when he pushes himself - and is pushed - to beyond what he would normally want to be.

The Doctor is, and always has been, a dark and tormented soul who has the capability to do whatever action or deed or word is necessary.

Which is very sad because it was such a good moment. How did no one catch that? Not only did Matt's location change, but the spot he shifted to basically makes him sitting on the console right infront of ""Hartnell"" looking right past him.

The Doctor is on 'rewind' reliving his life backwards as the universe resets itself. 

He's 'rewound' to the Byzantium and ends up infront of Amy and plays out the scene described above. 


So in Series 5 Episode 4 when the Doctor is telling Amy to remember. It's actually the Doctor from the future not the one from s5.e4.

River warned him that he was becoming less of a lover and more of a fighter. Now that we've got a bit more of the John Hurt/Time War backstory, I realized that he isn't *becoming* that sort of a person, he had *already* been a vicious warrior. We aren't seeing symptoms of him becoming one, what we're seeing are old habits and aspects of himself from the Time War that he's been trying to repress throughout the entire new series.
