You have to remember the context of transfer deadline day - we had a striker who was losing value by the day due to poor form and wanting out but there was no way the fans would have accepted losing Torres and having cash in the bank waiting for summer. We had to buy there and then because the alternative was having no-one else or, more likely, keeping Torres. Don't forget, Suarez was still an unknown quantity at that stage. 

The £35m price tag is a red herring anyway. If Newcastle were prepared to take £15m for him, we'd have got £30m for Torres and none of this would have looked quite so silly. The Toon got a sniff of Russian cash and rolled the dice. It paid off spectacularly for them but made little difference to Liverpool. Of course, history shows that it was a poor choice, an injured striker with very little experience and, by all accounts, a drinking ""issue"" was not the target we should have pegged Torres against, but the alternative was to keep an ever-worsening Torres and hope anyone was still willing to give us a tenner for him in the summer.

true,voilavoila,null,null,"The classic one I enjoyed recently was by Simon Kuper on Pep.  It is offline now - but here is a cache I kept.

We all see that Barcelona are brilliant. The only problem is understanding just how they do it. That’s where my friend Albert Capellas comes in. Whenever he and I run into each other somewhere in Europe, we talk about Barça. Not many people know the subject better. Capellas is now assistant manager at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, but before that he was coordinator of Barcelona’s great youth academy, the Masia. He helped bring a boy named Sergio Busquets from a rough local neighbourhood to Barça. He trained Andres Iniesta and Victor Valdes in their youth teams. In all, Capellas worked nine years for his hometown club.

During our last conversation, over espressos in an Arnhem hotel, I had several “Aha” moments. I have watched Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona umpteen times, but only now am I finally beginningto see. Guardiola’s Barcelona are great not merely because they have great players. They also have great tactics – different not just from any other team today, but also different from Barcelona teams pre-Guardiola. Barça are now so drilled on the field that in some ways they are more like an American gridiron football team than a soccer one. 

Before getting into the detail of their game, it’s crucial to understand just how much of it comes from Guardiola. When a Barcelona vice president mused to me four years ago that she’d like to see the then 37-year-old Pep be made head coach, I never imagined it would happen. Guardiola was practically a novice. The only side he had ever coached was Barça’s second team. However, people in the club who had worked with him – men like the club’s then president Joan Laporta, and the then director of football Txiki Beguiristain - had already clocked him as special. Not only did Guardiola know Barcelona’s house style inside out. He also knew how it could be improved.

Guardiola once compared Barcelona’s style to a cathedral. Johan Cruijff, he said, as Barça’s supreme player in the 1970s and later as coach, had built the cathedral. The task of those who came afterwards was to renovate and update it. Guardiola is always looking for updates. If a random person in the street says something interesting about the game, Guardiola listens. He thinks about football all the time. He took ideas from another Dutch Barcelona manager, Louis van Gaal, but also from his years playing for Brescia and Roma in Italy, the home of defence. Yet because Guardiola has little desire to explain his ideas to the media, you end up watching Barça without a codebook.

Cruijff was perhaps the most original thinker in football’s history, but most of his thinking was about attack. He liked to say that he didn’t mind conceding three goals, as long as Barça scored five. Well, Guardiola also wanted to score five, but he minded conceding even one. If Barcelona is a cathedral, Guardiola has added the buttresses. In Barça’s first 28 league games this season, they have let in only 22 goals. Here are some of “Pep”’s innovations, or the secrets of FC Barcelona:

1. Pressure on the ball
Before Barcelona played Manchester United in the Champions League final at Wembley last May, Alex Ferguson said that the way Barça pressured their opponents to win the ball back was “breathtaking”. That, he said, was Guardiola’s innovation. Ferguson admitted that United hadn’t known how to cope with it in the Champions League final in Rome in 2009. He thought it would be different at Wembley. It wasn’t.

Barcelona start pressing (hunting for the ball) the instant they lose possession. That is the perfect time to press because the opposing player who has just won the ball is vulnerable. He has had to take his eyes off the game to make his tackle or interception, and he has expended energy. That means he is unsighted, and probably tired. He usually needs two or three seconds to regain his vision of the field. So Barcelona try to dispossess him before he can give the ball to a better-placed teammate.

Furthermore, if the guy won the ball back in his own defence, and Barcelona can instantly win it back again, then the way to goal is often clear. This is where Lionel Messi’s genius for tackling comes in. The little man has such quick reflexes that he sometimes wins a tackle a split-second after losing one.

The Barcelona player who lost the ball leads the hunt to regain it. But he never hunts alone. His teammates near the ball join him. If only one or two Barça players are pressing, it’s too easy for the opponent to pass around them.

2. The “five-second rule”
If Barça haven’t won the ball back within five seconds of losing it, they then retreat and build a compact ten-man wall. The distance between the front man in the wall (typically Messi) and their last defender (say, Carles Puyol) is only 25 to 30 metres. It’s hard for any opponent to pass their way through such a small space. The Rome final was a perfect demonstration of Barcelona’s wall: whenever United won the ball and kept it, they faced eleven precisely positioned opponents, who stood there and said, in effect: “Try and get through this.”

It’s easy for Barcelona to be compact, both when pressing and when drawing up their wall, because their players spend most of the game very near each other. Xavi and Iniesta in particular seldom stray far from the ball. Cruijff recently told the former England manager Steve McClaren, now with FC Twente in Holland: ""Do you know how Barcelona win the ball back so quickly? It's because they don't have to run back more than 10 metres as they never pass the ball more than 10 metres.""

3. More rules of pressing
Once Barcelona have built their compact wall, they wait for the right moment to start pressing again. They don’t choose the moment on instinct. Rather, there are very precise prompts that tell them when to press. One is if an opponent controls the ball badly. If the ball bounces off his foot, he will need to look downwards to locate it, and at that moment he loses his overview of the pitch. That’s when the nearest Barcelona players start hounding him.

There’s another set prompt for Barça to press: when the opposing player on the ball turns back towards his own goal. When he does that, he narrows his options: he can no longer pass forward, unless Barcelona give him time to turn around again. Barcelona don’t give him time. Their players instantly hound the man, forcing him to pass back, and so they gain territory.

true,voilavoila,null,null,"4. The “3-1 rule”
If an opposing player gets the ball anywhere near Barcelona’s penalty area, then Barça go Italian. They apply what they call the “3-1 rule”: one of Barcelona’s four defenders will advance to tackle the man with the ball, and the other three defenders will assemble in a ring about two or three metres behind the tackler. That provides a double layer of protection. Guardiola picked this rule up in Italy. It’s such a simple yet effective idea that you wonder why all top teams don’t use it.

5. No surprise
When Barcelona win the ball, they do something unusual. Most leading teams treat the moment the ball changes hands – “turnover”, as it’s called in basketball – as decisive. At that moment, the opponents are usually out of position, and so if you can counterattack quickly, you have an excellent chance of scoring. Teams like Manchester United and Arsenal often try to score in the first three seconds after winning possession. So their player who wins the ball often tries to hit an instant splitting pass. Holland – Barcelona’s historic role models – do this too.

But when a Barcelona player wins the ball, he doesn’t try for a splitting pass. The club’s attitude is: he has won the ball, that’s a wonderful achievement, and he doesn’t need to do anything else special. All he should do is slot the ball simply to the nearest teammate. Barcelona’s logic is that in winning the ball, the guy has typically forfeited his vision of the field. So he is the worst-placed player to hit a telling ball.

This means that Barcelona don’t rely on the element of surprise. They take a few moments to get into formation, and then pretty much tell their opponents, “OK, here we come.” The opposition knows exactly what Barça are going to do. The difficulty is stopping it.
The only exception to this rule is if the Barça player wins the ball near the opposition’s penalty area. Then he goes straight for goal.

6. Possession is nine-tenths of the game
Keeping the ball has been Barcelona’s key tactic since Cruijff’s day. Most teams don’t worry about possession. They know you can have oodles of possession and lose. But Barcelona aim to have 65 or 70 per cent of possession in a game. Last season in Spain, they averaged more than 72 per cent; so far this year, they are at about 70 per cent.

The logic of possession is twofold. Firstly, while you have the ball, the other team can’t score. 
A team like Barcelona, short on good tacklers, needs to defend by keeping possession. As Guardiola has remarked, they are a “horrible” team without the ball.

Secondly, if Barça have the ball, the other team has to chase it, and that is exhausting. When the opponents win it back, they are often so tired that they surrender it again immediately. Possession gets Barcelona into a virtuous cycle.

Barça are so fanatical about possession that a defender like Gerald Pique will weave the most intricate passes inside his own penalty area rather than boot the ball away. In almost all other teams, the keeper at least is free to boot. In the England side, for instance, it’s typically Joe Hart who gives the ball away with a blind punt. This is a weakness of England’s game, but the English attitude seems to be that there is nothing to be done about it: keepers can’t pass. Barcelona think differently.

Jose Mourinho, Real Madrid’s coach and Barcelona’s nemesis, has tried to exploit their devotion to passing. In the Bernabeu in December, Madrid’s forwards chased down Valdes from the game’s first kickoff, knowing he wouldn’t boot clear. The keeper miscued a pass, and Karim Benzema scored after 23 seconds. Yet Valdes kept passing, and Barcelona won 1-3. The trademark of Barcelona-raised goalkeepers – one shared only by Ajax-raised goalkeepers, like Edwin van der Sar – is that they can all play football like outfield players.

7. The “one-second rule”
No other football team plays the Barcelona way. That’s a strength, but it’s also a weakness. It makes it very hard for Barça to integrate outsiders into the team, because the outsiders struggle to learn the system. Barcelona had a policy of buying only “Top Ten” players – men who arguably rank among the ten best footballers on earth – yet many of them have failed in the Nou Camp. Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic did, while even David Villa, who knew Barcelona’s game from playing it with Spain, ended up on the bench before breaking his leg.

Joan Oliver, Barcelona’s previous chief executive, explained the risk of transfers by what he called the “one-second rule”. The success of a move on the pitch is decided in less than a second. If a player needs a few extra fractions of a second to work out where his teammate is going, because he doesn’t know the other guy’s game well, the move will usually break down. A new player can therefore lose you a match in under a second. 
Pedro isn’t a great footballer, but because he was raised in the Masia he can play Barcelona’s game better than stars from outside. The boys in the Masia spend much of their childhood playing passing games, especially Cruijff’s favorite, six against three. Football, Cruijff once said, is choreography.

Nobody else thinks like that. That’s why most of the Barcelona side is homegrown. It’s more a necessity than a choice. Still, most of the time it works pretty well.",0,1371834126,null,0,false,0,canhpux,t3_1gqmw5,t1_canhpux,t1_canhpo8,null,1430730646,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I'm not one to advocate suing the council for tripping on a raised kerb, or any of the other frivolities of 'claim culture', nobody is dragging anybody through the courts - the refund is something offered willingly by the train services!

I'm also not saying the railways can prevent people sadly killing themselves. 

I just don't understand why you'd think it was shitty to recoup your losses from that situation. If refunds cost the railways that much then surely it'd be cost efficient for them to make the whole network inaccessible without authorisation (fencing etc.). I'm not saying it's their fault in any way, but the ticket you buy is a contract that they offer you to provide a service within a given time. If they break that contract then the onus is on them to make good their broken promise.

I have just arrived in Barcelona after traveling 15 hours on two scales, Stefan Szymanski questions about sports scores that occurred while flying over the Atlantic. Professor of Sport Management at the University of Michigan, has been the protagonist of Ernest Lluch I Academic Conference Football Economics and organized in collaboration with FC Barcelona. The conference, held yesterday at the Camp Nou 1899 Auditorium, was also attended by Egon Frank, Jaume Garcia and Placido Rodriguez. Three years ago, Szymanski published by Simon Kuper, Soccernomics , a book that chronicles the delicate relationship between economics and football.

Finance that sets eyes on Messi , Malaga, who stayed out of the European competitions , the Generalitat, which intercedes in Valencia , and the million dollar debt of League clubs health question football industry in Spain. The conflict, in any case, ""there is always, not just now that things go wrong,"" announces Szymanski.

Question. Why should this constant?

Answer. The competitive nature of football is the goal of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid to win in sports, therefore, sacrifice economic gain, the obsession is to win in competitions. The operation is different from the large-scale economy, where large companies are not interested in competition because it is something that reduces profits.

Q. The money runs out at some point, can persist this model sporting ambition expense?

R. In the factual should not, but here the fans are prepared to survive the clubs. If the followers of a club they propose donate 5% of his salary to help his club would. Still, football in Europe is accentuating the main problem, and it is becoming more difficult to survive for those who are not a power.

Q. What is your main problem?

R. The gap between the powerful and the clubs are not so. Here in Spain the income of two powerful are thousands of times higher than those of the other teams, and this is repeated across Europe. There are competitions that are not explained as they exist.

Q. What is solution?

R. You have to redistribute income, but I doubt this will happen. Another possible solution is to conduct a competition for large, which compete as equals and not at the expense of the less powerful, and other competitions for the rest.

Q. Does the complaint against tax fraud Messi goes in the direction of a change?

R. In the case of Messi, tax authorities try to create a demonstration effect to football force to install the idea that it is better to pay taxes. In times of austerity the governments want their money and put more pressure on the clubs.

P. imposed UEFA Financial Fair Play. How long term do not think this will work?

R. Approve the political will to change, but the diagnosis is wrong. The Financial Fair Play harasses weaker and not allowed to grow. The situation is similar to that of the States, impose stronger conditions. This kind of regulation makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker.

Q. What is the error diagnosis?

R. The instability framework that sustains the competitiveness. In Europe do not want to give up the demotion, which is understandable because it makes the competition more exciting. Therefore, without risk is difficult to sustain economic competitiveness is a team that can not compete seriously indebted.

Q. Why does this not happen in the U.S. leagues?

Q. Because it is a closed system competition. Entities beyond their performance in the season, do not ascend or descend. Yet there is an internal difference, if you divide the best performers of the lowest you'll find that the former are the biggest expense and other discarded do make large investments. Contrary to what happens in Europe, where despair leads to less power clubs into debt by figures who do not know whether they can afford.

Q. Is the financial stability must be imposed to competitiveness?

R. Should we regulate this counterpoint. Particularly this is my most emotional instability and makes the game more interesting. Still, the NBA, for example, is interesting.

Q. Will Germany is an example to follow?

A. I'm not sure it is. In my research I have been able to obtain detailed information leagues in Spain, England, France, Italy, but not Germany's. The Bundesliga provides information that shows the total income but not its details.

Q. But German clubs are in good financial health and the Champions League final this year was monopoly Teutonic ...

R. Not so, the Bundesliga has its problems. The decade ago Bayern loaned money to Borussia Dortmund, which confirms the difference between large and small. The Schalke 04 survives with Russian money. The Aachen Germany is about to disappear. Germany is telling us a story of your system, but it is a rather dubious history. And although this system actually worked well that does not mean that, for example, in Spain it work.",0,1371834567,null,0,false,0,canhw08,t3_1gqmw5,t1_canhw08,t1_canadlc,null,1430730565,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I highly doubt we'd go for Mignolet, who is coming off a good season, to keep him on the bench. Pepe won't settle for the bench, and given his wages it looks as if he's leaving.

I'm going to post what I said in another thread about this move:

What I don't understand about signing Mignolet is that he doesn't seem to fit the profile of a keeper we would want, which doesn't correlate with our other targets. You can see with Papadopoulos he is strong, vocal and young with great potential, he'd complement Agger well. Toure is an experienced defender who will fill that gap in the squad. Mkhitaryan is a goalscoring midfielder, we lack goals from that area and he would be better suited to the no.10 role (defensively compared to Coutinho who is comfortable wide unlike Mkhitaryan).

All you can say about Mignolet is that he has had a good season, but so has Brad Guzan and you wouldn't bank on making him our no.1 as we look to establish ourselves in the top 4. Being a keeper for a relegation threatened team always seems to skew a keepers reputation because they have to make so many saves. Mignolet is not particularly quick off his line, or good with his feet. Neither is he going to improve on Reina with regards to aerial ability.

Given Reina's wages and inconsistency I am not against finding a replacement, but I feel we can do better than Mignolet.

The reason I stated. The reason it doesn't work as well as receiving tips from a customer is because you are guaranteed to get less from minimum wage than you would a good night of waiting tables with attentive service. On top of that, your compensation up to minimum wage will be taxed, something you can somewhat avoid when dealing with tips.

Let me explain a little. Usually you are going to get a mixture of cash and credit card tips through a night's shift. A waiter in the US is supposed to declare their tips (in many cases, when they clock out at the end of the shift) so they government can tax it. However, most waiters only declare their credit card tips, the only ones that can be proven they received. On some nights, this means you can walk away with 50% of your tips or more being completely untaxed. 

Depending on where you work, you might get as much as 75% of your tips in cash, increasing what you get to take home, untaxed. This is especially true among places frequented by other restaurant staff. A lot of people, regardless of having ever worked in a restaurant, also know about the taxing of tips, and tip in cash for this particular reason.

Also, unlike other positions, CBs don't tire themselves out as easily during a match, so there will be less rotating and substituting centerbacks into a match than with other positions.

true,Stargazer34,num5-away,,"""According to transfermarkt, he's valued around 10.5-12m. Is that realistic, and is it a fair price?""

A) It may be realistic but IF we are going to buy him, i'd definitely suggest and hope it would be 10.5 or even less.

""How do you think he'd fit in to the team, either in the 433, or the 4231/4411 thing we ended up using with Bale floating around?""

A) That's the problem. For me, I don't see him fitting in the team until we figure out what the hell our team is going to look like UP FRONT next season and onwards. To me, he appears to be a cover player. No way he gets a PL start frequently over Dembele or Sandro, should both be working as expected and injury free. However, if he were a straight up Parker replacement and that's the thinking behind this, I am more open to it, although still not overly interested.

""Is this a reasonable target for us?""

A)  Sure, I suppose so but I am more concerned with why Paulinho. I don't see any indication we are in desperate need of somebody with his skill set and this time and with such immediate urgency. I thought for sure the strikers were the first priority this window, as they should always have been, even in Jan. 

"" Finally, do you want to sign him"" 

A) Short answer: No. 

    Long answer:  Not really but it wouldn't hurt. The only thing is I see the numbers of players out there like PAE , Son, Eriksen, Thiago and I cannot fathom why we are in for the names we are and not at least trying to make as hefty an offer as possible to attract the right players and not just "" suitable players"" like I feel Paulinho is. Sure, not all of the player examples I listed would be dying to come to us over the other clubs they are linked with but we did get Lloris over the gooners, if they are about to sign Higuin, we NEED to step it up and continue to try to tempt bigger names here as we did with Jan and Hugo/Dembele etc.

Lampard and Essien in turn helped Make by providing a bit of cover so that he could play a sort of midfield sweeper role and not have to track opposition runs as frequently.

Compared to Mikel who's mostly played with just one other midfielder.  Therefore he has far more responsibility.  He now has to cover for his one midfield partner's runs, while positioning himself to break up opposition attacks and track opposition players while having no cover himself.

A laptop has a number of advantages over a desktop, which come from its portability:

* Near coursework deadlines or exams, there can be huge competition to use the computers in university libraries. Being able to take your own laptop means you just have to find a desk somewhere.

* Easier to take home

* Easier to take to classmates' homes if you're working on a group project

You should also invest in a USB hard disk drive so you can keep backups of your work should your laptop become lost, damaged, or stolen.

http://www.zdnet.com/news/spy-agency-taps-into-undersea-cable/115877

&gt;Using a special spy submarine, they say, agency personnel descended hundreds of feet into one of the oceans and sliced into a fiber-optic cable. The mixed results of the experiment--particularly the agency's inability to make sense of the vast flood of data unleashed by the tap--show that America's pre-eminent spy service has huge challenges to overcome if it hopes to keep from going deaf in the digital age.
&gt;
&gt;Details of the NSA cable-tapping project are sketchy. Individuals who confirm the tap won't specify where or when it occurred. It isn't known whether the cable's operator detected the intrusion, though former NSA officials say they believe it went unnoticed. Nor is it known whether the NSA has attempted other taps since.

This is from 2005:

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/20submarine.html

&gt;To listen to fiber-optic transmissions, intelligence operatives must physically place a tap somewhere along the route. If the stations that receive and transmit the communications along the lines are on foreign soil or otherwise inaccessible, tapping the line is the only way to eavesdrop on it.
&gt;
&gt;The intelligence experts admit there is much that is open to speculation, such as how the information recorded at a fiber-optic tap would get to analysts at the National Security Agency for review.

It's also feasible, especially after 9/11, that US companies might have cooperated voluntarily (as AT&amp;T allegedly did) at their overseas regenerating stations.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"Well that's awkward because I think he's not a great DM but a far better AM in the grand scheme of things.

EDIT: obviously the Torres/Mikel support our players regardless circlejerk is quite against this notion but I'll outline these ideas for anyone who should wish to be enlightened (or disagree with the following points and as such enlighten me as to why he's more than a half-decent DM).

We did sign him seven years ago so you could argue that we've been able to turn him into a decent DM but frankly our first team coaching has been relatively poor aside from the managers. Certainly not on the level of Arsenal or Man U, probably not even on the level of Man City after their recent employments so I wouldn't say that those 7 years have been particularly productive in his development beyond facets he had already had (perhaps in lower refinement) at 18/19.

Many of his greatest attributes are applicable to AM and he seems to have a greater affinity for AM, basically he enjoys going forward but follows his coaches orders. His discipline in this case is probably his greatest asset as holding/anchor DM. He is nearly always ready to be the deepest DM, sitting only infront of the CB's.

On his attacking ability, he is capable of running fairly quickly with the ball and is a capable close range finisher, but is particularly adept at being a facilitator of attacks, preferring to make short passes in and around the box. He can sprint a lot quicker than you would think if you've only seen him for Chelsea. He really doesn't appear motivated for us. If you've seen him attack he's quicker, whereas the number of times he's lost the ball upfield and is just jogging back to defend instead being overtaken by Ramires who will make the tackle instead of Mikel is frankly ridiculous if you claim to be a DM. This lax attitude is something I expect of Hazard/Mata/Marin/Torres/Ba (although Hazard actually frequently does try and win the ball back if he's at fault for losing it).

Now to more DM orientated attributes.

He is capable of making a fair amount of interceptions. Particularly when play is congested. (Here probably lies his greatest effectiveness, when we defend a lot or need someone to make a back 3 then Mikel does this ably as he is great at slowing down attacks.) However, he slows down attacks by merely being an obstacle, he is hardly a great tackler and doesn't often get involved in shoulder-barging match-ups, instead shying away from real physical action. This is perhaps his greatest weakness as a DM. He simply doesn't break up attacks, he doesn't make other midfielders afraid of crunching tackles or make them think they're going to lose the ball by taking him on.

So no, he doesn't make tackles, but at least he can pass right? Erm, not really. He doesn't really have the vision to make a long pass and nor does he have the accuracy over long range so that's probably a good thing if he knows his limitations. However, he lacks the awareness in his distribution out of defensive situations that frequently results in turnovers. Mikel will often pass to Mazacar to feet when they have a player on their back. This puts them under immediate pressure and they either pass it straight back to him or often lose the ball. If this pass occurs higher up the field rather than when Mazacar is/are jogging back towards the ball then a quick passing move may occur but this hardly happens as often as we would all like.

If Mikel had Lampard's long ball distribution or vison then you could probably excuse his lack of physicality but just having great discipline is hardly all you need for a DM position. Ironically, Mikel's stand out trait is probably the one thing Luiz would lack if he was to play anchor, but I see no reason why we can't develop Luiz into someone like Martínez but I see reasons why we can't do it with Mikel. It's easier to make the transition from defence to DM than from AM to DM. The only similar cases I can think of are possibly Pirlo (who has the passing ability I mentioned and has transitioned successfully into a deeper player particularly for the national side) and Anderson who was a highly exciting and successful AM for Porto and is now quite dodgy at Man U so we can all see how that turned out (admittedly he's had more injuries so I consider Mikel to be the half way house between the two).

true,Domhnallbain,null,null,"I appreciate their sentiment but I couldn't vote for a party that is pro-partition as I think it is short sighted and will always be a hindrance to economic growth.

However the creation of this party could have quite interesting consequences. Remember when there was a battle for the leadership of the UUP between Tom Elliott and Basil McCrea. There was one of two possibilities:

* Basil McCrea gets elected. UUP gets a new lease of life with a fresh and modern approach to Unionist politics. Willingness to engage with the Irish Nationalist community. Liberal social policies which benefit everyone. No anti-Irish rhetoric and vindictiveness. Therefore Nationalism benefits.

* Tom Elliott gets elected. UUP backtracks on any progress it has made. Return to divisive politics. Conservative and outdated social policies. More anti-Irish and pro Orange Order rhetoric which further isolates the UUP resulting in a further drop in support. The party relies on its dwindling base vote and is unable to garner any young voters. UUP power and influence reaches a new low. Again Nationalism benefits.

So whatever the result it would be positive for the nationalist community. However since this party is starting off with a clean slate and seem to have none of the typical Unionist qualities that always drive Nationalists in the opposite direction they do have a potential growth rate that other Unionists don't have. I know a lot of people who would be happy for Northern Ireland to remain in the UK if the unionists showed a genuine respect for them as people, stopped their intolerance of all things Irish and rejected sectarian parading. So if this party were to become a dominant player then we could see benefits for all people in the north however it could result in the six counties becoming more secure within the UK as it would appear to the Nationalist people that Unionism has finally become 'sane'.

it also could be that honda has aboslutely no interest in liverpool.  but yea buying players from shaktar is always going to cost a lot of money. it would be amazing to get a player of Honda's quality on a free and then be able to spend that money elsewhere or save it.

true,RiverorRiver,river,River,"Amy's development is at best contrived. The kissing the Doctor thing was not ""just a commitment issue,"" it was a nonconsensual assault played for laughs. Not a cool thing to write in. And I wasn't talking about her fertility but honestly that's an issue that is never developed. I mean the episode with their divorce (another contrivance with no development) addresses this issue very poorly. Infertility can sometimes give a woman a sense of being worthless, that I can understand. I just think a much better, more developed reason would be that she's scared out of her mind to have more kids since the last kid she had was forcibly taken from her. That should have been developed over several episodes instead of a contrived divorce that was patched up unrealistically within minutes. 

I understand completely that Victorians shouldn't be all 'lovely' when it comes to Vastra and Jenny. That was not at all my point. My point was that the Doctor, the main protagonist of the show, makes boner jokes about them and kisses Jenny without her consent. Again it's played for laughs. Not cool. 

The Doctor 'saved' River and then just left her there forced to raise children she never expressed intrest having. That, and forcing her to be in the prison, despite the fact that she leaves occasionally, puts River in a passive role. No agency. The River/Doctor relationship has little to no development and what does develop in their relationship becomes contrivances. And yes, the Doctor is flat out abusive to her. Especially in Angels in Manhattan. [Essay here.](http://prettylittleparadox.tumblr.com/post/36495760356/if-i-didnt-believe-that-river-and-eleven-had-an) 

Also, [excellent essay](http://whovianfeminism.tumblr.com/post/51311846453/clara-oswald-the-ultimate-manic-pixie-dream-girl) on how Clara is another trope and is horribly written. She's bland, and has no personality. The Doctor didn't take her on because of her personality or because he thought she was genuinely fantastic and capable of a lot. Just that she was 'a mystery,' which she has no agency or control over. 

Overall Steven Moffat just treats the women like problems. The fact that Clara is a problem was the entire plot of S7 Pt2. He doesn't know how to plot and still hasn't resolved all of the questions raised in S5 and S6 and I doubt any of them will be. He favors plot contrivances for 'shock value' instead of actual development. It's just sad.

Reading this stuff would give others some idea of what the people of Thanet are up against as they continue to battle for the future of their town.

There is no reason for banks to change the way they operate because of feeble protestations by the rest of society. If government decides that the banking sector is a real threat to the country, they should either take steps to regulate the entire industry, or nationalise individual institutions and take a role in managing them for the good of society.

I'd say however, that they would be very unlikely to want to do this, seeing as the UK's production industry is ever dwindling and banks are providing an ever larger portion of our GDP.

Another thought:

Theoretically, had GI corrupted The Doctor's timeline, altering events in his past, then River may not have needed to sacrifice herself in the Library, finding another way, without The Doctor present, to stop the Vashta Narada and rescue the ""saved"" patrons and CAL. Clara saving The Doctor would have fixed the GI's influence, but not necessarily with precisely the same continuity.

When The Doctor is able to physically stop River from hitting him in the TARDIS tomb, it was a surprise to even her. 

And she does then say ""I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?"". Perhaps she realized the effects of both GI and Clara on The Doctors past rendered her physically alive. 

Her ""fade out"" bore an interesting similarity to the teleport from The Library.

The very founding idea of the internet is that it serves as a method of interconnectivity between countless sources in the world, and you expect privacy in its use??
If, going back to the bar analogy, a group of right wing extremists met to plan a terror attack, one would hope that the authorities might have a fair chance of hearing about it. Is the same not the case with online interactions?
The people intercepting these communications are working very hard to prevent activities harmful to society.

He just keeps the ball ticking over, which is well and good if he can offer more to the team, but he doesnt have that killer pass, he isnt a very good tackler and he makes lots of rash challenges in dangerous places.

No doubt he was one of our best players at the start of the season, but  the fact that we were doing so badly kind of backs up that he doesnt offer much to the team. The fact he was playing so well and yet we were losing games and conceding goals, then all of a sudden when he started playing badly we started winning games, scoring tonnes and conceding less.

I dont dislike him as a player but I think Henderson is a better option, and I think we can too a hell of a lot better than Henderson.

You're missing the point of the Forrest case, which is all about the special duty of care that authority figures like him have to young people in their line of work. 

It was a serious and flagrant breach of trust and apart from anything else, a sexual relationship with a 15 yr old CANNOT be consensual, by definition. In any case, just because she wanted to do it, in cases like this involving an adult and a child you are missing out the fact that adolescents might be swayed towards psychologically adopting the adult's perspective.

I don't know a huge amount about domestic Iranian politics, but I know that there are what can loosely be labelled 'moderate' and 'radical' elements within the state both of whom generally accept the state as it is but have differing opinions on how to achieve Iranian national interests. At different points in the history of the Islamic Republic, different elements have been predominant.

Phillips is almost wholly wrong on Iran in an international sense. So wrong I nearly threw my mug at the TV watching it this morning. Yes it is a repressive theocracy I certainly do not dispute that. But it has a significant moderate element who were in power between 1989 (death of Ayatollah Khomeini) and 2005 (election of Ahmadinejad). In that time Rafsanjani and Khatami were in power and made significant moves to improve relations with Saudi Arabia, the US and European countries especially under Khatami. The goal of 'exporting the revolution' which had been a key part of Iranian foreign policy was dampened down in favour of a realist approach which focused on promoting Iranian national interest and the goal of promoting Iran as a regional power given the placation of Iraq in the 1990-91 Gulf War.

Khatami provided intelligence about and offered to assist in defeating both the Taliban and Al Qaeda in 2001. The response by George Bush was to declare Iran part of the 'Axis of Evil' in 2002 along with Iraq and North Korea. This had so little basis in reality it would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic. Iranians were understandably pissed off about this, but still they didn't abandon diplomacy. In 2003 Iran halted its nuclear enrichment because the EU had promised an alleviation of sanctions. It got nothing in return. Frustrated by the moderates' inability to improve Iran's position through realism and diplomacy, the radical Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005. The moderates watched with absolute horror as Ahmadinejad publicly denied the Holocaust and provoked western countries with his rhetoric.

Despite this, Iran has still overwhelmingly complied with the IAEA's requirements and allowed them to monitor, as Johnson pointed out in the programme. They have nuclear ambitions going back to the days of the Shah because a significant aspect of Iranian national identity lies in being a regional and global power and nuclear weapons are a symbol of that. Not because they have a desire to wipe out Israel - this is a serious misconception resulting from Ahmadinejad's disgusting vitriol.
The point is that the Iranian state is not some irrational crazy state internationally. When it comes to foreign policy, Iran has been motivated (at least until 2005) more by realism than idealism, especially when compared to the USA. The US view that they are the only superpower who can do what they want led them to the disastrous war in Iraq, for example. On Iran, the US has not responded to initiatives such as Khatami's 'Dialogue of Civilisations' (a riposte to Samuel Huntington's pessimistic prediction of a clash of civilisations) largely due to this assumption that it is the only superpower (which I don't think exists anymore but certainly did 10 years ago under Bush) combined with enormous pressure from Israel and the Israel Lobby and a holding onto the US embassy hostage crisis. I can only imagine what the Middle East might look like today if George Bush and his neoconservative ideological foreign policy agenda hadn't been in power. It really is tragic.
That being said, I think there are good reasons for optimism. The overwhelming support for the moderate candidate in Iranian elections shows that the spirit of Khatami and his dialogue of civilisations is still alive among the Iranian people and it seems as though the religious leadership has not reacted to this so far. Combine this with a US government which has less strong relations with Israel and we may see cooperation that brings about the reduction of crippling economic sanctions and coordination over other issues in the region.

As a final note, I want to point out that the picture above is not particularly controversial among international relations scholars. American realists have been promoting the idea of relations with Iran over Israel in the name of better promoting US interests for a while now. I say this to point out that I'm not some crazy dictator-loving George Galloway type. In fact the Iranian regime is significantly different in kind to those of Syria and Iraq before 2003. Mostly because it exists outside of the populism of leaders such as Ahmadinejad. Political discourse, views and opinions are more accepted and vary more greatly. That is why the recent election was possible and the election of Rafsanjani and Khatami where it would never been possible in Ba'thist Iraq, Syria or with our mates in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

**TL;DR: There are significant moderate elements in Iranian politics who want to cooperate with the West and have previously been in power. Attempts to engage with the West over common interests in Afghanistan and Iraq failed and even halt their nuclear programme were met with near silence. Now might be the time for real cooperation. Melanie Phillips does not have a clue what she is talking about.**",0,1371856497,null,0,false,0,canpsxl,t3_1gs81v,t1_canpsxl,t3_1gs81v,null,1430726764,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The road network across the north of Edinburgh has fairly limited capacity (look at how choked up Ferry Road gets as it is, for example), and I think there were projections for sufficient redevelopment along the waterfront to mean additional people in the tens of thousands living there.

Tens of thousands of extra car movements is simply more than the road network could really absorb, but the trams would provide a load of additional people-movement capacity.  This also explains why the trams were to run right along the waterfront, even though that more or less halves the 'catchment area' (if people are prepared to walk X distance to catch the tram, well, there aren't many people living in the Forth to the north!).

However, as we know, the developments stalled (partly their own fault for building nothing but smallish ""luxury flats"" which are not really attractive to anyone with, or thinking of starting, a family - and partly thanks to the financial crisis).  So the tens of thousands of extra people aren't there.

Which is just as well, since the tram's gone sufficiently over budget that we've lost both halves of the northern loop that goes anywhere near there.

On a tangent to that, if you remember the charade where the council voted to terminate it at Haymarket, the Scottish Government then said if they did that it was a material change and they wouldn't be getting the last big chunk of government funding, at which point they had another vote and extended it to York Place again - how on earth not actually getting down to the waterfront doesn't constitute a pretty material change I have no idea...

Honda is a quality player without a doubt and I wish we got him as well because as a left footed player he would provide much more in terms of assists and goals compared to iaspas because unlike iaspas Honda has been playing for a team that consistently challenges for the Russian title and he is a part of the reason why Seydou Doumbia is so prolific, the man knows how to play a pass. That being said he isn't the paciest of players and he is pretty one footed whereas henrik is a quick player, younger and is BRILLIANT with both feet, something we don't really have in any of our players at the moment. Also with Shaktar Dontesk henrik is winning his league, playing in the chanpions league and playing well against teams much better than his own ( see games vs Dortmund, Chelsea). Wages would also be much cheaper for Henrik  so we may be saving money in the long run on that front. I do agree on your assessment that we do need to reinforce the DM position our midfield without Lucas was being bossed so much and with him being injury prone we need a Gary Medel, or Schniederling type player to rotate with Lucas. Both Honda and Henrik are great players, I don't think you could go wrong with either but I think Henrik would just fit a little better into our system and has the ability to score and create goals whereas Honda is more of a creative player and we have little Phillipe for that role already.

Most government benefit assessors (whether it be for Housing Tax Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Disability Allowance, Job Seekers Allowance or any thing else) don't understand the legislation behind the decision, they just follow a set of rules prescribed by the organisation that employs them.  After the end of the tax year the older (more lasting benefits) get a government auditing that corrects the most obvious of the systematic flaws within their existing systems (those that obviously violate legislation).  I'm not sure that ATOS even has to under go this (I know most councils do every year with regard to Housing/Council Tax Benefit).

A *lot* of government organisations (including local councils) outsource the majority of these processes to a few select companies (EDS, Capita, ATOS etc).

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"There's a myriad of reasons why privacy should be assumed and enforced. The information could be misconstrued and 2 and 2 put together to make 5 and you could be arrested. It's happened before, normally the CIA doing it in Europe, [this case comes to mind](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/european-court-human-rights-cia-abuse-khaled-elmasri). If the CIA or whoever has to go through the process of actually collecting evidence it reduces the chances of detaining the wrong person by a huge amount. 

This information may get to private companies who could misuse the information to profit off it. No doubt they will sell it on to advertsing companies; say good by to your email address because it will be full of spam and possibly also hacked because they'll have your password too. Furthermore it must be remembered that they powers don't disappear when a less than trustworthy party came into power. What if UKIP or the BNP were to ride to a general election victory on the back of the recession discontent; unlikely but possible. They would then have access to all internet data crossing the channel. I hope you'll allow me to be fucking terrified at that thought. If Nick Griffin is willing to give out personal information on Twitter to harass a gay couple imagine what he would do with the personal information of every gay couple, every immigrant and every foreigner in the UK and probably the US too. 

The fact of the matter remains is I don't trust them with that information and, with it being my information and all, I don't grant them permission. If I did I would consider being OK with it but as I don't I'm not. Is it not reasonable that I get to choose who has my private information. If you want to give yours up then fine but I don't trust what ever barely literate, barely in the job civil servant has control of it. I don't think anyone has a problem with companies logging our search information because we are using that product and thus grant them certain access to our information. It's not OK, though for them to turn round and sell it to some company who want's to sell me unregulated drugs over the internet who will send me spam. This practice, while common place is not OK and should be illegal. 

Finally you also have a right to a private and family life under Art. 8 ECHR. Turning round after the fact and saying 'well, of course they were breaching my right to privacy. That fact that it was so obvious that they were breaching my rights make it OK.'. It's also obvious that the US tortures people in it's jurisdiction, doesn't make it fine. Extreme example but if the government make it clear that anyone who uses the internet will be arrested and people continue to use the internet and get arrested, who is a fault? The people for using a resource they previously had access to or the government for breaching the people's civil liberties and human rights? I hope it's pretty clear that human rights and civil liberties come above the right of the government to impose force upon us. In fact human rights define those boundaries, what purpose would human rights serve if they could be breached just by giving notice? Effectively that's what you were saying, it was obvious the government was breaching your rights (and the law) but the fact that you did not alter your behaviour to work around the breach of your rights means you shouldn't have access to those rights. That's a contradiction. If it's obvious the government is breaching your rights you have a stronger case against them when they provably do so not a weaker one. It's not contributory negligence to refuse to give up your rights. ",0,1371860627,null,0,false,0,canr0ny,t3_1gsw6l,t1_canr0ny,t1_canoj1e,null,1430726192,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Nowadays more teams have way better scouting systems in place to give them great quality at cheaper prices. Players are examined and bought from all over the globe. It's far more far-reaching than what it was even a half decade ago.

&gt; Haha. It just sounds like you're trying to convince yourself otherwise by using a very strict definition of a ponzi scheme. Bitcoin is defined by how people use it.

What?  That doesn't even make sense.  How is a ponzi scheme defined by how people use it.  Ponzi schemes have a strict definition; it is, _by definition_ an investment where the past investors are paid from the investments of the future investors.  The whole thing is a lie and it is sold as a money making scheme.  Bitcoin is absolutely not that.  Bitcoin is not a money making scheme.

&gt; Bitcoin it's self does not but the current way in which bitcoin is being used by the vast majority of users does.

Nonsense.  Bitcoin is being traded back and forth every day.  That's not what happens with a Ponzi.

&gt; No of course not. That doesn't stop people expecting one.

So bitcoin is a ponzi scam because people, having been told it's not a money making scheme, obstinately refuse to believe that and start giving money to existing investors anyway?

&gt; Again, it might not be concieved as an investment but that's how people are using it.

How does that make it a Ponzi scheme?

None of this is relevant.  If you don't want to use Bitcoin, don't, you obviously don't like it -- fine.  The best feature of Bitcoin is that its usage is entirely voluntary.  My original point stands -- if you want the banking system to change, there are very few options open to you.  Bitcoin is one.  If there is another, I'm all ears; but all I ever hear is ""we need more regulations""... good luck with that.",0,1371861046,null,0,false,0,canr51v,t3_1gs85e,t1_canr51v,t1_canbael,null,1430726134,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Dazzacus,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I think part of the reason for keeping interest rates low (making mortgages cheap) and artificially keeping the price of housing up, is that the government benefits from the stamp duty income it receives. Forecasts for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) were 1.1% of Government revenue in 2012/13.

Also, corporations have to pay 15% SDLT on property over £2million (individuals pay 7%), but anything under that, and it's the same rate as charged to the individual. So, £1.99million, that's only 5%.

I believe there shouldn't need to be a change to have a land tax as that would impact on smaller home-owners more than larger ones. Mansion tax, maybe. But that can be recouped in other, less controversial ways instead. Council tax or increased stamp duty. I propose that **all** SDLT is doubled for corporations, not just for residential properties over £2million. But, that's just a off-the-cuff idea and I haven't researched it in the slightest. The same should go to non-residents, possibly. And already does for corporations somewhat, but I'm not sure if it expands to individuals. I'd hope this would slow down the drive to purchase London property as some sort of security against other more volatile investments by foreign individuals and corporations. The bubble will burst one-day, let's stop it from expanding again!

Finally, if six or more properties form part of a single transaction the rules, rates and thresholds for non-residential properties apply. So, over £500k is 4%. Normal rules state that over £1m, it's 7%/15%, but not if you get 6 or more in the same transaction. Why? It's still residential property! Why should the big guy get a break over the little guy?!

The changes to council tax benefit have meant that individual councils are now responsible for making up the shortfall, and some have indeed introduced policies on charging on vacant properties, and doubling the charge if they are vacant for an extended period of time. Also, for second home owners in some cases.

As you can see, I like to rant a bit. Not sure if it's coherent though!",0,1371862884,null,0,false,0,canrngx,t3_1gsjdf,t1_canrngx,t1_caneoia,null,1430725893,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He's is also decent controlling high balls with his head or feet and can read the ball very well. I've seen him a few times go up against bigger players to control a long kick and he has usually either won the header or boxed the player away from where the ball is gonna drop and just controls it with his feet.

true,stent_removal,lfc87,,"I'm not a master tactician, but I'll start us off:

we tend to play a variant of a 4-3-3; 4 defenders, 3 midfielders, and 3 forwards -- this can be just as easily considered a 4-2-3-1, and it seems to be what BR preferred towards the end of last season.

Let's start with the consideration that a formation is really only of paramount importance in our defensive shape. While attacking, it is much more fluid. When we are in possession of the ball, you will generally see two striking things happening: the fullbacks go very wide and press forward. the two center-backs will spread the pitch and push wide as well, and generally, a midfielder like Lucas or Gerrard will drop in to pick up a pass. In many systems, this pairing is the bread-and-butter to many plays. A DM like Lucas breaks up the play and makes a tackle, holding up the ball while options open. A playmaker like Gerrard (or... Alonso........ *sniff*) plays the killer pass.

Up front, BR seems to prefer an out-and-out striker spearheading the attack, with 3 versatile players behind him -- which makes it a 4-2-3-1. 4 defenders, a 2-man pivot, 3 players forward and 1 striker. We've had Henderson at AM, with Coutinho out wide, or Henderson out left with Coutinho at AM, and typically Downing has played out on the right. The big thing in BR's system is versatility; We can easily imagine Sturridge or Suarez pushing wide and pulling defenders out of position to create space for the AM to fill the gap that's left. We can imagine a left-footed player like Downing cutting in from out wide to take a shot on his strong foot, and add some firepower.

That explains some of it, I think. It's certainly not complete. But I'm also a little drunk and this was fun. There are good articles outlining our defensive shape and how our pressing game operates, but we operated last year with a fairly deep defensive line (especially with Carragher's reintroduction)... but that should get you started, at least, on how you might start considering formations.",0,1371865752,null,0,false,0,cansg71,t3_1gt3cj,t1_cansg71,t3_1gt3cj,null,1430725518,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I completely would prefer Honda over Aspas purely on what they could add to the squad.  But to say Honda over Mkhitaryan is silly, and for exactly some of the reasons you mentioned.  

For me, we need goals from midfield and players who will get in the box and support Sturridge/Suarez (which is part of the reason why Henderson impressed me so much last year, as he would do this when no one else did).  Honda isn't really that guy, and definitely not to the extent that Henrikh is.  Henrikh scores nearly twice as often and is younger, pacy, incredible on the ball running at players, and is excellent technically.  Not to mention that BR typically likes to play players on the side opposite to their natural foot, and I think Honda wouldn't quite as good as Suarez/Coutinho/Sturridge and potentially Sterling out wide (whichever of the 2 is playing there as a fluid front 3).

true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"I think ""numerous"" is a bit inflated. A few games? For sure. Happens to every goalkeeper and he's no exception to the rule. Name me one keeper who never makes a mistake and that would be called a pipe dream. I seriously mean this in no disrespect, but I find many people who heavily criticize goalkeepers have never played the position to see what its like even on a recreational level. I mean, I know I'm just a shit recreational player, but I often scoff when people ask why I didn't save a low drive in the corner from a striker 10 feet away who hits it as hard as he can or when you've dive with all of your might high in the corners looking like a flying fish only to come down hard while hearing the ball rustle in the back of the net. Now multiply that by the Mata's, Benteke's, van Persie's, Bale's you can what they're up against. Obviously everyone takes note of the fingertip saves or the save that leaves everyone wonder how it broke the rules of physics, but even the routine saves or the often quick reaction save through traffic, deflection are the ones goalkeepers don't get credit for. This shit is tough and to see what Pepe does along with his distribution, positioning, and organization of his defense have helped the club tremendously. Of course his punching and penalty saving lately has left a little more to be desired, but can't have your cake and eat it too these days.

I think the obvious problem with our team the past two seasons is the clubs complete and utter inability to convert the goalscoring chances. Just to put things in perspective:

Last season, we were 4th best in terms of the teams that conceded the least amount of goals and not by much. Citeh had the best record with 34 goals conceded to our 43. We scored a hell of a lot, but the bulk of that came in the second half of the season where we were flying and in no coincidence we had a very tight ship after getting our defense in order. We could have a much better ratio had we gotten our shit together 1st half of the season. The Scum had +43 GD but still conceded the same amount of goals we did.

2011/2012: We were the 3rd best team in terms of goals conceded. Why were we 8th then? Well, might have something to do with the fact that we scored only 47 goals for a +7 GD ratio. Citeh had a +64 GD. Hard to climb up the table with that service. Don't forget Liverpool hit the crossbar and post something like over 35 times that year or something to that effect.

2010/2011:Terrible year where we 5th best team in terms of goals conceded. but just off Arsenal's 4th with one more goal conceded. Let's be honest. The Hodgson Year was terrible and when you have utter garbage like Konchesky (who's got an even trasher mother who ought to know to watch her fucking mouth when talking about Liverpool) letting fullbacks let alone wingers streak by him, it was tough. Liverpool's goal differential +15 to the Scum's +41 GD. Better to forget this nightmare year.

2009/2010: Even in Rafa's last year we were the 3rd best team conceding only 35 to Chelsea's 32 and the Scum's 28. Yeah, they blew us away that year in terms of points but Chelsea scored 45 more goals than us.

The rest of the years, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

Obviously, football isn't about moneyball or pouring through stats. I don't think you can build a team strictly by numbers along. Hasn't been done and now it definitely won't be done with the amount money in the game today. But in this case its easy to point out that Pepe isn't the total liability that people make him out to be. My perception is the total lack of goalscoring ability along with our over reliance on Luis Suarez and with Fernando before him during our recent years. Defensive fits along with severe lack of luck in regards to defender injuries just exacerbated the problem and denied the defense to form any sense of continuity. Other Premiership clubs have a bottomless wallet where they can buy some exceptional defenders to boot while Liverpool haven't had the luxury. I mean, when's the last time we bought at 20M pound centerback? The fack that even happens now is mindboggling.

Of the teams that were ahead of Liverpool in goals conceded were some world class keepers and the differences the vast majority of the time is marginal at best. I understand you can compare his record with other world class keepers around Europe with the caveat of the style of play differences, but there's no question that the intangible physical differences and quicker tempo of the Premiership puts things in Pepe's favor and there are a lot of world class keepers in Europe that he bested. Plus even with his youth and early professional career connections with Barcelona, it says a lot when they target him for Valdes replacement even though I think Pepe is better by a country mile.

You're right that good defense alignments helped or were a big part of his clean sheets, but if that's the case then they also have to take responsibility for putting him in situations where he conceded to be completely fair. May not be the best, but he's a very good goalkeeper who's saved our bacon more than he's cost us in my view. He is/was one of the rocks in the back that allowed our defenses to form even in the worst of times. If he goes, which I think he will, he'll always be one of my favorites and one of the greats for sure. David James was in the middle of his tenure at Liverpool when I started supporting and comparing Pepe to the likes of James, young Friedel, Westerveld (good god), Kirkland, Carson, Dudek (last years), you can see why he's been our 1st choice for the past 7-1/2 years.

If we can ""splash a bit cash"" this window, bring in a top class midfielder like Paulinho, maybe Bernard, and a striker like Soldado, then all of a sudden the club has taken a huge leap forward, and very possibly over that tipping point.

And then it ends, or rather, that specific version of the Doctor ends. 

The emotions I feel at that point are such an interesting and wild mix, it almost feels like I'm having an emotional seizure. It's a crazy trip, where it start with sadness, followed by anger, followed by more sadness, followed then by a great sense of worry and even possibly doubt, which is all then followed by a great sense of longing for the past as we wait for the new Doctor to make his appearance once again, knowing that the person that we have come to know and love won't be there to greet us. 

And then, seemingly against all the odds, against everything that I've felt for the past months, against all of my instincts that are screaming at me, telling me to be ready to be disappointed, I instead feel an absolute and total sense of joy and happiness. Every worry, every doubt, every ill thought and feeling is totally erased and is replaced by a sincere sense of feeling... *at home*. As if it were meant to be, as if it had always been meant to be. Because it was! Because this is Doctor Who. This is what it's all about. 

I've never felt so fondly towards a television show before. It's an awesome experience and one I hope I get to continue enjoying for the rest of my life. 

Three cheers to Doctor Who! Three cheers to it's creators, to it's directors, to it's actors, to it's crew, to the very idea and the passion that acts as the driving force behind it.

if she was physically mature enough that it would cause no damage, and she was willing, I wouldn't wan't that to be a crime

so then you agree that a 15 year old could be mentally mature enough, but also that a 19 year old could not be? the idea of an arbitrary age is inconsistant with it's reasoning, if it's about both physical and mental readiness then age really isn't the issue and so it shouldnt be in law. 

now you can just say I'm so wrong with no reasoning again sure but I think I have a reasonable opinion that this girl knew exactly what she was doing, and that *she* should have every right to a relationship if she wants one, without fear of destroying the life of the person she wants.

oh that is right... Sky High Taxes, High Rents, High Cost of Living and No Jobs.


When you see some councils charging more in Business rates per Square Metre in Rochdale than in Harrods in London, you know something is not quite right.

First place for cuts to be made is simply, a top down, Root and Branch review of wages, perks and job use within the Public sector.

Yes yes, people will flee in droves if we do it... but with current unemployment rates, I think we could find people who would do the jobs for lower wages and lesser perks.

For example, do Public Services *REALLY* need gold plated pensions? massive bonuses for simply achieving targets? massive holiday entitlement?

as a Private Sector employee, If pay into my own Pension (company pays same amount) I pay into a SAYE share scheme, I get my bonus as a maximum of xx% of my salary assuming the company achieves over xx% beyond our internal targets, and assuming I meet my personal objectives. Some public sector employees seem to get massive bonuses just for coming into work!!

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;The fact something like this has gone on for ages yet people aren't being arrested willy nilly (as far as I know) for stuff they've admitted to privately if somewhat comforting.

It's much better, from their perspective, to coerce free people into doing unsavoury things than it is just to lock them up. Oh I notice you've been looking at some midget bondage porn, *wouldn't that be embaressing if your family knew?*

Basically this *is* the Politburo.

&gt;I myself have frequented some piracy sites in my time but haven't been arrested for it... And imagine the amount of idiots that talk about crimes they have committed over Facebook or via emails yet they haven't been caught.

Honestly not generally important enough. What is important is if you're acting against the interests of the individuals for whom these organisations operate. The wealthy and powerful. Then you'll be quickly picked up on, or they'll simply trawl through your history and charge you with something historical. In your case, they would threaten you with piracy for sharing copyrighted material *unless* you do this one little job for them...

&gt;I assume the system is literally just a list of keywords that get flagged and then people look at them for context to see if it is a genuine worry or not.

If you pour billions into software you can get much more intelligent results than that. People are inefficient and make mistakes.

&gt; I agree it does set a scary precedent and I would rather it not happen, but I think it's a bit of a slippery slope argument when people think suddenly the government will turn 'evil' and use it to start silencing people who have different viewpoints to themselves.

Again, it just depends on your activities. As long as you keep your head down and don't upset the status quo, they don't care about you.

I don't think you mean ""anti-fetish"", and even assuming I did have the feelings I think you meant towards him, it would still not make my observation odd. You clearly can't make the distinction, but my feelings towards him are separate from that fact.

&gt;There you go again... you are talking about extradition to the US which you believe is conspiratorial crackpot fantasy when it is not, thus Grand Juries are highly relevant especially when Ecuador has given Assange asylum from the US threat.

It is still a hypothesis, and it will be till we have proof that they intend to ask to have him extradited. 

&gt;When you deny the threat and Ecuadorean ruling you are unequivocally lying and thus should be given no credence whatsoever.

I don't deny the Ecuadorean ruling. I think Ecuador as a country is a fucking joke when it comes to human rights, but I don't deny their ruling. As for the threat, it's not what we're discussing here. you should read the thread before you decide to force yourself on us. We're discussing the need to prove guilt before an extradition.

true,Bragzor,null,null,"&gt;No, you went as far as mocking others for believing such a fantasy. You said: ""there was no evidence beyond some useless Stratfor email"" and [ad hominem removed] you are shifting your cover to a position of ignorance: ""more evidence than I at the time knew about""

At one point, that was all people had to go on, and they were just as sure about themselves as you were, thus the mocking. And what is wrong with admitting that you didn't know all the sources? Does your ego really need me to gravel and tell you what a low and pathetic human I am for not knowing all the evidence for a grand jury?

&gt;You most likely knew about it, you were hoping others didn't. For someone having so closely followed everything about the case (revealed by your history) it is unbelievable that you didn't know about it.

I knew about the rumour, and I knew about the stratfor email. Since I'm not that interested in the wikileaks case (as I told you before), I had not learned about the other evidence. I can see why you would think so though. As someone who consider Assange and Wikileaks to be one and the same, it's natural that you would think that the wikileak case and the Assange case are the same too, and that I therefore would be interested in the grand jury.

&gt;Either way you are dishonest or ignorant and should be ignored.

Or right, most of the time. I appreciate that you've tried to inject some kind of logic (logic or) into your smear campaign though.

&gt;These aren't ad hominem attacks.

Yes they are. You're attacking my person instead of what I'm saying in this case. That's the definition.

&gt; I say what you say is untruthful because of the inherent falsehoods and omissions I point out

You haven't pointed out any ""falshoods"" or ""omissions"" I've made in this thread. You've misrepresented our earlier encounters and you have instructed the person I'm talking to, do history mining and then ignore me, not based on my arguments, but on what he thinks about my former arguments (which are not related).

&gt;then my argument concludes that because you spread misinformation so feverishly you are a shill of some sort,

Feverishly? Only in a truly deranged minds is having an interest considered proof of shilling. Fucking biology professors out there, shilling against creationism… 

&gt;whether some anti-fan boy or girl, jilted ex-lover or even a professional shill. You are part of the smear campaign my dear friend whether consciously or not.

What smear campaign? The anti-judging-before-exradition campaign? The anti-immunity-to-extradition campaign? What cause am I shilling against or for? You have no proof whatsoever, and that's because there is non to find. In the meanwhile you continue with your own smear campaign against me, for whatever reason.

I have what? The 100% guaranteed extradition to the US as soon as he leaves the embassy is most certainly misinformation coming from, not so much the Assange ""camp"", as from his unruly cult followers. I have accepted your proof (some would perhaps leave it at that, but you seemingly have to bring it up all the time, like the humble ""winner"" you are), but I still haven't seen any extradition request, and until I do that, it's not relevant to my interests.

&gt;That's clearly not the case because I have a well rounded reddit persona. Yours almost exclusively exists to shill against Wikileaks and Assange.

Again, stop confusing Assange and Wikileaks. They're two separate entities. As for having a ""well rounded reddit persona"", I wouldn't know, since I don't history mine. I have no need to, since what I'm discussing is here, in front of me. The only reason I would have to go through someone's history, is to find an excuse to ignore them. Besides, your persona is just a few months old. A few more of these long conversations, and we'll see what happens to that roundness. Not that I consider roundness a singe of anything. I don't look down on people who only post in /r/football for having an interest either.

&gt;Seen as you can't keep abreast of the evidence (eg that for the Grand Jury) perhaps you aren't in the best person to have adopted such a task.

No, it was a misstake of me to venture out of my comfort zone. I should never have said anything about the grand jury, because I haven't been following it that closely. That said, how long will you rely solely on that conversation in your smear campaign against me?

&gt;Let's add arrogant to the list of vices along with ignorant and dishonest.

Why would you keep a list of your own vices?

&gt;So I take the bunkem you write (your history), note clear patterns, omissions, distractions, and untruths and that is being spun into an ad hominem attack?

Yes. Stick to the subject like a honest person would. Discussions are an exchange of ideas and opinions, not going through peoples web history. Leave the latter to NSA or GCHQ.

&gt;Ad hominem means ""to the man"" not ""to the words""!

Hate to break it to you, but we're not conversing in latin, so the literal meaning is utterly pointless.

Yes but not at the point we had that conversation. Another untruth, not the whole truth, and something but the truth.

&gt; I can see why you would think so though. As someone who consider Assange and Wikileaks to be one and the same

That's a largely meaningless charge and again dishonest. Ecuador granted Assange asylum in part because of the US threat brought about by his work in Wikileaks. To cry about irrelevance is bare faced cheek indeed: [""Your honor, I object! Because it's devastating to my case!""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119528/quotes). 

&gt; and that I therefore would be interested in the grand jury

You made such claims as ""Assange has nothing to fear from the US"" thus you have to have been interested in the Grand Jury. To not pursue the evidence shows partisanship.

&gt; Only in a truly deranged minds is having an interest considered proof of shilling. Fucking biology professors out there, shilling against creationism…

Look, I get it, this is an issue where most people are not prepared to even think about placing blame on anyone or anything except the ""paedophile teacher who took advantage"" - and if someone tries to argue even slightly against that then they are ""paedophile sympathisers"" or some other bullshit. I'm not at all trying to say what he did was right in any way - It was massively wrong and fucked up and stupid and all of that, and I agree he should be convicted under the child sexual offences laws, and be banned from working anywhere near schools or kids again, because that is the law and that is how that works, he broke those laws so he is guilty of doing so, and I agree with that. But there is also the fact that this girl actively pursued him, as well as him reciprocating, they both made terrible stupid choices.

Someone said in this thread that she was ""*described as a ""very quiet"" girl and someone who ""kept herself to herself*""  - well, I'm sorry but I dont buy that, no girl who ""keeps themselves to themselves"" actively pursues a sexual relationship with their teacher and runs away to France with him. She herself also told detectives: “*There was no naivety about it. It was what I wanted, I wanted it even more and probably encouraged it. It was something that was going to happen.*” It's cant be both; she was either a shy innocent girl that was taken advantage of, or she wanted a relationship with this guy and pursued it.

Yes he is to blame, he should have done something about it, told someone what was happening (in fact he did at one point, he complained to the girls mother about her advances - [source](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/i-cant-let-her-ruin-my-career-what-teacher-jeremy-forrest-told-mother-in-schoolgirl-abduction-trial-8663703.html)) and moved her to another class, walked away well before any of this happened, or even moved schools himself - or *something!* - and he's a fucking idiot for everything he did in this case, but all I was trying to say was that she also had a small part to play in how this turned out.

I already admitted that I was poorly informed at the time. How is it a untruth to point out that I based my reaction on old information?

&gt;That's a largely meaningless charge and again dishonest.

What charge? The fact that you storm in here, in a thread that's not at all about *wikileaks*, accusing me of being a shill against *wikileaks*, when I very seldom say anything about wikileaks, and even more seldom anything negative about it? This is not the first time either. You consequently refer to me shilling against *wikileaks*.

&gt;Ecuador granted Assange asylum in part because of the US threat brought about by his work in Wikileaks. To cry about irrelevance is bare faced cheek indeed: [1] ""Your honor, I object! Because it's devastating to my case!"". 

So? What does that have to do with anything? Ecuador can claim it was about his fear of werewolf for all I care, and so can Assange. I'm not interested in what any of those claim to believe, because it's a dead end. They could be lying and there's no way we would know. It's not like I'm the only one suspecting this to be political on Ecuadors end, and it's not like I'm the only one noticing the inconsistencies in Assange's behaviour. That doesn't mean they're lying, but the point is that we can't know, which makes it pointless to try, and subsequently to base theories on their honesty/dishonesty.

&gt;You made such claims as ""Assange has nothing to fear from the US"" thus you have to have been interested in the Grand Jury. To not pursue the evidence shows partisanship.

No, he has nothing to fear because he's protected by the laws of the UK, Sweden, and the EU, not because the US don't want him. You should at least try to understand my argument. The grand jury is not interesting. If they can come up with a legitimate charge, then Assange **should** be extradited there, if they can not, then he will not be extradited. That's as far as my interest in them goes.

&gt;Deranged is the classic ad hominem by the way.

Then I hope you don't own up to the accusation laid upon the deranged. Would you really admit to putting an equal sign between having an interest and being a shill? I doubt it.

&gt;Having an interest is not what you display, you are an (anti)activist.

Yes, it most certainly is. BTW, you really should reconsider how you use the word ""anti"" everywhere. I'm pretty sure you're trying to say that I'm an activist. I wouldn't normally say anything, but this is like the third time you do this in this discussion alone.

&gt;You persistently seek to alter what others believe and attack Wikileaks supporters, yet try to pass the behaviour off as if some casual interest.

Again, with the Assange=Wikileaks thing... Seriously, if you ignore your sensationalistic formulations, you're basically saying that I try to inform Assange supporters. If you for one moment disconnect your spin-machine, does that sound bad? They are often fairly uninformed because of information bias, so they often don't know basic facts. There are still people who think Assange is accused of not wearing a condom, and if everyone who points out that that is wrong are called shills, then these people will stay ignorant and misinformed. I never claimed that my interest was casual (yet another example of you putting words in my mouth), but it doesn't consume me either.

&gt;The only assertions have been that there is almost certainly a Grand Jury and that extradition is likely.

There is almost certainly a grand jury, but it's purpose is not as certain, and any extradition **request** is just speculation, unless you have something to back that up. As I've said, I'm not that well informed about the grand jury. Any actual extradition seems fairly uncertain at this point.

&gt;Only posting in one sub is different than focusing on one subject.

The subject of that subreddit is... wait for it... football.

&gt;Another rhetorical ad hominem.

Or a apt description. I'm not suggesting you ignore them, so it's not really a ad-hominem.

&gt;That's just self-refuting stupidity. Either you use words in their conventional form or explain to people when you have totally changed the meaning. Ad hominem means attempting to refute an argument by a personal reference: ""he's a man, he knows nothing of the plight of woman"".

Wherein lies the self-refutation ? On my part that is. I can see how you're refuting yourself by citing the literal meaning when it's the ""totally changed"" meaning we use today, and then point this out, presumably to me. Your example about what ad hominem is, is almost exactly what you're doing to me.

&gt;""History mining"" a person's words is what all good legal processes do, all good journalists, and all good biographers. Ignorance isn't strength.

That's not what you're doing though. You're saying ""this guy uses this word a lot, must mean he's a shill. I better tell everyone about it so they can ignore him, not for what he has said, but of what subjects he like to discuss"". It's a bit like accusing a WW2 historian of being a Nazi because a lot of his papers contain the word ""nazi"".

I'm actually pretty sick of politicians on all sides of the fence summoning the *""spirit of the war/post-war years""* as if to portray austerity to some noble military endevaour on the home front... when in reality we all know it has nothing to do with our working ethos on the 'home front' and is entirely to do with structural trade imbalances in our import orientated economy, exacerbated by global supply issues, an aging demographic and monetary issues in the neighbouring Eurozone.

I actually sympathise slightly with Miliband (not so much that I'd vote for him though)... he is in a difficult position with 2 years still to go until a general election. But in 2015 things might be **very** different so he is understandably reticent to throw his cards down now -- as they will only be dredged back up again by the opposition in 2 years time to haunt him. Keeping tight lipped about exact policy with few concrete details is probably the smartest thing he can if he wants to get elected. Infact, being seen to be complicit with austerity is probably one of the worst things Miliband can do right now -- which strangely he seems to be pushing for.

In 2015 the long term trajectory of the economy will be much clearer... we might be turning the corner out of a protracted recession, or perhaps more likely buckling down for a 'lost decade' and perpetual economic decline. Clegg-Cameron will ultimately succeed or fail based on the public perception of the effectiveness of austerity in 2015. We will also by then have the outcome of the Scottish referrendum. A suprise yes vote could shift the focus of the next parliament completely from the economy to Scots sucession and the future of the union (arguably something the Torys might be better at in the public eye, if it comes to driving a hard bargain with the Scots over the division of UK wealth).

Quick update (I am posting from my phone while sitting next to link whom is also on the phone getting an update, we only just got wifi). He said apparently this is a big enough problem to cause issues as Aspas doesn't have the 3.5m extra to pay the agents. 

If anyone has any questions I am staying 1 night with my link to Aspas so I can probably slip simple questions into conversation.

This then creates the ['Ripple Effect'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suugn-p5C1M&amp;feature=player_embedded) that eventually causes delays.



The other issue is everyone does 80mph, HGVs and Towing vehicles do 56ish MPH - HGV overtakes in central lane (since getting 20tons upt o speed takes time) thus closing off two lanes, you then get people zooming down motorway and hitting traffic at 56mph, they then try to pull into the outside lane to overtake the HGV, thus having to accelerate, this then impacts the other drivers doing 80mph who have to slow down, thin causing a bottleneck where traffic accelerating away is lower than the incoming traffic at 80mph..



Basic science, cause and effect, and not something that changing the speed limit to 80 is really going to solve, indeed driving at that speed will more likely consume more petrol and lead to more frequent replacement of tires....

If anything it is drivers themselves who need to be driving smarter, christ doing 80mph on a 50 mile journey is just saving minutes, if your coming off at the next junction be in the inside lane ready to leave, not the outside lane trying to be Knight Fucking Rider....

1. £120 for Sky Movies is way too expensive. I used to have Sky Movies + Sky Sports from Virgin Media (cable, so not directly from Sky) for £34pcm. I cancelled it after about a year as I ended up never watching it (took the package for live tennis on Sky Sports, mostly). There are some good movies, occasionally, but this is 2013 - I need stuff on demand, I'm not going to plan my life around Sky.

2. Netflix (UK) is a mixed bag. They are good for TV shows, I find, not so much for movies. At £6pcm it's quite cheap, so I keep it around in case I feel like watching a TV show here and there.

3. Lovefilm is £8pcm for unlimited streaming and a DVD rental service. Their online catalogue is only a fraction of what they offer in DVD rentals, unfortunatelly. Having said that, they seem a bit better than Netflix when it comes to movies. Still nto great, though. They also won't allow AirPlay from iPad, so I can't watch it on telly (although Sony BR/TV devices offer Lovefilm as a builtin service, the interface is always very fiddly, so I end up not using it that way at all).

In the end I cancelled Sky Movies/Sports. And I plan on cancelling the rest of my Virgin Media TV package and go streaming only (iPlayer, Catchup service on freeview channels, Netflix, LoveFilm. That should be enough).

There's a fine comment on the site, which I'll reproduce.

For those who believe in free market regardless, it's worth considering who it is that fall for scams, rip-offs, entrapment products and mis-selling. Here's my non-scientific list of such people…

1. Mental health sufferers. It's reported one in four people in the UK every year suffer from mental health problems, and at such times may be incapable of acting in their own best interest.

2. Those who don't read every term and condition. Over 30 pages of legalese terms and conditions aren't unheard of. If you don't read them all, well, you must be ""stupid"", I suppose.

3. The blind or partially sighted. According to the RNIB, websites are commonly not optimised for screen readers, which can lead to people making unavoidable mistakes.

4. Those with learning disabilities.

5. New parents and others who are sleep deprived.

6. Dyslexics, dyscalculics and the functionally illiterate.

7. People whose partner looked after the finances, then died. Joint finances managed by one spouse are common, especially among older generations. When that person passes away, it's easy to make naive mistakes when tackling complex finances for the first time.

8. Those with dementia.

9. Financial phobics. This is often linked to other mental health conditions, such as when a person with an anxiety disorder is too scared to open bills.

10. Those who trust banks. Take the PPI mis-selling; many were lied to that it was compulsory, some had it added, having turned it down, or had it added without asking. Is that stupidity?

So guess what, it's not just jobless chavs getting a hundred to spend on stella and chips.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"Unless you're planning to be living with parents for the long term, you're going to be paying rent. Take advantage of low rates now and buy a house with a 5 year fixed rate mortgage (or longer if you can get it). Look into first time buyer schemes, you might be able to get as little as 5% down. Nobody can predict with certainty, but I'd expect interest rates to have climbed a fair bit within the next 12 months.  

Now I know this is taking on debt, but your repayments can end up being about half what you'd pay in rent, you can rent a spare room out tax free, and you can always rent the whole thing or sell it if you want to move on.  

You might be tempted to pay a higher deposit to borrow less. Personally I think this is a bad idea - you can always overpay your mortgage, but if you need money back or can't pay the mortgage for six months and have no savings you're going to end up paying a lot more. Nationwide for example do a flex mortgage where you can overpay up to £500/month without charge, but if you ever need to you can phone them up and tell them you want to stop making payments until you're not in credit any more. Note this would only last 5 years though, and make sure you tell them you want overpayments to reduce your term and not your monthly payment.  

Personally I was in the same situation as you after uni (except with a little less) and I used it to buy a house cheap, rented it out straight away and it's still rented out now a few years later, pulling about £160/month after the mortgage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Because it doesn't work like that, even Keynes himself said that his formula for stimulating an economy out of recession only works on a net growth basis if you **stimulate the economy using savings and not debt**. You can't stimulate the economy more than the interest on debt will cost you, it's impossible. You can however stimulate the economy more than you would have else while got interest on the cash you've saved. 

The other flaw in the logic for stimulating the economy using more debt is that people say ""well the UK currently has low interest rates, we can borrow more"", however the increase in interest rates is logarithmic the more you borrow, and if you actually look at how much more the UK can borrow before interest rates shoot up above the impossible to pay back 7% Greek, Italian and Spanish bankruptcy level then it's not much more debt than we currently have, the government is walking a very fine line and has it's hands tied. It's also worth noting that before people say ""well that would never happen to the UK, we are independent financially"", we have gone bankrupt before only a few decades ago in 1976 and required a bail out from the IMF.

I actually believe that whilst the policy of printing money which the BOE is currently doing is the best option for the government right now in the short term, that is our life support, and during that time they should do everything in their power to reduce the debt so when printing money no longer works we can then borrow more and have some breathing room in which to manoeuvre.",0,1371907368,null,0,1371912768,0,cao0ajo,t3_1gstno,t1_cao0ajo,t1_cank157,null,1430721750,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You will need an NI number, but you can apply for and start jobs before hand, you just need to tell payroll of your NI number as soon as possible (Had to go through this with my new employee who moved here from the EU). [Getting a new NI number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number)

With the NSA, they appear to be grabbing everything they can and storing it indefinitely, which could potentially be abused in the future. On the other hand, if GCHQ are filtering the data before storage (e.g. dropping P2P traffic) and only storing it for 30 days, I get the impression that they are only concerned with current threats, and there is no database open to future abuse.

Obviously there are still privacy implications with the GCHQ monitoring, and I can't say that I am particularly in favour of it, but they seem to be taking a much more reasonable approach.

It also shouldn't be too surprising - they practically say they do this on the GCHQ website:

It seems to ignore the interests of vast swaithes of the private sector, of the hundreds of thousands of low paid workers in the financial services industry in order to advocate an agenda which appeals to the ideology of this exceptionally small, fringe group, claiming to represent the people.

So, I ask, how many of those people who claim to represent the people voted to keep FPTP and reject AV? Over two thirds of the electorate did in a plebicite, it stands to reason these people, reflecting the views of the people, should as well.

Do just under half of them support the death penalty? Did most of them support Iraq?

They are liars, hypocrites and charlatens putting 'People' in front of their name to claim false legitimacy when they have none.

They are the 1% of protestors, the ones who make careers and capital out of exploiting people who actually work and who actually have views, and they claim legitimacy when they have no electoral or political mandate.

I mean, what if that's only happened for a year? What about 3 or more years, where for most of the time they are unable to function ""normally"" due to an underlying depression/anxiety/etc.  

What if the mental challenges they face are quite tangible to their mental experiences, e.g. if they were transgender or had a lot of bad experience from their childhood, ..., etc - should that mean they're not ""disabled"" but just having a long case of the ""blues""?

It's quite clear that in the situation where they try to or are even helped but are still yet unable to overcome their situation, that they are sick.

So, should they not just simply receive a sickness benefit indefinitely to save them the hassle?

I mean, ultimately it would be a lot better and easier if the government rolled out a guaranteed income program.  I mean, if they lose their sickness benefit and it makes them worse and thereby unable to work due to not being able to function, shouldn't that mean that they actually need that benefit?

Or are they just a filthy benefit scrounger?

B) He plays as no. 9 for us, with torres as no. 2 striker. Both of these are scenarios that will be costliest mistakes for his career.

5) We can't say for sure. It depends on which style we play in, when he returns to play with first team. If we stick with our current system, I can't see him match Drogba. But, with changes coming from Mourinho's tactics might make our system more to Lukaku's liking.

Meaning if the shit hits the fan, the investment (the club) is left holding the bag, not them. Many, many businesses have failed in the US with that kind of investment. When that happens, the assets are usually stripped and sold separately to try to recoup as much money for the bank. Make no mistake, we were hours away from being permanently fucked as a club. H&amp;G hardly put a downpayment on the club when buying so thats why the interest rates were astronomical. Then they got PIK loans when they were getting desperate and those carry something like 15-25% interest. Death fucking sentence. Essentially its low risk for them for putting minimal investment on the club. The FA saw the potential disaster with those kinds of purchases and outlawed those kind of transfers. The Glazers have gotten super lucky with United still winning and recouping a lot of money with the TV deals. It's no secret of why they sold Ronaldo and didn't invest the vast majority of that money towards new players. It went straight to their interest and principal debt. Ronaldo out and Nani &amp; Valencia in? Ha. Fair play to them that they're going to get through it. The Scum supporters knew what was going on and that's why they had the Green and Yellow campaign. Funny how quickly that went tits up when it was business as usual. One of the main think keeping the wolves at bay for the Glazers is the TV money that they pulled the last few seasons.

true,thunderingblue,BR,brazil,"Basically his debut season in the PL and Romelu did very well. Missed a few chances early in the season but he played great overall.

I'm under the impression that Romelu should stay and fight for a place in the squad. Jose plays who's earned it and I think if Romelu practices and plays with the passion he displays, I believe he could get at least 20 some odd starts for Chelsea. Especially if he finds the back of the net.

He might not beat 17 league goals this term. We have many more players capable of finding the back of the net than West Brom. But that shouldn't be seen as a failure. However if he gets hot and starts a string of games in a row he could get back in the upper teens again. 

I don't want to start comparing him to Drogba in the least bit. He's only 20 and light years ahead of where Drogba was at his age. Let's just allow Romelu to be our Romelu Lukaku and not our next Drogba. But I think Romelu is the player to lead our line for years to come.

Also he wasn't just playing in the Jupiler League as a 16 year old.. Romelu was winning the Golden Boot for the league as a 16 year old. I think he can become a World Class player and if he continues working hard he can achieve that. 

""With talent you can get far, but with working hard you get farther."" My favorite Romelu quote. As long as he continues with this state of mind, he should realize that potential.

I'd say the decision on whether someone is ""cured"" enough to move from the sickness benefits onto JSA should be made by their doctor. If the person is signed off as ""suitable for work"", then there should also be a monitoring period where it's made simpler to switch back to the previous support too - maybe this is the case.. I have no experience of it and have spent a total of 5 weeks on JSA in my entire life, I don't plan on ever claiming it again - it's not worth the effort for the money tbh.

I don't think anyone is a filthy benefit scrounger, although I do think that there is a minority who take advantage of the system.. but that's true in all walks of life.. IMO they're idiots as there's no real quality of life to be had when living off of the benefits system.. they'd do better in the long run to change their lifestyle and work.

I do think that providing a system of support which allows someone to perpetually live on benefit when they are capable of supporting themselves does no one any favours - neither society as a whole or the person receiving the benefit. In some ways, I suspect that facilitating the cyclic lifestyle of a person with depression/anxiety is irresponsible.. I don't think of either condition as one which should be viewed as permanent - one should learn to cope with the condition and function around it. This includes earning a living.

That said, I also think that people with such a condition deserve both financial, medical and personal support from the welfare system in order to assist them when their symptoms are at their greatest. Ideally, the medical and welfare sides would work in harmony to provide a balance of care.. although I accept this is easier said than done.

There's no easy solution and it may be that the cheapest option for the taxpayer (aside from simply cutting people off as it seems the current government is doing) is to provide a universal payment to people with these illnesses and bypass the additional support, although I think this simply continues the cycle for many rather than helping them.",0,1371913439,null,0,false,0,cao1jt3,t3_1f6vgp,t1_cao1jt3,t1_cao1483,null,1430721158,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Normally these kind of youth phenomenons fade out rather quickly. Yet Lukaku had so much strength and speed he could keep using it at the highest level, aswell as showing enormous will and motivation to improve his technical skills.

That last bit is truely his only hope, as for now he is not suited for any top side and I laugh at people suggesting he should be Chelsea's first choice striker. He would probably break a leg combining with Mazacar.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"1. Pretty clear that Romelu had a great season. Steve Clarke did a great job for us, integrating him into the West Brom team at an ideal pace. His goal tally itself was impressive, but his goals-to-game ratio is the highlight. ..outstanding.

2. I want him to stay (which seems to be the case anyways). We now have a manager that we can trust to mold him into a magnificent player, and we need the depth at striker anyways. I'm not sure he will be 1st choice, but he'll definitely be more than a squad player. 

3. Like I said, I'd prefer not to loan him. I've heard a lot of people suggesting Swansea would be ideal in terms of playing time (no competition), play-style, and European experience (Europa League). No doubt he'd be great for them, which is exactly why I don't want it to happen. I fear how good Swansea could be with Romelu at the pointy end. More importantly, he'd good enough to make contributions for Chelsea. 

4. Yes. Last season only consistently started games in the 2nd half of the season, meaning he could see a similar minutes total this year. If he plays a similar amount, he'll probably have improved enough as a player to bang in a few more.

5. He's not the next Drogba. He's Romelu Lukaku. Maybe he can be as important for Chelsea, but he's not the same player. 

6. We can look at player potential in 3 broad categories: physical traits, technical traits, and mental traits. He's essentially at the top of his physical game already, though that's not stopping him from trying to max out his potential there. To become one the best players - perhaps even *the* best player, he has to work on the second two categories. He has a good deal to work on in terms of technical skill, especially concerning his touch and passing. There are signs that these aspects got better at West Brom, but they're still not at the level necessary to be a top striker. His mental game also showed signs of improvement during his loan spell, and you can see the development of his understanding with his team and the timing of his runs. These things simply improve with playing time, so they're at a good level for a teenager. Barring any major setbacks, I think Lukaku will be one of the best.",0,1371914337,null,0,false,0,cao1s36,t3_1guumg,t1_cao1s36,t3_1guumg,null,1430721038,12,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,12

http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa

&gt;However, an obscure clause allows the foreign secretary to sign a certificate for the interception of broad categories of material, as long as one end of the monitored communications is abroad. But the nature of modern fibre-optic communications means that a proportion of internal UK traffic is relayed abroad and then returns through the cables.

&gt;Parliament passed the Ripa law to allow GCHQ to trawl for information, but it did so 13 years ago with no inkling of the scale on which GCHQ would attempt to exploit the certificates, enabling it to gather and process data regardless of whether it belongs to identified targets.

&gt;The categories of material have included fraud, drug trafficking and terrorism, but the criteria at any one time are secret and are not subject to any public debate. GCHQ's compliance with the certificates is audited by the agency itself, but the results of those audits are also secret.

 
&gt;The Guardian understands that a total of 850,000 NSA employees and US private contractors with top secret clearance had access to GCHQ databases.

How the hell can you be reassured by that incredibly lax framework particularly when most of it is secret. You can't be that naive.

Furthermore, as you said ""[I don't] know right from wrong."" which is not true, I'm indifferent to what may constitute right or wrong as it is a simple social construct. Perhaps moral nihilism is a better description than amoralism.

If someone believes in the death penalty then so be it, their moral standpoint is as valid as someone who opposes it. The zeitgeist ebs and flows.

Yes, I do have personal opinions about things of course I do but I tend to approach it from a utilitarian view point and as such I don't claim it to be a moral viewpoint only that on the basis of social/economic utility a given position can be considered a rational choice. 

So, to give an example using the current context, if a criminal has been found guilty of multiple brutal murders then if it can be deemed more cost-effective to do so I have no particular objection to having him killed since it removes a known risk to society and society does not have to expend scarce resources keeping him incarcerated. Itself may constitute a form of cruel and unusual punishment. 

Incidentally, for those who have been handed multiple life sentecnes and face no prospect of ever being freed (some 500 people according to the BBC recently) I would give them the choice as to when they want to end their life. It seems even crueler to keep the Moors murder alive by force-feeding him then simply to let him die if that is his wish.

Either way going back to your (and many others) point that the death penalty is inherently wrong is absolutist bollocks. It's as idiotic as those who say gay marriage is inherently wrong. There may be valid arguments against bot hin which case make them, don't trivialise a debate to ""them"" and ""us"" as such chilidish tribalism is what feeds our pathetic political system.

Having said that, governments get elected by making pledges and demonstrating achievements. In the recent past our (labour) governments got elected by explaining how they had increased spending on X, Y and Z leading to decreased waiting times/better performance etc. 

However this government don't have any money to spend (although you can argue whether that really is the case). So instead they need to do two things: 1) capitalise on every small/inconsequential achievement (i.e. a 0.001% fall in road traffic accidents during their government and 2.) simply not do anything that might uncessessarily aggravate voters. This government are already typecast as the uncaring bastions of austerity - last thing they need is to go and upset 40% of their core female voters like the article suggests. I suspect as well that their research suggests that although 53% were in favour of increasing the limit, it probably wasn't an election-influencing piece of policy. However the 40% that opposed the move were probably the vehemently opposed busy-bodies we've all come to loathe whose votes may have been influenced by such a change.

Rodgers clearly believes (and I agree) that competition keeps players sharp.

Not ever player is Suarez, and gives 100%, players are humans who get complacent.
Sticking a rocket up their arse by having someone breathing down their neck is just the ticket a lot of players need.

Or it also works out as if you stick two great players together, they have a bit of competition in training itself as they attempt to outdo each other.

Ofc it's more likely that it also helps that Pepe is on the way out next season and mignolet signing is more because of the opportunity.

Also, Liverpool has a history of offering gentlemans' agreements to sell players if they stick around for another year.  We did it with Alonso, Mascherano, and supposedly Torres.  I could see us going to Reina and asking him what he wanted--which is to go to Barca--and then striking a deal to make it happen next summer.

The right answer to that question is no, or i don't feel depressed just frustrated that i'm not well enough to do what i want. The latter shows you would prefer to work but can't because of medical problems.

The assessment feels like a trial and you are the defendant, you have to stick to the facts and choose your words very carefully.

all your answer to my points have been are judgements with no accompanying justification, kind of like the sentence in this case

&gt;Then she was a paedophile. This is a very weird thing for you to say.

paedophile is a technical term for someone sexually attracted to prepubescent people, I hit puberty age 13, and that is very weird but also a fact.

&gt;You clearly don't have a ""reasonable opinion"" because you patently know fuck all about the negative effects of underage sex. Which is why you don't see an issue with it.

 I guess if you justify to yourself why my opinion is ""not reasonable"" you dont have to think about the issues I am raising, and I will give you points here for consistency, you see things in such black and white that you have decided how everyone will develop to the exact year. 23 if you must know, and no nothing truly awful, but nobody has pointed out what is so awful about this, 

I think you intended to say I patantly know fuck all about the negative effects of unermature sex, which by the way I'm well aware of. the issue I have being that this girl seems pretty much ready for sexual intercourse.

&gt;Like I said, you don't know a bloody thing about this. The ""arbitrary age"" keeps children safe. Further, age is generally a pretty good indicator of maturity.

TIL disagree=dont know about.

I know as much as you do, and ""generally a pretty good indicator"" is far too vague an indicator be used in a system of just, rational and sensible laws.

Now please stop getting angry at me because I don't agree, your logic of ""I know about this therefore anyone with a different opinion is wrong"" is not well thought out in terms of something as subtle and gradual as sexual maturity because it's not a part of the black and white delusion that you live in.

and keeps children safe from what? making decisions on their own? the world? themselves?

DLA is a very different thing though looks similar to most.

If you write all your conditions on your ESA form and are called in for an assessment and you present with symptoms like depression that aren't part of your current medical issues, they'll declare you fit for work since they might feel you don't have the conditions you say you do any more but something else you need to seek medical attention for and reapply.

If you are depressed to the point you can't work then that will be on your form and will be the thing focused on in the assessment, and how your depression prevents you from working. That's the whole point of the ESA, you are telling them why you are unable to work.

Also notice how i use the word assessment and not medical, these things are not done by doctors and existing medical records are not used, only the form you sent in.

How so? Don't forget the humongous financial turds we've flushed away over the past year or so, from Carroll to Cole, with more likely to follow this summer (Downing is on ridiculous money). Freeing up these amounts allows us to have a larger squad on smaller individual wages. I don't see why we can't or won't incorporate depth into the GK spot as well as others. It's not possible to know for certain either way of course, but I don't think that it's at all financially untenable to keep them both.

The ability to quickly borrow a modest sum of money if you have mis-calcluated and are about to go overdrawn, for example. If the total cost of the loan is less than the overdraught charge, and it also saves you the hassle of missed DDs, it is worth it.

We're going to Ireland to scatter his mum's ashes, as they were meant to be visiting Ireland together this summer, but then she developed stage four cancer in January and died in March (six or seven years after recovering from breast cancer). It's going to be a bittersweet trip. I'm going to get champagne ready for after the scattering, and we're going to toast her in style to celebrate her absolute amazingness. Sadly he lost his father to cancer three years ago too, so he is now an orphan. But it’s okay, he’ll always have me. I’m also hoping to drag my parents to Paris to meet him so that they can be his surrogate parents, although September is hella busy for my folks so it may not be possible :/

At present we're booting thousands of desperately sick people into the JobCentre, where they're joining 2.5 million healthy people who've often only just left a job and don't have years of sickness as a gap on their CV.  All chasing half a million jobs.

Ok, kicking someone of ESA to JSA saves the state about 30 to 40 quid a week.

How about doing some genuine job creation, getting people into work so they can claim reduced housing and council tax benefit, none if they somehow get a well paid job, and then once we've matched our 2.5 million health, active jobseekers to work, we can start looking at the sick?

I'd suggest getting one person into a decent job saves more than kicking 10 disabled people off ESA due to 'points'.

I'd also suggest this again proves it's not about money, but about Tory ideology.  Yes Labour started, before you reply with that old one, the Tories have magnified it hugely.

I suppose part of it is a reaction to paternalistic anti-drug rhetoric and policing, but it seems to me that enlightened drug policy should be: 

i) objective identification of which drugs are harmless, making them legal.

ii) objective identification of which drugs are harmful, and helping people to avoid and recover from addictions to those drugs, in the most humane manner possible. 

It's not about people 'making their own choices' to become and stay addicted to really dreadful and damaging substances without any help from the rest of society.

My attitude is that it's nice to talk about ideology, but ultimately people who are completely unprotected will suffer, sometimes in ways in which they and those around them will not be able to recover, and it should be part of government and democracy to work together towards a common idea of what constitutes a good life.

Yes I do have mobility issues that are mostly genetic and not likely to improve, and have gradually worsened over time. I cannot stand without being in chronic sometimes debilitating pain, I cannot grip fine things like pens or pencils etc for very long not even 20 seconds or so without my fingers seizing up, however I do have dexterity enough to use a keyboard/mouse in short bursts. A lot of dealing with the pain and mobility problems it presents quite often goes beyond exhausting me both physically, mentally and emotionally.

I do recieve DLA lower care and higher mobility the mobility which I use toward an adapted vehicle which cost me including paying for the adaptations around £4k, which is nearly 5 years ago. Wheelchair adapted vehicles are on 5 year leases before you have to get another one. The next one at the moment I won't be able to afford as it will cost me a similar up-front payment which I haven't got as I am no longer working. That doesn't take into account the power-chair I use to get around outside needs replacing as it's starting to fall apart. I used to use a manual one but had a lot of problems such as finger dislocations and lacerations and shit (thanks to dog walkers that don't pick up, and late night drinkers who can't use a proper toilet!). As such I need to sell my house to fund the next car and a new power-chair and move to where I can afford a home and probably pay for that to be adapted!

I did get a job in February, but a combination of falling asleep at work and regular rising panic attacks making me hide in the staff toilets for regular periods didn't make me an ideal employee, and it hit a peak one morning when I took my resignation letter and keycard in, but another panic attack stopped me handing it in, I just dumped them on the entrance desk (They'd already cut back on the secretary) and ran.

Fortunately I found a loophole called 'employment by trial' which meant that because I'd stuck it out for four weeks I could go back on JSA even tho I'd 'quit', or I don't know what I'd have done... probably gone and smashed some shop windows to get some prison time to be sure of food and shelter, because I'd have been left with nothing.

The Doctor has spoken English without the TARDIS nearby, like in Blink when he was separated by about 60 years.

It's not reasonable that the machines that are built by Gallifreyans can translate almost (or all) languages in the universe in all space and time but it lacks the ability to do so with the language by the people that built it (although as a side note it is entirely possibly that the Gallifreyan language is based on alignments of planets or some time component which would mean it would change but wouldn't hinder someone who can 'feel' time moving like Gallifreyans can and therefore, ever changing be too difficult).

The only reasonable explanation at this point is that the TARDIS can, but does not, either by programming or by instruction, it would make a unique and helpful security feature that it would be impossible to decipher the language the programming code of a vessel you just captured.

The Doctor says that he speaks Baby and Horse. Not that he can understand it, but that he speaks it.

At that time he will make his decision but until then he's going to chill and relax in Paris.

true,veridical,num2,,"I think it would be a decent move if it happened. He's clearly an excellent player, and even £17m would seem to be a good price. A midfield three of Sandro, Dembélé and Paulinho would be easily one of the best in the prem, and almost certainly the most physically dominant. His signing would likely signal a transition to a 4-3-3, which I think is better in the long run, although it would leave questions about what happens with Siggy, Dempsey and possibly Lennon.

I'd like to think that Levy, Baldini and co. wouldn't move ahead with the deal if they didn't have at least a solid plan of attack on the striker front. There can be no denying by anyone involved with the club now that we need a new striker, and Levy is far too astute to make a big transfer like this without being fairly clear on a striker signing.

Transfers from Brazil are notorious for being leaked left, right and centre, so it wouldn't surprise me if we had a striker signing all-but-completed but kept under much better wraps. I certainly don't think signing Paulinho would mean we won't bring in a striker.

All in all, I'm in favour of the move. He's a great player who would fit our league and tactics excellently, and improves AVBs ability to be flexible tactically - something at which he seems to excel. I also don't think his signing would be at the expense of a striker, but lesser priorities such as left back probably would be neglected. BAE's still got it though.

true,LeTouche,num30-away,,"I was about to make a post basically giving my take on our transfer needs, but I'll do it right here!

We had far too few clean sheets last term. Injuries, yes, Kaboul and Sandro could have really helped our defensive game last year. New style, sure, you'd never see 'arry adopt a high line, and with Vertonghen our only quick CB last year (Bull injured), we sure suffered there too. And with a new keeper, there was some definite teething, as with any new signing, especially a deadline day one.

Meanwhile, up front, we had one incredible striker for the first half of the season in Defoe, who scored over 1 in 2, goal to game, ratio up until christmas. Then Bale came into massive form, filled some shoes, and hammered home some hard fought games. Were we 'Bale-d out'? At times yes. Did we lack penetration, at times, yes. But if Ade found his form a month or two earlier, would we be in the top 4, my answer would also be, yes.

---------------------------------------

There are a lot of new fans on our homely sub who didn't get to see the monster of a striker Ade was for us in 2011. He was one of the best in Europe, bagged just under 20 goals and 20 assists for the season. The [Tottenham vs Newcastle game](http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/02/11/tottenham-vs-newcastle-goals-5-0-highlights-2012-adebayor-saha-kranjcar-assou-ekotto-video/) is a great showing of how lethal he can be, bagging 4 assists and a goal. Best striker performance in a Lilywhite kit I've ever lived to see.

So Ade, settled in london, with a full preseason, no injury, no ACON, no worries about being our #1, with some encouraging performances towards the end of last season, can, and I think will, show up next year. I truly believe that, if push comes to shove, he, Jermain and Gareth can get us through next year.

---------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, we now have Paulinho, assuming the rumours are true, to rotate with Moussa and Sandro, or to play in a midfield 3. If one of them gets injured, then we move to a 4-2-3-1 with Siggy on the wing, or in the CAM position, and Moussa deeper. If they need a rest, then we have great cover.

What we saw at the end of last season was Moussa and Scotty BOTH being subbed off EVERY game. We weren't at our absolute best, because we didn't have adequate cover for our midfield pair, one of whom (Scott), was already filling in for an injured Sandro.

If you extend our average points per match with Sandro, across the whole season, we'd have been level on points with City at the end. And that doesn't even factor in Bale's amazing run of form.

------------------------------------------

In conclusion, I believe that the CDM position is where we dropped points last season, and having Paulinho can really aid our midfield efforts. When you factor in the fact that Scott isn't getting any better at his age, we need some really decent cover, and I believe Paulinho is the answer.

Plus, do we really think that AVB doesn't see that a world class striker could really make a difference for us? I don't think so. I'd rather we signed Paulinho, a world class, expensive CDM, and a young striker, who could just provide some competition for JD and Ade. But, however much I don't want to get sucked into the endless rumours and rituals, I can't help but believe that Paulinho is only the beginning, and we're going to see a very different Tottenham Hotspur to the one we saw a few years ago, next season.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I think there are a few ways to look at it. 

A) We've wasted a big chunk of our transfer budget on maybe our 3rd biggest need.

B) The fact that we're going to spend 17m on our 3rd biggest need bodes well for the rest of this window and suggests we'll be backing our manager.

I think given the Baldini signing the latter is more likely. Paulinho is not a Levy signing at all. He's a player who was linked heavily with Baldini's former club Roma, and fits the profile of more of an AVB target. 

And frankly, I DO believe we needed to invest in another high quality CM who fits our style of play. Sandro has had two serious knee injuries in as many years, Dembele is always getting little niggles and has some sort of chronic hip issue, Parker is 32 years old and in decline, Huddlestone is another injury worry and doesn't fit particularly well with how we want to play, and Livermore is probably never going to be good enough to anchor our midfield weekly.

We're always a few injuries away from having a disastrously bad central midfield. And when you aim to play several combative central midfielders every week, there are going to be some injuries. 

Paulinho gives us an astonishing level of flexibility. We would have to be very unlucky to have Sandro, Paulinho, AND Dembele all injured at the same time. Last season on numerous occasions we couldn't field Dembele or Sandro and it hurt us mightily. 

He could play with our other two beasts in a 4-3-3 or play alongside either one of them in a 4-2-3-1. It also allows us to maybe phase out a few players and phase in a few more. 

If I'm totally honest, I could even see us signing ANOTHER central midfielder in a year or so. I still think we could use TRUE cover for Sandro. A totally defensive midfielder. Paulinho is flexible enough to do that but I have my concerns about Sandro's fitness going forward.

Similarly, if Gareth keeps doing what he does, playing down the middle, we could see him scoring more and more goals, especially if we go for the 4-4-1-1/4-4-2 we played against Arsenal, and others.

I assume from your language you're english, yeah? Did you watch the Basel game, with the Ade pen? I can't find the post match thoughts in the studios, but Shearer put it so well: Supporters just don't understand players like Adebayor. He's putting in all he can, but can come across as lazy, when he's just out of confidence. 

The best thing was seeing his huge smile when he scored against Chelsea. THAT'S the Ade we know and love!

EDIT:

 Adebayor said: ‘I have taken penalties for Arsenal and I have taken penalties for Real Madrid so it’s a gamble. You miss or you score. I missed this one.
‘I am very disappointed but that’s football for you. You just have to keep focused and keep going.

‘It’s a tough one. You run around for 120 minutes. You give everything you have in your stomach and you are tired and at the end of the day you have to take a penalty.

‘You play with 10 men for the last 30 minutes and on top of that you have to take a penalty and the pressure is there when you take the ball... you know. It’s not the reason why we missed - we had to score - but it’s not easy for us.’


I thought that besides Dawson, Ade was the best player on the pitch in extra time! He was holding the ball up, doing his best to win corners or throw-ins while holding off 3 defenders at once. He got the ball and was on his own from there!

I think United will retain their crown. This transition period will be much less painful for them because realistically Fergie will still be calling many of the shots. They're built off stability, and I'm sure they'll look for a two or three year period of SAF gradually relinquishing control to Moyes.

2-5 I don't even want to call. It's going to be incredibly tight. I'm almost certain it'll be some arrangement of City, Chelsea, us and the Gooners, but I have no idea which order.

The Special One may work wonders and get Chelsea second - although I really can't see them beating this Man U - or it may turn out his misfortune at Madrid is indicative of him losing his edge. The signings they have made so far are hardly indicative of a major bid for the title. FFP seems to have started biting them.

City, again, may do very well under Pellegrini, or they may not do too well at all. Their squad is far too talented to fail to get CL, however. 'Not well at all' for City would be fourth. To be honest, I really can't see them finishing below third under any circumstances.

If we have a stonker of a season we could get second, I think. Third or fourth is a realistic target. Just perhaps, in a couple of years, we could be title contenders, but I don't think we have the mentality or the depth to do it right now. Whereas last season I just wanted us to put in a good showing and build success with a very different team, I feel that failing to qualify for CL next season would constitute a failure. We have a better team than the Gooners - considerably better in my opinion - and we should finish above them.

On that note however, Woolwich Wanderers are absolute cunts, and could well turn in a repeat performance of absolutely smashing it at the end of the season. I really can't see them doing any better than fourth though, and I'm sure that'll be their target. I think our sensible, attainable goal for next season is to beat the Gooners to fourth. I'm certain we have the ability to do that.

Liverpool and Everton in 6th and 7th. Probably in that order. Liverpool will be better next season, assuming they keep Suárez, but I'm not at all convinced they're capable of a serious CL qualification threat.

At the other end of the table, I'm most certain of Palace going back down. All my Palace-supporting mates are unanimous that they have zero chance of staying up, and Holloway's 'attack or die' philosophy will lead to them doing a Blackpool - crashing back down to the Championship in a glorious ball of fire. The Zaha money will help, but it won't be enough.

Hull will struggle - badly. Staying up would be a huge achievement for them. I don't really have any insight here other than that they simply don't have the quality to stay up. They're poor and overachieved to gain promotion in the first place.

Cardiff should stay up. You don't often see clubs that dominant in the Champ completely implode in the Prem. They also have big financial backing now and are sure to invest. I'd imagine they'll be hovering around the relegation zone at times, but I'm pretty sure they'll make it.

So I have one more pick for relegation. I'm confident Sunderland will improve under Di Canio. Villa have a very young team who started to gel better towards the end of last season, and ought to come out swinging next season. The first campaign's always the hardest, and I see Southampton doing respectably next season too.

I'm torn between Stoke and Newcastle, and dear lord do I hope it's Stoke. Pulis was exactly what Stoke needed, and I think they'll do worse under new management. Pardew looks likely to leave too, which would also be a blow to an already-shaken Newcastle that will do well to overcome disarray next time out.

Sorry for all that. I got a bit carried away

Of those you listed, only Bale and Lennon created 2 or more chances per game. Of those you listed, only Bale and Dempsey are really comfortable being deployed high up the pitch and playing as more of a wide forward. Only Bale scored more than 10 goals of those players and he did that more centrally anyway. None achieved 10 assists (flawed stat but surely you'd expect more from very advanced wide players). 

Gylfi is being played out of position (and doing okay) and Townsend / Lennon are a bit weak when they don't have tons of space in front of them to run into. I actually think Townsend is a bit overhyped right now by Spurs fans. I want to see what he can do in our squad but often he does a lot of dribbling without much at the end of it. 

In a 4-3-3, specifically one which doesn't utilize a dedicated playmaker, the creativity comes from the front 3 almost exclusively. AVB's Porto had Moutinho but even that team relied very heavily on the wide players to create chances. 

We just don't have any prolific goalscorers or creators who play in wide positions other than Gareth Bale.

So he has big expectations on him and soon should have the experience to make a huge difference in the team. Hopefully he lives up to this and can become as well regarded and loved as Alonso was",0,1371949556,null,0,false,0,caobka8,t3_1gvt7n,t1_caobka8,t3_1gvt7n,null,1430716355,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
