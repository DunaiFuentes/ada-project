However if we persist and give him a chance (especially as many players failed to make their mark under AVB, not just Soldado who I think was a victim of the system) then theres no reason why he can't hit form and start scoring goals. If we simply write him off we guarantee that he will be a failure. Especially considering that we know what he can do when he gets service. If Ade and Soldado both hit form imagine how deadly they could be together...

If we did play them together I'd like to see Adebayor given a fairly free role, he's good at drifting wide to provide a bit of width and to pull defenders out of position. This would surely be great for Soldado and it wouldn't necessarily mean a strict 442. More of a 4411 where the support striker can drop back to midfield or drift wide.

Sorry I wasn't very clear about Defoe. If he's leaving then he obviously isn't in our plans so it depends who his replacement is. In hindsight my point wasn't very good.

I agree with your points aobut Eriksen and Siggy and I really like /u/VaqueroGalactico's idea of a 4222 as it allows for these two to play together.

That's either a lie, or you're speaking from a position of ignorance.

It's been done in several countries for significant periods of time (as it has in the UK for about 30 years), and states including Netherlands, Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Denmark, and the ROI are all fracking to varying degrees.

&gt;That's a pretty big caveat to overcome.

Not given the above information.

&gt;But you agree that fracking in the UK alone won't make gas cheaper?

The bottom line is ""it might"", no-one can know. Whether we do or do not legislate against hydraulic fracturing at this point should not be contingent on whether it will lower consumer gas prices, and that's an absurd notion.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;So what you're saying is, it's not Mr. Watkins fault? He didn't choose to be a pedophile?

I'm saying it's his *fault*. It is a fault with him. It is not a fault he chose to have. If it were possible to remove that fault, then it would be a good idea to do that instead of having him continue to live with it.

That's what rehabilitative care is for. If you can genuinely bring a criminal round to not thinking in the way they did previously about committing crime, if they genuinely would not have committed the crime if put in the same position again, do you think they still deserve the same punishment they would if they made a conscious decision to commit the crime and would do it again in a heartbeat?

&gt; but if you're asking if I think people should be punished for committing sex crimes against children, the answer is yes.

Obviously, committing sex crimes against children is wrong. There's no doubt about that, I don't think anyone sane could argue it's ok.

That said, I think there's a real problem with the idea that criminals are fully responsible for the disgusting things that they do. Take for example the number of child molesters who were molested themselves as children. Victims of child abuse are more likely to know how horrible it is than anyone else, yet they're *more* likely to abuse children themselves. Why would they do that? Are the victims of abuse evil people, or is their mind and their way of thinking altered by being abused? I don't see any way it's not the second option, how there's any way being abused doesn't sometimes change people in a way they can't control and would never want. I don't see why a victim of child sex abuse would ever abuse a child sexually themselves, and yet more of them do than any other demographic.

That makes me think that there's more to committing crime than just making an uninhibited choice, and if that's true then it means most criminals aren't evil, they're just mentally ill. If you can cure or surpress the desire to kill/rape/molest (and with the right care, you *can* do that with most criminals) then you can fix people better than punishment would. 

I'm rambling a lot because I'm a bit drunk and I'm arguing with a bunch of people at the moment, but I hope that kinda made sense. tl;dr I don't think criminals choose to be criminals any more than cancer sufferers choose to have cancer.",0,1387394636,null,0,false,0,ce4w1sh,t3_1t6436,t1_ce4w1sh,t1_ce4vmu1,null,1428078164,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

2. We beat them in the league cup, we wont' play the same team and neither will they. They also have more time to prepare for this game.

3. Although our record against Arsenal is much improved over the Abramovich era, our recent record is not as good as you suggest, with some bad league defeats in there as well (5-3 at home, 3-1 away)

If you have watched the two teams in recent weeks, there is no doubt that Arsenal are in better form than us, beating some good PL teams and making it look easy. The result against City was a battering, but we are not as strong as City atm, and Arsenal are at home. 

If Arsenal turn it on we are in for a long night based on some recent displays. I was at the Emirates for our game against them at around the same time of year under Ancelloti when we got absolutely torn apart and lost 3-1. A draw is by no means a bad result. Everyone is greadily eying up the top of the league but I think it is much more important we don't lose. If you are expecting us to boss this game like we did in the Carling Cup then you are going to be disappointed.

Look how Mourinho set up at Man U away, I expect to be vidicated in my cautious approach by how Mourinho will set us up for the game, ie. not to lose. 

And please don't call me a pansy because I don't have a deluded and boorish sense of optimism that we are gunna go and destroy them away from home. We barely scraped past Crystal Palace at home last weekend.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;  The police really should be able to handle that much...

Don't kid yourself. When I was working for a major UK force, within the last 12 months, we had a broken 5 year old sony Vaio as our offices (20+ investigators) only means of viewing CCTV footage on USB or DVD. Our desktops were Pentium 4's with 128/256 Mb ram and minute hard drives, and locked down USB ports and CD-Rom drives only. I had a 50Mb inbox and could not attach or receive files bigger than 1Mb.  To view or edit large files, I had to book time at a specialist video editing suite 10 miles away where we actually had some decent computers, but still no single computer that would deal with Files on the scale of Terrabytes. I frequently had to record digital footage in real time onto Video, so that it was playable in evidence at court. For evidential purposes, editing could not be done digitally, so I'd have to manually mix footage together, recording live screen grabs sequentially onto video. Screw it up, start again....

Now bear in mind that that 27Tb of data will first have to be mirrored in an evidentially acceptable and secure format, then sifted and viewed in it's entirety by trained child protection officers (because exposure to much of this material can fuck you up really badly, and it all has to be watched) so that images of potential victims can be obtained and work done to try and identify them, along with potential other offences. You have the issue of files being encrypted, hidden or obscured, they will do raw reads of the drives to see if data that has been deleted can be recovered. 

I am fully aware that we're not talking about 27Tb of child porn, but every file and all obtainable data will have to be reviewed. My experience of investigations leads me to say that it is not out of the question that it could take years for all of that to be done and the resultant information investigated to the satisfaction of the team (well senior investigating officer) looking into it.

Done correctly, it could expose other child abusers, and release children from utterly horrific abuse. So it's worthwhile.

How does the volume of gas produced from horizontal fracking compare to the volume of gas produced by conventional drilling in european and russian territories?

A few countries drilling a couple of test holes isn't going to make any kind of difference to the price of gas.

&gt; The bottom line is ""it might"", no-one can know.

Sure, no-one can know, but plenty of people can make informed forecasts, and when the number of industry analysts that are predicting that fracking will lower UK gas prices is zero, that should tell you something.

&gt; Whether we do or do not legislate against hydraulic fracturing at this point should not be contingent on whether it will lower consumer gas prices, and that's an absurd notion.

So why is the promise of lower gas prices a standard political talking point whenever fracking legislation is discussed? As [David Cameron](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10236664/We-cannot-afford-to-miss-out-on-shale-gas.html) himself wrote:

&gt; First, fracking has real potential to drive energy bills down. Labour’s mismanagement of the economy means that many people are struggling with the cost of living today. Where we can act to relieve the pressure, we must. It’s simple – gas and electric bills can go down when our home-grown energy supply goes up.

&gt; [...] Even if we only see a fraction of the impact shale gas has had in America, we can expect to see lower energy prices in this country. 

If fracking won't lower prices, considering the environmental and health risks and the despoiling of the landscape that's involved, then why should people in rural communities across the UK ever grant planning permission for it to take place?",0,1387396173,null,0,false,0,ce4wrsw,t3_1t2tzn,t1_ce4wrsw,t1_ce4vsey,null,1428077826,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Personal rules I have: 

Never assume anything (a lot of drivers break the rules of road so just stay aware), 

Don't drive up the inside of HGVs and buses (most cycle injures in London happen with HGVS), 

Know your route when you get used to riding one route you can know the safer parts. 

Be aware of pedestrians (for me they tend to think because the road is clear of cars it's clear.

For all we know, he could've actually been innocent and this would've ruined his life even if he didn't do it. At least the allegations were true in that his public accusation wasn't false (of course the acts should never have been done).

It's horrible to see lives end up this way, and no one should be victimised for what crimes they've committed **in my opinion**.

It's good that he was found out before any further hurt could be done upon innocent children, but I do hope he survives in prison though. Regardless of what he did, and how people in prison see people who hurt children in this way, regardless of who he was it's still wrong for his life or well-being to be in danger, even after what he did to others **in my opinion**.

The only people I have the most sorrow for would be his family and the band members of Lostprophets who have had their lives turned upside down, finding out that these charges were true and that he ended up pleading guilty to them, especially after it happening for a few years.

I still enjoy his music, and that's something I'm sure many people will never let him take away from them, as *no one* (general populace) knew what was happening and so his creativity shouldn't be shunned, as the impact it's made is enormous - rightfully or wrongly, ignoring it would just hurt the other band members who put effort into what eventually became the end of their career under that name because of one individual.",0,1387397578,null,0,false,0,ce4xg9n,t3_1t5yk9,t1_ce4xg9n,t1_ce4qdin,null,1428077509,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,narwhalicus,violet,Save me Barry!,"I think a year is realistic. 

It sounds quick but you've got to remember that the show isn't some kind of 'Famous 5' deal - it is a group of young offenders forced to spend a short amount of time picking up dog shit and putting it into a bin. As someone said before, their probation work was initially for roughly 2 or 3 months - then they were put back on probation when Rudy was brought into the show. Then even newer members were brought in for their stints, and so on.

At some point, the 'former' group met the 'latter' group - Jess and Finn met Curtis and Rudy for instance. You can't expect community service to go on for a year or more because community service is meant to ideally be quick rehab then the offenders get jobs and become part of the community. There are too many young offenders around to keep 5 or so on for a year. when you think about it this way, only a year can make sense compared to 3 or 5 like someone mentioned below because if new offenders briefly meet old offenders, it is like adding on another 3 month stint to the previous stint. In fact I'd go as far as to say that less than a year could be possible, but over 5 seasons, maybe not.

You can also go for a basic 5 seasons x 8 episodes (i think there were 8, maybe 6) = 40. when representing each episode as a week of real time which is a fair way to view it you get to 40 weeks. Add in breaks for when people are off of service like at the start of season 3 and it makes sense.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"&gt;you have to match the bid exactly with the ask, otherwise the order won't execute. 

That is how an exchange works.

For example - trader A puts on Bitcoin for sale (a Sell Order) for £100.

You can put a Buy Order for less (or more), and that will appear in the buy book.

But lets say you put a buy order for £90. We don't force traders (customers) to lower their price to meet your buy order, it is totally up to the traders.

They can cancel their sell orders and meet your buy order. But that is each individuals own choice.

Or as another example - lets say you, as a trader (customer) put on Bitcoin for £200.

And customer B comes on and wants Bitcoin for £50, they can place a buy order, but we don't force you to meet his buy order, that is not within our power and it will never be, thats simply not how an exchange works.

On an Exchange, customers can set their own buy order or sell order, or they can instantly buy/sell buy meeting a current buy/sell order. I should probably write up an explanation of how an Exchange operates sometime (you're not the only one to raise this question).

But anyway, your 1st point. That is what is supposed to happen.

As another example, as you can see from the [B&gt;£](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/ex/x/btc_gbp) window, there is nearly £3,000 worth of Bitcoin for sale. But if you wish to buy them, you have to meet the sellers (who remains totally anonymous) price. The market moves itself and relies on the decentralised nature of multiple traders from around the globe to create the value. Hence why if you require Bitcoin (or Litecoin) instantly, you have to meet the current lowest Sell Order (you can meet higher sell orders if you wished, but that would mean you'd be spending more than you needed to). Every exchange works like this.

As to someone placing a higher buy order than the lowest sell order, yes, if it meets no sell order it will appear in the buy order book. Give it a few months, when there's a lot of traders on IBWT then there will be more sell orders, and buy orders will be matched easier (for example, btc-e and mtgox (if you've seen darkmoody) have a substantial amount of sell orders, that nearly any buy order (near the average) would easily be met automatically (because its already placed).

Your 2nd point, yes, that was a bug, it got fixed this morning.",0,1387399872,null,0,1387400491,0,ce4ykhs,t3_1t5x27,t1_ce4ykhs,t1_ce4pdrf,null,1428076988,1,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,1

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"It is 1080i because of BD specifications. We shoot at 25fps however there is no 25p on the spec where-as 50i is so this is what they use since it is the closest to what we have. Lately, they've used 24p for the S1-4 BD release instead, presumably to save money by using a single global master rather than one for each region. (For the record, the region B set release of specials-s7 are just re-releases of the exact same discs that are already out there, which are 1080i. I understand they've changed for Region A so that they all are 1080p.)

They are not 1080i50 masters. They are the 576i50 masters, however they are better quality mainly due to a better codec and storage space. The techniques used may also have helped, but probably not by much. They also replaced all the captions, which might have helped give the *illusion* of *far* better quality. (Edit: They were also probably comparing Region 1 DVDs rather than region 2, which probably ensures the difference they see to be raised somewhat.)

I'm not happy at all about the results, but I can at least see the big picture. This year was never going to be a ""great"" year for us, it was always going to be a rebuilding year when you bring in that many new starters. And unfortunately you can get 0-6 type results in a rebuilding year.

Personally I would of liked to see AVB get the rest of this season to get things working the way he saw them. If at the end of the year things weren't looking good, then I would have pulled the trigger.

I can't tell you how many times in recent years, I've watched ManU and thought, they aren't that good, certainly not better than us.  But you watch how even when they are down, everyone on the team and Sir Alex expect to win, and the other team seem to half-expect it as well, and suddenly they are defending for their lives and giving up a late equalizer or winner.

Firstly, Norway pays the EU in order to get free trade, in fact they pay more per capita to the EU than the UK does, but they have no part in influencing trade policy. This doesn't seem like it would be a good scenario for the UK. We might as well just play hard ball in the EU and start not enforcing EU policies before we leave, give up all influence and then buy free trade at an inflated price.

Switzerland has spent centuries building up its own trade network, external to the EU, this is probably more realistic of what the UK would aim for, but the timeline on this kind of thing is huge. Optimistically we're talking 5+ years to get anything close to what we have now, most analysts are saying it would take decades.

I see no way that we would be able to trade as successfully as we are now in the aftermath of leaving the EU. I guess we could try to set up some agreement before we left and then fine tune it after, but that is a massive uncertainty, and certainly is not the kind of thing that would encourage businesses to move here.",0,1387401356,null,0,false,0,ce4zbaw,t3_1t5uhw,t1_ce4zbaw,t1_ce4molb,null,1428076640,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1. Sherwood had 2 days to prepare the team. That's not a lot. Anyone who thought that wouldn't be a concern is delusional.
2. It didn't seem like the sacking of AVB was due to player unrest so it's unsurprising that there wasn't a big post-sacking boost.
3. We are playing an injured first choice left back, a 3rd choice center back, and a 5th choice center back who's not even a center back. Our only healthy first choice defender is an attacking full back. It's understandable to have trouble at the back.
4. In addition to defensive injuries, we are missing Sandro.
5. Sherwood's substitutions are worthy of critique, but we shouldn't forget that the Townsend injury probably limited what he could do with substitutes.

With all of that, there were extended times of bright, attacking football. It's just the League Cup. I still don't know what to think about Spurs prospects. Maybe it's just not a good team.

He hasn't played more than a half in months so expecting him to put out a full 90 could be a lot to ask of him in his first big match back. Although it would have been nice to see Soldado in, I saw the Holtby choice as an option to up the defense a bit while still having an attack option. 

Our defense is mostly to blame though. We were just not winning any headers at all. West Hams offense was pretty much keeper boots it -&gt; player heads it -&gt; other players tries to make play. And they eventually got it to work. I can give some slack cause we're missing Vert and Rose was off the second half. Also, Chiriches probably wasn't fully 100% either.

I won't start judging Sherwood until we get to some PL matches. We have Southampton next and that'll be a true test. I expect Sherwood wasn't holding out on the main players and seeing this match as a secondary tournament (although I would have expected to beat West Ham even with our second string ...). Hopefully, we can see what Sherwood can do with Eriksen, Lamela, Soldado, and Sandro all in. If he can't make something work with that, then I'll be worried.

We need either Capoue or Sandro playing in front of the center backs.

We're hurting without Super Jan, I think the ideal pairing by the end of the season will be Vlad and Vert.

Hopefully Rose can play a full 90 minutes this weekend.

Townsend being injured opens up the door to Lamela to get some more minutes and hopefully find his groove.

giantkiller originally says:
&gt; Seeing as it's not the fracking that actually causes seismic activity I'd say this is a non issue.

From the source giantkiller linked:

https://www.bgs.ac.uk/shalegas

&gt; **Are there any risks associated with fracking?**

&gt; Shale gas extraction and fracking has received a huge amount of media interest. Just like any other industrial process there will be associated risks. Some of those relevant to shale gas include ‘induced seismicity’, such as the low magnitude earthquakes experienced in Lancashire in 2011. [...]

From the governmental paper it links on that very same page, it says:

&gt; Oil was commercially produced from Carboniferous oil shales in West Lothian between 1859 and the 1940s, and although shale gas potential was highlighted in the 1980s (Selley 1987, 1996, 2005) it was only in the 13th Onshore Licensing Round in 2008 that companies specifically sought to explore for shale gas. Only one shale gas well has been hydraulically fractured, Cuadrilla’s Preese Hall 1 well during 2011, but that test was suspended before completion of the fracturing programme after two small earthquakes were induced (Green et al. 2012).

From the Green et al. 2012 source which is:

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48330/5055-preese-hall-shale-gas-fracturing-review-and-recomm.pdf

It says:

&gt; A series of studies were commissioned by Cuadrilla Resources Ltd to examine the possible relationship between hydraulic fracture operations at the Preese Hall well, near Blackpool, and a number of earthquakes which occurred in April and May 2011, the largest of which had a magnitude of 2.3 M. The reports from these studies conclude that the earthquake activity was caused by direct fluid injection into an adjacent fault zone during the treatments, but that the probability of further earthquake activity is low. The reports analyse the earthquake activity and use available geological and geophysical data, including background geology, well logs and core samples, along with fracture treatment data, to develop a conceptual geomechanical model. [...]

Even after one paragraph of this statement, the governmental report says:

&gt; We agree with the conclusion that the observed seismicity was induced by the hydraulic fracture treatments at Preese Hall. However, we are not convinced by the projected low probability of other earthquakes during future treatments. We believe it is not possible to state categorically that no further earthquakes will be experienced during a similar treatment in a nearby well. The analyses failed to identify a causative fault, and detailed knowledge of faulting in the basin is poor. In the present state of knowledge it is entirely possible that there are critically stressed faults elsewhere in the basin. It is possible that a 3-D seismic reflection survey could help better characterize faulting within the basin. 

So... ye. I'm not sure if I would call you ""scientifically illiterate"" like you do to others (read your history btw), but it certainly seems that maybe you should refrain from stating ""facts"" and ""science"" if you can't cite / back up what you say.

As you say, ""this sub is getting ridiculous for ignoring science in pursuit of an agenda.""

- Read the [Highway Code Rules for Cyclists](https://www.gov.uk/rules-for-cyclists-59-to-82/overview-59-to-71)
- Wear a helmet — if looking a little silly means I get to come home safely to my SO (and cat!) I'll take ""looking a little silly"" every time.
- Learn the route in advance (as ChickenSun suggested) and, if you're not completely sure about it, try taking a bus which takes a similar route once or twice to learn the roads.
- Be aware that many drivers in London think that cyclists are beneath them and are not worth indicating for — anticipation is everything!
- Bus drivers are trained to take advantage of Rule 198 (bus has right-of-way when pulling out) and almost all London bus drivers treat the road like it's made for them. They'll often perform manoeuvres which put cyclists in incredibly dangerous positions, so stay back or get ahead of them quickly; don't ride beside them.
- If you see a vehicle with a sticker saying ""Cyclists stay back"" or ""Do not pass on left side"" you should do so, not because the sticker tells you to but because people driving these vehicles can use it as an excuse when they neglect to check their mirrors and cause an accident.
- Keep as far left as it is safe to be and always use cycle lanes when present.",0,1387404081,null,0,false,0,ce50nu9,t3_1t6t0t,t1_ce50nu9,t1_ce4xdoj,null,1428076011,5,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,5

&gt;Sure, no-one can know, but plenty of people can make informed forecasts, and when the number of industry analysts that are predicting that fracking will lower UK gas prices is zero, that should tell you something.

It tells me that some industry analysts have decided that's how they think the future will be. Anyone who tells you they can predict the future price of natural gas is lying.

&gt;So why is the promise of lower gas prices a standard political talking point whenever fracking legislation is discussed? As David Cameron[1] himself wrote:

Not an argument I need to defend. I'm aware he said that, but I can be in support of fracking whether that argument was made or not. Technically though, he's not wrong in a single thing he says, he says ""potential"" and then ""even if"".

&gt;If fracking won't lower prices, considering the environmental and health risks and the despoiling of the landscape that's involved, then why should people in rural communities across the UK ever grant planning permission for it to take place?

Because just like the North Sea oil, it stands to make many people a bit better off via wealth generation, it stands to employ a lot of people and stands to bring a few billion a year into the government coffers, which is a good thing all around.

Rose is working his way back from, a much worse than we all thought, injury, and it made sense to not make him go the full 90, especially since we are going to want him for the weekend. Injuries at the back made it difficult but thank god Sherwood brought on Fryers rather than Naughton. 

Chadli for Townsend was obviously out of necessity, but I think it was a good choice to get someone who would track back and help out Fryers due to his inexperience. 

Holtby should have came on for Defoe, but alas, maybe we will see Ade + Soldado for the weekend and that's why Defoe stayed on. We needed some more oomph in midfield and Holtby is a high energy guy.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"More so than at the weekend, this loss hinged on defensive injuries.  Neither Capoue or Chiriches played terrible throughout but neither is strong in the air.  We missed Dawson or Kaboul for this.  Plus, without Sandro we lacked the option to sit a midfielder in front of (e.g.) Cole to help with the long-balls and to track running-on midfielders.  Big Sam must have been rubbing his hands when he saw what options we had available.

The substitutions were largely enforced, with only the Adebayor substitution being up for any debate.  However, given his relative lack of playing time, this is also easily excused.

Small points: 
* Lloris is still opting for the punch too often, IMO.  His distribution was also a bit...variable in quality.  Made a couple of good saves though.
* A lot of people are reacting against Defoe but the best two chances fell to Chadli (weak finish) and Gylfi (took a touch when it should have been hit first time).  Both should have done better.
* Dembele has had two really poor games.  He just isn't the same player when tasked with the holding role.
* On a positive note: Danny Rose looks like he's getting fit.  I thought he looked lively, though obviously a bit rusty with the ball at his feet.

If you look at successful clubs, the manager has a say in who to bring in for transfers, and with Spurs it was done by Baldini and Levy.

Id go in a 4-3-3: Lloris; Walker, Dawson(It was only 1 game ban correct?), Vlad, Rose; Sandro, Holtby, Eriksen; Lamela, Soldado, Chadli

I don't envision playing an extremely high line so Dawson should be able to get on the pitch, and Vlad has the pace to help cover for him. I want to see Holtby in a more deep-lying role, and if Sandro is healthy, it would give him a lot more freedom. Eriksen in the #10 role. With Townsend out, this could be Lamela's opprotunity to truly settle and show his immense talent. With this lineup, I think we would do a much better job linking up play and getting chances for Bob the Solider to finish. 

If Sherwood chooses to stick with the 4-4-2 I think it might look something like this: Lloris; Walker, Daws, Vlad, Rose; Lamela, Holtby, Sandro, Chadli; Soldado, Ade

This is all assuming Sandro is good to go, otherwise, I would lineup differently. 

I prefer the 4-3-3 and I think that with Holtby deep and Eriksen in front we could be menacing playing 1-2's through the middle and then working it out to Lamela and Chadli or up to Soldado. We shall see what happens.

true,bvan007,flair3,,"While I'm not as livid as some others I'm still very disappointed and here's why:

1) Abysmal finishing. Seriously, I have no idea if it's a lack of training or something else but this needs to get sorted out. We should have had this game put away in the first half. Defoe is simply not cutting it, would have liked to have seen Soldado come on but I understand that Sherwood's hands may have been tied in that regard.

2) Grossly incompetent defending. Now I know that these guys aren't necessarily first choice but I saw junior level mistakes from this team today. Guys like Walker and Fryers losing their man in the box, guys getting beat first to the ball, two guys getting beat out for a header on that second goal, the list goes on. These guys don't need to be the second coming of Beckenbauer they just need to be able to do the basics.

3) Not to sound conceited but with the players we have (even with injuries) we really should be able to put away the fucking West Ham reserves. Seriously, a guy who hadn't scored in over a year got one on us today.

Now all this said there are certainly some good takeaways from this game. Adebayor was superb today, he was all over the pitch providing passing options for players, making passes, getting into space, and even coming back and helping on defence. Hopefully this means more game time for him in the future. Secondly, despite our inability to finish we did look more fluid than we have in recent days so that is promising.

In closing the best way I can describe my reaction to this match is ""we hoped for the best but it turned out like always"". Not sold either way on Sherwood yet, his subs were far from confidence inspiring but I need to see more. Hopefully we can take the positives from this game and build on them.

Instead, he punched it and, though he got good enough distance, West Ham retained possession and continued exerting pressure.

true,BouncingLlama,null,null,"&gt; Learn the route in advance (as ChickenSun suggested) and, if you're not completely sure about it, try taking a bus which takes a similar route once or twice to learn the roads.

Keep in mind that in central in particular quite a few one way streets have cycling contra-flow lanes.

&gt; Be aware that many drivers in London think that cyclists are beneath them and are not worth indicating for — anticipation is everything!

Absolutely! In fact, indicating in general seems to be viewed as sin to some motorists, so they never do. It's not just for cyclists.

&gt; Bus drivers are trained to take advantage of Rule 198 (bus has right-of-way when pulling out) and almost all London bus drivers treat the road like it's made for them. They'll often perform manoeuvres which put cyclists in incredibly dangerous positions, so stay back or get ahead of them quickly; don't ride beside them.

This flips once you're in the outer boroughs (bus drivers are some of the most pleasant road users I get to deal with), but is good advice none the less. Besides, drafting behind a bus is great fun.

&gt; If you see a vehicle with a sticker saying ""Cyclists stay back"" or ""Do not pass on left side"" you should do so,

Absolutely. You never want to be caught on the nearside of one those vehicles (inevitably large HGVs, busses or similar).

&gt; Keep as far left as it is safe to be and always use cycle lanes when present.

Ok, here I completely disagree. By all means keep as far left as you deem safe, but a lot of cycle lanes in London are complete garbage.

Had the internet been available in 1939 the world would be very different.

We barely get anyone forward. Occasionally our wildly skilled midfielders pull off a piece of skill nice enough to slip through the opposition defense and they get a goal, or we score an ugly goal.

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"&gt; because of a minority group of ""eye for eye"" types.

From how the media portrays it, it seems that a lot of the British public see Watkins under the 'eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth' way.

I'm sure you realised this from what I said, but I do of course agree with him getting a prison sentence for what he did.

I didn't read the report, I'll admit that, but I did know that one of the babies was found to have crystal meth when given a test.

Maybe I wasn't clear or didn't word it how I should've, but I don't view anonymity as a right of those who are sentenced. Sure, before they're actually found guilty then I think that they should not be named by the press, but if they admit to it or a jury finds them guilty then that's different.

I never meant to imply that you should not be informed, just not at least until they were found guilty (which I know in this case, Watkins admitted to). Whether someone's a drug user or a criminal who's had jail time, I feel as though you should still realise that they're as fallible as you and me and if they strive to move on from what they've done, it should be accepted. Within reason, people should not be stuck to their past actions.

Obviously in the case of Watkins and others who have done acts as he has done, I do think and hope that he would not be around children (unsupervised by a respected and responsible adult, at least, accountable) such as which he was in this music video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZzgN7efCoE

Jokes aside there are a few things which my family do, i imagine they aren't uncommon:

* One thing my dad used to do after we were asleep was to put flour on the bottom of his boots and walk around the room where the tree was to give the impression that Santa had been there with snow on his boots. We were none the wiser.

* You have to put down the mandatory mince pie and drink (we used to put a small glass of sherry if i recall) for Santa, and a carrot for the reindeer.

* No one is allows downstairs until everyone is up and ready, we then go down together. It built the suspense something terrible when i was a kid.


* After presents are opened then it is normally time for a cup of tea and for playing with new toys etc etc while the parents awaken fully.

* As it approaches lunch we will watch a Christmas film or two while breaking open the first alcoholic beverage of the day (normally bucks fizz).

* Then we stuff ourselves with a variety of food etc etc. What constitutes a Christmas meal varies between families i have noticed but for us it is generally stuffing, turkey and another meat, carrots, roast potatoes, sprouts (if your weird), parsnips and a few other things which i am forgetting. Starter is normally prawn cocktail.

* After we have rested for a while after the feast we meet up with family, either round our house of theirs and begin the socialising, board games or the mandatory game of charades. This normally continues until pretty late.

I imagine there are other things but i can't remembers at the moment, i shall add them as an edit if i do :)

true,nunnible,null,null,"&gt; Why are you talking about the Scouts? I'm pretty certain they don't advertise on tv that they're going to help those who are starving and have no shelter, and then turn around and spend that money on marquees.

I talk about the Scouts because they are real world examples of when relying on donated services isn't enough. It is not hard to see why a charity can't rely on donated services, and as such can't rely on the printing company you mentioned. Let alone when they are printing on the scale of the three large charities you opened with

&gt; Yes I did watch the video thank you, and it was little more than preaching to the converted, like most Ted talks.

I didn't question whether you watched the video, just the parts you focused on. As for that Ted talking being preaching to the converted, seeing as I was on the fence on the subject at the time of first viewing it, that simply isn't true. Perhaps preaching to the open minded?

&gt; You keep going on about no business being able to survive or compete without this kind of aggressive marketing and wasteful spending, yet most of these older charities did exactly that several decades ago. 

I never said that. I only mentioned businesses in the context of the organisations donating services, I at no point compared a charity to a business, though I suspect you mention that because you have had that said to you by other people or perhaps it was in the video

The scale of all markets, including the charitable ones, have changed completely in that time anyway. That would be like saying why don't banks operate without computers seeing as they managed it in the 60s. The world is different, and we only need to deal with the requirements of the world we live in. 

&gt; There are huge incentives for giving and leaving money to charities, raising money for charity is in the blood.

There are incentives of course, no one can deny that. It is, unfortunately, competitive. People have to decide where their money (and time) go, not just between charities but all over. Do I need another Xbox game or is there some way I can help the world instead?

Donating isn't in the blood. Although I would be interested in reading an article on genetic philanthropy. What I would say is, in a more Darwinian sense, in the blood is self preservation 

&gt; I am really bloody sick of this attitude that throwing money at a problem helps it, 

You know what, as a left leaning person so am I. Unfortunately that is the world we live in. You don't think money helps? 

Next time there is a tsunami I challenge you to maximise the saving of lives without any money. 

Lets cure cancer without test tubes (I am sure I simplified it again) And with scientists that won't get paid if their company isn't the one to patent the cure.

Money may be annoying, but if you are denying the need for it then I haven't got a clue where you are coming from.

&gt; even if the way that money was raised has negative consequences. 

You are still yet to demonstrate this other than vague comments about charities investing in arms dealers. Please tell me the negative consequences of the mailouts you received.

It annoyed you? (I have already acknowledged they should have obeyed your wishes when opting out anyway)

If you hadn't opted out? 

The only possible negative consequence are with occasional individuals refusing to donate any more. 

People are rarely that spiteful. ""Lets let people die because we got a piece of paper""?

And more are gained than are lost.

The simple fact is, you would barely know about the work of many of these organisations if their work wasn't publicised on one level or another.

The title is a little misleading: Spain states its stance towards Sottish indenpendence entirely depends of that of the UK

Spain's stance on a possible inclusion of a independent Scotland in the EU will entirely depend on what the UK says, states the Spanish minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel García-Margallo says. ""The UK's stance, whatever it were to be, would also be a determining factor when casting the vote to include an independent Scotland into the EU""

He compares it to the case of Kosovo, where its recognition has not been recognised by Spain, and ""Serbia's stance"" would also be fundamental, given that in its constitution, it did not recognise the secession of Kosovo.

Again, he referred to the current situation in Catalonia, where he says there would not be a session there as it would go against the constitution.

In a unilateral declaration of independence, Catalonia would be left out of the EU and it would hinder their re-entry into the EU, thus it would not be recognised internationally as a country.

He said that there would be few European member states, if any, would would decide to allow entry to a state who was formed out of a unilateral declaration, against the constitutional order, and that the Catalonians should be made aware that they would be left out of the EU.",0,1387409394,null,0,1387409747,0,ce532g9,t3_1t77m3,t1_ce532g9,t3_1t77m3,null,1428074817,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The justice system is CERTAINLY not harsh enough, when grown men rape fucking babies (such as the guy this thread is about), or kill CHILDREN who are INNOCENT CHILDREN, hanging isn't even good enough for these people. I'd rather they wake up to a living hell every single day, burn them and throw bricks at them and stuff. FUCK people who do that shit. We as a society owe these people NO REHABILITATION, they aren't people who have comitted armed robbery on shops, sold drugs, stole cars, been involved in scraps in the pub, they are just absolute fucking scum bags who honestly do not deserve to breathe the air around them and the fact we pay £35k a yr to keep every inmate and these people are costing us money, absolutely sickens me. 

Fuck them, I'd happily kill them myself if it was legal. I do not believe a man who rapes a baby should be alive, or a man who kills a child should be alive. 

Imo when you commit acts like this you don't deserve human rights, you forfeit them, and everything else that normal respectful people have. Even people who aren't respectful, but heavily misguided by their communities (which our government should really address) into a life of crime, can be taught to be respectful given enough time and visual/audio impulses toward ethical/moral conduct. I mean it's not hard that if you contribute to society/your country, you make it a better place by working and paying taxes and stronger internationally, rather than a shit hole like a third world country. It's just basic thoughts, but people who partake in acts like this do not deserve to be told anything like this, they won't benefit from it and have already crossed the line. 

A lot of the general public agree with you mate, if I ever got sent down for anything, I could not live on the nonce wing. They have a wing with peedo's and vulnerable people on it. The other wings are just idiots or 'manchildren', who argue about pointless shit constantly and occasionally stab eachother with bits of plastic from their TV's.

This is a good suggestion. Any mandatory motorway test presents a particular problem: a not-insignificant proportion of the population, and many test centres, are located with no motorways nearby. (It needn't be the depths of the Highlands to be in that situation: I took my test in Ipswich, which is an hour away from any motorway.)

Correct merging from a sliproad can be learnt on any dual carriageway, however, and that's without the safety-zone of a hard shoulder.

Hell if you went on the boards most people dismissed it because of his pricing and wondered if AVB scouted anyone under £30m.

The other's, well i don't think that has been any kind of surprise.  AVB wanted Hulk and David Villa to play in a front 3 with Bale. We sold Bale, Villa opted for Athletico and Hulk is wildly overpriced.  We picked up Soldado, Lamela and Chadli....AVB was ok with Soldado, everything else aside from this article (from the Mail) states that AVB approved Lamela, granted Chadli probably wasn't a first choice.

AVB wanted Willian.....seems to me that we did literally everything we could to try and get him and when he signed with Chelsea we got Eriksen, at least we had a plan B.

AVB wanted Coentrao, we all wanted Coentrao, it didn't happen and for the entire season we have all been screaming for a LB.  Fair enough that was some shit decision making all around.  

AVB supposedly was interested in Rolando and Otamendi from Porto as CB....we supposedly had conversations with Porto about at least one of them if not both and if i had to wager Porto asked for big money, Baldini knew of Vlad and we picked him up as a plan B (or plan C), again we tried and ended up getting a pretty respectable alternative.

I'm not a fan of the sacking of AVB but, to be fair, his dissatisfaction that we didn't get the players he wanted may also have to do with the fact that the players he wanted were wildly overpriced, we ended up getting him some serious talent and spent a shit load of money to do so.

I'm not really 'OK' with that. I think these people do have the potential to harm kids. I mean lets face it, they do. I don't have kids but if I had a daughter in tesco's running down the isle to grab a bottle of milk while I kept my eye on her, and some nonce was looking at her thinking sexual thoughts, the thought of that is fucked up. I mean it only goes from thoughts in public, to grabbing a child and abducting her, then killing her trying to not to get caught and things escalate. 

I honestly feel that, at all costs we need to protect the children in this country. Children are fully dependent on adults at every point in their lives, they need to be happy and to become educated. The thoughts of somebody harming a child, let alone raping or killing one is fucking enraging, it really is. The adult who does that does not deserve to live, should NEVER be allowed in the general public again, and should be killed to save us keeping them all their lives.

-Bill Nicholson

The quote says it all. But I will mention that as a Spurs fan of over 10 years, who has experienced our recent successes as well as *some* of the hardship the club came under I both agree with you and disagree.

Tottenham as a club is such an ambitious machine, in the way we play, the way we're run, what the team aims to achieve, even how the fans behave. That's what makes us great. That's why I love this club. There's always goals, entertaining football and lots of reasons to leap out of your seat.  For right or for wrong, we've always been very ambitious and I hope we continue to be.

So, to adapt your statement about how the club has fared these last decades, I'd like to say that we should be thankful to be near the top of the pack. We should be lucky that we're currently watching one of the best sides Spurs have put together, that we're even teasing with competing with the top clubs in England, all of which have such histories of success. But we should also know that we're lucky to be here, and 10 years ago we were lucky to make the top half of the table. We should understand and appreciate our history in order to progress in the future. 

In the end, we must bare in mind where Spurs were 10, 20, even 30 years ago, but we should never, ever let that thwart our ambition, because our ambition for glory is what makes this club great.",0,1387412466,null,0,false,0,ce54fu9,t3_1t7gvm,t1_ce54fu9,t3_1t7gvm,null,1428074177,64,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,64

It's as if somewhere deep in their brain realizes they're getting FAR more than they deserve and it's convinced any moment society is going to turn around and punish them for being greedy and fraudulent so it's driving them to make it obvious to everyone else, maybe on some level hoping to end the situation sooner rather than later?

I live in a republic now and have done for 5 years so have had the opportunity to see how it works. The main societal issue that strikes me as a parent is that my daughter, born in Iceland and as an Icelandic citizen could dream of becoming the Head of State and figurehead of her nation, voted for by her compatriots. Her ancestry is irrelevant and thus there is not the ingrained perception that the nobility are intrinsically 'better' than the masses. 

In the UK however, there is always an echelon that no matter how hard one works or what one does for his/her fellow countrymen can never be entered purely down to birth. That single idea, in my opinion, is harmful to the development of a ""fair society"" as written into law, there is technically, somebody born higher than you.

Republics aren't perfect and democratically elected Heads of State are rarely, if ever, perfect and don't create a fairer society overnight but it certainly fosters a positive belief in people. 

This is why the argument of a passive, irrelevant monarchy doesn't quite wash with me. The hidden effects on a nation could, perhaps, be more harmful than they appear on the surface.

Cycling is the best way to get around central London. How far is your commute? Which area will you be cycling in?

I'd agree with most of what others have said. Though to be honest, I have a pretty relaxed attitude to cycling in London. I have a carbon bike for the weekends, and a steel tourer for the commute for which I wear just my normal office clothes. I don't wear hi-viz or a helmet, but I do have pretty bright lights and I'm a fairly assertive rider so I don't have difficulty being noticed on the road. All in all, I don't feel that cycling in London is an inherently dangerous activity. I've ridden in central London for 8 years and the only accidents I've had have involved pedestrians walking out in front of me, or me slipping on the road surface.

Some tips:

*  If you are keeping up with the speed of the traffic, ride in strong primary. Take your lane, and don't ride in the gutter. Cars tend to give you as much room as you give yourself when overtaking.
* Work on your bike handling. You should be able to check over your shoulder and signal a turn without wobbling too much. Being able to adequately see whats going on around you and to confidently state your intentions to fellow road users is important. A hesitant, cowed cyclist is in a dangerous position.
* Try not to jump red lights. Resist the urge to follow cyclists that do. You can get an on the spot fine if you're caught, though its impolite more than anything. 
* Stay away from large vehicles if you can, especially if it looks like they may be turning left. Most fatal cycling accidents involve left turning trucks/lorries colliding with bikes. If you find yourself in front of a large vehicle while waiting at lights, try to make eye contact with the driver. If you can see him, he can see you.
* Never leave your bike locked up outside over night if you can help it. No matter how good your lock is, bike thieves will find a way to break it if they have enough time and no witnesses. Use a well rated U-Lock and try and pass it through a wheel, the frame and something thats attached to the ground. If you do this then you won't really have a problem leaving it locked in public while you're shopping or eating out or whatever.
* Always have decent lights on your bike. You can be fined if you don't have any. 

Really though, the best tip is to just enjoy it. As a cyclist in London you really do have access to the fastest and most convenient transport. You have as much right to space on the road as car drivers, so take as much as you need. Have a calm, respectful and relaxed attitude to other road users.

It is totally fucked up for someone to find a child attractive. I couldn't sit down to dinner with someone if I knew they wanted to fuck kids. I worded my first part poorly.


However, people indulge in all kinds of sexual fantasy. To start convicting people of thought crime is just ridiculous. I like weird porn, and I know a lot of people would be disgusted by it but it is none of their business. I've seen a lot of documentaries depicting the lives of intellectual, down to earth males who have a sexual attraction to children. While I think their preferences are disgusting, these people are aware that they have a disgusting preference also, and seek chemical castration. 


What I mean to imply is that people shouldn't be sentenced to prison for their thoughts and what they have in their own private fantasies. If anyone tries to actively attempt to have intercourse with a child, they deserve lengthy prison sentences and all the beatings they receive in prison.


However, there are people in this world that would conclude that I deserve putting in prison because I like BDSM. Should I be put in prison for enjoying BDSM? No. If someone wants to wank over little kids in their head then fine. If that person ever tries to molest a kid then I'm all for them being punished. If your kid runs in front of someone in the supermarket and you think that someone wants to fuck your kid, do you really think it is OK to kill that person? Why? Because there are horrible people in the world? What an irrational thought.

The Aberfan disaster was a catastrophic collapse of a colliery spoil tip in the Welsh village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, on 21 October 1966, killing 116 children and 28 adults. It was caused by a build-up of water in the accumulated rock and shale, which suddenly started to slide downhill in the form of slurry.[2]

The official inquiry blamed the National Coal Board for extreme negligence, and its Chairman, Lord Robens, for making misleading statements. Parliament soon passed new legislation about public safety in relation to mines and quarries.

Not had any problem with the exception of one guy in Greece who didn't get carded and a laptop I sent to Gran Canaries which is Spanish with a Spanish postcode but not apparently part of the EU and it got held up in Madrid because I didn't put a customs form on. Parcelforce were of great help getting it sorted. 

&gt; But companies running 7am-6pm delivery windows is helpful to no-one. 

But customers don't want to pay what it would cost to have delivery windows outside that. They're 7am-6pm because the vans also do collections and they have to be back at the depot by 8pm latest to get on the night trunk to the hub in order that they're at the delivery depot for 4-5am the following morning to be loaded for delivery that day.

When you've been involved in the sharp end of a parcel company doing the night trunk so you get to see everything that happens from the parcel that has been collected to be delivered and them getting to the delivery depot you wonder how it is as good as it is. 

The City Link main hub used to be at Wolverhampton. You could have a collection in Aberdeen at 2pm in the afternoon that makes it to Newquay by 9am the following morning. The first leg is being transported by a truck limited to 56MPH on the night trunk that takes 9hrs to get from Aberdeen to Wolverhampton. It is then put through the sort at the main hub and put onto the truck for the depot serving Newquay. The truck leaves the hub around 1am making the 6hr trip to the Newquay depot. The truck containing maybe 1500 parcels is then unloaded, it all sorted out into routes, the parcel placed on the van and then delivered for 9am.

I doubt you could collect it yourself and get it there any quicker unless you didn't sleep.

Southhampton (Wanyama, Osvaldo, Lovren)
Manchester City (Fernandinho, Navas, Negredo, Demichilis)
Everton (Lukaku, McCarthy, Barry, Deulofeu)

The team you support, I will concede they are a quality team who should be challenging for the title, I admit it. What they actually do is turn up each year and collect fourth place (eventually) or fall off and drop to fourth place. They get their CL qualifying play-off and all is well.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"No, ""on licence"" means that you are released from prison with strict conditions attached - your licence to remain free. For an offence of the magnitude of Watkins this could be as arduous as no internet access (whatever that looks like in 2042), no contact with children under 12, no drug use and to be tested regularly - all features of his offending. This is administered by the probation service. If he breaches those licence conditions, it's literally back to jail, do not pass go. Say for example he's arrested by police for shouting and swearing, and he has drugs on him. On balance of probabilities (all you need) he is in breach of licence, and would go back to prison under the original sentence. No new trial required for that to happen.

""A life sentence"" actually refers to a licence that remains in place for the rest of an offenders life. So when you get a ""life sentence"" for rape or murder, you remain bound by conditions of the licence for life, even though you might serve a paltry jail term. It's commonly misunderstood and misrepresented in the media.

HE will also be under the terms of the Sex OFfenders Register, and I can only imagine he would be regarded as an extremely high risk offender. Again, VISOR subjects can have really draconian conditions applied to their freedom, such as no internet, no going within 200m of schools, frequent home visits by a monitoring team.

Many straight men from the UK go to Thailand and get fucked by shemales, suck a shemales dick, and get fucked for the first time up the arse by a shemale. Because she has a beautiful face and a huge dick. 

And yes, it's fucked up that consenting adults can't have BDSM sex, or you can't watch it in the UK anymore.

But let's face it mate, that is completely different to RAPING A CHILD. Thinking about raping a child and wanking off really is fucked up, it is in no way the same as two gays, a shemale and a guy, or BDSM sex. It's a fucking child. It's an innocent CHILD who can't process these thoughts properly yet. And this is a thread that isn't even about toddlers, it's about RAPING A BABY. 

Honestly mate, you're doing yourself a wrong one by thinking about yourself and categorising BDSM in the same regard as raping a baby. Just because the law says it's illegal, doesn't mean that you being tied up and fucked by a woman with a strapon is the same as you raping a baby. Did I really need to even make that clear to you? 

I am drunk now, so I know I'm talking off topic and you are too, but in regard to what we're speaking about... I think you know as much as I do that we should protect the children in this country. And that people WHO RAPE BABIES, deserve to be fucking hung, they are of no benefit to society and only harm to them. And we should not trying to help anybody who has raped or killed a child. Somebody like that isn't like somebody like you who likes a bit of BDSM, which is concentual and an adult decision that has been made. 

I really don't understand where you're coming from now, honestly. 

I believe in the NHS, no UK citizen should die if we can stop that from happening, and that we should have jobs available, and increase our quality of life. I'm left wing too, and right wing too, I just don't believe in these concepts but whatever wing you are if you defend a fucking child murder/rapist, you need to think about why you're saying that and if you'd say it IRL.

Many men go to Thailand and get fucked by shemales, and just say 'yeah mate they've got dicks', it's really not that abnormal lol, many people in my office have been with them. But if they talked about raping babies and killing children, please believe me the police would be there the next time they attended work. These things are completely different. 

Adults doing what they want to do, is not the same as raping or killing a child.

Whatever they don't have you can watch on dailymotion. 

You should defiantly watch the first couple of serials with Hartnell (One), An Unearthly Child and The Daleks. If you're still into it keep going. If you hate the pacing, the black and white, and/or some of the companion's entrance/departures being missing, then skip to Pertwee(Three). Though I think you should at least watch at least one Troughton(Two) serial if you do this. Not many to choose from since most of his era is gone. Tomb of the Cybermen is really good.

true,cubs314,num14,,"I feel like Spurs had their best chance over the last 4-5 years and after Bale left, it was back to the mid table for us. Levy brought some great players in for us but, unfortunately, I think he causes more internal harm than good. Harry Redknapp was a great coach for us in my eyes. Under him, we finished either 4th or 5th which is pretty damn good. We were able to get a working team together and play attractive football and this was the team I enjoyed most. Sure, we wouldn't win every game, but that was usually left until the waning minutes with a close score line, none of this 6-0 5-0 garbage. AVB had a decent year with the team and although his performance was amplified by Bale's great season, you could still see that he had the players behind him willing to work in his new system. At this point, I am starting to look at Daniel Levy. What went so wrong with Harry that we had to sack him? Sure, he lost sight of things when the England job was mentioned, but aside from that he was a great guy loved by the club. That being said, I've heard from various ITKs that he was loved so much by the players and the staff, that Levy was actually jealous. Yes, I know that this is ITK rubbish, but after reading everything about how him and AVB fell out, it is starting to make some sense. A good chairman will let a manager take full control of what goes on with the team and will handle everything on the back end. I know that Levy has the best intentions for the team but I'm starting to get a sense that he feels as though he is an Abramovic type who can call almost any shot when it comes to the club as a whole, and we saw how many managers Chelski went through in between the Mourinho years. I just hope that things begin to turn around and we can dig ourselves out of this hole and push for a 4th or 5th place spot.

Chirches, Capoue, Rose - 3 out of our back four didn't play for the team last year.
Townsend did not play for us last year so that's 5 out of 11 starters 

Then on the bench you had Fredricks, Fryers, Chadli, Eriksen and Soldado. Who either don't normally play for the first team or weren't at the club last year.

Then you have Paulinho and Lamela who weren't even in the squad but who have been regular (semi in Lamela case) players.

Football is all about combinations, knowing where your teammates are going to be, when they are going to make their run, trusting they will cover you etc. That chemistry doesn't come about in 4 or 5 months (or 16 league games) 

The fact we are 7th with 6 point less than 2nd while having had that amount of turnover is actually doing pretty well.

You mention Southampton, who have 6 wins and have dropped down the table. Man City, only 5 more points than us with a much more expensive team. Neither of those teams bought in as many YOUNG players as us. 3 of the 4 you listed for Everton have plenty of Premier league experience.

Speaking of City, can you remember where they finished the year they broke their transfer record signing Robinho for 32 mill? It was 10th. The next year 100mill to finish 5th.

Clearly people go when it's convenient for them, which is about the same time for everyone which is why it's busy on a Saturday afternoon. Ideally you'd go twice, once in late November to get all your long life stuff, like Mince pies, puddings, tins of sweets, drinks and snacks and then a week or so before hand to buy things with a shelf life of a week or two. That said, if you're prepared to shop late this week you should be okay.

Although it's very thoughtful of you, it's actually in your own interests to avoid the rush. If you try shopping this weekend it'll take you twice as long to get around because the aisle will be jam packed, everyone will be stressed because it's taking so long and everyone is in the way and everyone will take it out on each other and the staff. If people spread their shopping out it'd take everyone less time and we'd all be happier, it's simply more efficient.

true,smokey815,num11,,"I've got to take issue with a couple of your points in the first two categories.  

Over the last two days, my dislike for the 4-4-2 has been... well documented.  I don't think it fits our players, and even if it did, because of the players we field in the system, I think it's a poor decision against just about any team we'll face.  Two strikers severely weakens the midfield, and doesn't utilize the fact that we have 2-3 very capable players at every spot.  It increases the amount of ground the two center mids have to cover, and forces one of the strikers to drop so deep they almost become a midfielder themselves.

Because of the quality I mentioned before, if you're going to have a player occupying a position essentially in midfield, why not use one of those midfielders?

As for the CMs you've covered, I think you're pretty far off in your assessment of Siggy.  While he's been a functional option on the left at times, he's not really a proper winger.  Or even an inverted one for that matter.  He drifts in and stays in, basically becoming an additional center mid.  For me, he's got to be the #10 when Eriksen is hurt or being rested.  


Mousa works best alongside a proper DM like Sandro.  He's not a destroyer himself, but he's also not necessarily a playmaker.  He and Paulinho, while they have different styles, perform the same role for us.

I'd actually be interested to see Holtby or Sig get an extended run at CM next to a destroyer to see if they can become more of a deep lying playmaker.  Think Luka, but unfortunately not as good. (yet?)

I think part of our problem with the strikers today was actually self imposed.  Like I said, in the 4-4-2, one of the strikers had to drop deeper.  Because expecting Defoe contribute consistently and meaningfully to the build up is pointless, then it has to be Ade.  So Ade drops deep and helps build up.  We get the ball out to our pacey wingers who beat their man and cross the ball... Straight to the 5'8"" Defoe. 

My thoughts on that are if we switch Defoe out for Eriksen, we have that playmaker to help with the build up.  We also have that big lanky bastard who actually is a reasonable target for our wingers.",0,1387427318,null,0,false,0,ce5apqi,t3_1t7nei,t1_ce5apqi,t3_1t7nei,null,1428071238,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Because taking 10-20 minutes to learn how to use technology is too much for a large group of Conservative voting, well off, 35-50 year old mothers in middle England to take. They are the classic newspaper buying group and thus they are the target of the right wing media which is disproportionately influential in politics (because the people these papers seek to ultimately influence are old men, possibly the husbands of the middle England mothers, who don't realise it's a dying medium). 

Digression: Why do the newspapers have a disproportionate influence. 

Put simply because they had a proportionate influence in the past and the people in power haven't realised it's the future. People think the newspapers have more influence in terms of opinion than they do so politicians act to appease them which makes more people take the newspapers seriously which makes their opinions more influential. It goes in a cycle where not many people actually reads the newspapers in question but they are taken as seriously as if we all did. How can we say that the Guardian is any representation of the left wing when it's read by less than 200,000 people? Why should we take the Daily Mail seriously when only 2% of the country see it's front page? We can't and we shouldn't but the people that run the country don't recognise any other media as legitimate so they take the ravings of what are, in reality, minority interest publications seriously. /digression

Because these insular mothers have their opinions broadcast everyday in the media and because the politicians still seem to think that represents the public at large in a real way they react to it. They take it on themselves to do something rather than telling these people to do it themselves and be better parents; that might offend them. The Conservative party stands to lose the most by these middle class mothers disliking them so they reacted to appease them. Now if I want to sign up to a new ISP it's presumed I should live like a prissy middle aged woman and if I think otherwise I'm told I'm basically encouraging child abuse.

Not if they legally don't have to, as in your suggestion. 

I don't think your idea of a 20% limit is sound, but if we were to introduce it, we don't have to go door to door checking on people, or somehow inspecting leases at the time they're signed.

If you introduce this limit, landlords will not agree to hidden additional rent payments, because they'll get screwed over by the first tenant with whom they make such an arrangement.

A prospective tenant says ""my income is £1000 a month, so I'm only legally allowed to pay you £200 a month in rent, but don't worry, I'll pay you the other £150 a month cash"". The tenant can then move in, pay a cheque or bank transfer for £200 per month and when the landlord says ""hey, what about that other £150?"" the tenant can just say ""what £150? take me to court, buster"". The landlord can't bring a court case for that £150, because it was illegal to charge it (under your proposal) in the first place; the landlord doesn't have grounds to evict the tenant, because the tenant has proof of having paid the amount agreed in the tenancy agreement.

&gt; I don't think taxing problems work. The tax just gets passed on.

Meh, you have a point, but the rental market is in a kind of fixed relationship, a balance, with the home-ownership market.

In this case, if the tax is passed on, it makes renting less attractive compared to home ownership.

I appreciate that home ownership isn't on the cards for lots of people, but nevertheless, it is possible to make renting is less profitable for landlords.

If you made a ""landlord tax"" and landlords passed that on to the tenant, then this would make renting even less affordable than it is at present, and more tenants would stay at home for a few years, instead, or bunk up sharing a single room with a friend, and save a deposit for a house. Thus landlords would be deprived of profit and the business would be less attractive to them and they'd sell their rental properties. 

This alone would be a very slow way to correct the market, and it'd be pretty marginal. So actually, it would not be a bad step to take, amongst others, because sudden changes are destabilising (not to mention more politically unpopular).

Personally, I'd at least tax landlords who are renting out more than 1 or 2 properties. This would tend to shift the balance away from landlords of dozens or hundreds of properties in favour of grandma-renting-out-for-her-retirement type landlords. Maybe we wouldn't see the former unable to compete and selling up overnight, but I think it would tend to tilt the market that way (alongside some movement towards home ownership). 

Landlords profit from renting property to tenants, and the main ""value"" they add is as financial middlemen, putting down a deposit on a BTL property, and renting to people who can't afford a deposit. Any percentage of profit by which renting can be rendered less profitable is a net benefit to the class of people who actually want to live in houses. 

The fundamental problem is that there are too few houses - that's what mostly needs addressing.

Artificially trying to meddle with the market never works - not on this kind of scale, giving the pendulum a massive big push and expecting it not to wobble. Trying to set prices in stone would just lead to market imbalance and the kinds of corrections you can't anticipate - your 20% of wages suggestion is Soviet in its severity. I can imagine people might find waiting lists for flats becoming a norm, or that people have to live with their parents much longer. It sounds ripe for exploitative landlords, to me.

I mean, minimum wage is about £1000 a month - you're saying I'm not allowed to rent the flat I want for £300 a month, because I'm only allowed to spend £200. That's kinda messed up, telling me how I can spend my money. (I know someone else has given this example elsewhere on this page, but I think it's important to reiterate it). 

You should read some articles about rent control in New York - I don't think that's as radical as your suggestion, it's well-established and it has some negative side-effects. Maybe it's justified and valid, overall, but you should definitely look at it, if you're serious about this.

To me, this is pretty much all band-aid politics - it's slapping a band-aid on the problem because we don't have a shared political or social goal in this country. Everyone disagrees on the purpose of government and how much it's the state's job to help people. So our politicians just end up pandering to whichever demographic of voters is most likely to get elected - there's no overriding philosophy or system of logic to these band-aids, they're just slapped on to get us past the next election.

A quick google search on why Eccleston left the role of the Doctor explains it easy. 

Eccleston is a class act and has stated numerous times that he loved playing the role of the Doctor. Now yes he turned down the role in the 50th which though was a real disappointment for the 9 fans (myself included) you have to understand that sometimes when the first go at something leaves a bad taste in your mouth, you don't want to go at it again regardless of how much its changed since you tried it, it becomes a personal thing. In Eccleston's case he couldn't see eye to eye with the production crew as the show went on which forced him to drop the role. Now fast forward to 2013 when Moffat offered a return and Eccleston declined. Sure staff has changed in the 8 years the show has been back since so whoever Eccleston had beef with is probably gone but being back in the atmosphere that gave you just as much bad memories as good can be pretty discouraging which is why though it kills me to hear, with Eccleston being my favorite Doctor its understandable, the man has morals... Think about it like school memories, you meet some of the most wonderful people but its balanced out by the stressful work and drama that comes with school which discourages people to visit their schools as soon as they graduate.

true,undadogkev,flair5,,"There was a man named Terry. Terry lived in London with his Arsenal supporting family. They were all massive Arsenal fans, living and breathing love for the scum. During his early teenage years Terry became quite the rebel - nothing too extreme, smoked a bit of weed, drank outside the local shop with his mates, worrying his mother by staying out too late at night, the usual fare.

He also began to support Tottenham. 

This wasn't just an act of rebellion. I'm reliably informed that he genuinely loved the way Tottenham played, he'd met a few Spurs fans and started to really get along with them and had the best time of his life sitting around chatting about Spurs, playing FA Cup singles in the park always choosing his favourite Spurs player (Lineker if memory serves) to play as and emulate as he banged in the goals.

Fast forward a few years and Terry's moved out of London and into a developing town just outside and is living there with what remains of his family after a nasty divorce and a lot of fighting among each other.
One night he meets a woman, they get to know one another, one thing leads to another and eventually he's introduced to her young son.

The son had no father figure to speak of and the only football shirt he owned was a fake Manchester United shirt that his aunt had bought him when he decided he liked watching football but was too young to make a decision either way about which team to support. Man U were the biggest therefore it seemed a safe bet and that was done.

Terry fell in love with this boy's mother and as a result ended up spending more and more time with the boy and eventually the boy decided that he would also support Tottenham. Not because he knew anything particularly about the club - he was six years old, not likely to be a font of knowledge at this point - but because his first and only father figure would spend time with him bonding over football. Terry taught him about the history of Tottenham, what fun he'd had playing football with other Spurs fans in London as a young'un and, when the boy's birthday came around, bought him his first spurs shirt - complete with the number 18 and KLINSMANN ironed onto the back.

In case it wasn't glaringly obvious by now, that little boy was me. So far this may not seem to bare any relevance to the topic at hand but bare with me, I'm gonna try and bring it all together. 

I was 6 years old when I met my step dad and he introduced me to Tottenham. When I was 9 he let me play for a local football team that was coached by his uncle, also a spurs fan. 
Every aspect of my footballing experience was beginning to revolve around this club. Despite my aunt buying me a Man Utd shirt for my 5th birthday.

My point is... I may have not had the most traditional introduction to Spurs. I may not be from a long line of Spurs fans and I wasn't even born in London. In fact, I even sometimes got stick from other fans living in London for supporting Spurs. That's cool, and is expected. Football fandom is tribal and I was an outsider to them, even though we were adorned in the same colours come match day. Just as a side note, this doesn't happen any more, now it's from Man Utd fans living in Milton Keynes and please don't get me started on the irony. I digress.

I don't give a fuck where you're from. I'm not a local lad and I don't feel that being from outside London can limit any love I have for this team. During the years I've made Tottenham a massive part of my life (whether through choice or otherwise) and I feel that anybody else who can tell me the same thing should be respected equally regardless of place of origin. I welcome our American yids. Football is a global sport and America is finally catching on and recognising its beauty. Fans are going to spring up for all Premier League clubs, that's just common sense, they're the most popular and talented teams in the world (Madrid/Barca aside). I'm glad we have a portion of them coming in and showing Tottenham love. Who gives a shit if it's because they loved Dempsey and Bale? So did we. Just because we were introduced to the team a little earlier on should have no bearing on how we receive new fans. 

These people could have been fans of our rivals and they chose us and in a generation or two's time we might have a new batch of Terrys teaching young little Kevs about the wonders of Bale, about that time Woodgate of all people secured us a Cup Final win over CSKA London. About why it is we no longer eat lasagne in this household.

If you stick to Maths, Economics, Physics and Chemistry you are narrowing yourself to Science subjects, while Science subjects are important and you are definitely going to find a job doing something like Medicine, Engineering, Maths etc at Uni, you are setting yourself on a path that neglects important parts of understanding the world. Economics has a philosophical background for example through Utilitarianism, Liberalism, Libertarianism, Socialism etc to not understand the philosophical background of Economics means you wont be able to critically asses Economic theories and be a creative and critical thinker. Even if you do not want to do Economics, subjects like Medicine, Law and Sciences you need to understand such things as legal ethics, medical ethics, constitutional law (political philosophy) and the justified limits of Sciences from an ethical perspective.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"I agree, good article and an enjoyable read.

I tend to agree with the author, yet at the same time I think he's slightly disingenuous to us as well. I know when talking about whether we were good or they were bad that he said ""a bit of both"", but he went on to describe everything about how Tottenham were bad, and took barely anything about what made us so good into account. Again, I'm not saying that Spurs weren't bad...they were terrible. Absolutely awful and I'm quite sure just about any of us here could've managed that team and not lost quite as heavily. But anyway, as I was saying, I still believe he was slightly disingenuous to us...let me explain.

Firstly, every article I've read about the match so far tends to gloss over the fact that we were also missing several key players. They all bang on about how Vertonghen and Rose are missing and how they had a completely makeshift defense, which is true. But we were also missing 3 key players in our team who, without them, anyone could be forgiven for thinking we'd seriously struggle: Enrique is by far and away our best *natural* left back, with only the struggling Aly Cissokho to deputise in his absence. However, because of his poor play, we even had to overlook him and give a 4th(?) successive start to a 20-year-old **right back** who until last month hadn't played for us in the league in over a year-and-a-half. Flanno has been absolutely brilliant since his return, but you'd be forgiven for expecting him to struggle up against the likes of (former) England international Aaron Lennon or anyone else who Spurs played on their right flank.

However, not only did Flanno succeed in dealing with Spurs' ""threat"" from that area, he completely and utterly made that side of the pitch his own. He defended well for the most part when he had to, he jockeyed for position, he made Holtby throw his arms up in despair after dispossessing him twice in two seconds with a couple of challenges that Carragher himself would've been proud of, and he even began to get forward and be an outlet in attacks, like all good fullbacks should in that system. He scored one and even almost scored a 2nd in the 93rd minute. If they're going to use ""we had Naughton out of position"" as an excuse, they need to take a look at Flanno and realise what an over-simplistic pile of crap that is.

We were also missing Sturridge and Gerrard, England regulars onto whom the country will be pinning all of their hopes in Brazil next year. You could argue that they're not as important to us as Suarez or Hendo these days (and you'd be correct in one of those cases), but both are vitally important and missing them is always a big miss, no matter who the opposition.

I'll admit, before the match I had a bad feeling. I was absolutely certain of a loss. I don't know why, I was even far more confident before we played Arsenal, but I just had a sinking feeling that we'd come unstuck and that they'd sort out their tactical shortcomings and it'd all fit into place. Thankfully it didn't, quite the opposite, but the result shocked me and even now, 3 days later, I still have a stupid grin on my face whenever I think about how well we played. I don't care it was a weakened Spurs team. Fuck that, we played out of our skins and deserved that win. In fact, even with Vertonghen and Rose and whoever else they wanted to put in there, I still reckon we'd have won 5-0. Hell, give them Bale back, we still would've won 5-1 at worst. As it is, I think the score flatters them more than us. A little more composure from players like Sakho (how did you miss that header, Mamadou?!?), or dare I say it, Luis, and we'd have won 7-, 8-, 9-nil, easily. You don't get those scores simply because the other team had an off-day.

My final point I want to bring up (thank you if you're still reading this half-awake rambling of a jet-lagged fool, you deserve unlimited upvotes) is how intrigued and happy I was to watch the midfield battle unfold. It was a tale of two styles: power versus finesse, for lack of a better word. Their midfield trio of Sandro, Dembele and Paulinho on paper looks more akin to a Lamborghini; powerful, loud, fast, hoping to blow away all opponents. Ours was more akin to a Porsche on a corporate track day; smaller and nimbler but would ultimately come up short against its more aggressive counterparts. In reality, they were nothing more than a drag racer with a gearbox problem...they could only go in one direction and they never got out of 2nd gear. The thing is though, we never let them. Our smaller players who, according to Spurs supporters across the interwebs would roll over and take it from their ""BIIIGGG, muscular, exceedingly more manly"" counterparts, never gave them an inch. Allen, who I've been taller than since I was 12, stepped it up and won possession all over the place. This is a player who many people (here and on other subs) previously wrote off. The lad was out for months and months, and was playing with a shoulder injury before that. No wonder he didn't seem that good before. You try attempting to outmuscle guys twice your size with only one functioning shoulder. On Sunday though, he and Hendo battled, pressed and hassled the Spurs midfield trio into submission, and from the 2nd or 3rd minute of the match it was clear which midfield trio was going to win the battle that day.

All in all, as much as Tottenham were bad, we were good. In fact, I think we were more good than they were bad (pardon the awful structure of that sentence). We were playing with togetherness, drive and style that we haven't seen since that legendary week of 2009 when we scored 13 against United, Real and Villa, with only 1 in reply. We have kids playing all over the pitch, particularly left-back and the right side of our attack, as well as a group of players in midfield who no one other than us gives any sort of credit to. The arrogance of the Spurs fans in the lead up to that game was astounding. You'd think we were the team in midtable (or worse), struggling to score. They were absolutely certain of victory and, like their recently sacked manager, they completely failed to see either the failings of their own team or the merits of ours until it was too late. You don't play a high line against the best striker in the world when half your backline is crocked. You don't go out and show such little effort on the pitch (not one of them showed an ounce of effort on their team until Holtby came on, who from what I understand absolutely hates us since he grew up an Everton fan). We also had injuries derail our preparations for the game, except we chose not to accept our fate. We came prepared for a battle and played that way, even if the other team didn't show up. Yes, they made it easy for us, and as I said at the beginning, the author was right in that regard, but you don't get to 5-0 or more simply because the other team was bad. It was our biggest game of the season so far and we made sure none of us forgot it.

true,melihs11,null,null,"IMO the key to salvaging the project is to finish the season in such a way that we can keep hold of some or most of our best players such as Vertonghen, Lloris, and Sandro. If we have to go through another ""transitional season"" following more squad upheaval next summer, it really could all be over. If we manage to qualify for Europe in 2014-2015, we might have a chance of keeping most of the squad together. Accomplishing that seems like a daunting task right now considering that, given the way we are playing, a month from now we could easily be out of the FA cup and out of touch with the likes of City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, and Everton in the league.

I don't think that AVB had the team on track to accomplish our objectives this season so if it is true that neither he nor the board saw him remaining our manager next season, then I can't say I disagree with his sacking. There's all (except obviously the League Cup) still to play for and if we want to lift a trophy or finish top five, it will require a manager who represents a genuine improvement on AVB. Tim Sherwood most certainly is not that manager.

What we saw yesterday was like a team coached by a totally inexperienced, naive young Redknapp, who may not prove to be even half the man manager that Harry is. What we need in order for the team to ""gel"" is a tactically astute manager who commands the respect of the players and can get them playing his way quickly. A real football manager, not a rookie learning on the job, no matter much Daniel Levy rates that individual.

Levy and Baldini need to act quickly on a more permanent replacement, whether it be a caretaker (ideally Hiddink) or preferably a long-term solution. They need to get the decision right and they need to do so before we fall out of touch with our objectives. The next appointment could be one of the most important in our history. Get it right, and we have a chance to keep our current near world class players (Lloris, Vertonghen etc.), however get it wrong, and it could be back to the early 00's.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; They protested that the new powers could also prevent Tory councils from attacking the Coalition’s support for the HS2 rail link between London and Birmingham or from criticising any future decision to expand Heathrow airport.

I think this is much worse. It's one thing banning a phrase, while still allowing them to criticise it (so, they could still say 'I hate spare-room subsidy). However, banning councils from airing any opinions the government disagrees with? At least you can somewhat understand them censoring 'questionable' stuff on the internet (although I disagree with it), but what they are proposing here is nothing short of censoring descenting opinions. 

&gt; Their anger centres on measures in the Local Audit and Accountability Bill, which is about to become law, to require council publications to comply with a new code of conduct. It is designed to prevent left-wing councils from using taxpayer-funded freesheets to convey critical messages.

So a left wing council, elected by the majority of the population in that area, aren't allowed to air their views, whereas a right wing government, who didn't get a majority in that area, or in the country for that matter, are? That's democracy, right? Wasn't Cameron promoting and bigging up democracy while he was in South Africa the other day? Nice consistency there. 

&gt; Brandon Lewis, the Local Government Minister, said the measures were aimed at protecting the “good, local independent press” and ensuring taxpayers’ money is used effectively and “not wasted on town hall Pravdas”. Heavily political material should be paid for by the parties rather than local residents, he said.

Great, essentially making it so that only the people with money can push 'heavily political material'.

I really hope this doesn't become another government policy that gets quietly pushed through without any real coverage. I can understand people backing the porn filter, or GCHQ hacking, but I can't really see anyone who can honestly say they support democracy supporting this censorship.

http://monevator.monevator.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/house-price-earnings-graph.jpg

Price to earnings ratio is still very high, meaning that for the majority of buyers, homes are not affordable. With less available buyers, there is likely to be a sustained downward pressure on prices caused by lack of demand. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uk.pop.pramid.2010.jpg

The population ""pyramid"" for the UK has several substantial 'wobbles', representing the distinct generations that our population seems to be in. The biggest of those wobbles are currently aged 53-57, so approaching retirement. Given that many retired people attempt to sell their homes (either to downsize, or to raise funds for care), there could be an increase in housing supply over the next few years. Excess supply could also cause a downward pressure on prices.

It might be the case that the government help for first time buyers helps to alleviate the potential lack of housing demand, but there are a few key limitations to this strategy. It relies upon the scheme running indefinitely, otherwise the current generation of first time buyers will find themselves with no-one to sell to. Also it raises questions of where these buyers will move to, and how they will raise funds to up-size given that their equity is reduced. The government scheme seems to be delaying rather than solving the problem.

It's also handy to note that the governments attempt to support house prices reflects an expensive process for them, in terms of money, time and thought. They'd only embark upon such a project if they were genuinely in the belief that there's a real risk of further house price decline.

Overall, if you see somewhere where you'd be happy to live for a long time, buy it. If you think you might like to be moving somewhere else in about ten years, I'd advocate caution as there's a few good reasons to suspect that house prices by then will be lower than they are now.",0,1387441460,null,0,false,0,ce5esoa,t3_1t7wmi,t1_ce5esoa,t3_1t7wmi,null,1428069334,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Whilst the majority I run in to on jobs are perfectly nice, they are somewhat confrontational,  and sadly are often illiterate.  Ive closed down two sites and threatened legal action against a contractor directly as the result of travellers ignoring basic health and safety rules and completely ignoring my design and doing it their own way.

And there are all the thefts from building sites contractors moan to me about.  A disproportionate number are carried out by travellers. 

And then you have all the sites that are invaded and we spend thousands getting them off only to find tons of rubbish, broken glass and human feces covering the entire place. Which then costs our clients thousands more to clean up.

Other run ins include trying to go for a cycling holiday in the new forest and having it cancelled because travellers took over the hotel car park. 

I once also saw a john lewis van drop off a washing machine and 2 minutes later a van drove up and nicked it straight off the street (Didn't know it was travellers at the time).  

Then a traveller once tried to fight me due to a case of mistaken identity (Someone had threatened his kid apparently)... fucking terrifying given I was on my own and I could see his mates in the background just waiting.

As for gypsies I lived in Rome for a few months and the kids are utter bastards. They have this trick where they write something on a piece of card and hold it up to your face while other little bastards try and steal utterly everything on you while you cant see and are distracted.

&gt; The manufacturer's tests demonstrated a potential running cost saving of around 75 per cent compared to a diesel bus. 

&gt; The buses take around four to five hours to fully charge overnight and should have a range of 250km, which would be sufficient to operate these buses for a full day on these routes without the need to recharge.

&gt; In addition to the two buses in this trial, six additional electric buses will be introduced into the TfL fleet in early 2014.  

If those figures hold up to scrutiny (let's be honest, TFL aren't great for that) - then this is a huge win. 

[The manufacturer BYD](http://www.bydeurope.com/news/news.php?action=readnews&amp;page=1&amp;nid=164) says: 

&gt; The 12 metre BYD ebus has already been tested worldwide in major global cities, including in Europe: Paris, Bremen, Bonn, Madrid, Barcelona, Salzburg, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Brussels and Budapest. These trials have demonstrated that the range of the BYD ebus comfortably exceeds 250 kilometres on a single charge in real world urban conditions.

&gt; This performance has also been proven in extensive operational experience in China where in the southern city of Shenzhen 220 ebuses have been in service since January 2011, covering in total more than 13 million miles of challenging passenger-carrying service by the end of October 2013. Challenging means carrying up to 120 passengers during rush hours with full air-conditioning in use.

&gt; While the BYD ebus delivers zero emissions public transport it also offers bus operators tremendous operating cost savings. The energy consumption is around 130kWh/100km in urban conditions. The ebus battery takes 4 to 5 hours to recharge from totally exhausted at a cost of in the UK of only £19.44 (using off peak electricity – the buses will be recharged at night). This represents a saving of up to 75% of fuel cost compared to a diesel bus. ",0,1387443796,null,0,false,0,ce5f7vt,t3_1t5wyt,t1_ce5f7vt,t3_1t5wyt,null,1428069137,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

/u/Seismica kindly explained how this is likely to develop:

&gt; *It will go from a choice, to an automatically applied filter with an option to opt out (Like the current system for mobile networks).*

&gt; *Eventually they will start silently filtering sites that ISPs deem unsuitable for all, even if legal. They will build censorship into the terms and conditions.*

&gt; *Then a government advisor will put together a list of morally unacceptable sites to add to the list, and ISPs will voluntarily oblige, and customers will agree to this filter when they sign up to the service.*

&gt; *There are different levels of optional. Before this, people had the option to implement third party filters, and that option has existed for a long time. Now ISPs are forcing people to make a choice at the point of purchase. Honestly, how long do you think it will be before they have a default choice in place, which you have to take action to reverse? Then how long before they make it harder to reverse the filter (i.e. having to send in ID documents to prove your age, or pay a fee)? It's all little baby steps to ease us into censorship, they're not stupid enough to try and impose it on the public in one move.*

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Why not? Everyone would have their own home. Who needs to rent if you can own?

Because unless you can buy a house (2-3-4-5-6 bedroom house) for the minimum wage people will have no option but to rent due to them naturally being the cheaper option. And even when you take out the markup added to property a 2 bedroom house still costs around £30k (man costs and materials) to build (excluding land costs).

Those who do not have that cash, or those straight out of school/uni will have no choice but to rent.

If you're insisting that people can only own 1 house, who will own the other houses that need to be rented?

If the options are ""people are only allowed 1 house"" then what about companies. Are you going to make it harder or impossible for companies to own property. I can register myself as a LTD company with little to no effort, you're then back to square one.

You could suggest the government - but be realistic that will never be a good idea, the tories will simply sell them off at the 1st sign of trouble.

Better (more realistic) options are limit house/property ownership, fine people/companies for vacant properties and manage rent expectations (very difficult that one as they are tied to mortgage payments and that's another problem all together).

true,ianrush88,null,null,"Excellent points here. Agree about Allen's ball winning, he's always read the game well to spot chances to win the ball but last year you'd see him get outmuscled when executing the tackle. Hopefully his shoulder is fixed once and for all because its going to come under pressure if he keeps playing like that. We actually saw sides to both Allen and Henderson that I wouldn't normally consider their strengths: Allen in physical duels and Henderson spotting creative, game-opening passes.

I think the high line aspect has been a bit overstated in the media. They played a high line in both fixtures last season and didn't get opened up like that, apart from the first 15 minutes at anfield; Swansea played a high line against us earlier this season and were very effective. Naughton and Capoue being part of the spurs defence, whether they dropped deeper or pushed up, may have been a bigger factor.

Probably the thing that's been most ignored about sunday was how tight and disciplined we were off the ball. We limited spurs to two real chances - Chadli's leap from a corner and Soldado in on goal at an angle after Sakho's mistake (arguably Holtby had a half-chance but Sakho was right on top of him). Man City have thrashed teams at the Etihad, yet conceded significantly more clear cut chances in those games than we gave up on sunday. When you consider that we were away at a team with good players, the number of chances we conceded at teams like arsenal, everton and swansea, and the fact that the spurs high line is *designed* to create chances by winning the ball quickly and having attacking players in support (while potentially being more open to the counter), our restriction of spurs is nearly as impressive as the goals we scored. We've had no problem creating chances this season, our bigger problem has been the chances we concede so for me this was a big development for us. As well as the pressing in the first half, in the second half before the sending off when they had some of the ball we dropped deeper and let them play in front of us and they created nothing. I don't know if this was genuinely the team being intelligent as a unit or just a coincidence of the right tactics at the right time, we'll need to see more games to judge.",0,1387445159,null,0,false,0,ce5fg07,t3_1t830y,t1_ce5fg07,t1_ce5e2vb,null,1428069030,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Personally, I feel that if porn does pose a danger to our youth (and I doubt that claim too) then families and schools should be working to educate them enough to avoid those dangers. Implementing a blanket filter means that the danger still exists and teenagers still don't have a means to protect themselves. It also means that legitimate non-porn sites will get caught up and banned (we're starting to see this already).

Your point about Henderson in your first paragraph raises a good question: Is his creativity and passing success against Spurs simply a result of Gerrard not being in the team? Perhaps with Gerrard playing, our other players, Henderson included, tend to let Gerrard be that creative outlet. I'm hoping that Hendo now realises he's got just as much **potential** to be that outlet as Gerrard. It won't be immediate, and he might not be consistent for the time being, but if he continues to improve like he has over the past 12 months, he can become our engine for another decade.

I'm not calling for Gerrard to be dropped. Not at all. But while he's out, it'll be a great chance to see Hendo and Allen and how they cope with some more tough fixtures.

They have dual controls for a reason.

I think if on the way to the dual carriageway if I'd been massively nervy or stalling everywhere, we wouldn't have done it.

We did it because the test centre I was at is basically just off the ring road, so they will take you on the dual carriageway a lot on test, so it makes sense.

It's the same reason why the day I got my car sorted after my test (I had to go to San Francisco for work the day after I passed so there was a 2 week gap) I decided to take myself for a jaunt up the motorway, because if I didn't do it then, I never would.

What we know about Charles we know from his public pronouncements. ""Monstrous Carbuncles"", Homeopathy and all the other stuff comes from *speeches* he's made to various groups, that have subsequently been reported on. And that's all in the last 20 years or so (the modern media age, for want of a better description), it's not when he was a nipper. 

And it's not that he's got opinions that people disagree with that's the problem - *everyone's* got opinions - it's that he feels free to voice them in a way his Mother does not. And simply by being in the public eye, his opinions count more than yours and mine. 

**This** is is the most impressive thing about the Queen:  all those years on the throne and could you give me a firm, documented opinion she holds about anything important?. She knows her place - Figurehead, not Leader - and she serves her country fantastically by staying in it.

Now William has *either* caught his Grandmother's sense of duty about things (I hope) or (more likely) is just too young to have developed political causes and opinions he feels the need to talk about in public. I suspect the truth of the matter is that he's been well advised by those around him to keep schtumn, and hasn't yet felt strongly enough about anything either way to speak up regardless. 

Either way, I think this underpins why many people would prefer William to succeed QEII rather than Charles - he's young, handsome, has a gorgeous wife and young family (mass appeal) *and poses no threat to anyone at all* (political appeal).

Whilst I agree with most of your sentiments I'm not sure about this being ""business as usual"", particularly when looking back over the last twenty years. We're not the club we were under Gross, Graham, Hoddle, Santini, Jol, Ramos. We've come on leaps and bounds on and off the pitch. We have some of the best players in Europe on our books with the likes of Lloris, Vertonghen and Sandro, and some of the most highly sought after prospects in Eriksen and Lamela. Compared to the Sergei Rebrovs, Gary Dohertys and Noe Pamarots of the past, our expectations *should* be higher.

We should not expect to lose 0-1 and 0-3 to Newcastle and West Ham at the Lane, we should not expect to only have scored fifteen goals all season, we should not expect to stumble to lucky own goal and penalty wins against relegation-threatened clubs.

It's not a sense of entitlement as such, just that we as followers of the game know that our team, and our club, should be doing better.

* When facing that long ball shit, the second we get the ball, don't just hammer it up the field. Try and win a free kick, or try and win a throw-in. Disrupt the rhythm. Get Dembele, Holtby, Siggy to string some passes together, take DOWN the tone of the game.

* When we're aware that all that's happening is crosses are coming in, Fryers and Walker should go wide towards the man on the wing, and Lennon + Siggy should track back and do the same. Yesterday - the second goal was completely avoidable. There was far too much room for the cross to come in. The first goal, Jarvis had a splendid finish from that angle - can't do much about those (even though Walker lost his man).

* At this point - it's up to the team. I know AVB was stubborn about the way of playing, but now the players can dictate what they should be doing on the field. If crosses isn't working, play through the middle, mix it up. Ade to drop back let Defoe push up, then Defoe to drop back, Ade to push up. Bring in some variety.

* A big problem is when we sit back and ALLOW teams to come at us. With a make-shift defence, is that really what you should be doing? Last night in the final 20 minutes, each time we got the ball, SPRINT SPRINT SPRINT! No. Yes, that second goal would have put the game to bed, but it also risks losing the ball again. BUILD PLAY. CONTROL THE GAME AGAIN IF YOU'RE WINNING.

Every week you'll see teams losing at home. 

My quintissential experience as a Spurs fan is going to White Hart Lane a couple of seasons ago to see us play Wigan. The season before that we'd beaten Wigan 9-1 and everyone at the ground was talking about how many we'd score. Would we win 9-1 again? Would it be 5-0? Would it be 7-0. In the end we played poorly and lost 1-0. It didn't surprise me. 

A lot of people seem to think that investment=success. All that investment means is that you have the chance to buy a better type of player.

Legislation has to be compatible with laws and can be challenged where as this kind of ""do as we say or we'll force you to have to fight massively overreaching legislation that will cost you a lot of money and tie up your legal team for years and in the meantime penalise you based on our total ignorance of technology both wilfully and otherwise"" can pretty much do what ever the hell it likes. 

When the ISPs 'voluntary' do as the government want it means that the government is legally not responsible for those actions. You can't challenge the filters (even if the ISPs make them mandatory) in court because it's not technically censorship that's imposed by law. Your only recourse is to use the ""free"" market and use an ISP that hasn't decided to join up. This of course will be near imposable for most people and so the government gets exactly what it wants with out having to actually being held to account for the results.   

In short the government didn't want to legislate this and was likely well aware that such legislation wouldn't be upheld. However the threat of the mess going down that road would make of ISPs for years is enough to get them to toe the line anyway. We might see push back from the ISPs if the government tries to push them to far on this front but they are effectively dealing with being held at gun point.

Their medium term goals are probably to get some renegotiation  of the NI constitutional documents which benefits them and people like them, to do this they need political legitimacy. Now obviously planting bombs on the face of it is a very bad way to gain legitimacy- however they are probably trying to doing several not immediately obvious things (none of which are really helped by actually killing people). The first and most obvious thing they seek is attention- if they are going to become political in 10 to 15 year time it is essential that they are well known. On a similar note they are trying to gain revolution credentials- they are trying to demonstrate that they are a serious group bravely  fighting for their peoples liberation (of course this is bullshit as about 5 people here actually support them) which means if they do become political they are theoretically attractive to hardcore republicans. The final thing they are trying to do is discredit the state and Sinn Fein who they probably see as traitors to the cause of a united Ireland. If all this is successful they probably believe that in 10 to 15 years time they will be in a position similar to Sinn Fein in the mid 80's from which they will to entire politics and try to move the agenda over the next 20 to 30 years towards a united ireland. And of course there are probably some nutters in amongst them who just want to hurt people. Either way they are cunts and the only way to stop this pressure from within their own community.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"Yes.

As mentioned, this is working the way it is supposed to work.

If for instance there was a large amount of traders (like [btc-e](https://btc-e.com), or mtgox, see darkmoody - http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/). You will notice a large amount of 'Sell Orders.

These can be seen on the bottom left, and left hand side respectively (you can select darkmoody to show more than the standard 100 listings).

If for example, on IBWT, there were sell orders for 459, 449.56 450, 450,5, 451, 451.505, etc, etc, your buy order would be instantly met.

We don't force customers buy orders (or sell orders) to lower or higher amounts. That is **not** how an Exchange works.

I have not personally used the other current methods in how to get Bitcoins in the UK, so I can't speak on whether they take the change buyers/sellers prices to fit others.

But we do not. It is not how an Exchange works, perhaps there are other Exchanges out there that do change a customers buy/sell order, I have not heard of them (I'd be interested to hear if there was though).

If you place a buy order for £450, or another amount, and there is not a matching sell order, then your buy order shall appear in the buy book.

This is working as intended. I will be honest and say there is not a lot of traders on IBWT yet (it is very understandable that it is a difficult thing to mail hard cash in the post, we had to think on the model thoroughly), yet in time (we've only re-launched 4 weeks ago), we'll get the traders (especially as more banks close more accounts, like Btc-China recently), we won't have as much as mtgox or bitstamp for a fair bit of time. But when we do, then buy and sell orders, as yours, will be met in a speedier fashion.

So, yes, again, I invite you to look at the Sell Order books of the other (much) more active Exchanges and consider how much easier it is for their platforms to automatically meet buy orders.

To be honest, it is simply plain **wrong** to change a customers buy or sell orders to automatically fit someone else's. Someone would always lose out and be rather annoyed, it is simply is not part of our business model.

A Trader (you, any customers, buyer or seller), is free to place whatsoever buy or sell order they wish. Without our (IBWT) changing their orders.

Civil Servants get paid far more than private sector people, don't you know that?  The Telegraph and the Mail are always banging on about it so it must be true.

My experience of HMRC (as I said in another thread) is that they are too eager to please whoever is their current minister rather than leading their current minister based on fact and data, plus they are too reluctant to let things go to other departments creating a huge monolith that has gone beyond its realms.  They are more or less the only department that aren't on gov.uk, their websites stink for finding information (because they don't care about people, their websites are built for lawyers) and their phone lines aren't much better.  As you say, this creates a culture of 'quick wins' where they know they won't have to go through courts.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"I was born and grew up in a republic before moving to the UK, and I don't really understand this for a few reasons:

First of all, there's a vast difference between being the head of state and the head of government. Anyone is free to be Prime Minister, which is arguably a much, much, much more important job. Or really anything else. The only thing they can't be is Monarch, that's it.

Secondly, I can't imagine why anyone would want to. Monarchs wield little if any power or influence. For all practical purposes, the position of PM far outranks that of the Queen. Plus, who would want to be the Queen? You get lots of nice things, and in return you get to enter a life of servitude where your every move, word and gesture will be scrutinised ruthlessly by those who want to ensure that you're succeeding and those who can't wait for you to fail. Even worse, you have no control over it, and no term limits. You either abdicate or die on the job. It's a pretty tough gig.

Furthermore, to me, the single biggest advantage of a monarch *that remains politically neutral* is that they represent a non-partisan figurehead of the nation. In western democracies, this is perhaps slightly less important than it is in places with ethnic and religious groups in constant conflict, but it's not to be underestimated. Take the US for example; a substantial percentage of the US population *loathes* Obama. The man who represents the font of power and what it means to be American is actively despised by much of the population due to politics. That to me is one of the truly wonderful things about constitutional monarchies; their job isn't to rule the country and pass laws that people have opinions about - their job is to represent the country internationally in an apolitical and dignified manner, and support charities and organisations that work to improve society. That's it. The Queen's not about to lay out a new royal decree tomorrow banning abortions, or legalising bestiality, or something incredibly controversial. In that sense, people from almost all political backgrounds still have a figurehead that represents the country that none of them find particularly offensive.

And the final point about social mobility - I agree it sounds nice when put that way, [but the data show](http://www.cognitionandculture.net/home/blog/16-nicolas/602-better-live-in-sweden-than-in-the-us-why-more-equal-societies-almost-always-do-better) that most of the countries in the world with the lowest levels of income inequality (Norway, Japan, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands) are all constitutional monarchies. Sure, the UK is much more unequal than most, but certainly no more so than the US. In fact, Spain is more equal than Portugal, and Canada more equal than the US.

A final point I would make is that though it may be true that in theory any American *could* be the president, in reality you have to be wealthy and powerful, currying the favour of donors, lobbyists, political groups and factions, party leaders and so on. The simple fact of the matter is that again, in practice, very few people could ever be in a position to become the president unless they were already starting from a pretty high base. I don't particularly see how telling a child they can be President is any more impressive than telling them they can be a ninja or an astronaut or an F1 driver, or even the second coming of Christ. The only difference is that as we get older, we still wouldn't mind being any of those things *except* President - who the hell wants that job other than narcissists with a desire to make their friends wealthy?

As a dyed-in-the-wool archetypal progressive leftist, this often puts me at odds with people near me on the political spectrum. [This article](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2011/04/28/why-i-think-the-monarchy-is-great/) by Chris Dillow on the website Liberal Conspiracy explains my feelings pretty well; granted, it's got some relatively hyperbolic language thrown in for good measure (as do most republican websites as well), but it's perhaps a bit more comprehensive in outlining my point of view. And in all honesty, I can understand where most republicans are coming from, and I agree that it sounds nice in theory; I'm aware of the monarchy's shortcomings (my main concern being funding), and I'm naturally a very sceptical person who tries to analyse most situations before forming any sort of strong opinions on things, but I just can't for the life of me see the use in chucking centuries of history out the window for something that I can't see as being any better of an alternative. As a progressive, I always like seeing things advance into newer and better things, but I just don't see how the UK becoming a republic (with the data at hand) is in any way a step forward; it's just an arbitrary step to the side for no real purpose other than to change something just because it feels right.

For me, Southampton has a lot of strength and height in their team (think Osvaldo, Lambert) who are strong, good in the air but not quite the Suarez players. I think that this suits Daws way better than last weekends horrible defeat. However, I feel like a defensive 4-3-3 would be beneficial. I was thinking 4-3-3 like this:

Lloris -Walker - Daws - Vlad - Rose - Dembele - Capoue-
 Eriksen/Holtby - Lamela -Townsend -Adebayor

I feel like Dembele and Capoue (Capoue especially) can fill in as Sandro and help out with Osvaldo and Lambert, and have Dembele utilise his strength in order to retain possession (and hopefully not lose it) and provide balls for our wingers, and Eriksen/Holtby who can play in a deeper CM role as well as CAM. I feel like Adebayor still has a lot to prove to the manager, to us fans and to himself so I feel like he can give a hell of a performance as much as I love Soldado.

I also think that Walker's pace and Lamela's creativity can trouble Shaw more than predictable Lennon (lets admit it, he often manages to end up near the outside box without really leading anywhere, just like Townsend a bit).

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Evasion is submitting your year end accounts, making say £100k profit, incurring a £20k tax bill and just not paying it.

Avoidance is structuring your business/accounts in such a way that you *still* make £100k profit but it doesn't quite reflect that on the books, so you never get the £20k tax bill. 

A crude example would be setting it up so that just before your accounts are due you have a sister company in another country send the UK company a bill for all the profit. The money stays under your control but the UK company now shows £0 profit so doesn't pay any tax. 

It's not *that* simple obviously, but the general idea is the same. Tax is fairly simple at the end of the day, you made £500k and spent £400k, so profit is £100k and HMRC takes a percentage of that. So if you can find a way to spend that £100k in such a way that it's not really gone from your control but still marked as 'spent' money.. you avoid the tax bill.

Under £300k profit the tax rate is 20%, so the goal with the above example would be to spend that £100k in such a way that it will return more than what you'd be left with had you just paid tax. So anything above £80k is money you're saving that would have gone to the £20k tax bill.

I'm never going to say it's stupid americans on here cos that's harsh and just a stereotype. I'm perfectly happy for american fans, it's no different from any other new fan, but please just show some humility, don't pretend to have it all figured out if you've only been here a while. I bloody don't and I've been supporting spurs my whole life.

&gt;  Most of us support Spurs specifically because we don't want to be glory hunters and cheer for Man U, Chelsea, Arsenal, or City

Maybe I shouldn't take this out of context, but maybe don't say this next time as it makes it seem like you support spurs cos you don't want to be called a glory hunter. By that logic you could support any one of 100 other teams in the league, I know it seems silly but it just could be worded better i guess.

&gt;There are probably some who planned to stay, but have fallen (or will fall) away when they realize that being a Spurs supporter has a lot more lasagna, Judas, and Europa League than it does glory, glory nights at the San Siro.  

This is quite important as it is quite frustrating to see this happen, as you see people here rage at players/managers/chairmen as if we deserve this or that. I'm not trying to belittle new fans or have a go at them but I'd just like a few of them that've got worked up to sit back and say ""hey I've not been around here that long, maybe dropping into midtable, losing a good manager is something that happens as a fan and screaming hail mary about it isn't going to change anything and will just annoy people""

It's got nothing to do with where supporters come from it's just about how long they've been a fan. Being a new fan won't necessarily make your opinions wrong but you might not get the same perspective on it that a new fan has and when you compare several thousand new fans or something on here, don't blame me if I see a pattern of reactionary posts.

On the other hand it could just be the way this website works that the most outlandish and reactionary posts get voted to the top whilst the sensible opinions are just there in the middle range being discussed.

&gt; This antagonistic attitude is stupid, it's jingoistic, and it's bad for the club we both love. Stop being such a pretentious douche bag and enjoy the fact that other people love what you love. Instead of being a football hipster, embrace new fans and help teach them about the club you supposedly love.

You've switched it round i see here. Umm I don't know many spurs fans that'd consider themselves football hipsters in the sense that they don't want us to become popular because it would ruin the coolness or anything. That's ridiculous we're like within the top 10 most supported clubs in Britain, and we're only getting more fans by the looks of things.
That said it's not hard to find out about spur's history or to enjoy watching us play so I don't think new fans have a tough job finding their feet here, and whilst they're welcome some of them will have some learning to do in terms of how you behave when something doesn't go your way in sport. People seem permanently in a state of crisis or elation, and these overboard reactions are just annoying to see.

The simple fact here is this: first, it is perfectly legitimate for a company to be based in one country but sell goods in another. Try to make a moral argument out of it if you like, but we all live in one big happy European free market, and this is what you get.

Second, if the UK lowered corporation tax to compete with places like Ireland and Belgium, companies like Amazon, Apple and Google would be far more likely to be based in the UK and be paying UK tax. Lowering business tax actually increases tax revenue.

British Rail were developing an [Automatic Train Protection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Train_Protection#Overview) system in the 1990s after the Clapham Junction crash. Two prototype systems were developed. They were installed on the Great Western and Chiltern lines, and are still in use today.

The prototype ATP systems were both based on existing signalling systems from Europe anyway so I don't know why it couldn't have been rolled out earlier. Of course, the usual arguments of cost came up and the system was never fully rolled out. Instead [TPWS](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Train_Protection_%26_Warning_System) was developed and installed at a lower cost.

Now that [ERTMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System) has been developed we have one cab signalling system that can be rolled out when lines like the Great Western get electrified and upgraded in the coming years.

&gt;There are no plans to run European trains any further than London until HS2 is built

No. But at this point ERTMS is [mandated](http://www.railwaypro.com/wp/?p=2724) for new and upgraded main lines. That will include the ECML and GWML as they get upgraded.

The main reason ERTMS was developed was to replaced the mix of signalling systems across Europe anyway. Each country would have it's traditional signalling systems (like our [AWS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Warning_System#British_Rail_AWS)), and then they were developing new systems for high-speed lines (like the French [TVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_voie-machine) system). So trains like the Eurostar need something like seven dfferent systems just to run in three countries, because they were running on non-high speed lines when the service first launched.

true,p4rus,eng-essex,Essex,"We're buying at the moment. I *hope* it's a good time.

That aside, my main bit of advice is not to overstretch yourself. Be sensible. We could conceivably have spent a lot more than we have done/are doing, but we'd have been left with no savings and monthly repayments that left us with no spare cash should shit hit the fan. A rule of thumb offered to us is that you should try to leave half your annual combined salary in savings at all times. Obviously that's not always possible, but by not overstretching yourself you can leave that headroom should you need it. All told we've been pleasantly surprised by the whole thing, especially how low our monthly repayments will be compared to our rent now. But our circumstances will likely be different to yours and that may not be the same.

The first step is to look at your monthly finances. How much can you spend on a monthly mortgage repayment? Because unless you're paying 100% of the house up front, you'll need a mortgage. Factor in *everything* you spend over a month when working this out. Then, count all your money. How much do you have in total? Now imagine that as a 5%, 10% or 15% deposit on a house: what kind of budget would that give you, and are you able to borrow enough to make up the difference? Lots of estate agents we went into had tame financial advisors. A chat with one of them would be useful. With us he sat down for an hour and went through what each different lender or bank might be able to give us, giving us a really good idea of our top end budget, along with what criteria they had for actually securing that mortgage. Be aware that stuff like fixed term contracts or very new jobs might make things difficult. He was then able to show us projected monthly repayments, from which we could see if we could actually afford to live.

On top of all that, remember that there's stamp duty to pay, legal fees, surveyors, and then the inevitable renovations and redecorations once you're in. Our fees, all told, are coming to around £6k. The amount you spend on renovations depends on the house you buy; some we saw were ready to go. Others would have required £20k+ and a couple of months to make them habitable.

But when it comes to engineering, only in the last few years has there been any major government support in training and education. Now we're training far more engineers then previously, but still not at a rate which keeps pace with the numbers retiring each year. We can't grow our manufacting base with that sort of labour market.

London's resiliance to this decline has made it a beacon of opportunity for the aspiring young, so now we have the situation where people graduate and imediately move there to 'make it'.

The result is the rest of the country being starved of talented individuals, who'd much rather remain in the countries cultral centre, despite the high cost of living.

It spends less tax because of the incredible corruption there. Entire neighbourhoods are empy in london as a result of Ruissia/Chinese/Saudis using the UK housing market as a financial safety net. And our rulers that sit on their thrones rolling out laws as a one size fits all approach to the rest of the UK are happy to inflate the housing market in this way because Eton twats like Osbourne then get to stand up and say ""I fixed the economy"".

Secondly, anything in the composites industry (aerospace, motorsport, maritime) isn't done by machinery anyway, but by hand. Making the sort of strong, light-weight components we need to fuel a more energy-efficient ecconomy requires an awful lot of semi-skilled manual labour.

It is not our (IBWT's) place to ask traders why/what they're putting their Orders at, or changing customers Orders to fit our own needs.

If a decentralised virtual currency Exchanges decides to start changing customers Orders to fit already placed orders, that is their own choice.

It is not our practice to change customers orders to fit our own needs. But please, if you find Exchanges that do change customers Orders around, let the rest of us know, so people can stay away from them if they so choose.

I understand what you're saying. You would prefer an Exchange that changes customers Orders to fit the minimum Sell Order automatically.

~~We do not do this. We do not change customers Orders. Customers are free to place whatsoever Orders they wish to place without our interference.

true,jjones217,num23,,"""There's also a bunch of us who are Tottenham till we die. Most of us support Spurs specifically because we don't want to be glory hunters and cheer for Man U, Chelsea, Arsenal, or City.""

This is exactly why I started following Spurs 3 years ago. I wanted to watch a team that had the potential to compete for top four, and maybe eventually the title, and also play in the European competitions. 

What I didn't want was a club so prominent and steeped in success that they thought their shit didn't stink and the fans felt like they were entitled to finishing top 2 (aka. UK equivalent of the Yankees - Manchester United). 

I didn't want to be a part of a fanbase whose team bought their way to championship success after being nobody for such a long spell and now act like they're above everyone else (UK equivalent of the Red Sox - Manchester City). 

I didn't want to be a part of a fanbase of spoiled old-timers talking about the glory days and bitching with every season of missed glory (UK equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys - Liverpool).

I didn't want to be a part of a fanbase of a team that had unlimited cash and would throw money at whatever problem with an eccentric rich owner who meddled too much in the affairs of the team (UK equivalent of the Dallas Mavericks - Chelsea)

I've gotten off track. The point is, I chose Tottenham because they were the embodiment of what I love in a sports team. I started watching them around Christmas of their 2010-11 campaign. I got to see them fight through the group stage in the CL and beat Milan. It was great, and I quickly fell in love with the club. I haven't missed a single PL game since. I occasionally missed cup games, but that's only due to the time difference from where I live an the availability of replays that I can download. 

Point is, I'm an American fan and I didn't come here for Friedel or Dempsey, just like I wouldn't take up being a fan of Everton for Tim Howard or Sunderland for Jozy Altidore. Spurs and football, in general, have quickly surpassed some of the other sports and teams that I've followed my whole life. 

So to anyone that hopes that I take my American fandom somewhere else, I sincerely hope you go screw yourself.

That's already a normal part of train maintenance, so nope, nobody's on strike over it.

The vast majority of UK trains are now fitted with those systems as standard. These are some of the last trains left in the country without it, simply because of their age. They will be retired within a few years.

I don't know about the railways specifically, but on ships [I'm a marine engineering student] these holding-tank systems have been a legal requirement for years, to protect our coastal water quality.  
(Particularly on passenger-carrying vessels, which... *ahem* tend to produce rather more sewage than just a crew).  
They are also already mandatory on new small pleasure yachts (ie. caravans!), but older yachts built without them currently have an historical legal exemption. That might disappear.

&gt;Tax avoidance is bending the rules of the tax system to gain a tax advantage that 
Parliament never intended. It often involves contrived, artificial transactions that serve little 
or no commercial purpose other than to produce a tax advantage. It involves operating 
within the letter but not the spirit of the law.

&gt;Tax avoidance is not the same as legitimate tax planning. Legitimate tax planning involves 
using tax reliefs for the purpose for which they were intended. For example, claiming tax 
relief on capital investment, saving in a tax-exempt ISA or saving for retirement by making 
contributions to a pension scheme are all legitimate forms of tax planning.

This isn't true for all circumstances - sometimes lowering tax does increase revenue, sometimes it leads to a decrease in revenue.

There is a sweet spot where charging just the right amount of tax leads to the most amount of revenue possible.

Your view on where that sweet spot is will likely be based on where you think the current situation sits on the **[Laffer Curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve)**.

true,AllenJB83,null,null,"Typical lorry drivers - even tho they have plenty of free space on their lanes to the right, they continue to travel too close together in the first lane through a busy junction.

To those who believe you're supposed to stop here, I don't believe that's what the road marking indicate. The single dashed line indicates 'give way', not 'stop and give way'.

The highway code states you should always drive in the left-most lane as long as the lane ahead is clear. You should use the next lane to the right when overtaking slower vehicles (which I believe implicitly includes vehicles merging to your lane).

The highway code states:
&gt; ... keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front and increase the gap on wet or icy roads, or in fog (see Rules 126 and 235).

I believe that the lorries in the video are not a safe distance from the vehicle in front in this case because of the merging traffic.

The highway code explicitly states:
&gt; You MUST NOT stop on the carriageway, hard shoulder, slip road, central reservation or verge except in an emergency, or when told to do so by the police, HA traffic officers in uniform, an emergency sign or by flashing red light signals.

true,superlewis,flair5,,"Let me explain the glory hunters comment. When I started to follow football, I looked at the teams in the Premier League to get some idea of who to follow. I instantly stopped considering Arsenal, Man U, Chelsea, and Man City (although at that time Man City was just starting to rise). I didn't want to pick a team that was always going to be at the top because they were rich and had built on their richness.

On the other hand, I didn't want to pick a team that was going to get relegated. I, obviously, can't watch many games from the Championship. I don't want to support a team that I can't even watch. From that middle range of teams, I just started watching and felt attracted to Spurs. That's not the reason why I support Spurs, but it did play a big factor. That's probably true of most American Yids. If we were selecting a team based on logic and chance of winning titles, we wouldn't have picked Spurs. Because we did pick Spurs, it shows that we picked a team because of something else.

Another interesting thing I notice in your response, is your frustration with people who are upset about the current state of fairs. Maybe this is just an illustration of the differences between our two cultures, but this seems really odd. Don't we all want to win titles and participate in the Champions League? This attitude of, ""we've always been a mid-table team, and we shouldn't expect to stop being one,"" really baffles me. Perhaps, it's stereotypical English pessimism, but I'm always going to want to be improving and be upset when we go backwards.

I see what you're saying about giving a customer a better deal (which if they want the harder/higher deal, its harder for them to type in, than just clicking the min sell order). But what if they specifically want to put a higher order?

Try placing a high buy order with Mtgox and/or Btc-e (with a pitiful small amount of coin), and you'll see that they match the order the customer (you) places, they don't change your order to the minimum sell order.

Because IBWT has a very small order book in comparison to other Exchanges, there will be overlaps (and these will likely be brought up by savvy day traders), until there are a lot of traders on the IBWT platform.

edit: If we can safely keep the option of allowing customers to choose whether they wish to put in a higher Buy Order (and meet that higher Sell Order), or, have their Buy Order changed by the platform to meet the lowest Buy Order, then we will.

London doesn't produce anything other than numbers on a computer screen and shit to pollute the Thames with. Absolutely everything London consumes comes from outside of London. And with that dependancy comes the ability of suppliers to ramp up the prices if the opportunity presents itself.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Obviously not. Don't twist my words.

I'm simply making the point that you cannot possibly improve the country as a whole by maintaining the status quo.

As large as London might be, there are major, major cities in the North and Midlands of England, and in Wales and Scotland that deserve investment.

Yorkshire for instance, where I live, has a population a little greater than Scotland, with a massive financial services sector. It has the potential to be a powerhouse of commerce for the UK, but cannot reach that level without investment, which it does not get. While billions are ploughed into London, the UK's 3rd largest city repeatedly gets denied a tram or underground system.

Very recently, a stadium was closed in Sheffield to save £50 million. Around the same time, West Ham were awarded £60 million to help them move into the Olympic stadium. This is a classic example of taking from the North and giving to London. It's just not fair. 

It would cost Leeds United £15 million to buy back Elland Road. Would they get that money? Would they fuck. But Leeds United has the potential to have the largest native fanbase of any club in the country.

Sometimes I think Londoners forget that there are vastly more people living in the rest of the country. You might make more money than we do, but that's not because you're better, it's simply because you've always had more, and can capitalise on that.

There are thousands of entrepreneurs in the rest of the country crying out for help from the government.

Investment is always about *potential*, and places like Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle all have massive potential, but it's easier to just argue that London produces more so it should get more.

How can you possibly expect the rest of the country to better itself without an increase in investment?

I've had a couple of beers at lunch, so this comment might not be the most coherent thing I've ever written, but it certainly goes to show how much I care about the situation.

If we want the UK to be a major power again, and we want to improve our economic fortunes, we cannot rely on 12.5% of the population to do so.",0,1387464151,null,0,false,0,ce5izhc,t3_1t8n2c,t1_ce5izhc,t1_ce5hhej,null,1428067309,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I don't see why you should imagine I'd dislike your solution, although IMO shortage is the essential fact. Once availability is addressed, prices will follow. 

I agree with you that security is an underlying element, but I would guess that it's not only rent-control that has led to greater housing security in Germany.

Over the past 3 decades, neo-liberal policies have undermined tenant security - the Smith Institute talks of this in terms of ""revers[ing] three-quarters of a century of over-regulation … allowing landlords to regain control of their properties by notice and enabling them to charge market rents."" [[PDF](http://www.smith-institute.org.uk/file/The%20End%20of%20the%20Affair%20-%20implications%20of%20declining%20home%20ownership.pdf)]

I think entrepreneurism is wonderful, but what is so entrepreneurial about being a landlord? I think we need a change of narrative and a wider understanding that tenants rent their homes, and should not be treated primarily as profit centres - landlords need to be in it for the long-game.

We all understand that property is a safe investment on a (relatively) small island like the UK, so I am sympathetic to second-home landlords, who own one or two rental properties for retirement income, but it's another thing when [foreign investors are rushing to profit from our peoples' essential needs.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9507235/Rise-in-foreign-landlords-is-crowding-out-first-time-buyers.html)

At present tenants who have lived in their homes for years can be evicted with only a few weeks notice, having done nothing wrong. That is the second thing, after availability, that needs to change.

i have linked this account not because it is necessarily the best way for you to go, but it does demonstrate what is possible:

&gt; Opening adult must be 18 or over and the child must be under 16 and a UK resident. Child's birth certificate or passport required at account opening.
&gt; Interest paid is net of income tax (currently 20%) unless a parent or guardian registers the account with us, on behalf of the child, to receive gross interest

in other words, you can open an account for your bro (assuming you are 18+), as long as you have his documentation.  the only thing you can't do is make the interest pay tax-free automatically.  your parents can do this if you can get their attention, or he can always claim tax back from the government. crucially, the interest point ""proves"" (to my mind) that everything else can be done by someone who is not a parent (because that is the only section with a caveat like that).

When I send the order to sell 1 BTC @ $675, what I mean is ""I would like to receive **at least** $675 for my bitcoin"". If I receive more I won't complain.

If these two trades are in the market then you can see that you have the following options:

* Seller receives 675, buyer pays 675.
* Buyer pays 1000, seller receives 1000
* Anything in between

Now you can see that with any of these options, both the buyer and the seller are happy because: The buyer pays no more than $1000 for his bitcoin. The seller receives at least $675 for his bitcoin.

You can debate exactly which option should occur, but there should definitely be a trade!

He is perfect positionally, his athleticism and strength mean he is favourite in most 50-50s. Even though I prefer midfielders who are better on the ball, he is good enough with it. He has been playing at the base of Porto's midfield for around 7 years so he is clearly a quality player.

He is one of the best tacklers around, so aggressive. He'd give us the bite that we've missed ever since Mascherano left. He's vocal, a leader and experienced but still has his best to come.

You see from these videos that he is actually more impressive when the game is open, something Lucas struggles with and appears overworked. I think he is better than Lucas, but you never know how a player might adapt.

I also think he can improve, he can become one of those midfielders who can burst from midfield and join the attack. He just qualified for Portugese citizenship, so he is serious about his national team ambitions, and having a motivated player is great for the squad.

I think he'd be a great signing, especially on a free. He could challenge Lucas, or be an option for closing games. ",0,1387465035,null,0,false,0,ce5j9zx,t3_1t8uu0,t1_ce5j9zx,t3_1t8uu0,null,1428067173,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

&gt; The Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern has conceded that the Criminal Justice Act 2006 does not provide for electronic tagging [of sex offenders after release from prison] 

&gt; Section 101 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 allows a restriction on movement order to be imposed on an adult convicted of a public order offence or a non-fatal offence against the person as an alternative to a sentence. The court must have considered that imprisonment for three months or more was otherwise appropriate. Such an order provides the places where the offender may and may not be present, and shall not last for more than six months

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"&gt; Typical lorry drivers - even tho they have plenty of free space on their lanes to the right, they continue to travel too close together in the first lane through a busy junction.

How do you know there wasn't a vehicle to their right? As a lorry driver I always moved over when possible however its not always possible. No doubt you also complain about trucks cutting up cars.......

&gt; To those who believe you're supposed to stop here, I don't believe that's what the road marking indicate. The single dashed line indicates 'give way', not 'stop and give way'.

Give way to the traffic already on the motorway. A give way is a stop if there are vehicles crossing your path.

&gt; The highway code states you should always drive in the left-most lane as long as the lane ahead is clear. You should use the next lane to the right when overtaking slower vehicles (which I believe implicitly includes vehicles merging to your lane).

Wrong.

&gt; I believe that the lorries in the video are not a safe distance from the vehicle in front in this case because of the merging traffic.

The merging traffic is not yet on the main motorway.

A GCSE is a level 2 qualification, an A level is level 3, the first year of a university degree a level 4.

The base requirement will be a level 3 qualification and a pass in English and maths at level 2.

If you don't have at least a C in English and maths, you'll need an equivalent. That'll be 'key skills' or 'functional skills' level 2. You can do this with a local college, either on their own or as part of another course. 

The other course is probably going to be an 'Access' course . I saw someone posting about them in this sub-reddit, I think - have a search. They are intensive courses covering general educational skills, often with a specific focus like the humanities, IT, nursing or science. 

If you get a good number of modules at 'merit' or above in the course, you can go onto a full university course at a medium-ranking uni.

I suggest you speak to your local college about Access courses...  they might have January starts. If there's a uni or course you already know you want , speak to them about what they would want.

Good, you're calming down. Now that your incandescent rage has abated, if only temporarily, let's examine this, shall we. 

Let's forget for a moment that labelling someone a 'troll' is a handy way to dismiss them, without having to actually engage in any sort of civil dialogue (not that you would be found guilty of that crime) - let's look at the actual situation. 

You seem to have mistaken my CLEARLY 'jokey' post and seemed to infer from it that  I do not understand that an independent body decided on the pay rise.

I do indeed understand this. 

My 'joke' (for humour is subjective in nature and you might not have recognised it or appreciated it as a joke), was that the politician is 'upset' about being 'forced' to have a pay raise.

If you read the previous sentence, and my original post, carefully, you will see that at no stage did I make the statement that politicians CHOSE this. Indeed my 'joke' was a play on how 'reluctant' they have been to accept this.

When we consider the expenses scandal, where MPs were seen to be taking advantage and indeed fraudulently claiming on their expenses, it can be seen as ironic that an independent body actual agrees they deserve more money.

Perhaps your rage has not fully abated yet to blink through the tears of anger enough to get this far down. I understand. We all have emotional issues. Some of us can barely read a two sentence 'joke' before tearing their copy of the Daily Express up in apoplectic fits.

HMRC would be less influenced by ministers than other departments, since it technically doesn't have one but I take your point. HMRC will have a wealth of knowledge on what works and what doesn't but it doesn't matter when it comes to drafting legislation; laws will be brought in and it's HMRC's job to make it work, no matter how daft the law is or how many gaping holes it has, so it is difficult work for HMRC.

I'd imagine the powers that be are aware of the issues you've mentioned, I think it's more a question of time and resource, with the massive staff reductions and having to re-focus on yield generation, there just aren't the people to do stuff like that. A lot of the educational aspects of HMRC are long gone, there is very little help available if you need it, it is much more transactional now.

&gt; When I'm in Newcastle I have loads of fun I go for walks on the beach, I surf, I cycle into the hills, things are pretty clean, people are happier and talkative. I don't earn a lot of money but I do loads with it. I eat out quite a bit, I spend all night in pubs and bars which don't close till 4am and travel by taxi without even considering the cost.
&gt; When I visit friends (many of whom earn considerably more than me) in london, I have to catch night buses because taxis are unaffordable, at night I walk through streets lined with stinking rubbish and the best pubs all close at 11. Everyone seems depressed or pissed off, everything is dirty, there is no countryside there is no escape from the noise and pollution. People live in tiny boxes with no gardens, the ones without good jobs are still stuck on minimum wage in call centres and shops, its just they can't afford to actually live on minimum wage let alone have any kind of life, so they end up in huge amounts of debt.
&gt; I lived in london for 3 years, and I enjoyed it, but now there is not one single part of me that wants to return. Its a great place to visit, its a terrible place to live.

Agree with this completely. You would be mad to live in London when there are so many other great cities to live in. 

As someone who lives in Manchester, I have access to jobs, affordable housing in a nice area and loads of things to do.

Meanwhile, my friends who live in London can't go on a night out on a saturday because it's too busy, which isn't so much a problem because they pay twice in rent what I pay for a mortgage on a property twice the size of what they live in.

crazy really.

Obviously this could be a move for the future with Lampard's future in doubt but we cant forget the talent we have coming up in Chalobah.

Being an Italian-American, I followed every minute of the 94 World Cup, and cried when Baggio's kick went over the cross bar.  

After the 1998 World Cup, I realized there was an entire world of club soccer out there, but despite my obsession with Christian Vieri, there was literally no way for me to actually view him playing for Lazio or in the Serie A.

But in the past few years with the advent of online streaming video and more and more excitement over soccer, we started getting Premier League games regularly on TV.  It was now relatively easy to catch a PL game, and for the first time ever, I could actually follow a team and watch more than one game a year.

I think it's fair to say the consensus is that Jordan Henderson rightly deserved MOTM. The article had this little extra to say about that, which I think is pretty interesting (even if the last bit is... perhaps premature):

&gt; In terms of his attacking output, [Henderson] handled the mantle of “Gerrard Replacement” with aplomb. In terms of his passing, he made the most passes out of the whole team at 63 passes, with an astonishing 92% accuracy. As if that wasn’t enough, he also replaced Gerrard’s long passes in quality and quantity – Gerrard averages 7.1 long passes per game with a 74% accuracy level. Henderson played 7 long passes against Spurs, and all 7 reached their target. He also played 4 key passes in the game, which is higher than Gerrard’s average of 2.7 key passes per game. Perhaps the successor to Gerrard is someone we are already looking at on the books. ",0,1387472614,null,0,false,0,ce5ma5c,t3_1t904x,t1_ce5ma5c,t3_1t904x,null,1428065771,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Great post! I fully back you and i'm English! I'm not the classic fan from North London though either, my immediate family were never into football and so my exposure to it was from school basically but tbh I never really liked it. Most of my mates supported Liverpool but I never really felt connected with them. I remember being annoyed with the amount of football coverage there was in the sports media, I wanted to see more on tennis and F1! :P It wasn't until a couple of years later that some cousins introduced me to the mighty Tottenham Hotspur and from then on I never looked back! I now get annoyed if there isn't enough coverage of football!!! I think also my love of fifa helped my growing appreciation of football and spurs. :P

Anyway enough rambling from me. Basically I welcome any fellow spurs fan no matter where they're from or how long they've been following the sport! I guess this doesn't mean as much as i'm not from Tottenham but l think all spurs fans should welcome others as in the end surely more support is better!?

Saying that I can see where some of the hostility comes from, some fans from Tottenham will have literally been brought up on the club and so will have a very strong connection it, meaning that some new fans can seem a  bit fake if they stroll in and declare their love for spurs. I think because of this new fans just have to be careful where they step, of course you can be enthusiastic! Just try not to pretend as though you know more than you actually do...

Since the money comes from the fine paid by the LIBOR fraudsters, and since their manipulation of interest rates undoubtedly tipped some mortgage-holders over the line into payment arrears and repossession, spending the money on the homeless or housing supply doesn't seem quite *so* inappropriate to me.

Having lived here for 6 years and having many friends here I think your opinion is incredibly biased. London is just like any other big city with its fair share of poor and rich people. Because of population density and the heavy presence of corporations and banks you get to see a lot of reckless spending but don't let that fool you. There is plenty of poverty in London. Everyone is struggling. On top of that whatever 'benefits' the government offers, doesn't benefit London at all. Allow me to give a few examples:

- Minimum wage. That's bullshit compared to London standards but London doesn't get any special privilege. 

- Rents and house prices. Extortionate, but we do not get any grants from the government. 

- When the government setup the 0% stamp duty incentive for houses under 250K, it didn't really apply to London because there are hardly any houses in that sort of price range. 

- The help to buy scheme salary ranges and house prices means that most people working in London cannot use it. 

I work in a corporation and I see lots of reckless spending but you forget that there is corporate backing in these situations. Very few individuals make that sort of money to have the glamorous life style that you mention. Don't let the pretty dames in Mayfair fool you because they're probably spending a good chunk of their monthly salary for an evening of fun. 

Edit: A major thing that I forgot to point out. Child care costs! Fuck I get about 50 quid from the government in childcare costs. I wish I could call it a slap on the face; its a fucking punch in the face. For reference, that's less than a day's cost of my daughter's nursery. There are several places here that charge twice that for a day.

Considering most mortgages will only give you 3 times your salary I'd be buying a bellow average house and could very well be stuck in it paying it off until i'm 50 if house prices were to fall again. Where a PC in 1997 could afford an above average house.

So i'm holding on, fingers crossed that hopefully in the next 5-10 years house prices will drop enough for me to purchase a property I'd be happy to live in.

Didn't AVB say what he really wanted more than anything was a DoF so that his setup could follow the European standard where DoF makes the decisions on what players are brought in with input from the coach?  Well, we got him Baldini, the DoF that he wanted.

Presumably he would give his input to Baldini who then examines the list and what may be available/affordable/attainable.  

But ultimately in this model the DoF makes the decision on who comes in and AVB (who's title was ""Head Coach"" not ""Manager"" if i am not mistaken) gets the team with the players provided to play.

So effectively the system for running the team that AVB wanted worked the way that it was supposed to and now the story is that the system that AVB wanted the team to run in didn't get the exact players he wanted.  Well, unfortunately that happens in a system like this.

As for the players he wanted, Mouts was a fuckup, no one can deny that, he has reason to be upset with that not happening b/c we were haggling over £500k in the 11th hour of the window close.

But Villa we brought in to the training center, we had him meet with AVB and we made an offer to Barca.  **David Villa CHOSE** to go to Athletico (incidentally for less money than we supposedly offered), that one isn't on the team.

With Willian (another one of his targets and a supposed friend of AVB) we literally did everything we could, we made the offer, we had the contract ready to go, Willian was in for a physical at our fucking training center.  **Willian then CHOSE** to go to Chelsea, again that isn't on Spurs.

Hulk would cost what £35m plus say £150k/wk in wages?....that is a shit load of cash for a player who hadn't lit the world on fire in Russia, i fully understand why Spurs would look to another target.

Part of this blame should also be put on AVB as his list of targets seemed to consist of players who were wildly expensive and difficult to land.  Maybe he should have provided a list with more alternatives that fell better in line of the reality of where Spurs tend to spend cash.

The team certainly deserves some blame on some of these things, but AVB has some blame as well if we didn't get the exact players he wanted since the front office system and the DoF he wanted ultimately made the choices.  If you want full control over your team and who is on it you need to have a different role with the club than he was signed into.",0,1387475410,null,0,false,0,ce5nijr,t3_1t941f,t1_ce5nijr,t3_1t941f,null,1428065196,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

They have a fair amount of room for 2+luggage and are, if you get the right engine, nice to drive. Also very cheap and simple to repair when they break! Anything you find for £3k will be well-used, and will most likely need tlc before a continental trip.

The VW's and Japanese vans are quite rare, and tend to be quite expensive. Also can be expensive to repair/hard to get parts for.

What may suit you better could be rental, there are some companies out there that will rent out slightly older campers at a quite reasonable price, hiring a brand new one can be expensive, if you are going home straight afterwards, it would save you the hassle of selling it on when you are ready to go (Camper sales are very dependent on the season, the first nice spring weekend is a busy time, but Autumn will be dead...)

I've loved football for years, but never really picked a team to get behind until 2012. I looked at all the teams in the Premier League, figured the best chance I had of ever visiting my newly-supported club at their home ground would be if they were in London, needed a club that wasn't really in danger of relegation (can't watch Championship matches in the States), and had an aversion to Chelsea and Arsenal out of a belief that they were NY Yankees-like money teams (something that doesn't *really* apply to the scum the way it does to Chelski)...

This left me, basically, with Spurs, Hammers, and Fulham. I watched some matches from each, and fell in love with Gareth Bale and Hugo Lloris. Sure, now Bale's gone, but I'm invested. And I think Lewis Holtby and Christian Eriksen are the bee's knees now. Next season it might be someone else if they leave.

At any rate, I wake up early in the morning, sometimes at 4:30 am, to watch my club. I feel as dedicated to them as I am to my favorite team in my favorite sport, the Oakland A's. But I'm new, and I don't know all the history, and I ""picked"" the club, they weren't foisted upon me by geography or genetics (the A's, otoh, were).

Not sure if that kind of voluntary adoption makes me more or less of a supporter, or if it doesn't matter. Whatever. COYS.",0,1387477263,null,0,false,0,ce5ocbp,t3_1t7vc2,t1_ce5ocbp,t3_1t7vc2,null,1428064810,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

I think Islam is probably a smaller problem than media coverage would lead you to believe, but Muslims in this country grow up exposed to social mores that most of us don't, and it would be surprising if these didn't lead to differences in behaviour. For instance the number of indigenous English who travel abroad to train and fight for Al Qaeda is negligible, whilst within the British Muslim community it is *comparatively* common.
