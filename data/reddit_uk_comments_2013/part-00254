Scotland's being made to accept economic policies that where designed for the City, pay for projects that either do no benefit it or actually *damage* Scotland and being given a slice of national debt that is largely being rung up by England.

I was referring specifically to England and Scotland, but if you want to go down that route, yes, we mainly came together because England conquered us.

This imperialistic tendency also came into play in terms of Act of Union in 1707, aw well. Whilst the Darien Scheme was a major factor, so too was the fact that the English government either threatened or bribed many members of the Scottish parliament. Furthermore, it must be remembered that the Scottish parliament at this time was by no means democratic; many English spies reported violent riots in opposition to the Union at the time. In short, it is a myth that England allowed Scotland to join it in order to help Scotland. England forced the Union upon the Scottish people, with the help of the Scottish parliament, because it saw the opportunity for expansion and to perminantly remove a rival in terms of colonisation and trade. 

As a result of this, any benefit the Union gave to Scotland back then (and there where *many*) was not done for it's own merits; it was a happy side effect of action that was taken to help the political and social elite of England, who where centred mainly around London.

But then this has very little relevance to the politics of today, you cannot blame the English today for the actions of a select few 300 years ago. The point is the Union is only as useful to Scotland as the benefits it provides, and how far Scotland can control these benefits.

FOR THE ATTENTION OF:

Catherine McKinnell MP
Newcastle upon Tyne North

Tuesday 26 November 2013 #### #####
## ######## #####
######### #### ####

############@gmail.com
Dear Catherine McKinnell,

I am becoming increasingly concerned with recent developments which may end up damaging the free and open society which the Internet and its services has the potential to help lead our country towards.

Being a worker on the Internet and increasingly relying on and celebrating the Internet's timely, open and unbiased coverage of the global community, I have found my concern and empathy broadened beyond our country. I am finding myself eager to learn about our similarities to our neighbours and how to broach the differences, something which was previously impossible on such a scale.

The Prime Minister's attack on an open Internet has been documented and lamented online on forums, on Twitter, on Facebook and elsewhere around the world.

The so called Active Choice system allows for the closure or blocking of websites containing, among other things, ""esoteric material"", a vague and legally ambiguous phrase which it is my concern could be argued to mean whatever a suitably motivated prosecutor might want it to mean.

At this time, the PM's plan is seen as a choice but the framing of the issue is what worries me mostly.

The Internet is already a choice.

What the PM is proposing is a limitation.

I understand that children growing up into this complex world will quickly and instinctively understand how to take advantage of what can reasonably be argued as one of humanity's greatest achievements.

I also understand that the Internet does reflect many of the more extreme aspects of the human condition and that parents are free to prevent their children from premature exposure to such material. Of course, parents need to be informed in order to exercise this responsibility.

Our nation has an important part to play on the global stage. In order to play its strongest hand, its people need access to information representing every aspect of human culture. Sometimes this information may be distasteful, or offensive, or threatening.

To some.

I am deeply worried that the some, in their struggle to appease the voting public, will look to sensationalist or alarmist strategies to gain favour, or align their views with those who are prepared to ignore the longer term benefits of expansive and progressive integration in exchange for short term rhetoric and populist policy.

In Engagements on 23rd October this year, Column 300, David Cameron explained, David Cameron explained,


""We have had repeated meetings of the extremism task force—it met again yesterday—setting out a whole series of steps that we will take to counter the extremist narrative, including by blocking online sites.""

[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0001.htm#13102356000002]


Of course, I understand the need to protect our country, but as long as information, any information, is being withheld from the voting public, their vote is potentially being undermined by the very parties they may be voting for. The PM's use of ""extremist narrative"" could be, either by design or even unwittingly, expanded in the future. I'm sure that nobody wants to inadvertently label a person curious to learn of, for example world affairs, an extremist.

I argue that such measures as the wholesale blocking of globally accessible information — even that which may be distasteful or offensive to some — will undermine the ability of the voting public to ascertain for themselves the direction their country should be taking by concealing what may be information valuable to a debate they might otherwise not even be aware of.

It is a little distressing to know that certain parties and politicians are harbouring such shortsighted tendencies when the clear course is the open and frank conversation which can only be had with a public as fully informed as it currently is at the time of writing.

It is my wish that the Internet be allowed to both reflect and inform humanity's progress, that access to it remain open and free from restriction, that the responsibility of its use be entrusted to the British public and that short term political gains are reined in to allow the UK to flourish as an informed global voice.

As my representative in Parliament, thank you for your continuing work and I look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,

It also appears that the officer who Mitchell swore at has said that he is prepared to give evidence under oath.

&gt;“I stand by my account of events in Downing Street on 19th September 2012. This has now been thoroughly investigated and the CPS has confirmed there is insufficient evidence to take any criminal proceedings against me. “In addition, neither am I subject to any disciplinary proceedings.  I confirm that I am prepared to give evidence under oath if required.”

Also they're snidely called ""guardianistas"" in the same sneering way Glen Beck or Hannity would refer to ""liberals"" with the same imagery that pops into your head.

The Independent has less baggage than the others, slightly left leaning but not in your face with it like the Guardian.  It also does some good original investigative pieces.

true,HankyDanglers,tennant,Tennant,"THIS ANSWER IS VERY LONG. I'm not sure exactly what instance you're asking about, so I'll exhaust the solutions and you can let me know and I can give a TL;DR answer at the bottom/new comment.

There are five distinct instances of the Time War Time Lock being bypassed. The first is when Dalek Caan temporal shifts out, but loses his sanity. The second is in the End of Time, when the Gallifrey Chancellor throws the diamond (five point star or whatever) at the earth and the master finds it. Then, when Gallifrey comes through utilizing the connection they established with the diamond. In TDotD the War Doctor leaves his timeline to view his future (the whole premise of the episode), then finally when Ten and Eleven return to the War Doctor as he is making the decision to destroy Gallifrey. They make the comment that something must have let them through, which is the only way they could have gotten there. The Moment (Rose Tyler) makes a remark, telling you that she/it let them in (it being quite obvious, considering she's the one that let the War Doctor out). Now this leaves two instances unmentioned/noticed. How did the doctor get out of the time lock in the first place (round one), then how did the three of them get out after they saved Gallifrey (round two)? This is mostly up to what you want to believe, especially if you consider how time travel works in the show. 
[TANGENT&lt;START&gt; Russel T Davies and Steven Moffat have very different ideas (not to mention every other executive writer who has ever hosted the show) and that means that the continuity of Doctor who has always been full of plot holes, especially between the reboot and original series. Moffat does his best to rectify the inconsistencies while still providing an amazing show, so we need to take the whole situation with a grain of salt.&lt;END&gt;]
Do you believe that Gallifrey REALLY blew up the first time, then the second time was saved? Or do you believe that the whole time it was saved, and the Doctor just didn't know it until he was able to retain the memory of saving it during his eleventh incarnation (twelfth technically, but whatever). If you believe that it blew up, then the Moment (who said that the Doctor's punishment was to survive) must have let him go. If you believe it blew up, and that is what caused the Time Lock, then is the whole event still Time Locked once Gallifrey was never actually destroyed? Probably. 
[TANGENT &lt;START&gt; Time locks are just events in time that can no longer be accessed by time travel. They aren't universally caused by the same thing, and they are different than Fixed Points which are just points that cannot be changed. Time Locks can be caused by destruction of time (my assumption for the Time War), by incredible amount of Time Travel in a given area that screws with history (Angels Take Manhattan), and by a few other intentional methods. &lt;END&gt;]
If you think that Gallifrey never blew up at all, and that the second time around just proved that it LOOKED like it blew up but didn't (the doctors couldn't retain the memory), then why is it time locked since the moment was never activated? My guess is that it has to do with the fact that the solution to save Gallifrey was, as they repeatedly mention, *to freeze it in time in a pocket universe.* Time travel has a hard time entering into alternate dimensions, let alone into frozen pockets of time. So in this scenario, all 13 doctors save Gallifrey (ONLY THE PLANET), the Daleks shoot each other to death (unlikely, but it's the answer they gave in the episode) and The planet is now time locked and cannot be accessed (unless it is found, which is the new direction of the show). Therefore, the doctors, being outside the time-freeze, would have no problem just whizzing away to their appropriate time streams.",0,1385497405,null,0,false,0,cdnmsxd,t3_1ri3t8,t1_cdnmsxd,t1_cdnjyit,null,1428497435,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The Olympics took names and the like and still some people bought fakes, but presumably a much lower number than otherwise would have.

true,mo_rar,null,null,"[I might be saying bullshit, but anyways here goes] Oscar was very weak last season playing on the right. His main strength is playing in the centre in the 4-2-3-1 that we opt most of the times. Mata also is strong in the centre and for the wings we have better players in Hazard, Schurlle, Willlian and company. Both Mata and Oscar are amazing in that central role. But I would say Mata is a little better on the attack and in distribution but Oscar is immensely better tracking back and contributing in the defense or pressing hard up front. Since in a 4-2-3-1 they are both fighting for the same spot and Mourinho wants his players to be defensively strong, he chooses Oscar over Mata for AM and considers Mata as a rotation on Wings since Willian/Schurrle are better on the wings. 

In an Asymmetric 4-3-3, there is a forward aka Torres/Eto'o.. There is a winger aka Willian [first choice].. there is an AM aka Oscar [first choice].. there is a Mid playing centerish who will go forward aka Lampard.. A mid who is playing leftish.. who will go forward from the left wing.. aka Hazard.. and a DM who will win the ball and distribute.. aka Mikel.

So it leaves Mata mostly second choice for each formation that Mourinho wants to play. A remedy for this would be if Mata works on tracking back and pressing effectively and tries to take Oscar's place.. or tries to improve as a winger.. both of which don't look like happening immediately..

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Firstly Scotland has to enter a formal negotiation track to enter the EU - which could take years and need a full renegotiation of terms, considering there are other countries in line first it might take years. 

Most of the delay in EU accession is harmonising national legislation with EU law - Scotland has already undergone that process as part of the UK. I don't think anyone is expecting that membership will simply arrive in the post, but conversely the question is going to be ""how do we make an existing part of the EU a member state"" not ""how do we get this country up to speed with legislation/corruption/religious persecution/etc"".

There is absolutely no precedent in EU law for a member state dissolving into its constituent countries, but then again there was absolutely no precedent for German reunification either (at the time it was described as ""[EU enlargement without accession](http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/eu-negotiator-main-difficulty-ge-interview-498395)"").

&gt; Secondly, countries like Spain might not accept Scotland because it would give their own restive regions, like Catalunia, the possibility of breaking from Spain and going it alone in the EU

Spain's Foreign Minister has stated that if the process is ""[in accord with \[the UK\] constitutional arrangement, written or unwritten, Spain would have nothing to say](http://www.paisleydailyexpress.co.uk/renfrewshire-news/scottish-news/2012/02/26/spain-s-uk-comments-hailed-by-snp-87085-30410099/)"".

Spanish objections to Catalonian independence are based on the Spanish constitution referring to the ""indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation"" (the Spanish government believe that Catalonian secession is unconstitutional, and hence illegal).

Bear in mind that Scotland would still be within the EU the day after the referendum. Negotiating exactly what EU membership would look like would take place while still part of the EU, not from outside.",0,1385498646,null,0,false,0,cdnne32,t3_1rhkd7,t1_cdnne32,t1_cdnl03y,null,1428497161,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,thegenregeek,null,null,"Well to be fair the Doctor thinking he's dying, then suddenly not being dead, would be addressing it in a storyline. 

My point wasn't to say that they would pretend it would never happen. Merely that they can use a past event to explain what happened, while telling a story and using a bit of mystery.

In terms of Moffat's point on the matter, his [latest comments](http://www.blastr.com/2013-11-25/confused-moffat-addresses-all-those-who-regeneration-limit-questions) on the regeneration issue is:

&gt; ""Paul McGann turns into John Hurt so they're not the same incarnation. He used up another regeneration and I expect he'll be in trouble shortly - **you can't break rules laid down in 'The Deadly Assassin’**.”

Well, [The Deadly Assassin](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Deadly_Assassin_%28TV_story%29) did establish that the regeneration limit could be restarted, via the [Eye of Harmony](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Eye_of_Harmony). Which, if you want to get technical the 8th Doctor clearly had access to. (If we *really* want to go with the idea of the 1996 movie being full cannon. That would mean all Doctors, and presumably all Time Lords, have access to it.)

If they wanted to they could explain that the Bad Wolf was created as by product of something to do with the Eye of Harmony. Maybe because the [Heart of the TARDIS](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_TARDIS) is now linked to the Eye Of Harmony. That it has the power to restart cycles, etc, etc. Which is why the 9th Doctor tells Rose, after she looks at it and absorbs it energy, that ""no one is meant to do that"". (Doing that wouldn't *technically* break whatever rules were established, just clarify them at a rather convenient moment)

Ultimately you have to remember one fact: [Moffat lies](http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a500248/doctor-who-steven-moffat-ive-lied-my-arse-off-about-50th.html).

We're getting to a reductionist debate over terrorism, when we both agree there is no single cause for it. As such to go over each individual cause we may find is not constructive. It seems like we are disagreeing over the causes of violence in general in this case. I agree that there is no evidence that limiting the flow of weapons to an are would reduce overall violence in that area. However I haven't heard an argument of why limiting the flow of weapons into an area would stop the violence in that area from increasing. I do agree that weapons are not the sole cause of violence, and without them violence would still exist, however with them violent acts are much more damaging. 

I understand that most terrorists are acting for change, as such I believe one way to reduce the risk of terrorism would be to ensure dialogue on these topics remains open at a national level, so that it can be rationally debated, rather than being shut down or censored, bringing me back to my original point.

true,RMcD94,eu,"North Ayrshire, Scotland, United Kingdom, European Union, Earth","&gt;Scotland's being made to accept economic policies that where designed for the City, pay for projects that either do no benefit it or actually damage Scotland and being given a slice of national debt that is largely being rung up by England.

""Cornwall's being made to accept economic policies that were ....largely being rung up by London""

Policies are not going to magically apply to all of Scotland like they apply to all of the UK.

If Scotland goes independent you could say

""Aberdeen is being made to accept economic polices that were designed for Glasgow, pay for projects that either do no benefit or actually damage Aberdeen and being given a slice of national debt that is largely being rung up by Edinburgh (rest of Scotland w/e).""

&gt;I was referring specifically to England and Scotland, but if you want to go down that route, yes, we mainly came together because England conquered us.

Since you specifically said the UK numerous times I'm not sure how I would be able to know that. And England conquered us? What?

&gt;Whilst the Darien Scheme was a major factor, so too was the fact that the English government either threatened or bribed many members of the Scottish parliament.

Already said that buddy.

&gt; and then they were all bribed to join the union.

I don't really know who you're talking to about this:

&gt;In short, it is a myth that England allowed Scotland to join it in order to help Scotland

I was pretty clear that it was very much of a predator pouncing on a weak victim.

&gt;The point is the Union is only as useful to Scotland as the benefits it provides, and how far Scotland can control these benefits.

This is an absurdly selfish point of view. 

Why the fuck should the UK government have donated £55 million to Philippines right? That's money out of our pockets! Just think of the ~£600 or whatever it is that leaves Scotland and instead goes to helping the poor British folk who don't make enough money but are outside of Scotland.

You know the same way Aberdeen would (does) give an incredible amount in tax compared to what it receives. Unless you're going to start saying The point is that Scotland is only useful to Aberdeen as the benefits it provides, and how far Aberdeen can control these benefits.

Unless you want to start kicking poor parts of the country out of the country.

It's just an incredible kind of logic used by any sort of nationalist. ",0,1385499248,null,0,false,0,cdnnoh5,t3_1rhkd7,t1_cdnnoh5,t1_cdnmeey,null,1428497026,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,[deleted],null,null,"Italy. I'm going to reply to your questions in advance since they're usually the same ones that get asked :D

* Why is the UK an improvement?

Reason number one: the job market. Not only is it extremely easy to find a job compared to Italy, you also get paid much, much better, and you can actually hope to increase your salary over the years, which is *impossible* in Italy. I work in software development by the way. Also generally the working conditions are better, people are more professional and prepared, and bosses seem to be more open minded.

Other than jobs, I like the people here. I like that when you go to the barber shop, you get your haircut in silence with no pressure to talk to the barber, or how on the bus barely anyone talks, and how generally people are more polite and respectful of rules (I can't point to any specific example, it's a general feeling that I get when I'm around people here). It also seems easier to make friends around here.

* Do you miss Italian food?

Yes, but there are so many options here in London, you can literally pick between dozens of different cuisines if you're willing to walk 5 minutes (at least where I work in Shoreditch High Street). Also I'm sure that when I am going to feel the need of authentic Italian food I will be able to find the right places, even if they're obviously going to be much more expensive than their equivalent in Italy.

* The wheather sucks here in the UK

Sweating in your shirt and underpants sucks much more. I actually like the cold, and honestly it doesn't seem to rain *that* much in London.

Scotland leaving means that we'll need to for out on a lot of money for a new base for Trident (if they leave they don't want WMDs on their soil) and also means finding places for training. It seems to me that both the UK and Scotland should work together instead of splitting apart, both sides need eachother.

A simpler solution would be for the UK to just scrap Trident altogether, no? :)

If we get a Yes vote in the referendum, there will be ongoing negotiations between Scotland and rUK until the actual separation takes place (18 months after the vote). The SNP (and a lot of the Scottish population) don't want Trident to be kept in Scotland, and it's not a good idea for the UK to have its nuclear deterrent stationed in a foreign country. It could happen that rUK leases the Faslane base from Scotland until they can outfit a suitable base in England, Wales or NI.

&gt;Also, Scotland might have trouble surviving economically...

We also might not.

&gt;...or even worse might join the EU and become a backup-Ireland for them.

I don't see how joining the EU is 'even worse' than financial failure. In fact, I don't think there's a mainstream party in the Scottish parliament who would advocate *not* joining the EU post-independence.

&gt; Tuesday 26 November 2013
&gt; 
&gt; Dear Paul Blomfield,
&gt; 
&gt; I am concerned by the creeping scope of this Government's proposals to
&gt; censor the Internet. While I believe they will be ineffective for those
&gt; with any amount of technical knowledge, it's somewhat chilling to see
&gt; that already we've crept from ""ban the worst of pornography"" to ""stop
&gt; extremist language"" -- and as the scope of the precedent for this
&gt; blocking grows, I am left to wonder what else might be blocked in the
&gt; future. Could the next Wikileaks be mitigated by virtue of UK ISPs
&gt; being required to filter its content?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to cite the obvious Martin Niemöller poem, because to do
&gt; so would be to compare Cameron's Conservatives to Hitler's Nazis, which
&gt; only serves to trivialise the latter -- but I am deeply concerned that
&gt; this Government is:
&gt; 
&gt;  a) going to dishonestly win some votes on the right by appearing to be
&gt; tough on smut and on ""extremism""  
&gt;  b) going to create extra work, costs and thus expense for ISPs -- and
&gt; so their users  
&gt; and c) going to inconvenience us all by (effectively or not) flailing
&gt; wildly in an attempt to censor the Internet.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be interested to know your stance on the issues surrounding this,
&gt; and what if anything you feel you can do to combat it.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt;

Scotland generates about as much money as it spends. It spends slightly more due to running a deficit, as does the UK as a whole, however Scotland's deficit is a smaller percentage of its GDP than the UK.

TBH, the argument that Scotland couldn't be economically viable is probably one of the weaker ones.

Mainly; as in most of of the countries that make up the UK joined because England conquered them, or because they are England.

Even then, it can be argued England annexed Scotland– a political conquest, rather than a military conquest.

&gt;  the only reason Scotland joined the union under one government was because some fucking retards decided to get into incredibly national debt so they could have a colony in Panama which failed
&gt; I was pretty clear that it was very much of a predator pouncing on a weak victim.

Even if you did pay lip service thpo the widespread fraud involved in the Act of Union, you still give centre stage to the myth that the offer of Union was extended to Scotland, and readily taken, so that England could bail out the incompetent Scotland, out of the kindness of it's heart. A myth many Englishmen believe wholeheartedly. Even then, the ptoblwem was not the Darien Scheme in and of itself, it was also the trade blockaid set up by Spain, France and, yes, England in order to choak out the competition for America.

You say that the idea the Union is only as useful as the benefits it provides is incredibly selfish. However; would it be fair for England to sacrifice it's own interests for the benefit of Scotland? When Scotland is far, far richer than England anyway? Of course not! So why is it suddenly ""selfish"" when seen from the other viewpoint? 

You draw a comparison to the Phillipines. Last time I checked the City was not a third world country experiencing a massive natural and humanitarian disaster. And it is going to the City. It's going to a Westminster government who is bent on punishing those same poor Scots who you mentioned, as well as any poor English, Welsh or Irish. Meanwhile, companies and banks (many of whom donate heavily to the Westminster parties) are allowed to pay a pittance on profits of billions! It is not that my money is spent on someone other than me. It's that my money is being spent on things to benefit people far richer than I am, such as HS2, or that benefit no one at all, as is the case with internet block or the ridiculous overspending on our Navy.

What? Scotland voted labour and labour was in power for ages.

&gt;Scotland hasn't decided the makeup of a UK election since 1974, when without us it would have been a hung parliament rather than a slim Labour majority.

So what? Georgia has never decided the president, should they go independent? What an odd choice. Has Wales ever swung a UK election? Has Lanarkshire?

&gt; Just as it should be under a FPTP constituency system, where we are but 5 million of 63

And so is Birmingham, or London is a mere 8 million of 63.

&gt;The UK's system of devolved nations with MMP, and a monolithic FPTP England, is simply unfair to everyone.

AV was an option. If you seriously think England is one colour you are crazy wrong. It is not surprising when you divide segments of the UK into areas where one has 50 million and the others are 5 million that the one with 50 million chooses the vote. Just like if I drew a map of the UK and included everywhere but Cornwall in one group and the rest of the UK in the other and was like omg why not cornwall be deciding?!?!

&gt;City states aren't efficient unless they have something else going for them.

Don't have to be a city state, can be a random division of the country by however you feel. And who cares about efficiency? It's only about the benefit of the country is all that matters.

   What I would like to see more of is the Tardis insides. Most of the Tardis, based on what we've seen, seems rather bland and generic. The Paul McGann movie had some of the most flavorful sets we've had in the Tardis, but the episodes have mostly had generic hallways with generic rooms, with the rare few rooms that stick out as memorable.
   
   The Doctor himself tends to be an eccentric character, shouldn't the Tardis reflect that? Maybe there's an Edwardian Ballroom tucked away somewhere on the Tardis. Maybe a parisian painting studio. Maybe a room of shifting crystals that form into the shapes of one's thoughts (better be careful what you think in there.). I'd just like to see more eccentricity in what lurks in the Tardis, rather than a hologram room to recreate places they can just go anyway.

Even then, it can be argued England annexed Scotland– a political conquest, rather than a military conquest.

Yeah cause when I annex countries I allow them to keep their legal system and large amounts of independence.

&gt;
Even if you did pay lip service thpo the widespread fraud involved in the Act of Union, you still give centre stage to the myth that the offer of Union was extended to Scotland, and readily taken, so that England could bail out the incompetent Scotland, out of the kindness of it's heart. 

I literally said *BRIBED*, how the flying fuck is that readily taken?

I mentioned the total economic failure of Scotland which drove it to even being a possibility.

&gt; Even then, the ptoblwem was not the Darien Scheme in and of itself, it was also the trade blockaid set up by Spain, France and, yes, England in order to choak out the competition for America.

That's a problem with the Darien scheme. You don't start colonizing if you're going to get blockaded. Tiny countries don't get to stand up to big countries.

Not to mention I can find no evidence of any sort of blockade so I'd like some sources. I know that PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS IN other countries didn't want to back it but that was before it started. 

I cannot comprehend you defending the statement that Scotland founding a colony in Spanish claimed lands without any sort of serious reasonable planning, after having been really badly shot down by numerous people and having no meaningful support or plan was a good time.

&gt; However; would it be fair for England to sacrifice it's own interests for the benefit of Scotland? When Scotland is far, far richer than England anyway? Of course not! So why is it suddenly ""selfish"" when seen from the other viewpoint?

What? Scotland is not richer than England, don't know where you got that idea from. Per capita it is, but not in terms of total wealth. Or more importantly defence.

For example had Scotland wanted a darien scheme as part of the UK it would probably have succeeded (and many Scottish colonies did). Not to mention Scotland wasn't richer until the oil so that's a pretty recent thing.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Most of the delay in EU accession is harmonising national legislation with EU law - Scotland has already undergone that process as part of the UK. I

True, but the process has always been political more than it has been structural. The decision to allow accession and the political will to do this is what will be important. My argument is based on the political machinations involved. 

While you are correct with the lack of precedence, the issue is one that has been bubbling for a while and the institutional responses are already in place. The German issue was the closest thing but it was almost accession by proxy so doesn't really fit. 

Spanish objections maybe be de jure based in ""indissolluble unity"" of the constitution but de facto the concerns are that the precence set by a Scottish accession will allow a Catalan state to be able to find an alternative functioning pathway to EU membership thus removing one of the major economic and political incentives for being part of the EU ie it comes via the treaty status of Spain. 

&gt;Bear in mind that Scotland would still be within the EU the day after the referendum. Negotiating exactly what EU membership would look like would take place while still part of the EU, not from outside.

Maybe, but again, it might just not be convenient for there to be formal negotiations until the process is in place because of the treaty status of the UK and the obligation therein.

It took 10 minutes for the first comment saying Lampard shouldn't be playing to be made in the match thread - and that was that. It didn't matter that Lampard played a lot better in the rest of the match than he did in the first 10 or 20 minutes, or that Ramires was worse than him, or that Mikel kept giving the ball away, or that the forwards (apart from Willian) were downright invisible. It won't even matter that the goal was down to Ivanovic (and I say this as someone who loves to defend him). No, because Lampard had already been singled out for the blame. Seeing that comment in the match thread is just indicative of /r/chelseafc at the moment - jumping to conclusions, quick to assign blame, desperate to scapegoat someone. That everyone is so *eager* to scapegoat Lampard I find disappointing, especially when it's nearly every game. Even after a great performance against West Ham, a large proportion of the subscribers here were so *reluctant* to give Lampard his due praise. Who even are you people? I just find it utterly, utterly bizarre. 

Yeah, Lampard didn't play well tonight. But most of the team didn't play well, and there were players who were noticeably worse than him. Yet this thread will all be focused on Lampard. Calls for him to be dropped, calls for Mikel/Ramires - conveniently ignoring the fact they both played and were dire. I just don't get this place.

A fixed point in time is observed, the larger scale the event the more likely it is to be a fixed point in time.  For that fixed point to be respected, the event has to be observed identically - that doesn't mean it can't be caused differently.

When the Doctor was shot originally, it created a fixed point and was widely observed and recognized.  Therefore, when River broke that event by not shooting him, stuff went bad.  In the end, with the final solution, they gave the appearance that the Doctor had died at River's hand, even to River's own perception, so the fixed point was met.  His death was a fixed point in time, there was nothing about it that said he had to stay dead after it occurred.

He basically just used a loophole.

It's similar to Rory in ATM.  He observed his death and it became a fixed point in time, but then paradoxed it and thought he made it go away.  The angels got him anyways, sent him back, and he still met that fixed point in time by dying when he was originally supposed to.

Admittedly our social presence is subpar and it's something we're working on *(our Facebook and Twitter accounts are relatively new)*. Our vendors are the retail businesses themselves *(Tesco, Amazon, Dominos Pizza, etc)*, we have just added a web front that updates stocks and prices on the regular to make it more convenient and in one locale *(think of it as all4btc but the selected products and services are already there for you to select)*. Items such as Physical Bitcoins are fulfilled by ourselves. Our prices are displayed on every product, and there are no additional fees. 

The website originally started as an experiment to demonstrate how one could order groceries with Bitcoin, and has *slightly* taken off since then. I agree that providing more information on how we operate is something we need to address on the site, be sure to see that soon. We're always open to suggestions; you can contact us on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/user/cryptodechange/), email @ contact at cryptodechange.com or through our live chat form on our website.

&gt;What? Scotland is not richer than England, don't know where you got that idea from.

It's called a hypothetical comparison, dear. I'm saying that if it's selfish for Scotland to view the Union as only being useful as what benefits it gives, then surely it must be even more selfish for England to do the same thing, given it already has far more than Scotland.

&gt;For example had Scotland wanted a darien scheme as part of the UK it would probably have succeeded

But, unless the lion's share of the benefits went to London it would never, never happen.

&gt;http://www.cityam.com/article/53000000000-how-much-city-paid-tax-last-year

Are you seriously suggesting that a newpaper printed by and for City business people is going to be an objective source of information? If this is the tax that *is* being paid, how much is being avoided? How much of this money is staying in London, to pay for things to benefit Londoners?

&gt;If London disappeared from the UK the UK WOULD BE FUCKED. The UK relies on London so much for financial support it's unbelievable.

Without London the UK is pretty average in terms of financial differences in geographical terms. *With* London, the UK is one of the most economically divided countries in the Western world. Furthermore, this isn't about the UK, this is about Scotland. Could an independent Scotland survive without London's influence? Many, many people think so.

&gt;"" The constituencies where workers contributed the least amount of income tax per head were those in Wales, the Midlands and Northern England""
&gt;That's where the loss goes.
  
Yes. Because there's no investment, because all of the money is spent in London. The government spends £70 per person on culture in London. In the rest of England, the figure is £5 per person.

&gt;Exactly, true of any democracy, so Aberdeenshire should break off.

The problem with this is that it does not take into account that Aberdeenshire is far, far closer to Edinburgh, in geographical, demographic and political terms than Scotland is to London; which would all limit the discord that could arise between the two. 

Furthermore, it assumes an Independent Scotland would automatically adopt the same, broken system of government as rUK, where *all* representation is proportional to population. It does not allow for the possibility of a Scottish Senate, where each area of Scotland is given an equal number of representatives regardless of population, which can be given in a separate, proportional House.",0,1385503899,null,0,false,0,cdnpv12,t3_1rhkd7,t1_cdnpv12,t1_cdnouh4,null,1428495937,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Spanish objections maybe be de jure based in ""indissolluble unity"" of the constitution but de facto the concerns are that the precence set by a Scottish accession will allow a Catalan state to be able to find an alternative functioning pathway to EU membership thus removing one of the major economic and political incentives for being part of the EU ie it comes via the treaty status of Spain.

Maybe, but then again they did have a civil war 74 years ago. Their constitution was set up in the aftermath of that, still within living memory.

Catalonia is probably the only other realistic example within Europe, however I do think the parallels with Scotland are overblown.

Even if Scotland was explicitly waved through by the EU, Spain would not see that as a valid precedent. They would say that the UK was a nation of countries rather than a nation-state, they would say that the separation was not unilateral, etc.

To my mind, the Spanish perception of Catalonian independence would be similar to the UK if somewhere like Yorkshire announced their desire to leave. That Scotland has had separate legal, education, or health systems (even before devolution) goes a long way to making the idea of dissolving the Scotland/England union more practical than some of the pre-England kingdoms.

&gt; I hope they get it done if they go independent, personally, i just think Salmond is being more than a bit cheeky by not exploring this properly in public and his attitude contains more that a but fairy dust.

The EC have offered to provide some advice in advance of the referendum, however unfortunately the UK government have [refused that offer](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html).

In the **original version of history**, there is no Bad Wolf and the Doctor uses the Moment to end the Time War (imprisoning both the Daleks and the Time Lords).

In the **new version of history** (which we see in the special), Bad Wolf is there, the Doctor chooses not to use the Moment, and Gallifrey is preserved in a pocket universe.

(I'm choosing to believe that the Daleks were still time-locked in the new version of history. Although if we were to take the episode literally we would have to believe that every Dalek in the history of the universe was bombarding Gallifrey in the final moments of the Time War, somehow they all managed to shoot each other in a bout of ultimate stupidity, and most of the Dalek appearances from RTD's have been retconned out of existence.)",0,1385504215,null,0,1385504501,0,cdnq02m,t3_1rh58v,t1_cdnq02m,t1_cdnm8i5,null,1428495872,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,jayman419,amy,Amy,"You can start with *Rose*. It's the first episode of the reboot, and it's not bad at all. I really liked Eccleston's take on it. He had a certain dark glee that the other recent Doctor's have rarely brought to the role. 

But I didn't care for Tennant, even though some of the best episodes ever occurred during his run. *Blink* is probably the one stand-alone episode that I'd recommend to anyone, whether they were looking to get into the show or just looking for a good watch one evening. Same thing with *The Waters of Mars*.

But you can skip all the way to *The 11th Hour*, the reboot of the reboot with Matt Smith and have a great time. Smith wasn't bad (he's probably my least favorite of the new Doctors), but Amy Pond was just amazing. (It helps that she's a ridiculously hot Scottish redhead.) 

A lot of die-hard fans hate Amy, and I see their point... she's the only Companion to do a voice-over introduction to the show, and they really shifted the focus onto her quite a bit. 

But I think it worked.

So either start with *Rose* and watch all of the new ones. Or start with *11th Hour* and go back later and check out *Blink* and *The Empty Child* and such at your leisure.

As for the classics... you have to have a strong appetite for cheese to enjoy them. For the fans who grew up watching them I'm sure they're special, but a lot of people (unfortunately including myself) are going to be turned off by the shoestring budget production values, and the fact that quite a few ""classic"" episodes are missing so you can't watch the complete series anyway.",0,1385504350,null,0,false,0,cdnq27n,t3_1riejv,t1_cdnq27n,t3_1riejv,null,1428495845,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Today, he completed more passes than any other Chelsea player and had the second highest passing accuracy after JT. How the fuck was he giving the ball away all the time?

Lampard - yes he had a good game last week, but a lot of this season he has been poor. Why does he keep getting picked? Is he using his influence in the dressing room to always be on the lineup etc? We all know that in previous times he has been involved in dressing room drama.

A lot of new players - this will probably get down voted etc, but problems that often plague both us, city, and other err money teams for lack of a better phrasing are that sometimes the team turns up looking like it doesn't give half a shit. There seems to be a problem with our players not always being motivated to give their all and really strive for the win. What could be done to fix this? Or do other people see it as being a problem? 

This isn't a knee jerk reaction, just something that I have been thinking about for a while and seemed like as good a time as any to post it and see what others think.

true,CraftyDragon,null,null,"I have actually crocheted one, based on this website, using the ""inches"" pattern.  If you decide to take it up, here's a few tips from my run:

- Remember crochet works up thicker than knitting.  I'd recommend working in the back loops only of rows, and would make the scarf a thinner width than the suggested 11 inches.  A knitted scarf will do that ""curl"" thing, or will fold in on itself in half very easily, effectively making the scarf more like 5 or 6 inches wide.  Crochet lays flat, so there's no folding/bunching.  This makes the scarf lay much wider around your neck, and if it's 11 inches wide, it winds up being slightly unwieldy - especially since you're wrapping it about yourself so many times.

- The color suggestions on the website are great, but don't get too hung up on matching them exactly.  Because of wool allergies I had to work with acrylic yarn, and took far, far, too many trips to every craft store in town to try and find the ""perfect"" match, especially since many stores didn't carry the exact brands listed on the site.  In the end I realized that if my blue-grey was a little more grey than blue, nobody was going to cry about me being inauthentic.  

- Weave your ends in as you go when you change colors.  You do -not- want to be going back along 12 feet of scarf with a needle and weaving in the ends after you're done, believe me.

Just my two cents, and maybe you'll find it helpful.  Good luck!",0,1385505869,null,0,false,0,cdnqpvp,t3_1rhuz2,t1_cdnqpvp,t1_cdnlinc,null,1428495537,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Are you even serious right now...? Everyone *always* criticises Mikel, what are you on about? The only time I can recall him getting universal praise by Chelsea fans recently is after the Champions League semis and final.

I did watch the game and I didn't think Mikel ""constantly gave the ball away"" so I looked up the stats to confirm. Instead of spouting reactionary and blatant lies, that's what rational people do, see?

Yeah, he also keeps playing Ramires so I'm not sure your point there holds up. I think Ramires might have even played more than Lampard but apparently facts aren't allowed in this conversation so I can't look up stats on how many appearances they've each made so far this season.

It is this eagerness and almost desperation to blame Lampard that I find so bizarre.

Statistics only have value in context. Of course Mikel is going to have more completed passes than Lampard - part of his job is the simple passes, keeping the ball moving, giving it to players like Lampard who are going to try and do something creatively with it. Lampard is going to play more risky passes. They have different roles, and statistics like pass completion don't offer a fair comparison. Lampard didn't do his job well tonight, but neither did Mikel. He gave the ball away, committed needless fouls and was caught out of position.

That... depends on how you look at it. Known history up until The Day of the Doctor was that the Doctor used The Moment to burn them all. But now we see that he didn't. 

However, War and Ten _don't remember_ this. If War didn't remember, then neither did Nine. Only Eleven and forward will remember. So the history The Doctor has been giving us up until now was correct as far as he remembered. Now he knows differently. 

Or yes, time _was_ rewritten. I'm not wanting to quibble over how this is interpretated, and it doesn't matter becase...

The effect is still the same. War and Ten still don't _remember_ that this all happened. If War does not remember that it happened, then Nine and Ten would be completely ignorant of having encountered Bad Wolf before her appearance in NewWho Season 1.

That is why I'm saying Bad Wolf/Rose isn't a retcon. Because even if she was part of the original events, The Doctor won't/didn't remember her.


EDIT: I'll leave this post intact but point out that my wife has informed me you and I are saying the same thing, but from different perspectives. You seem to be arguing from the perspective that time changed, while I am arguing that the true events were merely revealed to us in the special. Soooo yeah.

Once Gallifrey was moved, and the daleks destroyed I'm not sure if that negates the need for a time lock or if it just reinstated seeing as how it was in 10 &amp; 11's past.  However, since 8.5 and 10 wouldn't remember that they tried to save Gallifrey I would venture to guess that the Daleks wouldn't know either.  And since the curator and 11 are the only ones that know they were successful, Daleks in the present timeline would have no idea of what transpired.

I feel like I'm watching a bunch of If...then... causalities when I watch the club. If this happens, then pass backwards. If that happens, then reset the attack. Training and tactics are all well and good, but soccer players are not chess pieces to be manipulated and controlled, they need room to express themselves. Every single criticism of him stems from this. Don't get me wrong, Harry's philosophy of starting 11 players and then letting them run about isn't prudent, but it needs to be a balance. None of the players really look like expressing themselves at all, and as such, it is robotic and easily readable. Not even SAF won the title for Man U on his own. He created a framework which provided his players the opportunity to do what they know how to do.

This is something that all great leaders do, and something that any text on leadership will tell you to do.

**Edit:** First link that comes up if you type New Pence into Google: http://www.royalmint.com/help/help/new-pence-coin

&gt;All 2p coins struck between 1971 and 1981 included the words 'NEW PENCE' as part of their reverse. In 1982 and in subsequent years the words 'NEW PENCE' were replaced with the word 'PENCE'. However, in 1983 a small number of 2p coins were mistakenly struck with the wording 'NEW PENCE' on the reverse. These coins were produced to brilliant uncirculated quality - a standard higher than ordinary circulating coins - and were included in special sets intended for collectors.

&gt;Since there are relatively few coins with the date 1983 and the inscription 'NEW PENCE' in circulation, they may well have a value higher than face value to a collector.

I'd agree with you on that point but in this case Luiz is an exception, based on his performances last season anyway.

What we really be pivotal about this match in terms of AVB is how we play....if we win obviously that would be huge on any number of levels, if play well and lose or draw then at least we are showing progress. However if we lose and play badly....AVB will start being under the microsocpe in all the papers (more so than he already is), he will be the talk of every pundit on the tele and radio....these things have a momentum to them and once it picks up steam it is very difficult to head off regardless of who the team or manager are in that situation.

**Additionally, the filters are mostly unnecessary with regards to child protection in the first place. It is the responsibility of parents to moderate their children's access to the internet. The state has no right to intercede on this responsibility and to do so is a terrible mistake.**

There is just way too many obvious things in the episode to say otherwise, such as:

* Elizabeth I makes the Doctor the Curator of the Museum, and considering he seems to never truly die, this would make the Curator the Doctor still.

* 11 says ""I could retire and become a Curator"" and the Curator says ""you know I really think you might"".

* Curator says ""in years to come you might find yourself revisiting a few [faces], but just the old favorites"", and Baker was like the favorite doctor.

* Tom Baker is only credited as The Doctor, and not the Curator. In fact, the Curator isn't a credited role.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"You are almost correct - the midfield trio of Rami/Oscar, Mikel and Lampard are almost exactly in the same position as the WHU game. However, there were **three** major differences between this game and the WHU game. Allow me to elaborate.

**One**, the WHU game had Hazard starting - he played wider and predominantly to the left as compared to Willian. This led to a lot more width as compared to Oscar and Willian cramming into the same spaces in today's game. Also, it didn't help that Willian kept drifting into the middle trying to dribble his way through into the box.

**Two**, the WHU players chose to exploit the flanks whereas the Basel players chose to cut in. Typically, marauding full-backs will stretch the play wide by hugging the touch line. Voser, instead, chose to cut in. The combination of Voser and Salah running the inside channels ended up continuously overloading both Mikel and Azpi with their pace and pressing. Azpi, being a right-footed player would typically show them inside and Stocker (F) and Streller (LM) would then link up further upfield to harass JT and Cahill.

**Three**, WHU did not press as much as Basel. WHU were content to allow Chelsea the majority of possession whereas Basel worked hard off the ball to win it back when they were out of possession. Chelsea, on the other hand, gave away possession far too often with sloppy passes. When they did press for the ball, they ended up fouling the Basel players more often than win the ball or they left gaps that the Basel players were happy to occupy and exploit. 

^(It also didn't help that the ref kept blowing his whistle for almost every tackle and then some.)

This last point is the one that actually bothers me. IANAM but having seen Basel press like mad in the first leg, I thought Jose would have gone for a deeper, quicker defensive line. IMHO, Cole/Bertrand &amp; Luiz instead of Azpi &amp; JT - yeah, it is not exactly a better choice but certainly a 'quicker' choice. I was also hoping (as somewhat of a fan-boy) to see Mata starting in central attacking midfield instead of Lamps. His ability to unlock defenses might have come in handy today. Then again, it is a matter of ifs and buts, so who knows...

That being said, I would like to differ with your overall sentiment. Yes, average positions may not be the ultimate key to analysing team performances, but it gives a pretty good idea of where various team members spent most of their time on the pitch. A heat map may give a much better idea but an average position chart is much easier to read so I put these up.",0,1385512646,null,0,false,0,cdntfp4,t3_1rj630,t1_cdntfp4,t1_cdnsngf,null,1428494269,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

The interesting thing about this is that The Moment essentially spends this entire episode making sure the Time Lords live and the Daleks get mostly wiped out. It is solely responsible for making the Doctor's meet up and saving Gallifrey.

The *reason* this is interesting though is that The Doctor has implied before that most of Gallifrey's higher up organization is corrupt and has been doing some pretty bad things. Destroying the Daleks almost makes sense - but one would assume that Gallifrey is also not worth saving, or at least *those* people aren't worth saving.

Since The Moment can impose judgment and seems to have quite the knowledge about how to make things play out the way it desires, we can only make the assumption that Gallifrey living is necessary for some important events to come to pass. We assume it's to extend The Doctor's regeneration limit, but I think there has to be more to it than that since The Doctor clearly isn't going to go to Gallifrey in the Christmas special.

There have been a few [official petitions](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/) started on the matter, but they are either not very well worded or not up to date (with the inclusion of the banning of extremist material), see exhibit [A](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/53004) and [B](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/53220).

I suggest that someone creates a new one, that is comprehensive and factual (i.e gives good, well informed reasons and sociogical rebuttals rather than dramatic but realistically meaningless waffle about freedom). One that states the reasons that people (presuming the arguments put forth recently on reddit are reasonably representative of the rest of the demographic that opposes the new laws) disagree with what is happening.

Why should people have to suffer?  It costs nothing to be polite to another human being, it costs nothing to treat someone with a bit of respect.   Yet, large segments of the population can't even be bothered to say 'please' when ordering a McDonalds. 

If you poke around even reddit you'll see not only people who have had to clean up after someone who appears to have a sprinkler for an asshole but people who actually have smeared their own shit on walls because ""fuck the cleaners"".   These bottom rung positions get flak from both that ilk and are regularly abused by people more senior than them.

All I'm saying is that if the majority of people want to treat another human being in such a manner then they should be prepared to pay a hefty financial amount for the privilege of doing so.

It all comes down to formation, which then comes down to the Manager.

We're playing basic football with a 4-2-3-1 formation that ends up being a 4-1-5, we have players in their unnatural positions i.e. Ramires, Lampard, Oscar, Willian - You cannot expect a decent team with the above.

We have a poor formation for our team (and everything else you've said), and as far as I'm concerned, Jose is making all kinds of excuses not to use Mata - It's something personal, because Mata is our best player by a country mile, it's not even debatable (it's like Barca not using Messi, Madrid not using Ronaldo).

Tonight proved it, he pretty much used every player apart from Schurrle before Mata - He didn't even have the balls to change our formation to support the attack and bring on Mata (You'd obviously move into a 4-1-4-1 or 4-1-2-1-2, it's basic football). At the very least, he could of took off Lampard for Mata, and he didn't.

In terms of management, he's doing a poor job.

One slight thing I disagree with is Lampard being past it - He's simply out of position, in a poor formation, that's it.

So to prevent that Paradox all the Doctors before Smith can't remembered them changing the time line. Smith has no such limitation so he remembers. So as such it is his time line that the events of The Day of the Doctor are happening in. More or less if they remember it happening than it might never have happened.

2: The Moment going off is what Time Locked the war. Likely whatever the Doctors did re-locked the events a new but there was a window for them to get in there and mess things up.

3: No as it is more or less happening to all of them for the first time at the same time. Since nothing they did changed the later outcome there was no Paradox as long as none of the Doctors before Smith remembered those events.

Plus, in order for the series to continue making sense, Doctors 1-9 must have forgotten the events of saving Gallifrey in the same way that War/10 have, or else the entire show's narrative falls apart. So logically, as 12 was present, 11 should forget too and should not recall until he becomes Capaldi at the point of about to save Galifrey.

edit: for some precedent, see *The Five Doctors*. Four wasn't directly involved with the other four Doctors as he was 'trapped in the time vortex' (a cover for not appearing in the episode), but he must have forgotten in the same way as One, Two and Three in order for Five's actions to make sense.

Here's a link to the article: http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-11-25/steven-moffat-is-rewriting-doctor-who-folklore-to-produce-a-christmas-cracker

Moffat does state in that interview as well that he does consider that 12 regeneration limit a hard rule in the mythos of the Doctor Who universe so I don't think he'll ignore it. There'll probably be like a loop-hole or like something that gives him extra regenerations. I think some people have theories like River Song healing him gave him extra regenerations since she used up all of hers and ""gave"" it to him to heal him or the episode ""Big Bang"" restarted the universe, so it gave him a reset on that counter.

I hope that it won't be so simple though. And knowing Moffat I feel like he must have something ridiculous planned to explain it.",0,1385519911,null,0,false,0,cdnw51f,t3_1rj5db,t1_cdnw51f,t1_cdnvzd3,null,1428493008,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Though I do like the idea of the Moment being the Bad Wolf. Though this raises the question of how the time vortex from the Doctor's TARDIS came to be the same consciousness as the Moment. The Doctor has had the same TARDIS the entire time, which would mean that possibly the Moment slipped itself into the Doctor's TARDIS, which is then how it managed to pull Rose's image from the Moment's own future timeline.

This is only my view, but I took that to mean that The Doctor will acquire the ability to regenerate *into* previous incarnations. And that, when he finally retired, he regenerated back into his fourth body for old time's sake. It perfectly fit with the fact that this Doctor was much older than the Fourth Doctor ever became and that he knew everything - the true name of the painting, the fact that Gallifrey was alive, and that the Doctor could now go and find it. And, to top it off, it fit with the notion among most people that the Fourth Doctor was *the* Doctor.

true,Kopman,null,null,"We have an interesting midfield setup strategy wise. 

Ideally Lucas plays defensively, and gerrard still has the proven ability to distribute the ball and put in spot on set pieces. The issue with having the 2 of them in the midfield is they are immobile together. 

This leaves Henderson, Allen, Alberto, and Coutinho to fill in the 3rd spot. This position depends a lot on the opposition we're playing. For instance, against Everton, Henderson pressing capability was used against baines until baines was subbed. This left Allen, Alberto, and Coutinho, the last who was played on the left. Rodgers opted for Allen who can play further back in a more defensive approach. 

Against other opposition, Coutinho is opted as the 3rd central player so he can play a more attacking role, we sacrifice defensive positioning and honestly suffer from the mobility of Lucas and gerrard but make up for it through possession. 

The real issue is going to be gerrard as he gets older. We'll have to transition out of using him eventually. in my opinion, Lucas Allen and Henderson/Coutinho could be really good. Allen plays very well when his main role is passing. Henderson's best quality is his running which seems to be best used when he can have the freedom to move forward and press or attack, and Coutinho needs to play up much higher with limited defending requirements so he can be in position to transition us between defense and attack. 

Alberto, seems to also fit into that higher role, although I wouldn't be surprised if he gets trained to also play deeper. He's a great passer, but can also score. He might be best suited to play deep but choose his moments to join in on the attack.

2. It's saved in the cloud. I have a Chromebook. I can open a browser with tabs in my Chromebook. I can then log into ANY other Chromebook and my browser with the same tabs, bookmarks, and settings will be there just as I left it on the other machine. If I were to stop typing right now and restart my computer, when it came back on (5 seconds later, since it's superfast), I would still have this unfinished post sitting here waiting for me to submit (in fact, I'm going to do that right now...and I'm back without losing my post.)

3. Have you ever had to restore your Windows machine to a previous time to fix a problem created by corruption or a new program that wasn't compatible? Same thing. That sonic is backed yp at regular intervals, and if something goes wrong, it can all be restored.

History says Levy and Joe don't put up with much BUT they gave AVB the keys to £100m. They need to see it through. And it isn't all terrible.

If it turn out that they not only can, which is seems blatantly obvious is the case, and they even consider this as an option I can only label this as immoral, a word which gets thrown around a lot but is truly relevant here. 

This combined with the government talking down to pay-day lenders for their scurrilous method of ripping people off is so rich. At least Wonga doesn't entice people to take out low interest loans on the false promise of better prospects and then put up the interests on purpose later to lock debters into a cycle of repayment that will last as long as they have money...well actually they may do the first part but their interest rates stay the same. 

They can surely see what will happen as soon as they've sold off the debt, a big interest rate hike and maybe a change of other terms of the loan so they can chase you for money maybe even reposes possessions. I hope it would never get to that point but I can't see any legal reason why it couldn't and it's in the interests of the interest buyers to have it reach that point. 

I have the feeling the government would never raise interest rate in such a calculated money making move themselves so why is it OK to allow private companies to do it on their behalf? Presumably because we wouldn't have anyone to hold accountable and they can try and deny responsibility.

true,shoryukenist,null,null,"Well, I see that you have removed the ""insult"" provision of the Public Order Act, and apparently you have eased the ridiculous libel laws as well.  So maybe in some ways it has improved.  Still, your laws are so vague that nearly anything can be construed as an offense.  If you had something approaching the ""void for vagueness"" doctrine, I think you would be in a lot better shape:

""If a person of ordinary intelligence cannot determine what persons are regulated, what conduct is prohibited, or what punishment may be imposed under a particular law, then the law will be deemed unconstitutionally vague. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that no one may be required at peril of life, liberty, or property to speculate as to the meaning of a penal law. Everyone is entitled to know what the government commands or forbids.

The void for vagueness doctrine advances four underlying policies. First, the doctrine encourages the government to clearly distinguish conduct that is lawful from that which is unlawful. Under the Due Process Clauses, individuals must be given adequate notice of their legal obligations so they can govern their behavior accordingly. When individuals are left uncertain by the wording of an imprecise statute, the law becomes a standardless trap for the unwary.....

A fourth reason for the void for vagueness doctrine is to avoid encroachment on First Amendment freedoms, such as Freedom of Speech and religion. Because vague laws cause uncertainty in the minds of average citizens, some citizens will inevitably decline to take risky behavior that might land them in jail. When the vague provisions of a state or federal statute deter citizens from engaging in certain political or religious discourse, courts will apply heightened scrutiny to ensure that protected expression is not suppressed. For example, a law that prohibits ""sacrilegious"" speech would simultaneously chill the freedoms of expression and religion in violation of the void for vagueness doctrine (Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S. Ct. 777, 96 L. Ed. 1098 [1952]).""

Anyway, I'm not advocating for US style freedom of speech, I think you could learn a lot from your Canadian cousins (children?).

But Lampard has been doing decently in most fixtures and was brilliant vs West Ham, yes he's had a few bad games but I feel that people are too harsh on him on this sub.

 About Hazard, I think he's been doing fine, a bit up and down in terms of form but I'm quite satisfied with his performance. I would like to see more Schürrle though, if only to give Hazard more rest and keep him fighting for his place.

The toughest pill to swallow for me has definitely been the Mata situation. Oscar has been brilliant this season, but I still believe that Mata has that something special when he's attacking. He definitely has the best defense splitting pass in our squad, and with our struggles in scoring against Newcastle, West Brom, and Basel I would really like to see Mata play more. 

So having said all this, you can see that I do have some personal opinions that are seemingly different from Jose's. But I think it's ridiculous to attack Jose and his decisions.

Hazard has been our best attacking player, it's so obvious I don't know how you could miss it.

He started Oscar on the wing twice in a different system where he is one of only two midfielders in the attacking band and is supported by three central midfielders.  He still plays like a no.10 he's not a winger.

Mata doesn't press consistently and doesn't have the same burst of pace as all of our all other attacking midfielders.  That's why De Bruyne came in/Mata isn't played as frequently.

b) No, they don't. That's the joy of the Experimental Technique over theoretical calcuations (and I point to the days the Doctor experimented rather than ""calculated"". The Tom Baker episode where he used a spoon to test a spaceship, whereas the local queen's advisors spent decades doing measurements, found nothing and she had them killed).

All you do is put the stream of pulses in one end. Measure at the middle. The material of the door **itself** does the ""calculation"". The point of simulation is to model a physical system we can't actually work on yet. The door's right there, not a problem.

You don't need to ""calculate"" for *multiple areas* of the door; just over the door *as a whole*. Really, should take a couple of minutes. Even if it does blow a hole only in part of the door, just repeat for the remaining door.

c) I point you to *The End Of The World*. The Doctor can somehow step himself (and his clothes and pockets' contents) fast enough to step through the fan-blades. In a Classic episode, the Doctor used an assembly of 20th century household objects to disrupt nearby time experiments.

Really. Easy-peasy, doesn't mess with ""real"" science (anywhere near as much), draws on things that happened in previous episodes. Doesn't **break** things in previous episodes.

*Yes*, I know the point of the ""400-year calculation"" was to set up that the Doctors would need *all their lives* to do the calculation to send the whole of Gallifrey lost into some other universe. Foreshadowing, that dramatic literary device. *No*, it's just as silly. You could say ""but you'd need some kind of super-intelligence, not even the non-linear intelligence of the old TARDIS could do that! But wait, what about **thirteen TARDISes** ***working together...!***"".

(EDIT: and those *thirteen TARDISes* could **also** have recorded or calculated *where* they sent Gallifrey... there's your Christmas episode right there.)

The door scene in particular introduces the idea of using multiple versions of himself to perform calculations over a long period of time, and it introduces the idea that the Doctor might just conclude something's locked merely because it's supposed to be locked.

true,Fetchmemymonocle,null,null,"Well to get the ball rolling, yes you probably do have UK citizenship, see http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/othernationality/Britishcitizenship/bornoverseas/ However, your application to university may be treated as an application by a foreign student, seeing as you are not and have never been a resident.

As for UK tuition, it hasn't been free for quite some time now. The fees recently became £9000 a year. However, this is paid by a government provided loan see http://www.slc.co.uk it's a fairly generous loan. Scotland does not have tuition fees for those resident in Scotland or the EU, and I believe has much lower fees anyway. If you are treated as a foreign student, fees will be much higher with no government loan, this I suspect, will be your position.

As for finding a course, you can use a site like this http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings the Guardian and the Times newspapers also offer university rankings. Most of all visit UCAS, http://www.ucas.com the way everyone applies to universities. You might also want to check out this http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/international. Applications start in September, though this is different for foreign students. You are a little late, but applications from UK citizens for September courses to continue into the new year, but for competitive courses you may be at a disadvantage. Oxbridge closes applications in October.

UK degrees are, I certainly like to think, treated equally, but as with all universities it is the institution's reputation that really matters. They are generally more specialist than US degrees, which would probably be a bonus in your chosen field, however what will be important is if you need a professional qualifications, I n which case in the UK you might get ones not applicable in the US.

Edit: You asked about living costs. On top of tuition fees loan students receive a loan of 3,000ish a year, with various grants and loans on top of that depending upon income. It is highly dependent on where you live but the loan should hopefully cover all/almost all of your rent. On top of that I generally spent as much again probably on food, drink, trains etc. If you choose London you will be poor.

To recap, you have a lot of research to do very quickly if you want to apply for September 2014, and whilst you are a British citizen, the fact you are not a resident may mean you will have to apply as a foreign student, meaning high fees.",0,1385530721,null,0,1385532014,0,cdnzxyy,t3_1rjwml,t1_cdnzxyy,t3_1rjwml,null,1428491222,19,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,19

Now, there was a rumor floating around that The Doctor looking like an important character would be mentioned. What if The Doctor, out of regenerations, possesses the body of one of these characters??

He loaned BAE out because they had philosophical differences which has fucked us since Rose got hurt (this made no sense at the time and makes even less now. It was so stupid. Yea, Benny is different but everyone likes him and he can play). He insists on playing a high line every game, no matter who we're playing, which doesn't suit Dawson's style at all and kills us when Jan plays LB because we're too slow and can't recover as well. He has no real tactical variation. We get the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 in which we play a safe possession game but it isn't working. No one's been delivering good balls into Soldado from the wings, so we have to build through the middle and it ends up becoming a clusterfuck around the box. We then dick around for a minute until Paulinho or Townsend rips a 25 yard shot that ends up in orbit (if I had a nickel for every time they take some audacious, wasteful shot, I would have killed myself a month ago when I saw how many fucking nickels I had). Soldado scores everything inside the box, so you'd think AVB would design his gameplan around getting him the ball in the box.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Such an argument is meaningless, I'm afraid. According to the census, only 18% of Scots consider themselves ""Scottish and British"", compared to 62% considering themselves ""Scottish only"". 

If I had to give a reason for this, I guess it would be because ""British"" identity has supplanted, largely, ""English"" identity, and the two are treated as synonymous up here. Certainly, especially during the Olympics, whenever (usually English) people tried to make me feel great about being British, it all felt rather hollow, forced and meaningless. Didn't help when the megaphone guy following the torch relay couldn't pronounce half of the town names up here.

You can see the same thing in France, to a great degree. ""French"" identity is, largely, Parisian identity writ large; much to dismay and distress of the other cultures in France, such as the Basques and speakers of Occitan. This was done, largely, so the French king could consolidate his power over treacherous and largely automous feudal Lords, but the repression of different cultures in France continues to this day. Obviously, it is nowhere near as bad in the UK today.

Probably, also, because of the simple reason that Scots are very different from the Southern English, who hold most of the power. But other than that, I don't really know.

But, again, such an argument is meaningless. This debate is not about identity; it is pure practicality. Will Scotland be better off as an independent nation state? Is being in the Union worth it?

So you can count him as 8.5, ""the warrior"", or the ""war doctor"" for logistics sake. But Hurt will not have an official number and Capaldi will be 12. 

As for the academic arguments about number of regenerations that a timelord can have. That gets complicated. We at one point were told that they get 12 regenerations, that would be 13 lives. But we do not know if this was biological or a social limitation. We do know that they were able to give the Master an additional set of regenerations at some point in Classic Who and that they also gave out additional ones during the Time War. That leads me to believe that it is a social limitation. Particularly since Tennant used some regeneration energy without actually changing faces once.

I have kids in two local primary's.  Both schools are doing well and I feel I have few if any issues about how the schools are run under the leadership of their current heads.  

School 1 has just been forced to acadamise after a couple of years of struggling against poor Ofsted reports accompanied by the threat of closure.  Basically the only way for the school to get a better grading and be left alone by the inspectors will be to receive sponsorship from a commercial organisation based some 200 miles away.  The school has been manipulated into this situation and there is no choice in providers.  Only a single provider was able to make a presentation along the the lines of any choice having been made and the result a fore gone conclusion.

School 2 is in a different position. Due to its previous excellent reports it hasn't been inspected during this governments term.  Its periodic inspection will be due next year some time.  Rather than tar its excellent reputation, wreck its staffs careers and put massive strain on its resources fighting the forced change to academe status the head has decided to not fight the inevitable and start the who proves of privatisation now, before teaching standards are forced down and the kids suffer.

This is wrong.  Words fail be as to how wrong this is.  The government disgusts me.

[**Of Knights and Neckerchiefs**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9449087/1/Of-Knights-and-Neckerchiefs) by **FlyingMachine1** (8k words)

**Summary**: Hurt/comfort and shameless fluff, but this is still a really good story. ""In which Merlin is bullied, a neckerchief is lost, and Arthur is protective of his servant.""

**Spoilers**: Takes place sometime after the season 3 finale.

[**Healing Spells**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6022745/1/Healing-Spells) by **BeyondTheStorm** (200k words)

**Summary**: ""After revealing his magic to Arthur due to life-threatening circumstances, Merlin decides it's time he learned to heal. With Gaius off dealing with an illness in the outer villages, Merlin is left to his own methods, bearing some rather costly outcomes.""

Post-reveal. Also, it's a pretty important story within the Merlin fandom in general because most other stories tend to use this author's model of healing magic.

**Spoilers**: It's set mid-season 2, but nothing too spoilery.

[**Bury Me Whole**](http://archiveofourown.org/works/693400/chapters/1274942) by **Ryne** (20k words)

**Summary**: This story is set during the Great Purge and describes the events that led up to it and the events that followed. It doesn't focus on Merlin or Arthur since they're infants, but it's still amazingly written and gripping. I cannot recommend it enough.

**Spoilers**: None, really. The story has some characters from season 2, I believe, but nothing particularly ""spoilery"" happens.",0,1385540640,null,0,1386575699,0,cdo2cqp,t3_1rk63c,t1_cdo2cqp,t3_1rk63c,null,1428490097,3,false,merlinbbc,t5_2s3xe,3

The Time War was the greatest war in history because it was a war that existed beyond the third dimension, beyond time, twisting and ripping reality in endless destruction and despair. The Horde of Travesties? The Skaro Degredations? The Nightmare Child? Jesus Christ, when Tennant described the Time War in The End of Time it sent chills up my spine. I couldn't *wait* to see how they represented that in the 50th.

So...what happened? Where did all of these horrifying creations go? If the Time War turned into Hell, why in God's name is Smith suddenly so eager to bring Gallifrey back? Is the Time War now just Daleks versus Timelords pew pew boom boom?

I know that Moffat is all about unanswered questions, but this clashes way, way too much with The End of Time. Tennant gave his life to keep Gallifrey FROM returning. Why the sudden change of heart? Wouldn't Rassilon just impose the Final Sanction again as soon as he gets out?

I don't have the definite answers to a perfect society though I think collectively we could be a lot stronger and co-operative working together within society than being divided and ruled against one another.

With autonomous and social spaces we could have places to organise, look after each other collectively and create a space with real community involvement.

I felt very let down by politicians promises in the past and don't see how voting for these 3 parties with similar views will make much change or difference. Which made me think there has to be  other ways which we're able to have some decision and control which we can all make ourselves not just relying of a politician to change issues affecting our daily lives (i.e- this internet filter, bedroom tax, gas prices) . We could all make a change together if we try. 

What do others think? I think politics is more grey than black and white. I can't be the only person who feels fed up with these 3 parties and think there's alternatives which society and equality can be improved other than voting.

This isn't really clubs or things like that but it's just a list of ""things"" to do. I will think of some more clubs etc and see what I can come up with. Do you have any specific interests?

We have a few obvious features, in the town centre there are shops the majority of which are spread across two shopping centres an open market  and a long street. We don't have any particularly unusual shops in the centre. St Giles street probably has some more interesting options.

We have a cinema (vue) in the town centre as well as a casino. I think there is a lazer quazar thing as well although I have never been in there. Both of these are in a building called ""Sol Central"" which is just out of the town centre.

There is also a theatre, the Royal and Derngate. Their website has some more details (http://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/)

We also have a museum and art gallery that is right near the theatre (http://www.northampton.gov.uk/museums) it is open on sundays and it is free. Lots of exhibits about the towns proud shoe heritage.

There is also another museum (mentioned on that same page) that is slightly further out of town but is near to small park that is nice if the weather is good although there isn’t much there.

There is also Delapre Abbey which is fairly near the centre of Northampton and is a nice walk around, again probably slightly weather dependant. http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186349-d2553139-Reviews-Delapre_Abbey-Northampton_Northamptonshire_England.html

There is in out of town area (near the motorway) that is based around the Sixfields stadium. This has many eateries (Frankie and Bennies, TGI Fridays etc) and there is also a bowling alley and a cinema (cineworld). Both Coventry and Northampton play their home games there.

There is a go carting centre near sixfields, although I have never been (http://www.northamptonindoorkarting.com/)

Moving out from town slightly there are two forests that are quite nice, Salcey forest that is just outside Northampton towards MK (http://www.forestry.gov.uk/salceyforest) and there is also Harlsetone Firs (http://www.ukattraction.com/heart-of-england/harlestone-firs.htm) which is pretty much out of the top of Northampton. There is probably more to do at Salcey forest but both of them are going to be fairly weather dependant.

Finally two other areas slightly out of Northampton there is Pitsford Resevoir (http://www.anglianwater.co.uk/leisure/what-to-see/water-parks/pitsford/) you can walk or cycle around, I think there is a white water centre there (http://www.nenewhitewatercentre.co.uk/) there might even be other providers as I am sure you can get up to all kinds of water based activities and maybe even rent bikes as well. Also Billing aquadrome (http://www.billingaquadrome.com/) they have a marina and some open spaces as well as some activities.

At that level of taxation, tobacco brings in around £15 billion each year in tax revenue (which more than pays for the £9 billion or so that smokers cost the NHS)

In contrast, the retail price of an ounce of cannabis (without tax, obviously) is around £240.  That's roughly **150 times the price**.

There's no reason why cannabis couldn't be produced for the same kind of price as tobacco, tomatoes, or any other legal plant.  So the government could tax cannabis an awful lot more than they tax tobacco and it would still be way, way cheaper than the black market.  For example, If the taxation was 10x that of tobacco (£54 per ounce) then it could still come in at under £60 an ounce, less than a quarter of the current price.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"That is such a crap. For the most part, Chelsea has been playing with 2 midfielders. You mean to tell me you can't find minutes when Hazard and/or Oscar are not on the pitch? 

Take for example yesterday against Basel. Why couldn't Mourinho switch from 3 midfielders (which was clearly not working) to 2? They did it against the spurs earlier in the year. Mata could have given Hazard options to work with. 

Now, for Oscar. I have been a huge proponent for Oscar. I've said it since last summer that I preferred him over Mata. He had a blazing start, well deserving of being anointed Chelseas #10. But lately, his form has dipped. He has been inconsistent. He needs to be rested. 

For how good Oscar has played this season, it has not provided a fluid attacking play. Even with Chelsea dominating the possession, it does not look dangerous and just leads to nothing. 

It is painfully obvious that Chelsea is lacking something when attacking. If Mourinho does not think Mata is the answer, then let the man go somewhere else and get someone that he things is better suited for his system. 

I had been inherently curious on how Mourinho would deal with Oscar/Hazard/Mata. I kind of figured that Mata would draw the short end of the stick knowing what kind of guy Mourinho is. With that, this is not how I expected it to play out at all. I did not see Mata just rotting in the bench. 

The man is 25 years old. At the prime of his career, easily in the top 20 footballers in the world, during a world cup year at that. He has been Chelseas player of the year the past two seasons. He has been class both in and outside of the pitch. If he is not going to get the minutes with Chelsea, let him go and don't ruin his career and his chance to play with Spain.

Dear Phillip Lee,

I strongly oppose the recently announced internet censorship measures
by David Cameron and it was the recently announced ""extremist"" filter
which inspired me to write to you. I find them a gross violation of
civil rights. As a consenting adult I should be able to decide if I
want to view porn without having to get it rubber stamped by my
ISP/goverment/thought minister, download files from a peer to peer
network or read the views of others.

I grew up in the internet age. I browsed various adult websites sweaty palmed teenager. This
was in my mind no differently from finding a gift from the porn pixie
in a hedge, or trying to buy a top shelf magazine from the corner shop.
This hasn't made me a sexual deviant and I make an informed decision
not to download movies for free. I am a father my children should be able to read the views of all people when they grow up. I
don't want them to grow up connected to an internet with the kind of
restrictions common in China not a modern democracy.

My wife is a (was) a teacher so I know a lot of teachers socially and few are looking to stay in the profession any longer than is necessary.  I don't blame them. Working conditions are horrendous so add to this poor pay and a Damoclean sword wielded by Ofsted hanging over the tatters of their careers and you can easily see why teaching is no longer a good career move. I wouldn't do it and I have done some fairly shit jobs in my time.  No wonder that few youngsters want to become teachers now.  It is all OK though.  Gove is planning on [fast tracking Ex-service personnel](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-routes-for-talented-ex-armed-forces-personnel-to-become-teachers) to fill the gap.

(low paid and only basically trained / educated classroom assistants are not teachers - they are only assistants)

First, the effectiveness of drive-by malware has been greatly reduced by new operating system and application features, improvements in automatic updating and disabling or removal of known common attack vectors. It is much more common to use social engineering to get malware on computers, and even then malware is frequently caught and quarantined before it is able to execute, thanks to malware protection software.

Secondly, this has nothing at all to do with malware, and everything to do with ""protecting"" children from completely legal age-restricted content. Many firewall packages include the ability to block content based on text filters, IP addresses or domain names, making them sufficient for this purpose.

Lastly, the filters are not being forced on me, but on ISPs. I said as much in my comment. How you read that into my comment is beyond me. What I am being forced to do is tell my ISP that I want access to otherwise restricted content. I don't have to tell my car manufacturer if I want to visit a porn shop. 

Hell, this is even worse than in a firewall configuration, since I can't configure it on a per-user or per-machine basis - it's either all or nothing. If I want access to something deemed unfit for my kids, but want to deny them access, I *still* have to go and configure a firewall *anyway*, defeating *any* convenience this may have given me.

If the government wanted to protect kids from adult content, giving parents a useful pre-configured tool to install would have been a much better option, in every way.

Disclaimer: I've bred pedigree dogs. My family still breed pedigree Labradors. We've had no serious issues with any of our pedigree Labradors who have on the whole had long, healthy and happy lives.

The idea that ALL pedigree dog breeders do this is frankly insane. I've yet to meet one breeder who does not love their dogs totally. I imagine there are some but they are in the minority. Most of these people dedicate a lot of their lives to looking after dogs and they are part of the family.

I've seen the show posted above and it was ludicrously one sided and yet everybody lapped it up and now see pedigree dog breeders and evil people who just want to make pretty dogs and really don't give a fuck if they are in pain. I can only talk from personal experience, but when one of our dogs dies, but mum has been in pieces for weeks and weeks. She hates seeing them in pain. She spends a lot of money taking them to the vet if they so much as yelp strangely or have slightly hurt themselves and are hobbling.

When we had people chuck paint at some of our kennels which almost went into one of our dogs eyes, as a family we took it in turns to stay up through the night for a few nights to make sure they didn't come back. To make sure they didn't come and hurt the dogs.

I accept that there are some bad breeders out there, some bad pedigree dog breeders. But please do not tar us all with the same brush. It is a small minority that doesn't care.

As for the breed standards being unhealthy, this is being dealt with on a breed by breed basis. For example, Labradors are known to have bad hips. Every pedigree Labrador has to have their hips ""scored"" to make sure they are in a decent condition. These are then published so that people can check the scores of the dogs to see whether to breed with a certain dog (obviously a bad score means it's not suitable for breeding with). My mum used to actually write the book with all of these in. She did this for free.

EDIT: Realise this is a bit of an unstructured rant, but every time pedigree dogs come up in a comments, it's a massive circle jerk about how evil they are and how little they care when personally I could not find that further from the truth.",0,1385552341,null,0,1385552526,0,cdo41zw,t3_1rk8ce,t1_cdo41zw,t1_cdo3t3k,null,1428489233,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

I don't think these lyrics represent the UK in the slightest. 'Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set'? Given that British territory has been waning for near enough a century I don't think they ever particularly have done! Religion is waning massively too, with [half of the country](http://ir2.flife.de/data/natcen-social-research/igb_html/index.php?bericht_id=1000001&amp;index=&amp;lang=ENG) being completely irreligious. It's also the Tory party anthem, unsurprisingly.

Jerusalem is a beautiful song, but again due to its religious content is not relevant.

&gt; And did those feet in ancient times walk upon England's mountains green?

No.

I'm proud to say that Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau doesn't have any religious lyrics at all, even if some Welsh people do find it a bit embarrassingly OTT.

Who won meaningless individual events is really not the point of being a sports minister. These events are deliberately designed to be pointless, whoever wins the FA cup this year will have to try again next year and all games are exchangeable through time at some level.

They're pretty dim cats, and will go through the whole performance over and over again until finally eating it or losing interest... First it goes with them hiding behind a corner preparing the pounce, whilst the mice lay dead, then they do pounce and end up looking like they're trying to break the record for mouse juggles in a second, then they bat at it a little bit which I think they confuse for the mouse moving, then they hit it a bit harder and it slides across the floor to somewhere else. Rinse and repeat. It did lead to the pretty cool sight of my bigger cat giving one mouse a full-on choke slam that would've put The Undertaker to shame. Sorry about the length of this paragraph.

&gt; This is horse shit. Only some breeds have problems, most don't.

I've add in some emphasis to help you out here. It's an increasing problem. Responding that it doesn't affect most breeds doesn't say anything about whether it is an increasing or decreasing problem. Or, since we're on the point whether or not it affects most *dogs*.

&gt; Just because you watched a one sided sensationalist documentary does not make you an expert entitled to lecture people on what dogs they should/shouldn't own/breed.

Good thing I didn't make any of those claims then, isn't it. 

FWIW, it's the opinion of the UK Kennel Club that defects from purebreeding is an increasing problem and they have taken steps themselves to combat it. I'm sure you'll agree that if anyone is entitled to lecture dog breeders, they are. 

And after all that you managed to miss the central point of my comment. dantheman999 tried to imply there were no issues with dog breeding by putting aside the two main problems with dog breeding.

I'd quite like for us candidates to just be judged based on our manifestos and the quality of our husts. Anybody who has no interest could easily avoid both. But, the way things are, to get elected you have to waste tonnes of paper posting your face all over campus with obnoxious slogans. I hate that this is the standard, and seriously resent having to do it to even have a hope of getting elected.

That said, as long as my opponents do it, I have to do something. I've tried to buck the trend by having a campaign which doesn't rely on puns, hashtags or my face printed all over campus. I've got a few posters telling people where I'll be every lunchtime, and a big sign to make me identifiable. Nobody has to look at my mug any more than they normally would when I'm walking around campus, and I'm not approaching people or sticking leaflets down their gullets.



Aaaand now I'm gonna go stand in the cold for a couple of hours with my sign, in what will probably be a futile attempt to get elected without allowing my campaign to further muddy the already cack-smeared campus.

Basically, we have zero cohesion on the pitch right now. We're constantly cycling players in key positions and the chemistry needed to create world-class football hasn't had adequate time to develop.

Oscar had a poor display yesterday, which is atypical of him. Maybe he's tired or maybe he was just having an off-night. Either way, I see Oscar and Mata as interchangeable. The question being asked most frequently is: Why wasn't Mata brought on for Oscar early in the second half?

Ramires as an attacking midfielder really only works when we've parked the bus. He seemed completely out of position yesterday. I like the Ramires/Mikel partnership generally.

Lampard doesn't need to start every game. He had a few moments of Super Frank in the game against West Ham, but that was because the flow of the game allowed him to maraud forward frequently. If he's on the team sheet as a holding midfielder, I worry about the lack of creativity. He's certainly better suited as an attacking midfielder, but we've got several other young and talented attacking midfielders. I think Mourinho keeps starting Lamps out of respect rather than talent. I'm not saying Lamps isn't talented, but he's no spring chicken anymore and starting every game seems excessive.

Our midfield felt crowded and narrow yesterday. Until Hazard came on, no one made darting runs to the outside. We were forced time and again back into our own half, which is very frustrating when we KNOW our boys are capable of absolute magic.

Generally speaking, we had a poor display and deserved the loss. Hopefully we can survive the Round of 16 and cement some roles.

true,igloo_assassin,num7,,"Ok, let's debate the manager (x-post from my comment in another thread): He isn't flexible AT ALL and I think it's hurting the club. He loaned BAE out because they had philosophical differences which has fucked us since Rose got hurt (this made no sense at the time and makes even less now. It was so stupid. Yea, Benny is different and doesnt share AVB's intensity but the locker room likes him and he can play). He insists on playing a high line every game, no matter who we're playing, which doesn't suit Dawson's style at all and kills us when Jan plays LB because we're too slow and can't recover as well. We were bound to get lit up at some point. 

He has no real tactical variation. We get the 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 in which we play a safe possession game but it isn't working. No one's been delivering good balls into Soldado from the wings, so we have to build through the middle and it ends up becoming a clusterfuck around the box. We then dick around for a minute until Paulinho or Townsend rips a 25 yard shot that ends up in orbit (if I had a nickel for every time they take some audacious, wasteful shot, I would have killed myself a month ago when I saw how many fucking nickels I had). Soldado scores everything inside the box, so you'd think AVB would design his gameplan around getting him the ball in the box. Look at his [heat map](http://www.offthepost.info/blog/2013/11/graphic-roberto-soldados-heat-map-man-city-6-0-tottenham/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+offthepost%2FTLAa+%28Off+The+Post%29) from last game, all his touches were in the midfield. It's like buying a new Rolls Royce and using it only as a radio.

What do you get for rushing it through - a lukewarm GB which already threatening to bail from the EU being even more pissed off meaning its political elite have to further walk away from the EU project.

If one or two of the ISPs decided to add these filters of their own volition (as TalkTalk did), with their own decisions of what should or should not be blocked then that is their prerogative, and just like a newsagent deciding not to stock lads mags or similar.

The government doing it is a whole different story as it is state censorship, where the government decides what should be blocked (including what they believe to be ""extreme"" political views). This is more like the government telling all newsagents not to stock magazines X or Y, and threaten them with regulation forcing them not to stock them if they don't comply. Magazine Z that has similar content, however, is perfectly fine because the government said so and it is owned by their friends (hello Rupert Murdoch).

Yes people *can* opt out, but most will keep all the filters out of fear even if they accidentally block things like sex education sites or (more likely on purpose) block places like Wikileaks.

The UK Government and various Crown Dependency and Overseas Territory Governments have signed pretty comprehensive information sharing agreements which pave the way for more control over tax havens.


A tax on Gibraltar's currently under-taxed gambling sector has been proposed.


200 individuals who are under investigation over their tax arrangements were recently ordered by, I think, the Supreme Court to continue to pay tax throughout the investigation, generating around half a billion for HMRC.

4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 are in my eyes our only realistic formations, considering the players we got. People are screaming for two strikers up top, well, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern Munchen, Dortmund, Napoli, Athletico Madrid are all using one striker for a reason, they want to exploit their talented midfield. Even Manchester United, with two great attackers in RvP and Rooney, decided to push Rooney back in an attacking midfielder position, because they preferred playing with one striker.

I don't think it's a tactical problem at all, I think AVB is way more talented than us at that particular subject, but I think it comes down to his people skills. He is really young, and he is dealing with a squad close to his own age. He implented 7 new players, replaced their star player, and is trying to make it all gel. It's like buying a risky stock; if it's value decreases with a, let's say 10 % over the next months, it doesn't mean it can't double it's value the next day!

Once more, with feeling: War and (Nine and) Ten remember how they _thought_ the war ended. But now because time has been re-written that literally never happened. That is my opinion on it. IMO when a time traveler goes back and changes history, all they have really done is fulfilled history a differently than what was reported. So while War and Ten thought they had destroyed the Time Lord's they really hadn't. Because they thought they had, that is the story they told.

Think about it, our only source of that story is The Doctor, but now we know his memories are faulty, so we can't ever really know that his story was true or not.

A partially masticated Penguin bar between his chocolate-stained fingers, Eric paused and looked at the computer screen.

An electronic mail delivery. It was going to be one of *those* days.

He crammed the rest of the sweet treat into his gaping maw. His free hand rested on the computer's mouse; the other, currently being licked clean, had an appointment with the virgin pack of Caramel Digestives across his desk. He lamented the fact that whichever of his advisors he had sent to make tea (they all looked the same to him - except her with the tits, of course) had not yet returned.

*click*

""Dear Fatty Pickles...""

Eric's eyes widened. Crumbs ricocheted from the LCD display.

The *nerve*! The unabashed **nerve** of this little oik! No need to even read the remainder of this derogatory missive. Eric was going to sort him right out. He moved the cursor towards the 'Reply' button, then stopped to wipe his brow and wrestle the McVities open. Multi-tasking was hard.

Composure regained, Eric began constructing the rebuttal to end all rebuttals. ""Fatty Pickles"" indeed! He typed for what felt like hours. By the time he was done, he was drenched in perspiration and the digestives were almost gone. Eric surveyed his work with satisfaction, and nodded to himself. Setting the world to rights was what Eric Pickles *did*. 

The reply was dispatched, and as Eric got up with the intention of finding out what had become of the Hob Nobs he'd stashed behind the radiator, the harrowing events of the last few minutes were already fading from his carbohydrate-saturated mind.

The computer screen dulled as the 'idle' setting kicked in, leaving barely visible the rejoinder which even now was swirling through the electronic aether en route to its destination:

""Fuck off, peasant.

Love,

Fatty""

The theory is pretty water-tight, bar the fact that I think it would take A LOT of work for the Doctor to persuade the Time Lords he has 'gone dark' so to speak.

IMO, if anyone is watching Doctor Who for the danger to the Doctor, I think they are almost missing the point. It'd be like watching Star Trek for the danger to the Enterprise really. Doctor Who is ultimately a story about a mysterious alien guy going on crazy adventures with his companions. He does get into some danger (regenerations), but mostly it's about the adventures and crazy things he sees/does, promoting optimism, hope, and a sense of adventure, and his interactions with his companions and learning about the Doctor/companions, rather than wondering if the Doctor is going to survive it all. I doubt we will ever see the entirety of The Doctor's life on television or film. 

Just like how the Enterprise, yes it does get into *some* trouble, but Star Trek (the TV shows anyways, not the films), are about the interactions of the crew, crazy sights and races they meet, and the moral and philosophical challenges that come from a futuristic society that is very close to an utopian socialist government and how they have overcome the cynicism and problems that beget current humanity.

I honestly think Mourinho was never going to give Mata a chance. There were already reports about Oscar coming infor Mata whilst Mata hadn't even rejoined the squad per season. Forgive me for speculating and I know Oscar is a wonderful player, but a lot of this Mata business just looks like Mourinhos power play at the club. Mata thrived under Benitez, and to recall him now risks making Mourinho look bad.

The team is still a very long way from where we want it to be, no one was prepared to accept just how shit West Ham were on Saturday. We all wanted to believe that the simple introduction of a defensive midfielder was all our squad needed to flourish, not that simple I'm afraid.

Last nights performance was one we've seen too often from this current team, aimless and almost passionless. I can't tell you what's wrong exactly, it's lots of things, but its no good heaping blame all over the place on the likes of Lampard, Mourinho and Hazard.

true,PanTardovski,null,null,"&gt; Shunting gallifrey into a paralell dimension can be done without significant damage to the timelines

In this universe, but not necessarily wherever Gallifrey ends up. And if (when) the Doctor eventually finds a way to retrieve Gallifrey then that will change the timeline significantly from what it would have been if Gallifrey were truly destroyed. And ultimately, both sides had already been using time travel to alter and revert battles throughout the entire war -- one last edit that would save potentially billions of innocent lives isn't worth the risk if they're not Gallifreyan lives?

My whole point being that it's a pretty blatant deus ex Whovia and that it totally ignores the broader moral dilemma that the War Doctor supposedly represented in the first place. If you have the power to save Gallifrey then aren't you equally bound to save the planets who were bystanders in the war to begin with? Oh nevermind all that, we'll handwave about ""altering the time stream"" and ignore all the dead that weren't explicitly mentioned because it sets up a handy ""let's retrieve Gallifrey"" timeline for the next Doctor. It's shoddy writing, and it does a disservice to what (since the '05 resurrection of the show) was a major philosophical issue for the Doctor. He was finally stuck in a Kobayashi Maru sort of no-win situation that being clever and acting silly couldn't get him out of; in the end, instead of examining that dilemma DotD just wrote it out, made everything okay by ignoring the larger implications of its own solution.

Using the Moment was the right move (until magically Clare and three Doctors can come up with a solution that all of Time Lord civilization couldn't) -- 11 and 12 said as much when they came back to activate it -- because without the Time Lords there would be no one left to stop the Daleks. So if activating the Moment was the necessary lesser of two evils then what obligation, if any, should the Doctor have had to try and undo the rest of the collateral damage of the war?

From [this](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending#zoomed-picture) article in the Guardian, UK government spending on JSA is £4.91bn. 

4% of £4.91bn is £196.4 million.

Not all of that will be saved by these changes, but it's hardly to be sniffed at. And that's just JSA. If you add up all other benefits, especially housing benefit, the number will be much higher.

The event last night was a Fathom event, those events are sponsored by NCM who run the pre-show in chains like Regal, AMC and Cinemark amongst others. The pre-show runs off a client computer (aka desktop) near the proper digital cinema projector. In many cases it has been integrated into running on the digital cinema system by means of a DVI cable run from the client to an input of the digital projector (which don't run Windows, but custom Linux distros). There was likely an issue with the pre-show content sent by NCM to have this come up at so many locations.
I happen to know that the Doctor Who content was an actual D-Cinema package as I held the HDD that they shipped in my hands last week, so it wasn't a streamed event.

Given that British territory has been waning for near enough a century. I don't think they ever particularly have done! Religion is waning massively too, with half of the country being completely irreligious. It's also the Tory party anthem, unsurprisingly.

Firstly, why do ""bounds"" have to be interpreted as territorial borders? Why not just take it as ambitions for the country to reach new frontiers? Secondly, why do we need to have a ridiculously politically correct anthem that offends no-one? The French national anthem has stuff about the joy of going into bloody battles and xenophobia in it. The idea that we should write-off a well-liked patriotic song because it has the word ""God"" in it is ridiculous.

&gt; Jerusalem is a beautiful song, but again due to its religious content is not relevant.

&gt; No.

This always makes me laugh. The whole damn *point* of the hymn is that the answer is no. Thus we need to build a new Jerusalem. It's also a famous English myth. Incidentally, did you know that St. George didn't really kill a dragon? I suppose the English should stop holding him up as a patriotic symbol too.

true,SeanOrange,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"After absorbing all of the information about this, and even disagreeing with the show runner (Moffat) about what's really going on, I have come to this conclusion:

Moffat wants to address the regeneration limit.  He wants to do it while he's still show runner, and he wants to do it without having to burn through two more actors.  He wants to be in control of this story point, because -- let's face it -- addressing this issue can make for a pretty good story, but also because he wants to throw off the shackles of a thought, an episode, a line that was never meant to be so restrictive because the show was never thought to outlive such a ridiculously high number.  It's the 50th anniversary, it seems like just as good of a time now as any to do it, and he wants to set the tone for ""the next 50 years"", which between now and then I'm sure all of the rules (such as they are or have ever been) will continue to evolve.

I think it's wrong and a bit selfish of him, but probably no more wrong or selfish than insisting it must be some other way.  Because we all know that for the show to go on this limit must be breached.  It's something we all agree must happen.  I'd rather not quibble about how or when or if the requisite number of actors playing the role has passed or not.  Capaldi is going to come in, we're all going to know that the Doctor is pretty much immortal now (and/or his regeneration process is just going to be extremely dangerous and uncertain every single time it comes up), and that will be that.

...

Okay, SMALL quibbles, then.

Let's Kill Hitler.  The Doctor is sure he's dying permanently.  We all think it's because of how traumatic the injury is, and that's possibly true.  It sure seemed like the Doctor was only worried about dying for that reason.  But it's also possible that he knew what was going on, and didn't want to cop to it, making River's sacrifice actually all the more important.  We see the Doctor cheat death like this so many times, it's probably just going to keep on happening.  But at the time it read like ""this is happening for reason A, and not reason B that no one has mentioned yet"", probably because it wasn't in Moffat's head (or any of the other writers' heads) that this was in fact his ""final"" incarnation.

The Doctor lies.  This is probably in Moffat's show bible somewhere.  It can conveniently explain away anything we've ever heard ever that's ""canon"" since the Doctor himself is the one who explains it.  A rather neat solution.  If something doesn't fit?  Well, the Doctor was just fibbing a little.  Or a lot.  Depends on how angrily the fans will react, I suppose.

In theory the government could do anything they like to the terms of existing loans because they're the government and they can change the law to it legal. However, I doubt that they will. Two other groups of mortgage-style loans were sold in the late 90s without changing the terms. If they wanted to implement the suggestions of that ""secret report"" then they should have already done it. The loan terms that came in with the higher fees are worse than those suggested by the report, and if they'd wanted to apply those terms to existing loans then that would have been the ideal time to do it. It would avoid running two systems in parallel and the media would be too busy with students complaining about the fees increase and burning Nick Clegg in effigy to notice some graduates complaining about their interest rates going up.

I haven't seen any suggestion that they've considered changing the level of repayments, just the interest rates so that the value of the loan doesn't get eroded by inflation while you're not repaying it. If you expect the loan to be written off before you pay it off, the interest rate is irrelevant anyway.

He doesn't have trust in his players like he used to. At the moment it seems like he only prefers the old guard and few others. Mikel and Lampard at the pivot was the worst combination a coach could select at Chelsea. How on earth can he play Mikel and Lampard at the pivot and say Mata can't play alongside Hazard and Oscar? If he thought Mikel and Lampard could work then there MUST be a chance that Mata can play with these other players. We saw how well they played before. Also Mazacar didn't work last time because he played Ramires and Lampard at the pivot. I remember posting my doubts before the Match. And hoping, if they ever fail he won't blame Mazacar combo only. But he did blame them. His obsession with the old guard will definitely cost us. After last night match, Jose admitted the players were tired! How can he say that? It really boils my brain that he will even admit that. Why play tired players in the first place. Look at your disposal, you have such a ""Big Squad"". What is the point of even keeping them on our team? For God sake, we defended for our lives against Basel! Yes, Basel of all teams. What can we really win with this line-up and the other line-ups he has been fielding lately? Can we even make it top 3 in EPL? And by the way, there is no such thing that Jose only plays players that are playing well. Lampard and Ivanovic have been awful this season and yet, they play almost every match. Luiz was crucified for his one big mistake. But, nothing is happening to this other defenders who are having lackluster performances in almost every other match. Our gaffer said he won't even point out fingers. And that he blames fatigue!

hardly an accurate analogy; everyone agrees cancer is bad, not everyone agrees religion is bad.

at the risk of being obtuse; suicide bombing is not a purely religious issue. People can blow themselves up for any number of non-religious reasons; suicide attacks are not new, nor exclusive to religion. 

now it's true that *muslim* suicide bombers who blow themselves up for 72 virgins *exclusively* (and not as part of some wider international political movement or cause) would be solved if religion was done away with. But that is one slither of a denomination of *one* religion...which would hardly be a valid reason to do away with Christianity for example.

If a Welsh person asks me where I'm from I say Cardiff.

The thing about English identity and culture is the ""British"" and ""English"" culture are almost synonymous with each other. As England conquered Wales, and essentially bought Scotland, the battle for those two countries has always been to retain their identity in the face of England attempting to force it's identity on it's ""lesser"" countries.

While some of this was deliberate (England banned speaking Welsh for example for a long time) most of it is natural. Seats of power were all in London, most the biggest cities were in London etc.

While the definition will always vary of what it means to be ""English"" most people if they were to write a list would see it equally applies to being ""British"". Whereas if I were to write down what it means to be Welsh or Scottish, you'd find much less in common with what it means to be British.

IMHO, Taulant Xhaka's (the Basel LB) superb touchline dribbling combined with Chelsea using Branislav Ivanovic as the first-option outlet for their attacking buildup was the primary reason for this unfortunate (and abysmal) positioning of the trio.

This allowed Voser and Salah to continue bombing via inside channels down Chelsea's left flank, as a result of which they were able to successfully exploit Mikel and Azpi's inability to hold the ball by simply putting constant pressure on the duo. 

Add to that, Lamps seemed to spend more time near the half-way line and in the final third rather than help Mikel out with defense. Obviously, he must have assumed that Ramires and Oscar would be more than capable - which, unfortunately, they were not.

Had to pay a month's rent in advance, a security deposit, a holding fee, and a fairly extortionate agency fee. The final cost was about £1100  up front to get the house. Which was a pain in the arse considering that I'd just finished undergrad and didn't really have that kind of money available right off the bat. Every agency was the same, I don't know if they just knew that everyone looking at studenty places around that time of year would be desperate or what (I hope so, fuck knows how the average undergrad affords to live round here on student loan if not), but I honestly think I had a better time with the shitty student letting agents I dealt with as an Undergrad than these prats.

Plus his team literally scored one million goals and won the hexaquadraduple. I guess he wanted a challenge to manage a shit team like Bayern after our owners and board (who r tots retarded btw) turned him away.

I think we would OF been playing a 4-6-0 false 9 if he would OF come here and it works great for me in FM and heck even Fifa so its tots the way to go. That way One Manuel Mata can play too and my sportsdirect shirt wont go to waste cuz of the Spanish connection bien tu?

Now I've been of the ropes for this hoze guy from the start n dont know what u guyz see in him. In all my years on my blue life ive never in 2 years seen this shit of a manager n think we could of kept rafa till we got Guardiola.

Hoze = 4 words
Crap = 4 words

It's also just a basic thing... you can get much nicer accommodation for similar prices in better locations. The only benefits of it are that it's near a (albeit not very interesting) shopping centre, has parking and there are a couple of nice restaurants at the shore. I'm guessing you won't be taking a car though so I wouldn't head there.

For a hen do I'd try and work out how many of you there are and see if you can find a very central apartment. A lot of them can be quite reasonably priced between 6-8 people. Anyway like I said I'll check with SO when I get home. You could probably get the others to cough up a share of the apartment for the full weekend even if they are only coming on the Saturday, as long as they know it's so the bride can be pampered :-) Just my opinion but all sharing an apartment is more fun than separate hotel rooms... although only you can decide what your friend would like best! Hotels in Edinburgh are expensive though...!

I organised a stag recently and I know the organization feeling... it can be hard to get people to help with organising, can be easier just to do it all yourself and then at least you/the bride is guaranteed a good time. I hassled other people to help for over a month and it just resulted in us not doing as much stuff in the end.

also consider how the first theist departed from atheism. according to your view, there would be no way for that first theist to come into being.

An apartment is something I never thought about either, as my plan was only really to deal with the bride, the other (chief) bridesmaid and then myself, so far the people who have said they'd be up for going have pretty much said they would pay their own way, but as of just now it's like 2 people that have said maybe. The other bridesmaid has asked people who all apparently want it to be in Glasgow but that's not what my friend wants so she said she doesn't want to change it for them. Although that could be an idea once I get a better reply from people! 

Yeah that's the way I'm looking at it, if I don't do it the other girl wont so I want to at least make an effort and get something arranged so she doesn't miss out on it.

He couldn't be less of a militarist. He was ardently against military intervention in Syria and Libya even spending money on advertisement against it. He would pull the troops out of the other countries they're in and has even said in a Jewish forum he's against bombing Iran. 

&gt;he's pro-monarchy

Most of the country is pro-monarchy. Is everyone far right wing? That's only one of his stances though, as I said you can't just say he's this or that. Like most people all his opinions aren't either left or right wing. 

&gt;pro-uninhibited private power

He's against quantitative easing, one of the things that benefits private power the most by giving private banks free money and fucking all the savers with low interest rates.

This is a guy who apposes the NSA/GCHQ spying &amp; is against the undemocratic centralisation of power under the EU with their wealth confiscations from the public. He advocates for more freedom than the other major parties.

The reason they don't have MP's is because our first past the post electoral system is so skewed against them. They represent the views of more people than the lib dems so they deserve at least as much coverage as them.

* I've read a few comments along the lines of ""Trust Jose, he has won us trophies before. He knows what he's doing."" But the same line of reasoning doesn't seem to be applicable to Juan's achievements. ""So what if he's won two PoTYs? He doesn't fit into Jose's tactics. Also, he isn't bigger than the club, you know?"" 

* Seeing Mata on the bench bugs me. However, what bugs me even more is people who claim he hasn't been up to scratch in the games he has featured in. Guess what? 
    * Mata has won all but two of the matches he has either started or subbed - 8W 1D 2L. Interestingly, he has played an average of 61 minutes per game for these 11 games.
    * That being said, he is yet to play a full 90' game in the PL and in the UCL. He has almost always been subbed off around the 60' mark, including both the matches he 'lost' - vs Newcastle and Everton. 
    * The only time he's played the whole 90 minutes? Both Capital One Cup games we've played so far - Swindon &amp; Arsenal. His average playing time drops to 54.55 min/game, if you leave out these two Capital One Cup games.

    ([Stats from WhoScored](http://www.whoscored.com/Players/25363/Fixtures/Juan-Mata))

* Yesterday's loss was scary because we never got a single shot off inside the Basel box. NEVER. With all the dribbling, passing, technical and creative skills of our 'world-class' players, we just couldn't make it past the Basel defensive line. Our best shot attempt (not even on target) was off a free-kick and even that didn't trouble the GK. Can you see how scary that is?

* Quite a few comments have been along the lines of, ""That's why Jose gets to manage Chelsea and you get to sit in your Mom's basement, typing away at a keyboard."" Uh, AVB never played football. Heck, he started out with unsolicited scout reports. But he still gets to manage a PL team*, doesn't he?

Good work

&gt;  before interest rates start to climb again around the end of 2014

Don't underestimate ours governments and banks willingness to go to great lengths to keep interest rates low.

&gt; How do you re-mortgage a house

You apply for a mortgage, similar to buying a new house.

&gt;  I’m assuming that if I I’ve paid off enough capital I can drop down to a lower loan-to-value and get a better rate on the remainder?

Yup!

&gt; If you change banks do you need to come up with an early repayment charge

It depends what it says in your T&amp;C for that particular product

&gt; Are re-mortgages based on the value of the property at purchase and the amount remaining to be paid off, or do they get worked out on the current value of the property?

If you move lender they will revalue it and you may pay a vaulation fee.


Who are you currently with? What is your current deal? What if the SVR you drop on to? What is your anticipated LTV? I may be able to help further.

It often involves contrived, artificial transactions that serve little or no commercial purpose other than to produce a tax advantage. It involves operating within the letter but not the spirit of the law.

&gt;Tax avoidance is not the same as legitimate tax planning. Legitimate tax planning involves using tax reliefs for the purpose for which they were intended. For example, claiming tax relief on capital investment, saving in a tax-exempt ISA or saving for retirement by making contributions to a pension scheme are all legitimate forms of tax planning.

Eriksen and Lamela are more mobile and more of an attacking thread so they are strikers.

Why is it disingenuous? It's accurate and is the position millions of atheists have held since forever. The only way I'd agree with you is that the quote you give doesn't go far enough: it is, in fact, ""atheism is simply the lack of belief in a god or gods"". ""God/Jehovah"" isn't the only god that atheists don't believe in, hence the (paraphrased) quote ""I contend we are both atheists: I just believe in one god fewer than you.""

&gt; agnostics are not atheists

If someone, anyone, answers the question ""Do you believe in a god or gods?"" with anything other than ""Yes"" then they are an atheist. That doesn't mean they love Dawkins, that doesn't mean they know who Christopher Hitches was, it doesn't mean they've ever even heard the word ""atheist"": it means that they do not believe in a god or gods.

I've been an atheist my entire life, and I have been an agnostic for the same length of time.

Alcohol ultimately can't be banned because it's the easiest 'drug' in the world to produce. Some yeast, something with sugar in it and a place to store the bottle is all you need. It makes growing cannabis look like rocket science. Lots of fruit are even kind enough to provide you with their own yeast.

Coffee? The effects are predictable and stable for the vast majority of people with small effect on blood pressure and short term hyperactivity being the worst side effects. Stuff like Green Tea is even beneficial to health.

Ultimately, no governments want another Tabacco situation where millions of people get addicted to a substance only for research to come out down the line proving it's causing horrible deaths.

Yes.  Those things happened because the GI went into the Doctor's timestream and started mucking things up, reversing the accomplishments the Doctor had over his life.

When Clara went into his timestream, she was able to ""undo"" the GI's interference which would have restored everything he had done, reversing the GI's damage.

The Doctor sent her the leaf to find her way, so the implication is that they both left the timestream and then Trenzalor.

In DotD, Eleven even made a comment when Clara met Ten that she should recognize him - I think the implication there is that Clara is no longer the impossible girl but back to her normal self, having left his timestream.

You can't get further right than monarchy by definition, so you tell me if everyone is far right. He also wants to give royalty more land/wealth, but I digress. Left wing:

* abolition of private property (note that doesn't mean the gov get's to own your shit),
* land re-distribution,
* abolition of rentier economics,
* anti-social hierarchies,
* worker ownership,
* international solidarity between the worker classes (rather than them being thrown over the top to be mowed down in No-Man's-Land),
* anti intellectual property,
* anti-corporatism,
* anti-military.

If you don't tick any of those boxes you aren't left wing.

true,Potato743,smith,Smith,"The war came between 8 and 9 and the Doctor used ""the moment"" to put the war into a time lock where it basically removed the war from existence, sort of like sticking it in a parallel universe where the war is constantly occurring at every point in time, with no way of entering or escaping it (with your sanity See: Dalek Caan).  The 8th Doctor lived during the Time War, but refused to fight in it to keep with his non-violence promise (the promise being that as long has he is called ""The Doctor"" he will never fight in wars or harm innocents).  When the Time War is in full force, galaxies are being destroyed every day and the Doctor decides ""enough is enough"" and he starts trying to save people from the war.  In the prequel to the 50th, The Night of the Doctor, he lands his TARDIS in a crashing ship of a refugee and upon realizing that he is a Time Lord, the pilot crashes her ship into a planet as opposed to escaping with him (which shows how evil the Time Lords have become).  The Doctor dies in the crash but is resurrected by an ancient order of mages who researched stolen Time Lord technology and created a set of potions that the Doctor can drink in order to regenerate into anything he wants.  The Doctor (who only has 3 minutes to live) gives up his promise to be the Doctor and regenerates into his 9th form, Jon Hurt (who is now known as the War Doctor).  The War Doctor declares that he is no longer the Doctor, and begins fighting in the war.  He fights for an undetermined amount of time (probably measured in decades) and eventually decides that the pain and suffering has to stop.  After the fall of Arcadia, he steals the Moment from the Time Vaults and takes it to a remote desert on Galifrey, where the events in the 50th take place.  At the end of the 50th, the three doctors re-write history by saving Galifrey by putting into one of the ""picture cubes""  Since Hurt and Tennant are ""out of order"" (ie their timelines crossed in a way they never should have) they forgot that the events of the 50th ever took place.  Hurt enters his TARDIS and, instead of regenerating during the war (like most people thought), he instead regenerated peacefully due to old age, and turned into the 9th Doctor (who, again, forgot what happened in the 50th and believed that he had killed all the Time Lords and believed that he had used the Moment).  Basically, Hurt is the 9th doctor, but isn't called the ninth doctor because every *thought* that he had broken his promise and used the moment when in reality he had saved all of Galifrey and never truly broke his promise to be the Doctor.  The official order of the Doctors is 1st Hartnell -&gt; 2nd Troughton -&gt; 3rd Pertwee -&gt; 4th T Baker -&gt; 5th Davison -&gt; 6th C Baker -&gt; 7th McCoy -&gt; 8th McGann (Time War begins during the 8th Doctor's life) -&gt; War Doctor/9th Hurt -&gt; 9th/10th Eccelston -&gt; 10th/11th Tennant -&gt; 11th/12th/13th (depending on whether or not you count Tennant channeling the regeneration energy into his hand as a full regeneration) Smith -&gt; 12th/13th/(14th) Future Doctor (Spoilers)

Human morality is extremely mutable, religion imposes a shape on that mutability. Of course religion is based in human emotion, but what specific human sentiments are culturally dominant has largely been driven by religion/ideology (I make no distinction between the two).

People have always ""persecuted"" those they perceive as different to themselves and will continue to do so with or without religion. I say all the bad things that secularists claim for religion are really natural human ideas and emotions that have nothing to do with divinity or faith but are a natural human condition.

The actions he took to do so occurred from that real time point on his own timeline, which is why he would have had no memory of it with his past selves until he caught up to that point on his timeline.

It's not weird. They need to know how much your income is in order to assess how much tax credits you're due. Was this letter your renewal? You need to fill one out every year as well as updating HMRC as and when any changes of circumstances (including income) happen through the tax year. Renewals are very important and as such there is months of advertising nationwide to tell people to do this before the deadline. You also get a second letter to remind you to complete your renewal if it's after a certain point and there's no response from you. 

&gt; i dont know why they couldnt just take it from my tax return in april.

Because the tax office doesn't know that you're in receipt of tax credits and won't send your information to the tax credit office randomly just in case. Also these systems may not have been updated yet and/or could not be assumed to contain all of your sources of income. You need to declare all your taxable earnings yourself, it's much quicker that way for them and you.

&gt; anyway the next letter i received from them appeared to suggest that i would not continue to receive credits but that the matter was resolved so i stopped working out my accounts.

The first bit sounds right as the reminder letter that your tax credits will stop if you don't get the information to them. Not sure about the second part, it could indicate a different type of letter but without seeing it then I couldn't advise. At the end of the day, your tax credits are your responsibility. If you receive a letter and don't understand if or what you have to do then you need to contact HMRC to ask as soon as possible to avoid any problems.

true,keeblerlorien,martha,Martha,"I agree with you.  While I understand OP's feeling that maybe retconning the fall of Gallifrey invalidates some of The Doctor's guilt, it may not quite be so.

Surely in some version of reality, The Doctor *did* use The Moment and commit genocide on his own people.  It had to have happened in one of the versions, in order for the memories to be there at all.  To my way of thinking, this version of events is the one we see playing out in Nine (Eccleston) and Ten's (Tennant) seasons.  And then later, when Eleven (Smith) comes back with Ten, they change it, and from then on, they *didn't* use The Moment, but only Eleven afterwards will remember it the new way.  

Basically, it has happened, but then it unhappened.  ""Time can be re-written!"", etc.

What makes me think this is after the Pandorica, when Eleven reboots the universe, Amy Pond says she can remember both realities.  She can remember life before when her parents were gone and there was a crack in her wall.  But she also can remember the new version of her life.  If I remember correctly, The Doctor says it's because as a time traveler, it has altered her perception and she can see both realities.  They both did, in fact, happen.  It's why she was in a unique position to bring back The Doctor even though he never existed.

To me, clearly The Doctor can see both realities.  Nine and Ten will only see the first version where they did kill all the Timelords, because that's the only truth for them.  It did happen.  But Eleven, after the events of Day of the Doctor, will see both realities, because both happened.

That's my theory anyway. ",0,1385576353,null,0,false,0,cdobdk9,t3_1rkgp1,t1_cdobdk9,t1_cdo732o,null,1428485817,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

When Rafa was Manager, I supported him the whole way (well, not the first few weeks, I was still pissed regarding Di Matteo, and still am but nothing I can do) - BUT he was making good decisions, even if he's a total dick.

I was brought up in London, but I no longer live there, so a Season Ticket is impossible for me, if you have that luxury, that's fantastic, many of us don't, and many of us don't have the timetable either.

If you watch Chelsea TV, Jason Cundy has been saying the exact same thing as me for many weeks, even the other week after the game against West Brom, there was a Season Ticker holder who rang in and complained about Mata not starting, and so did a Yank after him - I don't have an isolated opinion here.

But there's no way, regardless of who Jose is, I'm going to support his decision on Mata, not in a million years.

So call me a cunt, a troll, use the Season Ticker line over and over, it doesn't mean anything, because quite frankly, if you honestly think you are a bigger and better fan than me due to a Season Ticket, you are not - And for a start, a decent fan wouldn't call another a cunt on an opinion regarding the POTY for 2 seasons.",0,1385576746,null,0,1385595673,0,cdobk0d,t3_1rk3nm,t1_cdobk0d,t1_cdob9uh,null,1428485733,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

Never said I have a season ticket - I don't. I regularly attend matches, but don't have the luxury for that yet. Doesn't make me any more or less of a fan. Not going doesn't make you less of a fan, couldn't give any less of a shit, but don't preach you're still a true fan and you hate those remarks when you said exactly the same thing to someone else in another thread. Not having a go, why so defensive?

Criticising Jose is baffling however. If you feel his non inclusion of Mata is wrong (I disagree) that's fine. You will feel daft at the end of the season for it. It's strange to say I don't want to team to succeed though. Although you didn't say it outright you pretty much suggested it. Odd comment. I've never, and will never want us to lose. We all have differing thoughts on who should and shouldn't play, but I tend to not shove it down people's throats like you do, which is why I (and whoever downvotes you I assume) has a problem with you. Have a bit of tact. If you want to play a 4-1-4-1 formation that's fine, it's opinion. But don't act like Jose is wrong because he's not playing it, and you'd do a far better job as that is honestly how your posts come across.

There's some serious revisionist history going on here. If you only read this post, you would think we won all our matches with Benitez last season. Remember how we either lost or dropped points to Corinthians, Fulham, West Ham, QPR!!!, Reading, Southampton, Swansea and Newcastle?

Facht is, the only good thing Benitez did for us, is win the Europa Cup that we were heavy favourites for in the first place.

- only 4 points away from the leaders 
- most likely to win our group in CL
- beat Arsenal in League Cup

Not going into much detail (I have done so before regarding it), Pep has taken over Bayern and he's implemented a 4-1-4-1, it's working for them beautifully, and they have a very similar lineup to us. If it works for them (currently undefeated in a fairly strong Bundesliga), it can work for us. Man City have implented I think a 4-1-2-1-2 / 4-1-3-2, again, very similar players to what we have, and it works fantastic for them, even if they are low on the table - They play amazing attacking football.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Possibly. The report was admittedly just from a bank to the government saying what would be good for them. It just seems like if the government is so keen on short term money then it would make sense for them to try to make the deals as profitable as possible. Clearly the interests of the students themselves hasn't factored into their reasoning for several years so that wont stop them. In other words I wouldn't put it past them especially given they have started the process already. 

Secondly, I think the government said *they* would not increase interest rates but the Guardian article I linked shows that the infrastructure is there if they changed their minds:

&gt;Lifting the cap would also fly in the face of ministerial assurances that there would never be a retrospective change in terms. Speaking to a parliamentary select committee last June, universities minister David Willetts told MPs: **""In the letter that every student gets there are some words to the effect that governments reserve the right to change the terms of the loans. That is a text that has always been there for students**, but we have no plans to change the framework we have explained to the House of Commons.""

Although the government might not do it themselves (but we have to take their word on that which means very little) they may allow a company to do it. As I said all the loans have a term which allows the retrospective changing of interest rates so it would be possible. It may be improbable for the government to do themselves but I think it would be more probable if the interest rates made up a debt collecting company's profit margin; they might be less inclined to think of the interests of students and more likely to raise the rates.

It also depends on how much context you need. I think jumping right into season 5, which is the start of the Eleventh Doctor, new showrunner (Moffat, the guy who also does the amazingly excellent Sherlock), is a good thing to do. The only context that you really need is that The Doctor changes forms when he ""Dies"" and he'd just done that, and it borked up his spaceship (The TARDIS). If you want to see that progress, and some of the context in season 5, then here's what I'd recommend:

Blink (Season 3)

Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (Season 4)

The End of Time parts 1 &amp; 2 (Christmas special before season 5)

So that's about 4 hours of pre-season 5 viewing to give you good context as to what's happening. But, when you start digging down the context well, you'll keep adding episodes, so I say just start with season 5. When you eventually go back and watch the rest (And you will, loads of it is really good), it'll be even more rewarding (Especially Silence in the Library).

Terry Nation WAS the creator of the Daleks and had always owned the rights to them.  His estate still owns the rights, as he died many years ago.   Steve Martin specifically asked to have the Daleks in that scene because he is a huge Whovian.  One version states he made this a stipulation of his contract to be in the film. 

From here, there are two versions of what happened - in one, WB thought the Daleks' trademark had expired and were public domain, so they never asked anyone's permission.   In another, WB asks the BBC, who grant permission, but did not ask the Nation estate. 

In either version, the Nation estate was upset because they did not want the Daleks to become jokes and wished them to remain scary.   They had a similar issue with Daleks' light-hearted usage in a Kit-Kat commercial.  So the Nation estate was to the point of not wanting to offer  the rights to anyone.  It had nothing to do with the the Looney Tunes movie being ""terrible.""  It was because WB didn't ask permission AND they were used in a comedy fashion.

Per the story, Steve Martin did write a letter of apology (I don't think Steve Martin would ever plead) and after production had already started on the new Who show in 2005, the Nation estate relented and allowed the BBC to use them. If they had not been allowed to use the Daleks in series 1, the episode ""Dalek"" would have featured a new alien, the Toclafane, which was later re-purposed for use in series 3.

 - Head up with name and contact details. If you don't have a vaguely professional sounding email address, get one. Gmail is perfectly acceptable, xXxLegaliseTheHerbxXx@gmail.com is not. 
 - A ""Profile"" section gives a brief overview of the things you know about. It's also the ideal place to put the ""list of keywords"" that recruiters search for without it being too obvious that this is what they are and why they're there.
 - Recent achievements: A bulleted list of 3 or 4 things you've done. Ideally these want to be things that a prospective employer might see and think ""Hey, I could use someone who's got experience in these things"".
 - Personal Attributes: Whether you like it or not, a prospective employer doesn't just want someone who'll do the job. They want someone who'll fit in and become a valued part of the team. This is how you convince them you're that person.
 - Career Summary: This bit is a fairly traditional career summary. Don't feel you have to include every job you've ever had - your experience stacking shelves in Sainsbury's is unlikely to be very useful unless you're applying for a job in a supermarket.
 - Qualifications: Ignore traditional wisdom that says ""employers want to know what qualifications you have"". They don't, they want to know what they'll benefit from hiring you - and all the degrees in the world don't make you the sort of person who'll solve a problem they have. Oh, they might have some HR or policy reason to know, so you do need to tell them. But don't make a big thing of it.
 - Hobbies and Interests: You're not a 1-dimensional piece of paper, you're a person. But don't lie and put in something you don't really do - sod's law is your interviewer will have spent several years living with Sherpas in the Himalayas and will spot your lies about climbing Everest a mile off. (Says I, this bit's conspicuously missing from the current version of my CV!)
 - Aims and Ambitions: Are you looking for a job or a career? A lot of companies are very keen on promoting from within (hiring good staff is incredibly difficult; it's frequently much easier and safer to hire people at an entry level and promote from within) - if you're looking to move up in the world, you'll fit in great.

Yes, it probably is worth saying it (though I'm guessing you mean expect rather than intend). Don't make a big deal over it and waste space labouring the point though as they can always ensure the requirement of you getting those grades with the conditional offer.

&gt;Seeing as though I can only select 'pending' on my 'Education' section, will my universities offer me conditionals purely on my personal statement? My GCSE's aren't great either, so what is the path from there?

Yes, tbh as far as I could tell it was most important to apply in time. Other than that it's mainly upon personal statement (and possibly interview/supplementary test).

I was expected to get top grades across the board when I did my UCAS form. I was rejected by durham and accepted by cambridge. It seems to be a bit of a lottery.

Some good advice is to spread your applications across varying level of university to hedge your bets. Also, be sure to visit the campuses and the town/city beforehand. You're going to spend 3+ years there, you want to make sure you choose somewhere you're going to enjoy.

&gt;Payments being stopped after six months unless the claimant has a ""genuine"" chance of a job

&gt;New migrants not being able to claim housing benefit immediately

&gt;Deportation of those caught begging or sleeping rough, with no return within a year

Am I right in saying this is already the case under EU law? Your right to free movement in the EU without a job only lasts for 3 months (according to Directive 2004/38, Article 6) so if they don't find a job in 3 months they can be deported. They'll only be allowed to stay longer if they have a genuine chance of finding work (mirroring Cameron's words) and if they are actively looking. 

I'm working mostly from memory here but Cameron's words seem to be taken from European Court of Justice case law and he's just backing up the EU's position.

I believe that the Tesselecta also speaks about the poison, so it would seem that the knowledge of the poison is out there and is probably how the Silence found out.

As far as the Silence know, the Doctor just regenerates after he ""dies"" without any limits, so in their mind the only way to kill him is to stop the regeneration. So their way of killing him would also involve stopping that regeneration, therefore that's why he used this specific poison even though technically just straight up killing him would've worked as well.

- We are allowing criminals of all descriptions to exploit the UK's good name to help them break the law in other countries. Reputation is very important when it comes to border controls and the movement of goods, especially in the US where they don't fuck around

I'm sorry, but this is only getting a positive reaction because of who posted it. Mark Lawrenson, Garth Crooks, Phil McNulty and many other gobshites have been expousing this view for some time, with the obvious intention of sticking it back to the Chelsea fans who they don't particularly like and supporting Benitez, who they do. And now we are hearing it from an 'established' Chelsea fan. I don't know about your history personally other than that people here hold your opinion in high regard and that you like to refer to your high-flying lifestyle a lot, but this post would've been laughed off (quite rightly) if it was viewed objectively.

It's a lot easier to make this kind of point when everyone is reeling after a bad performance and result, in the same way you can pretty much convince people that everything is fine after one good result (see the overreaction to us beating a truly dismal West Ham on the weekend). How can you possibly judge Mourinho's second reign at this stage? Because whilst you say it's 'too early' to, that's is what you are doing. You are saying that we should now realise how well Benitez did in the context of what Mourinho is now doing, ie. not being a success. Surely this can only be accurately reflected on come May? And would you really bet against us picking up a trophy by that time?

And what was the other option? To keep Benitez? That is just not palatable to most of the Chelsea support, myself included. But to keep him would also have meant not getting Jose back, surely you agree that is something we have needed/ yearned for as a club since pretty much the day he left?

I am as baffled and saddened as anyone that Mata isn't playing (and I said so from the beginning of the season, and people shouted me down because he was just 'being rested / recovering from injury'). I also think Hazard is suffering under the Mourinho straight-jacket, as is David Luiz (but I'm not sure your comparison between him and Gerrard is valid). These things are a shame, but my faith in Mourinho remains as strong as before. 

If we mount something representing a title challenge this season (which we look like we will and which Benitez emphatically failed to do) then I can stomach David Luiz and Mata not playing as much as before, difficult as it is to take.

But at the end of the day I'd take Jose over anyone else, and I'd still take anyone else over Benitez. Frankly, I'd be a bit embarrassed if fans of other teams see this, Chelsea fans crying over Benitez because Mourinho isn't running away with the league this time?

Now, I'm not English, but I've been following Chelsea since 1996, and it's becoming increasingly clear to me that in his first tenure, Mou has benefited greatly from the foundation Claudio Ranieri set up here before his arrival.  Ranieri toughened the squad up with his rotational policies and the undeserving loss to Monaco cured the steel that was being forged.  When Mou arrived, the team was READY to win.

However, since then, I think Mou's dalliances in Italy and Spain have given him a bit overly arrogant about his own abilities.  Instead of building on the foundation that Rafa built here, he tried to reimplement everything from scratch and is now being predictably found out.

On the other hand, Rafa has clearly gotten a rotten deal.  At the end of the day, supporters were biased against him from day one, all because of comments that offended our supporter pride.  But it might be worthwhile to consider that such notions are old fashioned and overrated.  If we're to be a modern club that competes for all trophies, we must be more open minded to all kinds of supporters - they're the ones filling our coffers by buying shirts and merchandise.  And most overseas supporters don't want to see some petty grudges from the 90's get in a way of us having true masterclass managers and players.  Supporters need to be adaptable to times.  And honestly, why even put so much focus on Rafa's tenure at Liverpool and what he said there, when it's pretty clear that Liverpool are not much of a rival for us anymore -it's the Manchester clubs and Barcelonas and Bayerns of the world, that's who we're competing against for trophies!

I've been struggling with those thoughts for a while, but your post has finally got me over the line.  The thing that I regret the most about this however, is the virulent anti-Rafa atmosphere that I facilitated in the Chicago Blues, the supporter group I'm in charge of.  I now have to seriously consider whether I can even continue serving as the head of the group.

No, I'm right. There is going to be a new application process. There has to be. Scotland cannot inherit an EU membership because it doesn't have the sovereignty to do it. When it does - it's a new country and thus has to begin the process as a new country.

What we're arguing about is SPEED not whether it's a new process or not. Speed of accession is going to be determined by the natural rate of the process , the political will to move the process forward and the difficulty of meeting ACQUIS terms. 

The natural speed of meeting ACQUIS is going to be about 4 years. Which is the quickest any country has managed accession under the new EU framework (not the old EEC one). 

What you and your nationalist chums seem to be doing is taking it as read as that there is lots of political good will that entails smooth transition either at an accelerated rate or without any impediment because of good political weather. 

So the EU is going to shove Scotland into the fast track, ignore all the the other countries who are still sitting around in Acquis limbo like Turkey, hack off a still substantial EU member ( the UK) , make the current Spanish gov very nervous and possibly get Belgians all het up.

Now, I've been pointing out that the political will is not really there because of other factors within the EU that the Scots cannot control. For various reasons its going to be a process that's going to take time. Painting it as some sort of trouble free passage with no issues whatsoever that won't have geo-strategic issues for the EU is mindless and frankly irresponsible for politicians to be doing - especially when the legitimacy for the new soveriegn state might only be gained by  3% majority.  

Thus the amount of toe + finger crossing going on is frankly a bit dubious.

I remember reading the acts the government passed to buy Northern Rock's shares - UK company law has various provision to stop someone who is not formally part of a company from pulling the strings behind the scenes and controlling the company without being subject to the normal rules and controls for company directors. When the government took those shares they just exempted themselves from all those provisions.

We want to tell someone about something we've experienced, and the need to tell people is in direct proportion to the enormity of the experience.

When someone has been brought up in a very religious background, there's a chance that when they leave home, they're going to experience a great many new things. New ways of thinking might be introduced to them that make them question everything they've been taught by their parents and mentors. In the case of religion, this revelation is both stunningly emancipating and deeply distressing. Did  their family lie to them all those years whilst simultaneously taking away their childhood by denying them all the usual things considered fun? If they did, then there's a very good chance someone in that situation is going to be angry about it, considering their mind now accepts everything they were once taught to be a lie.

I've spoken with so many ex-fundies before now, and they all went through something akin to the five stages of grief after their conversion.

true,teachbirds2fly,null,null,"&gt; Now they can get a job in Tesco, despite being massively overqualified, and I'm sure I read that about half of recent graduates ARE in entry level work.

Overqualified...How does a degree in English Literature or Media Studies or Sociology make you over qualified? How does it even make you qualified to do anything?

&gt;Where's the jobs for non graduates now? They sure as hell can't do the jobs the graduates should be getting.

What jobs? If I need a essay critically analyzing the poem Beowulf from a neo-marxist perceptive I'll hire a grad. 

&gt;Someone on JSA for a year then getting a decent waged job saves us SO much more money than someone being on JSA for a week then taking the first job in Poundland.

And how is that fair? I don't want my taxes being spent so a graduate can laze about JSA for a year when they had the opportunity to work. Also JSA isn't a lot so to be honest you would need other benefits to live as well, this comparison is doubtful. The longer someone is out of work or not doing anything the harder their chances will be to find work. 

A ""decent"" job comes up who is the employer going to prefer the man who has a year of doing nothing on his CV or the man who worked at Poundland and is aspiring to better things? 

&gt;while it might take a little longer to get a DECENT job as a graduate

No I can tell you right now the longer you go jobless with gaps in CV the harder it will be to find anywork even at Poundland.

As I said before employers don't like gaps a job at Poundland on the CV is better than a gap. 

Graduates have an unrealisitc view of the working world... what skills and experience out with your degree can they offer an employer? That's what employers care about. 

I worked all through my degree and after, every job I saw as a stepping stone, I did them all and I moved on eventually getting on a Graduate Scheme. And I'll say this I had good sounding Policy based jobs on my CV.. but when it came to the interviews and assessment center for the grad scheme it was all customer service focused, the examples I gave all came from work in shops and call centers, it came from jobs that my uni friends had scoffed at and would honestly turn their noses down at doing.

I graduated a number of years ago now and have been fortunate in employment but I wouldn't consider myself lucky. Everyday I see graduates on my facebook feed who are unemployable because they have always held out for that ""decent"" job. The shit jobs are stepping stones to that ""decent"" job.

The reaction to this was almost universally that people didn't really mind if they had radiation poisoning because they would be dead already (despite how little contact they had and the fact they didn't have any symptoms which suggested a life threatening illness) and consequently barely anyone actually went through on it.

This was exceptionally confusing for the people investigating, as they had spend the day wondering how they would contain the panic and worry and it turned out there was barely any.

I like this because it shows that bitcoins don't really *go* anywhere (they're all just numbers next to public keys on the blockchain which in turn is just a text file on everyone's computers) but private keys, the 'key' in the analogy is also a file that is stored on your computer, but only on the computer of the owner.

You cannot prove that through; that is an assumption, and show no signs of being in a position to have any kind of advanced knowledge on the matter.

Why on earth would the UK be so stupid to leave the EU purely because Scotland might join, ruining it's trading relationships right across Europe? It makes no sense.

 - Your CV isn't there to get you a job. It's there to get you an interview. Don't expect anything more of it.
 - It is perfectly normal that you will send out a lot more CVs than you get interviews, and you'll do more interviews than you get job offers. Try not to let it get you down. (If you find a way to not let it get you down, let me know).
 - If you've sent out a hundred CVs and had not so much as a call back - you're doing something wrong. Try changing your tactics.
 - Don't be afraid to send speculative applications. At any given point in time, lots of managers are thinking to themselves ""I could really use another hand on deck"". Surprisingly few ever get around to putting the wheels in motion to hire someone.
 - **Every** application you send should be customised to the job you're applying for - and I don't just mean the cover letter/email. Your CV should also be customised. You don't have to rewrite the whole thing every time, but taking 5-10 minutes to tweak the profile, achievements and attributes is almost always time well spent.
 - While we're on the subject of cover emails, you should always take time to put in a paragraph about how ""I understand your company does X. This is something I'm particularly interested in"". **NEVER** write a two-line ""I'm applying for a job, please find CV attached"" email.
  - Don't know what the company does? Then you have no business applying for a job in the first place. Find out, then apply, not the other way around.
 - Some people still advocate a scattergun approach - send out as many CVs as possible. I disagree. If it's a choice between sending out 10-15 carefully-crafted emails and tweaked CVs in a week or 100 identical CVs with two-line emails, send 10-15. 
   - Right now, it's an employer's market. But even in a poor market, an employer may get 30 or 40 applications and of those, 20 will be obvious scattergun approaches, 15 moderate applications and 1-5 really good applications (and believe me, scattergunned approaches are obvious when you've got 40 applications in front of you).

This comment is a bit longer than I intended, but I'm trying to explain it in one go.

My question to you, to which I'd be looking a yes/no answer (though I'm not sure you'd answer it like that ;)), would be: do you believe that *any* god or gods - a higher power of some kind - exists?

If you answer ""yes"", then you believe in a god or gods and are, by definition, not an atheist (you are a theist, in fact). Conversely if you answer ""no"", or actually if you answer *anything* but a definitive ""yes"", then you are not a theist - you do not believe in a deity or deities. Consequently, you fall into the definition of ""atheist"".

That's it. Organised religion gods, personal gods or otherwise - it all comes under the same banner.

You're an agnostic. So am I. So are the majority of the population I'd warrant. I am not convinced by any theistic claims, or supposed evidence, and so I don't believe that any posited god exists. Nor do I see any reason to make one up of my own. However, I am of the opinion that I can't know for absolute certain that a god does or does not exists at the present time. Of course there are other things that this might be true for: any number of supernatural animals or spirits or beings. I'm 'agnostic' with respect to those too. It goes without saying that that doesn't mean all those things have an equal chance of existing or not.

&gt; Whereas atheism is the opinion that there definitely is no God, of any kind, never has been and never will be.

I chatted elsewhere in the thread regarding the two definitions of atheism: strong and weak. 

You're going for the 'strong' version there (with a couple of added bits - ""never has been and never will be"" - that might be considered redundant when it comes to a supernatural being!): ""I believe there is no god"". This is effectively trying to prove a negative, and very few people make this claim.

The 'weak' atheist definition is: ""I do not believe there is a god."" It's a subtle but important difference,.

&gt; so I'm open to the possibility.

I'd posit that so are the vast majority of atheists. In fact I'd put money on it. Atheism isn't a defiant position, but a reaction to a claim. If no religious people made the claim, then there'd be nothing to respond to in the first place.
