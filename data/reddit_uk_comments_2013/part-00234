Because a metallic blue estate car is extraordinarily difficult to see during the daytime.

The insurance companies dicked around for months. They gave completely inadequate courtesy cars that had to be returned (a three-door Alfa Romeo really is not an adequate substitute for a Peugeot 406 estate). They eventually decided they had to write the whole car off because there was no way to repair it. Even though it was relatively new (three years old maybe).

The other party's insurance company contested the cost of the assessment done that determined the result of the write off (they had sought a second opinion, because if they hadn't, they would have been challenged on writing a car off in these circumstances—rock and a hard place). This went to court. My mother had to testify in court proceedings because *some other stupid fucker* drove into her parked car because they weren't looking.

My mum had to waste weeks and weeks talking to solicitors and insurance people because of this. Remember those Michael Winner ads? You know—you have a little accident, you call the number and it all magically gets sorted by the nice insurance company? That's some grade A bullshit right there.

And as for dissenters, I don't know. The treatment you are thinking of is more the Stalinist approach to Socialism. I think what I am going to say next ties in with this and it is the reason why we will never see Communism apart from maybe in a few small communes or communities from time to time.

The problem is people, we see and we want what others have. We have grown up for hundreds of years wanting more and more things. And it has gotten worse. No one needs a new idevice every time a new one comes out but we see the queues every time a new one comes out. In a utopian Communist world we would be past this. So why would people dissent? If they have everything they need, they have freedom to learn and work in what they want. They have a place to live, freedom to travel and do what they want. Food is there and everyone is pulling together for the good of people.
I think we can say the majority of the world runs on a Capitalist system, this is why people want to make a buck. I argue if the majority of the world was Communist then it wouldn't happen. 

Why has no revolution ended in a Communist regime, again I would say that people are not ready for it. Most of the world is Capitalist, even the countries that are called Communist run more of a Capitalist system with Socialist bent. Like China.

I'm glad that within the NHS its already a policy in place, like it was in my school. Like I say though, some people apparently do have reasonable suspicion or pretty much knowledge - but for whatever reason do not report it to either the police or their higher ups.

There should be a clear policy for every organisation working with vulnerable people of what to do in cases of suspicion of abuse. Notes should be kept and filed, even if nothing is progressed at that stage.

As is, some organisations do have policies in place - some leave it completely to discretion. And evidently based upon the people I have spoken to personally, and also the claims that have come out today nationally, it is not uncommon for that discretion to believe 'I'll say something if it gets worse'. Bystander effect or something.

I dont think the law needs to criminalise it, we just need to make it black and white that if you suspect something - you report it.

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"Well then by your own admission, ""Utopian communism"" is a pipe dream. The word Utopia itself is derived from ancient greek, meaning ""Nowhere"". What i am getting at is that a Utopia is a very human idea, and is fundamentally unachievable.

What worries me is that you seem to think this is a viable model for our society to move towards! Skipping over the fact that the UK simply cannot support its population with our amount of agrarian land. We couldn't even support the 45 million we had in 1945, and that's WITH imports from America and Canada. 

You talk about ""In a utopian communist world"" but offer no ideas on how to get there. You talk about revolution as the beginning of the process, but throughout history and the world we have seen revolution to bring disastrous power vacuums, political factionalism, anarchy, and bloody civil wars. In fact, the only revolution to end in the creation of a feasible nation state is the American one, and even then that was for reasons of capital alone. They didn't want to be taxed!

&gt;So why would people dissent?

This is the crux of the matter. People would dissent because they want more from life. They dont want to be told that somebody else knows best, that they are provided for. People want meaningful relationships with others, they want to influence and change the world around them. can you imagine anything more terrifying than a world where we were not allowed to do that?

There is no accounting for human nature. I myself, purely on principle, would never subscribe to such a totalitarian system (and it *is* totalitarian) like you describe. What would you do? How would I be dealt with?

How would you stop people from doing the bare minimum? How could you support your growing population, with an economy which does not allow growth? How would you deal with the rampant, plague-like onset of depression? with no personal achievement, no dissenting opinions allowed, what would be the point of living?

&gt;Why has no revolution ended in a Communist regime, again I would say that people are not ready for it. 

I would say humanity will not be ready for anything like you describe until we live in a sci-fi, futuristic post scarcity environment, in which the stoical collective is the only thing keeping people sane.

Ultimately, people want choice. They want the choice to be an artist, or a financier, or a scholar, or a nurse. These choices would be cruelly curtailed under a communist regime. People would have to slave away to stay alive, with the choices of agrarian worker, industrial worker, overseer, bureaucrat and perhaps a few others.

How would you stop a Stalinist hierarchy from developing? After all, a study of Stalins rise to power shows us that even the most well meaning of revolutionaries are co-opted, manipulated, and ultimately eliminated by evil men.

Where private enterprise was illegal, how could you regulate it? I in the past have seen you advocating the legalisation of all drugs, but surely the outlaw of private enterprise is in direct contravention with that idea?

This is becoming quite an essay, so I'll leave it there until I hear a reply. But know that I could go on and on, citing reason after reason, question after question to be leveled at your brand of communism.

One thing people seem to overlook is to play that killer pass against good defenses you need to play it just before the striker makes his run. Timing is everything.

You play the ball to early and the striker can't get to it in time. If you play the pass in reaction to his run, the defenders are also reacting to that run and more often than not will cut out the pass.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"You know, I've been pretty adamant about Coutinho through the middle in this formation but I'm really re-thinking that now.  Sturridge and Suarez should be playing as close together as possible.  Run Suarez in the hole behind Sturridge and Coutinho to the left.  Coutinho and Suarez are smart enough to swap around and interchange frequently so neither will be strictly confined to their role.  Coutinho will make things happen no matter where he is on the pitch and Suarez is the best player in the league.  Keep SAS together.  I seriously think we will miss having Suarez playing close to Sturridge more than what we'll gain by having Coutinho play through the middle at this point.

That said, I hope the 3-5-2 thing comes to an end now.  Arsenal really exposed our deficiencies in that formation (namely our weak midfield... although Arsenal has the best midfield in the league except maaaaaybe City because Yaya is such an absolute beast) and we did much better after we switched to 4 at the back in the second half although even then Arsenal really shredded us on the break a couple of times and we were lucky that Ozil and Giroud couldn't finish.  The 3-5-2 never really looked particularly impressive except agaisnt West Brom and while we played very well that match (3 of those goals are easy candidates for goal of the week, possibly goal of the month) West Brom made it easy for us and we really came undone once we met strong opposition in Arsenal.  It's nice to have the 3-5-2 as something to use when we've got injury problems and we're against a lower table side, but I don't think it'll work against the top clubs.  If we had vastly different personnel in the midfield (ie 2 powerful, fast, and explosive defensive midfielders like Vidal and Pogba for Juve) then maybe, but we don't.  As it is our midfield is the weakest link in the team defensively and to expect them to help defend the wider areas is asking too much, Lucas and Gerrard are not the kind of energetic and athletic players who can run like that.

You can call it an overreaction or whatever but we were seriously outperformed.  I don't think it was down to us having a bad game per say so much as Arsenal just being better than us and really finding the weaknesses in our team and formation.  We looked bad because we couldn't keep up with their midfield and that meant we couldn't get our forwards reasonable service, so they ended up frustrated and stifled.  

Oh and Cissokho is just awful.  I don't want to pick on an individual player but he's just shockingly bad to the point where I'm scared to death every time we have to defend or attack down the left.  I remember when he was a monster for Porto a few seasons ago, what the hell happened to him?  I was so relieved when BR hooked him at the half.  People are saying the first goal was bad marking and bad recovering from the midfield and that's true, Arsenal never should have had a free man in the area.  But Cissokho is the reason the whole move happened.  Sagna ran right around him while he was staring at the ball jogging and didn't notice.  He was completely unaware of anything and didn't even notice until Sagna already got beyond him and had the ball.  Absolutely shocking defending and awareness.  Sagna absolutely never should have been in behind our wing back so simply and with so much space to make a calm, measured cross like that.  Cissokho may as well have not even been on the pitch.  Enrique needs to hurry the fuck up and return to fitness.

We need midfield reinforcements in January big time.  I hope we get them.  If we can sign 1-2 wonderful midfielders (a defensive one and an attacking player) as well as a backup LB who isn't completely uselses then we're going to be an incredibly potent side.   At the moment we're so very close to something spectacular, I think we're 2-3 signings away from busting through the door and back into the champion's league.  We can perhaps do it this season even with no bolstering the midfield and I'll be pulling for us until the final whistle but it'll take a bit more luck than I'd like to count on.",0,1383598946,null,0,false,0,cd6qiuo,t3_1pvr7u,t1_cd6qiuo,t1_cd6khyi,null,1428791344,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

Follow that path until you get to a kissing get on the right hand side (~200meters down the path). Go through the kissing gate, the path should make a sharp left a few meters after going through the gate. This path is made from the stones you get on a train track... this is because you should be walking parallel to the [railway](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/preview?authuser=0#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d456!2d-2.5787762!3d51.4720047!2m1!1e3&amp;fid=7) on your right (you might not be able to see the track for the first 50 meters of the path due to a fence with plants on it). Follow that path for about 300 meters (steep drop down to the left of the path) until you get to a fork in the path. At this point bare right and follow that up some wide steps and the rail way should be down to your right. Go up as high as you can on that grassy mound and at the top is a bench with metal animals welded onto it. That's a pretty good view. And that area is known locally as 'The Tumps'.

&gt; (But, as a different redditor below failed to realize, buying all of those before traveling here would have been really difficult, expensive and a waste of essential luggage space)

If you care to reread my comment, you'll note that I do not suggest or imply you should've brought cold-weather items with you. That would indeed have been stupid. What I was implying was your complete and utter lack of common sense or logical reasoning. You require certain common, readily available and easily acquired items. Instead of going to the shops (lord knows our good city isn't lacking those!) like any other sane person, you instead run to the internet and expect us to furnish you with answers. 

Oh and FYI, we also have Amazon.co.uk on this side of the pond. I know its all weird and scary with that .co.uk at the end and all those '£' signs, but believe it or not, it works in the exact same way that Amazon.com does. Its like a global marketplace or something. So that takes care of ""affordable"" now, doesn't it?

While I'm on a roll,

1. if you're in student accommodation, contact student services.  
2. if you're renting (privately or through a letting agent), contact your landlord.  
3. if you own the property, call the fucking plumber.

Wow, that's a great argument.

Let's be honest. It doesn't matter what race/sexuality/gender the Doctor happens to end up as. If they can find a good actor/actress to play the part, then hire them. Don't hire a woman just because she's a woman. That's just as bad as hiring a man, so you don't have to hire a woman.

You can argue that having a female Doctor gives a strong leading role for women, but does gender make a difference?

You can say that it's sexist/racist/homophobic to not have a female/ethnic/gay Doctor. To argue, gender makes no difference if the actor/actress is good. Ethnicity makes *literally* no difference. The Doctor isn't gay, nor is he straight.

I never liked the 3-5-2 in the first place and we've been pulling results from not so good teams. We were outplayed by Arsenal and never really expected a win from them, hoped for a draw at most. I know what BR was saying at the beginning of the season was true, about how our performance needs to improve despite our results. We're not a Champions League side yet, which Arsenal is and that game showed a dose of reality. We're getting there, just not yet.

Also about Cissokho, he was complete shit. The few minutes he played before his injury was actually impressive to me, but I'd rather play Agger there. I didn't know he played for Porto, only remember him being nice for Lyon. Cissokho is at fault for the goal but we've got an injury problem, not much you can do about it. I don't see why we need a new LB when we've got Jack Robinson who's England's U21 LB (behind Shaw) and is having a very successful loan period, when Cissokho is probably better than him right now.

Notable mentions go to;

Ibe was brilliant to watch. My motm anyway. I'm guessing Inglethorp told him to run with the ball because every time he got it he tried to beat his man (and usually succeded). Assisted all our goals and buried one off the post too.
I like the way he was switched to the left wing too when McLaughlin came on. He looked just as comfortable there and it appears he's being developed so he can play both wings which is good to see.

McLaughlin, anyone know why he didn't start? He looked good in his short cameo. Played RW rather than RWB. He didn't get on the ball a lot though but when he did he looked dangerous. He should have had an assist but Rossiter skied it.

Even so, Rossiter still had a really good game... again. Hes just so consistant and already appears to have such a maturity to his game. Hard to believe he's still so young.

Texiera was very good again and took his goal well. High hopes for him. Our 21's seem to have all the midfield dexterity our senior squad lacks. I'd hope himself and Rossiter will be good enough for the senior squad in 2-3 years time. 

As mentioned on here already Ilori is just too good for this level. I know it's a lot of players but I'd like to see himself, Tex, McLaughlin and 1 of either Ibe or Sterling loaned out as I their progress will stall playing U21s imo.

Gallifrey has played it's role. Doctor Who already has a bad habit of comic-book proportions of saying things are gone forever only to bring them back from the dead. 

Let's face it: The show often lacks conviction when it comes to killing stuff off. The loss of Gallifrey and the Time Lords have, so far, been the only guns that it's ever truly stuck to. It would be completely spineless to suddenly cave and go ""You know that horrifying guilt that the Doctor's been carrying around ever since New Who started? You know, the single most important event in his entire life? Yeah, now we're going to just *go ahead an undo that*"".

I mean seriously, how creatively bankrupt do you have to be to resort to bringing back Gallifrey? We've brought back the Daleks, the Cybermen, the Master, even the goddamn Great Intelligence.

Alex Inglethorpe has been playing Brad Smith and Ryan Mclaughlin (both fullbacks) on several occasions as attacking wingers (game against Tottenham last month and surely during training sessions) which shows us how important attacking and creative fullbacks are to Rodgers philosophy. This might also explain why we struggled against Arsenal because both our regular fullbacks were missing and the replacements were not good enough.

This also explain why we are playing with 3 at the back: with this formation our wingbacks are more freed up from their defensive duties and can contribute more to the attack. HOWEVER playing classical fullbacks such as Flanagan and Cissokho as wingbacks (just like against Arsenal) makes little sense since they are not really used to it. I'd much rather see Sterling and Henderson at right- and left wingback. Both are hard workers and can contribute more to the attack than both Flanagan and Cissokho. Henderson is not the ideal candidate for left wingback but certainly offers more than Cissokho by what we have seen. 

But yea, it is important to realize that fullbacks, and not wingbacks, are an important piece in Rodgers tactical philosophy and that the work for future success in these areas is already being laid in the academy which is very nice to see. 
We should also realize that while Suarez is a worldclass player, he may not be able to carry us all the time. The other players have to play their part. 
And the sooner we stop with the 3-5-2 formation, the better since the midfield is just overrun against opponents that are pressing. 

And I would also like to mention that we would do very well to finish in the top 4 this year because right now, even after our great start, the quality is not sufficient. Chelsea is getting more and more accustomed to Mourinho and so are the Manchester clubs (to their respective managers). 

EDIT: One last thing: The reason why Agger is not playing right now is because his form isn't great and has been declining since the start of the second half of last season. For those doubting this, rewatch the 1-0 against Manchester this season where he made a lot of panic clearances which fell right to the opposition's feet and the resulting shots could just as well landed in the back of the net instead of being blocked. 
Right now Skrtel and Sakho are both superior. 
For those who don't believe that Agger is not in the best form I have the following explanation: Sakho is our best defender and is leftfooted. Agger is also leftfooted. Rodgers doesn't want to play 2 leftfooted central defenders, especially if we would play with 4 at the back instead of 3. Right now, Toure offers more leadership and experience.",0,1383602694,null,0,1383603077,0,cd6s7y2,t3_1pwj0w,t1_cd6s7y2,t3_1pwj0w,null,1428790552,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

I don't know if it just not having enough playing time with one another or what, but we need to start having better moves along the back line or good diagonals in order to make the opposing defense work some.

On another note, I think this is why having Siggy in there is a good thing.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"&gt;Extending on what you said, no matter what formation we play, our attacking players will always be fluid and switch positions. So playing 2 up front wouldn't be much different to playing Sturridge up front with Suarez out wide

While I agree that Suarez and Sturridge are tactically adept enough to move around fluidly, there are differences. The first is that Suarez will be more confined to staying in either the middle or the side he's played on. Right now him and Sturridge can wander wherever they please in attack, and with Suarez wide if he wants to drift to the other flank he will have to swap wings with our other wide player, which adds a lot of complications and coordination. 

The second big change is our shape without the ball. In the 2 striker formation we've been playing, Suarez and Sturridge are both free to always be looking for attacking positions, without having to track back much, this is what gives us that edge on quick counter attacks. In a 4-2-3-1, Suarez will have to stick to the opposition fullback whenever we lose the ball as failing to do this risks giving the opposition chances via a 2v1 overload on that flank (see Ronaldo vs DiMaria at Madrid). While adding defensive responsibilities to Suarez it also limits his forward positioning, and so will take him out of play for the fast breaks previously mentioned. 

To be clear I'm not trying to invalidate your opinion or even advocate one formation over another, but I've seen a fair amount of similar comments around and wanted to add some information.

As for Matt Smith I am not really a big fan(This isn't Matt's fault). I think there are multiple factors (one being the lack of consequence as you mentioned) also the fact that no one ever really seems to be taken aback by what is happening around them.

true,widgetas,null,null,"Hellos lockdownuk. First of all: I am not an expert, your mileage may vary, I don't know the ins and outs of your situation yadada. I only offer what ""I would do"" if I were in your situation as presented (and having been your age with my own experiences).

The first thing I note is that you don't explicitly make an allocation for savings of any kind. Again, this is my personal feeling as I like to have something kept back for emergencies/rainy day/'that uber plan'. It could be that it's contained within the £450, of course, but I think it's something worth considering and factoring in from the get go. Others may disagree and so I recommend you weigh up the pros and cons presented. Getting into the habit of saving is (I'm told) not to be overrated. Then again, as you're living at home and paying ""very little in terms of housekeeping"" then I assume you have a sum left over at the end of the month already? If so, would you want to lose that saving, or that outgoing if you're spending it on stuff you enjoy?

However, the main thing I would note is that you're looking for a place on your own, which can be quite expensive at any stage of life/career. Sharing can be hit and miss, but have you considered it? You'd be welcomed into a 'professional' house-share rather than a student place, but depending on where you are in the world I would say your rent and utilities will be significantly less than what you'd expect to pay alone. Even if you're only sharing with one other person (so long as they're not a energy burning muppet), you'd still save on various outgoings (except perhaps council tax?).

So that's my main advice for things to consider: savings and sharing.

As to your last question: Who can say but you? It would depend on your motivations for moving. Personally I got out as soon as I could because I simply couldn't stand living under the 'rental roof any longer. Simply outgrown the nest, rather than them being horrible, you understand. Meanwhile some of my friends stayed at home (even now, 10 years later) and saved a crap ton of cash. Swings &amp; roundabouts.

Now that's a deficit, but the entire UK runs a deficit so you need to compare the deficits. I'm not going to trawl up the figures but it's obvious that, given that Scotland pays more of the tax than the spending it's deficit is lower. As the debt accrues at the same rate regardless of which side of the border - centralised national debt to be divided equally on a population basis - that means Scotland is, in effect, subsidising rUK.

You go on about how your B Team is better than the league leaders, yet go on to see your ""A"" team lose to Newcastle and then gob off about other fans being deluded pricks. 

It's fucking rich mate. 

&gt;You have the most fickle fan base of any football club and you are a shining example of it.

The fact that a supporter of one of the most artificially successful clubs in history, a team that has literally bought success at the highest price as if having access to limitless amounts of wealth is some form of achievement, a team that can buy almost any player in the world at any time, and that has attracted literally millions of the most glory-hunting, bandwagoning plastic cunts ever seen, can call *Arsenal* supporters fickle is beyond belief.

true,atlwantsmls,num11,,"According to AVB, Lloris did not remember what happened to him and did not know where he was for a bit of time.  He definitely looked confused and had that deer in headlights look.  Can you imagine not knowing where or who you were in front of thousands of people?

I had a major head injury in the 2nd grade where my head hit a kid's knee (very similar).  I was knocked unconscious and the only thing I remember was waking up in the hospital room.  Went to school the next day in a wheelchair because I still couldn't walk (I was a nerd and wanted to keep my perfect attendance for the year as it was the last week of school).

I played football in high school as a 210 lb offensive tackle/Defensive End going up against 300 lb guys.  After a coach heard me say I didn't remember playing in the 4th quarter of a game I played every down in, they made me go to a specialist.  Turns out, at the age of 17, I already had signs of a permanently damaged brain.  The hardest decision of my life was quitting the sport I loved and worked so hard right before my senior season.

To this day, I still have ringing in the ears, splitting headaches, and bright lights make me nauseous.  A few weeks ago, one of my high school teammates who had a successful college and NFL career killed himself and it's widely suspected that CET played a part of it.

Concussions are a very, very, very serious issue.  The brain is most vulnerable after a concussion.  If Hugo had another impact, there would have been permanent damage, just the severity is unknown.

I don't blame the medical staff.  He literally did EVERYTHING he could to take Lloris off the field.  You could see him pleading with the player, dragging him off, and I believe he even tried to use the authority of the referee.  The decision rests with AVB and I honestly don't think AVB knew this issue.  He would have been forced to use his final sub in a game that could have a huge impact on the club and his future.  I firmly believe he is unaware of the risks involved.  He said it was up to the player and he wanted to go back on...EVERY player wants to go back on. They cannot be the one who decides there.

This needs to be a change from the top down.  Some governing board (FA/UEFA/FIFA) needs to implement a procedure that MUST be followed by every team.  Maybe there's an added rule to allow an extra substitution? Maybe there's an independent doctor or some type of equipment that can determine whether the player is safe to play?

From what I saw, I believe that we risked Hugo's life/quality of life by allowing him to play again.  As I was watching the game, I didn't care if we won or lost anymore, I just wanted the game to finish.   We can't change what happened, so I'm not mad at anyone, I just hope that changes can be made before a player is severely impacted.

Edit: Different sport, but the impact is still the same...a concussion followed by another concussion can cause [death](http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/181507-mares-shares-thoughts-on-friend-leals-passing). Or [very serious injury](http://www.badlefthook.com/2013/11/3/5061500/mago-abdusalamov-in-coma-hbo-boxing-following-mike-perez-loss) (Both of those links are from events of the last 2 weeks).

I think he would be a good option to try from the bench. He's a different option to the likes of Kozak and Helenius, and could be useful as a late replacement for Gabby or Weimann.

I would love to see Grealish and Carruthers given more of a chance when they are back from loan, and Jordan Graham could get there as well. But right now Robinson is in fantastic form and it can't hurt to stick him on for 10 minutes if we need a goal.

Soldado got very excited when he actually had a decent ball played for him, we really need to figure out what balls he wants and give them to him.

Edit:  On the topic of Soldado, we need to look to play him through earlier.  He looks to makes runs quick, before the defense is settled.  Once the center backs get comfortable in the box, we lose a lot of what make Soldado very good.  We lose his movement, as the defenders are able to keep him on front of them, and keep him marked.  We can't set up shop and lob crosses to his head, we've got to find his feet.

It's the thin end of the wedge. How many times have we given up on unbelievably convenient and good deals in this country because of incremental changes that steadily add up to make them a complete rip-off? 

University fees won't be so bad; besides it's not that much to pay and poorer students still get help. Oh, the top-up fees won't be so bad. They can always get a student loan. Oh, the price increases aren't anything to worry about. They don't have to pay them back till they earn x amount per year any way. Oh, selling the loans to private companies won't be so bad, it isn't as if they'll change the terms to be more onerous.

Oh, privating the buses won't be so bad. Companies will compete on prices and services to keep costs down. Oh, the prices increases aren't so bad. Do you have something against people making profit? Oh, it isn't so bad that one company pushed the others out of business; if the other companies had had better service they would have survived. Oh, it doesn't matter that some services are being cut. Not many use them any way. 

Oh, it doesn't matter that electricity utilities are being privatised. There will still be rules in place about how the bills will be. Oh, it doesn't matter that the companies are shutting down power stations to increase the wholesale price of electricity to make more profit. We have more than enough reserve power any way. Oh, it doesn't matter that prices are increasing above the rate of inflation year on year ever since privatisation; it's still cheap compared to these other European countries whose homes have better insulation. Oh, it's a good thing that power companies are threatening black outs and rationing; we use too much electricity any way. Oh, it's a good that we're going to pay for the construction and subsequently pay double the going rate for electricity for this new nuclear power station that's based on an old-fashioned and defunct design for thirty-five years at index-linked prices; why wouldn't it be, are you some sort of hippy?

And it'll be the same with the NHS. A £15 consultation fee here. A £15 prescription charge there. £30 wheelchair hire here. Every additional increment on its own won't seem like much. But in the end it'll be like the trains and the buses and the utilities. Massively overpriced catastrophes of public works that offer an astonishingly terrible deal for anybody who uses them.

The unique nature of our NHS is also a huge sticking point for neoliberals and libertarian wonks who will always point to other European nations where the private sector has more of an involvement. OK, so say we do it like France. Have people pay up front for their medical care and then have insurance companies reimburse them some or all of the costs at a later date. Yeah, okay, great. The question I want to know is *how does this improve the NHS or patient care in any way whatsoever?*

It's a great sham that we can all save money by having our taxes cut, when all the evidence shows that we all pay so much more for the things directly. An electricity bill is a tax by another name. We all need electricity. But the largest burden of all falls on those least able to pay. Private utility bills are no more than a regressive tax on the poor. The same applies to the NHS. I'm more than willing to pay my monthly share of national insurance when the alternative is having the sick and vulnerable pay £750 for a hospital bed, or alternatively higher premiums for their insurance policy because they had the audacity to be born with congenital hyperthyroidism.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"As a responsible adult looking to move forward in life, your goal should never be to utilise all of your financial resources for month to month living, you need to have long term goals that involve saving. That includes a pension[1], saving towards home ownership (unless you have a different plan for your future) and having money saved to support yourself should things go wrong -- an emergency fund. The biggest rule for a responsible adult: never live at your limit unless it is your only option. 

The rule I have always lived to is 1/3rd of your after tax income is the **maximum** you can afford to spend on rent/mortgage. That leaves you another 1/3rd for day to day expenses (food, bills) and then 1/3rd to save. That means in your situation you can afford £450 rent at a maximum -- although of course you don't want to be living at your maximum.

If I was in your situation I would stay with my parents for as long as possible. I moved out of my parents house the moment I could afford to and I regret it. If you have the opportunity to live rent free and get used to saving and budgeting properly *while* having the metaphorical training wheels (your parents unconditional support) then you're in a fantastic situation that a lot of people don't have a chance to be in.

Stay with your parents, save up 6 months of expenses, then re-evaluate. You should always be working towards a specific goal, otherwise you'll end up floundering and making mistakes, just moving out because you can wouldn't be a good move in your situation. You never want to be just surviving... you want to be working towards something.

&gt; Is it possible for me to move out and have an enjoyable lifestyle?

To answer this: yes it is possible for you to move out and survive. No it is not possible for you to move out and have an enjoyable lifestyle, if an enjoyable lifestyle is one that is going to support your future. If your enjoyable lifestyle is ""I paid my rent this month and can afford to buy a new keyboard woo!"" then sure, you can do that, but you don't want to be in that situation unless you have no choice.

(For reference Experian credit scores (and any credit score from a company) is completely worthless, they are not a measure of anything. You could get credit with a score of 600 from one bank and not get anything from another bank when your score is 999.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"&gt;Do you not see the irony in calling fans of other clubs ""pricks"" only a few days after ranting about Arsenal

Again comprehension my friend. Like I have explained above already (visit /r/ELI5 if you have further problems), pricks in the sense that they get so full of it that they call their club and it's players the best in the world when your club sure as fuck isn't there and it is behind us. 

And sorry princess if you think this was the most harsh post of all time, I'll buy you a trip to disney land to make up for it and I really hope you don't wander out of the boundaries of Reddit and your PG sub because you might have a heart attack.

&gt;You go on about how your B Team is better than the league leaders, yet go on to see your ""A"" team lose to Newcastle 

And you lot lost to Aston Villa, emptied your stadium and proved to be a disgrace once again and that just on the opening day of the season. You also lost to the team which lost to Newcastle just last week. Really gloating about fuck all but fuck all is what Arsenal and their fans do so fair enough.

&gt;The fact that a supporter of one of the most artificially successful clubs in history, a team that has literally bought success at the highest price

You think I give a shit to that? I've been a supporter of this club my entire life. I was here before the money and I will be there after the money still in the stands and still cheering whether we are in the bottom league or the champions league final (At this point I should remind you we have won that too). Invading other subs isn't the epitome of my fandom which is the case with you.

&gt;as if having access to limitless amounts of wealth is some form of achievement, a team that can buy almost any player in the world at any time, 

Sorry about that if that makes you so butt hurt. I am not part of the hippie Reddit mentality. I do not have the thought process of ""Oh corporations BAD, money BAD SO BAD , money is the satan! Support Indie developerszz!!"", ""OMG BOYCOT THIS COMPANY 1 EMPLOYEE FUCKED UP"", ""save the world save the rainforest"", ""omg fuck money"".

I work at a corporation. My job involves money and exploiting psychology, evaluating and handling finances and exploiting the stupidity and nature of fickle people like you who like the shiny things and the ""eco friendly"" products. I do not give a shit to this mentality and most of all I love money, wealth and businesses no matter how ruthless they are because even if they are smudging little specks off and growing, they are doing it for their good and the good and intelligence of those who run it. Same goes with football and same goes with the business of football. 

A club grows, a club goes bankrupt, a club gets rich and a club gets poor. It is a circle that will keep on rotating and every top club has gone through each and every single one of these stages whether you like it or not. It might not be the 900 million figure which they put in the headlines to attract fickle idiots like you to read their articles but it was always happening at a different rate. There have always been clubs who have spent double or more than other top clubs and vastly more than small clubs and Arsenal, United and Liverpool are some shining examples of that. 

You just happened to pick Arsenal while playing Fifa 2009 when it was Chelsea's turn to go through this phase and now you are butt hurt about it. This is economics, this shit happens. You have done the same in the past and so have most of the clubs with successful histories. 

You think I give a shit about your clubs mentality? You think it is above us? You weren't even born in the time when me and my old man used to go to games and we were smacked left and right by United, Arsenal and Liverpool because they spent money. Did anyone else criticize them for that? Yes they were. But it didn't sell any papers because you the Internet article reader hippie crowd didn't exist yet and you love reading 900m headlines so they keep writing them and repeating them at the start of every match.

Oh yes money and business is just so easy. I mean look at City who spent so much and got every trophy in the world. Its just so easy. So many teams have spent fortunes and literally won every single trophy in the world. I mean it just works. You get investment and it equals trophies. All Arsenal needs is wealthy owners and not corrupt bastards like Abram.....oh wait we forgot about our shareholder....shit.

&gt;I look forward to the day that Abramovich's ill-gotten funding dries up at your nasty club and you cunts actually have to face reality for a change.


Mate you clearly do not understand how a business works nor will you be able to understand how a club works. I'd be amazed if you can even figure out the CSS of your sub which should be your specialty since you are a mod because otherwise I see no reason why they would put a muppet like you on the sidebar. 

Seriously you are just a waste of my time and I honestly am feeling ashamed for you. You should go argue on Arsenal's facebook page because they will be able to leave replies of your level. This place isn't for you.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; At the moment Townsend is very raw and hasn't matured 

Think you hit this nail straight on the head.  Townsend clearly is very talented, and to be fair, has been our best attacking player for much of the season.  But he is young and isn't picking up on some of the things that are going on and how to react to them.

You can see the fullbacks shading him to the outside and the CBs not coming up and challenging him. End result is that he takes the path of least resistance and moves inside, since the CBs aren't stepping up he is presented with the chance to take a shot.  Problem is, look how many times he is coming inside as full tilt and firing a shot from 20+ yards off-balance so his shots are sailing and wasting opportunities.  

The other problem is that he is not recognizing some of the opportunities that are coming up.  When he cuts inside Soldado/Eriksen/Holtby/Paulinho are all moving and Townsend hasn't had enough experience to recognize where to settle and either take a balanced shot from the outside or look for the teammate making a cut.

As he matures he will start seeing how he can take advantage of these opportunities more effectively.  Unfortunately the way our attack is playing we really need him to mature and take advantage of these things now, not later.",0,1383614629,null,0,false,0,cd6x5m7,t3_1pvnik,t1_cd6x5m7,t1_cd6pn88,null,1428788238,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I agree about watching sitcoms for the Britishness factor. British films tend to focus on a perspective of British life that I cannot relate to. Especially as a northerner.

Although they're very dated now, Only Fools and Horses and Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads are very interesting, especially from a modern perspective, of British life. I mean, you could probably map a version of British culture going from Dad's Army (1960/70's take on WWII), through Likely Lads (1970's north-east culture), the Only Fools and Horses (Thatcherite, 1980's London), Men Behaving Badly (1990's lad culture), the Royle Family (1990's North-west culture), The Office (2000's office culture).

I mean, that sounds to me like a great night in.

Yeah, that's a realisation I found hard to deal with. It was kind of: OK, this is great, but what about the rest of the year for these people? 

Also general volunteers are given all sorts of different jobs, you could be standing on a door making sure people don't go through it, or cleaning the toilets, or helping one of the badged volunteers or walking around talking to people. There's a ton of different jobs. What you get is pot luck and it may not be what you envisioned at all. 

My shift was around eight hours, but I had a lot to do over a day and I did 4 shifts over the period. I also packaged up all of the individual sound and video systems from the warehouse to be distributed to the individual centres a couple of days before it all happened. The logistics behind it are incredible though, there's a shit load of work that goes in.

I mean a lot of volunteers have this romantic vision of helping the homeless at Christmas. It's rarely like that though. It's rewarding definitely, fun sometimes, but I've seen people literally spit their dummies out because they were given a shit job to do. You've just gotta remember that it's not about you. It's about them. 

I personally had to tell this couple off once ( and eventually split them up for the duration of their shift ) for walking around hand in hand; kissing, cuddling, all happy and joyful that they were doing a great thing. But what they really weren't thinking about is that some of theses people are homeless because they literally lost everything at some point.  Including their wives, husbands, kids, families. Whatever. 

The last thing they want to see is the happy couple with everything to live for and... everything to go home to. 

You just have to think. 

But they tell you a lot of this at the briefings beforehand. The rest is just common sense. ",0,1383617923,null,0,1383618377,0,cd6ylo0,t3_1pwxnr,t1_cd6ylo0,t1_cd6xz9f,null,1428787563,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"I've volunteered for a different charity, caring at Christmas, but I think the roles are about the same. 

It involved basic catering to prepare and serve meals, basic things like chopping vegetables and socialising with service users through activities such as playing cards, playing pool or just talking. 

I enjoyed it, but you do need to be mentally prepared, you'll hear a lot of heartbreaking stories and encounter a lot of people feeling completely lost and hopeless. 

My main advice is don't try to be anyone's salvation, it can be tempting to focus on one person and try to persuade them to go to drug treatment or call their estranged family but that's not what you're there for. Talk to everyone, listen to them, be patient, understand that by giving someone who needs it a bit of non-judgemental company you're helping. You can make suggestions to people but always remember that these are adults who can choose whether or not to take your advice and most of them will know the systems and problems of dealing with them a lot better than you do. Do your best to make sure you interact with everyone, the quiet guy sat in the corner might be an ex-soldier needing to open up with someone about a traumatic experience, the loud mouthed woman might be trying to hide her pain at losing her home, if you can be patient and non-judgemental and listen, really listen to people you will help them to regain trust in others, which means they will be more likely to seek help they need and build good relationships. 

If anyone does ask you for any help or advice beyond this check with the shelter to see what groups they work in partnership with and always refer them to a permanent member of staff if you feel out of your depth. 

If you don't feel comfortable with the idea of interacting directly straight away then ask if you can do a shift or two in back-room duties, such as sorting donations or kitchen prep to get an idea of the feel of the place.

The other reason I'd love to see Khedira is because he's young enough to bring a prime-level playing mentality to our side, but is old enough to give the midfield of the future (Chalobah - who incidentally could do a job for us when he comes home in January, Loftus-Cheek, MVG) space to grow into their own.

I find these numbers highly dubious.

How many people were conducting this research that they could snag a new paedo every 5 minutes?

Were they running 3 shifts, in order to do so 24 hours a day?

5 minutes is barely enough time say ""hi, how are you"" in a chatroom, nevermind soliciting someone to take their clothes off.

Usually you will see the signs manifest pretty quickly, but it isn't unheard of for some of the more severe signs (nausea/vomiting, degradation of motor skills, speech impediments, pupils not dilating) to manifest later depending on the severity of the concussion.  If he couldn't remember some of the facts, then he had a concussion. 

That said, i am going to say that if the medical staff felt he was clear to return to the match then i will abide by their decision.

Concussions are not fun to have, and it sounds like after the game the team to all the necessary steps to ensure he was safe (CT scan, observation period, some testing) following the match which is all we can ask for.

Personally I don't think Scotland could survive on it's own after all this time, either culturally or financially.

I also hate the *way* the SNP seems to be pushing the issue. To me it seems like half their campaign is saying ""Hey, Scotland! You know how you hate the English? Well here's a way to be free of them...""

They seem to be feeding off of Scotland's natural racism to get their own way.

One more thing I don't like about the whole ""YES"" campaign is that the majority of people that I have seen in favour of it are 16-18 year olds who seem to have been brainwashed into thinking that somehow we will be some sort of global superpower the moment we leave the union.

Although I disagree with OP. While this does affect the UK as a whole, it is Scotland trying to decide if it wants to leave the union, so it should be up to Scotland only to decide.

If it was a vote to *kick* Scotland out of the union, then yes the UK as a whole should be involved in the voting.

But I don't think Scotland will leave. The last time I looked at the figures, the majority of Scots wanted to stay part of the UK, and not be independant.

And my final reason for Scotland to stay is my personal opinion of Alex Salmond. I think he's a power hungry, wee cunt, that thinks he is lord and master of the world.",0,1383631314,null,0,false,0,cd73ttl,t3_1pwmq7,t1_cd73ttl,t3_1pwmq7,null,1428785112,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

... but you've got Clara who's met all the Doctors; you'd be undoing all the Matt-Smith-wearing-""11"" references; the on-screen flashbacks to all the previous Doctors; all the PR-material put out by the BBC (including my boxed set of Eleven Doctors figurines, damnit!); remember SuperDonna has (had) all the Doctor's memories; universe-hopping Rose is bedding down with a human Doctor with almost as many memories as SuperDonna and they should *both* remember any such thing...

... you've got in-story and out-of-story reasons for the Doctors to not be bumped up.

(Mind you, in checking back over episodes to see if there's an explicit identification? ""School Reunion"" has the Anthony Stuart Head Krillitane identifying the Time Lords as ""peaceful to the point of indolence"", which is sure something Davies didn't take into account when he wrote insane Rassilon. See; inconsistencies and crappy writing like this are what stopped me from loving Who as much as I used to; or the new *Star Trek* or the new *TRON*. Sigh.)

I know they could've had an aged McGann (funnily enough, in Eighth Doctor novels? The Doctor came up against an aged evil version of himself *a couple of times*!). That's what I'dve *preferred*; it almost-certainly would've cost the BBC less than **John Hurt** too. It certainly would've been less of a *slap in the face* to poor McGann.

(edit: you might want to stop reading now. Sorry. I had to get this out.)

I watched the BBC throw away nearly every piece of unofficial, licensed **and** official *Doctor Who* writing (including Lawrence Miles's *Faction Paradox*) that was created between 1990 and 2005 (with the exception of Paul Cornell's *Human Nature*). And a couple of bits of the official 1963-to-1989 series too. I've seen them give the Master **super-powers** like a *Spider-Man villain*. I've understood they supposedly mistreated Eccleston so that he **wouldn't come back** for any of the anniversaries.

Including the ***50th***. The **Fiftieth Anniversary**. I can think of only one other show ever that ran for 50 years.

The BBC have stripped me of my innocence. Almost as much as...

... when I was a kid and watching *Doctor Who*, I'd decided I wanted to move countries and die on English soil. 1988, 89, I was watching the final glory years of the classic series. Years later, I read the foreword to Alan Moore's *V For Vendetta* trade paperback, read what he'd written of what life was like in the **real** Britain in 1989. And it was nothing like the idea I'd gotten of the golden fields of Great Britain, from watching 26 years' worth of *Doctor Who*.

The BBC isn't our channel to the whole life and cosmos of the Doctor. The BBC are the corporation who tried to ditch the show in 1986 for a year and a half. They're the company who ditched the show in 1989 and ended up licensing the book rights to Virgin Publishing (only to take it back after it'd proved its continuing sustainability). If the whole world starts hating *Doctor Who* next week, the BBC would drop it like a hot rock.

I know. Downer. Sorry. I'm almost middle-aged and I'm obviously showing it. But *Doctor Who* shaped my life when I was a kid and I don't exaggerate when I say it made me a better human than my parents would've on their own; with a love of reading, science, technology, being inquisitive, thinking of a better world and a bigger universe.

I want Russell Davies and ""fan"" Steven Moffat to know what they did to my childhood. I want it rubbed in their faces. And I'm sure they'll never hear of it. And now they've made their money, I'm sure they just wouldn't care.

true,StavromularBeta,CA,canada,"Well they explain it above. This entire argument is based off of the assumption that to win the title you want to get 91 points because that is the number of points you will get if you beat all of the bottom ten teams in both the home and away fixtures, if you beat all of the middle four at home and draw them all away, and if you beat all of the top 6 at home but lose to them away. It's basically saying, if you don't fuck up and statistically win the games you statistically should win, and accept losses that fit the statistical outcomes for the games, you'll win the league. It alludes to the fact that the most consistent team will win the league.


anyway, if we get +1 for a fixture, it means we scored one better than we statistically should on average. One example of this is drawing City away. That is a game that statistically it was acceptable to lose. If you got -3, that would indicate that we lost at home to a bottom ten team (could you fucking imagine) and we are -3 from our average score of getting 3 points.

Edit: this isn't my opinion, this is just what they are trying to say in the article. I would say that their 91 point target is a minimum for a title contender, but it's really hard to quantify that number at any given time because that number really depends on e  amount of teams in each ""category"" which fluctuates.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"You know, this is a pile of carefully worded bullshit to hide the real issues.

&gt; Migrants who have come to the UK since the year 2000 have less likely to receive benefits or use social housing than people already living in the country, according to a study that argues the new arrivals have made a net contribution of £25bn to public finances.

Well of course they have. While you might not like the ""dey turk er jerbs"" argument, these migrant workers are more willing (or indeed forced) to accept low-paid, zero-hour and minimum-wage jobs - due to they fact they can't avail of many of the state benefits right away and they probably have minimal savings to support themselves. Jobs that people already based in UK and receiving benefits are unwilling to take, because they'll potentially be worse off.

Again, due to the fact the migrants can't avail of benefits right away, what else could they be but net contributors or zero contributors to the country? They're not allowed to take anything OUT of the pot! The ""massive contribution"" they are making is propping up a system that pays UK workers to sit idle, while lower paid workers from other countries effectively do the work for them. 

It still doesn't detract from the point that those jobs *could* be taken by British people, however it's financially unwise / detrimental to them to do so - a terrible state of affairs. And businesses KNOW this. They have a duty to their shareholders, not the unemployed, and therefore will find the most cost-effective (read cheapest) way to fill their staffing requirements.

It's a nasty side effect of globalization, and I'm sorry I don't have any answers ... but weighted garbage as we've come to expect from the Grauniad who paint these migrants as a positive thing is obfuscating the real issue.

There should be ZERO unemployment amongst the existing population before we start letting migrants come in and devalue the jobs market for everyone. Otherwise, the whole system becomes a race to the bottom, with no locals working and all lowest-bidder labour ""imported"" from elsewhere.

EDIT: One more point is that we have no idea how much local workers would have contributed. Migrant workers are more likely to send GBP home to their own countries, to help support their families there - money that a local worker would have spent in the UK. Without a comparison of how much more (or indeed less) than 25 billion LOCAL workers would have contributed, the big numbers being bandied about mean nothing.",0,1383637706,null,0,1383637964,0,cd75aat,t3_1pxri5,t1_cd75aat,t3_1pxri5,null,1428784432,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

**No**, I *really don't*.

&gt; Wilfred: But you said your people were dead. Past tense.

&gt; The Doctor: Inside the Time War. And the whole war was time-locked. Like sealed inside a bubble. It's not a bubble, but just think of a bubble. Nothing can get in or out of the time lock. Don't you see? Nothing can get in or out except something that was already there.

&gt; He didn't say they weren't dead.

The Time Lords escaped the lock **because they weren't dead**. How did we see *anything* to do with them if they were **dead**? Are you telling me **zombie Time Lords** cover their eyes and spit while raving madly?

&gt; He confirmed that they are in fact dead in the Time War

**No he didn't**,  and now **you really are just making stuff up!**

Right. I've got the scene in front of me now and I'm looking at your transcript. You're taking the Doctor's ""Inside the Time War"" line as **added to** Wilf's ""you said your people were dead"" line.

a) You should be taking what the Doctor said as a **correction**, not an **addition**.

b) You seem to have left out a little something after your clip. Namely:

""The signal! Since he was a kid!""

""They can follow the signal. They can escape before they die.""

Okay? **They're not dead** and frankly I'm having real difficulty understanding **how you fail to comprehend this**.

&gt; , which is inside the time lock. This is not him saying they aren't dead or that he lied.

[snip]

&gt; If this is the dialogue you're interpreting to mean he lied, you're really taking a jump.

No, really, **I'm not**. Just *listen and think* for a damn minute.

I take it you either haven't heard, or choose to ignore [Steven Moffat declaring that the Doctor lies](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/602598-rule-1-the-doctor-lies) or watched the episodes *The Big Bang* and *Let's Kill Hitler* where that line is repeated as ""[Rule 1](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Doctor#The_Doctor.27s_Rules)"".

&gt; Seeing the Time Lords does not mean he lied about destroying them, they're the Time Lords right before being destroyed. They're time travelers, that's why he tried to time lock them. He didn't want anyone and anything to be able to stop them from dying in the Time Lord's future.

You say, ignoring quite cheerfully what I told you *last time* - the Doctor didn't even know the Time Lords were involved **until the Master announced the White Point Star**. ***Explain that away!***


&gt; His quote ""back into hell"" is in reference to his earlier quote:
&gt; 
&gt; The Master: But this is fantastic, isn't it? The Time Lords restored.
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor: You weren't there. In the final days of the war. You never saw what was born. But if the time lock's broken then everything is coming through. Not just the Daleks, but the Star of Degradations. The Horde of Travesties. The Nightmare Child. The Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Neverweres. The war turned into hell! And that's what you’ve opened. Right above the Earth. Hell is descending.

**None of which says the Time Lords are dead**. *Honestly*.



&gt; The Doctor is saying that why he locked in the time lock is Hell, and that if the Time Lords escape, all of Hell does too. By sending them back into the time lock, they're back with the Hell he was afraid would leak through. It doesn't mean they aren't going to die,

But it **does** mean that they're *not dead* because he **did not kill or destroy them**. *Honestly*, ***why are you not getting this?***


&gt;  he's just making a reference to the fact that he's held Hell back in the time lock and that they'll have to return to it.

*Which is not destroying or killing them*.

&gt; They're all time travelers - even if he destroyed them all in the end

... ***now*** you're saying ""if""!?

&gt; there are uncountable years prior to their destruction where they still existed and could travel out of the time lock. This was the point in the time lock.

... it's a pretty useless Time Lock if they can time-travel out of it, *don't you think*?

Now, the Time Lords **did** get out of it because *Russell T Davies is one of the shittiest writers to ever be cut loose upon ""Doctor Who""*. But I think everyone on this subreddit will pretty much agree that a ""Time Lock"" might not stop space-or-time travel **within** the Lock, but will certainly prevent any space- or time-transit **out** of it.

&gt; Killing them at any given time is useless as long as they can time travel

That's officially the *silliest* thing you've said on the topic yet; that even beats out your original first claim. If they're killed *before* they escape the Time Lock, then they are **not going to escape**.

&gt; or people can time travel to them. The time lock seals them in an prevents them from escaping their eventual death.

Given that they have Time Lord technology in a lock which basically means they're not a part of the universe, it doesn't mean that they have to die. Again, did you miss the bit in the episode where the female Time Lord mentions that there are people close to the centre of the Lock who are dying and being **un**-died every *second*?

It also means that their ""eventual death"" (that you're so *desperately* reaching to in order to justify your position) is the same death that comes to **everybody and everything** when the entire universe reaches maximum entropy. It also means that ***the Doctor did not kill or destroy the Time Lords***. **Are we** ***clear*** **on this one yet?**


&gt; You've entirely fabricated ""the Doctor admitted he lied"" in your own head.

Please refer to the links included above. **No I didn't** and you need to stop being so insulting. And silly. ***You've*** fabricated the idea that the Doctor destroyed or killed the Time Lords.

Same Doctor who *permanently* imprisoned the Family of Blood, yeah? **Not** ""destroyed"" or ""killed"", ***okay!?***

&gt; The only thing he lied about was how he presented the Time Lords to others, ""how he chose to remember them"". He never says he lied about destroying them.

Provably wrong. Repeatedly. To add to that, I point you to the last four-odd minutes of *Gridlock* where Martha asks the Doctor to explain what the Face of Boe said to him. About 41 minutes 40 seconds in he says **and I quote**: ""I lied to you, 'cause I liked it. I could pretend, just for a bit, I could imagine they were still alive underneath the burnt orange sky"".

As much as I dislike it and as much as I despise Russell Davies and Steven Moffat for turning the post-Eighth Doctor into a **repeated liar**, they *bloody well did* and this new series Doctor ***lies***.

And if you're **still** trying to argue the point, then you're pretty clearly letting your personal preferences get in the way of actually *understanding* the show.

He has the requisite determination and hard work to develop technically, along with the athleticism required. Whether or not he develops into a top-class player or stagnates as an average EPL player (similar to the likes of danny murphy, david thompson) greatly hinges upon whether or not he develops confidence in himself as a player.

The issue with the LCP is somewhat different. Many of us know that something similar to this has been (informally) common practice for many years.

I'm not. You're not reading what I'm writing. I'm all for reducing unemployment, and I'm not against controlling immigration if and when necessary, as well as improving our education system in tandem, in order to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment as much as possible.

You argument is totally fallacious and a massive straw man. For someone who claims to not be against immigration, it does raise my suspicions that you would resort to these tactics. I agree low skilled immigration will reduce opportunities to a lot of the unemployed. I agree immigration should be looked at and controlled where possible, in relation to this particular facet of this issue. I'm actually agreeing with you.

My point is, reducing immigration to zero, until unemployment reaches zero, is an idea rooted firmly in the realm of fantasy. This was the suggestion to which I was responding, and in no way does it mean I'm suggesting that any effort at reducing unemployment is in vain. Quite frankly, that is a ridiculous accusation. Saying that aiming to reduce unemployment to zero is impossible, is not the same as saying any effort to to reduce unemployment is in vain, and to try and frame my point as such seems rather disingenuous. Furthermore, tying the fate of one policy to a totally arbitrary and unrealistic aim of another policy is a recipe for failure, and is the sort of idealism in spite of pragmatism that I don't really have a lot of time for.",0,1383652696,null,0,1383653194,0,cd77bbr,t3_1pxri5,t1_cd77bbr,t1_cd76wd6,null,1428783486,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Your added quote solidifies it.

""They can escape before they die"".

The Time Lords are time locked but not dead at point A. At point B, the Doctor kills them. These Time Lords are from point A, and have not been killed by the Doctor. If they escape at point A, they won't die at point B.

This is a show about time travel. Just because the Doctor killed them at some point does not make them always dead. These are Time Lords from a point in time prior the the Doctor killing them - they're not zombies. They are simple time travelers traveling to a future point after their own death.

true,jesterkid01,null,null,"I am an american who graduated from st andrews a few years ago and did my full 4 years there. 

I would say that there are really only a few different aspects of life at St Andrews that you will need to prepare for. 

1) Weather. yes it is wet, and yes it is chilly, but what youre really gonna hate is how bad the wind can make both of those feel. Get a waterproof jacket that has good wind breaking ability. If you want to go native, then something like a [Barbour](http://www.barbour.com/All-Collections/Mens/Waxed-Jackets/c/mens-waxedjackets?breadcrumbs=mens) will fit right in. It is also pretty far north, so in the winter months, it gets dark pretty early in the evening and stays that way till pretty late in the morning. when i was in my first year, i partied enough to completely miss daylight for about a week. dont do that. 

2) Back to clothes. There is no need to go buy a whole new wardrobe, but be aware that a vast majority of St Andrews male students wear sport coats and button downs on a daily basis. mind you, this isnt dressing up to them, but just their general casual wear. some study abroad people can find this jarring as no one goes to class in sweats or pjs. Formal Balls call for black tie, (no need to get fancy here as it may well get destroyed. go to one of the many charity shops in town and pick up a battle-tux that fits decently for 30-50 pounds.) and most of the club events will call for a suit (again, this may get destroyed depending on the rowdiness of your compatriots, so leave the fancy stuff if you have it at home). 

3)TRAVEL. you didnt hear me the first time...***TRAVEL!!!!*** the relative cost of traveling around europe from st andrews is so small when compared to going to see the same places from the US that it isnt even funny. I did some traveling, but not nearly enough and it is one of my major regrets. you can do your own research and figure out where you personally want to go, but even just heading off for a weekend is possible if you take a moment or two to plan it out. just do it. I knew JYAs and JSAs who got all grumpy that st andrews isnt a bustling metropolis but never took advantage of the fact that the EU has figured out cheap travel.

beyond all that, i would say dive in to the club culture (social and sports clubs, not *oontz-oontz* clubs). there is no 1 team that everyone gets behind, but there are some massively fun events to attend and even participate in. Ma Bells 7s is a rugby tournament where all the teams are basically just groups of friends getting together to see who can walk the fine line of staying sober enough to run in the right direction with the ball while being drunk enough to dull the pain of getting laid out by another group of guys doing the same thing. Strathtyrum is a grass polo tournament (and the official start of the Scottish Grass Polo Season) that is great fun to watch with a glass of pimms in one hand and a glass of bubbles in the other. the standard of play fluctuates, but it is generally one of the first nice days in town and there is always a well played exhibition match with actual professional players. There is Octobeerfest, a whole other beast that has grown from somewhat humble beginnings while i was there to a massive beer swilling, lederhosen /dirndle wearing, polka musicing party. there are fashion shows which are basically just great parties with lots of pretty people and thumping house music. 

If none of that sounds like your kind of party then there is nothing to worry about because there are tons of other clubs and what not to get involved with. the key is just jumping in. St Andrews, be it from the social side or the academic side, is very self directed and really just ends up being what you make of it. 

If you have any other questions, just message me and ill do my best to help out where i can.

A lot of these crimes occur in phases. One group of awful kids with some air guns could shoot dozens of cats in a week - this makes quite a difference when you're dealing with less than a thousand incidents a year.

I suspect it gives disgruntled homeowners ideas, too. They hear that a cat has been found dead after being shot with an airgun (or poisoned with antifreeze or whatever) and try the technique on whichever hapless moggie has been pooing on their lawn. An inexperienced shooter using a cheap gun is likely to maim rather than kill.

Income tax accounts for £155bn of national income and national insurance for £107bn. So, if we used the saving we made by abandoning the NHS to purely reduce the money coming out of our paycheques, then we could abolish national insurance, and reduce everyone’s income tax bill by roughly 19%. Meaning your person on £15k would save £1,085, or £90 a month. 

An average person on £26,500k gross, paying £3,412 Income tax and £2,250 national insurance, would save £2,910, or £242.50 a month.

Alternatively, we could abolish VAT (£103bn) and council tax (£27bn) altogether and come out around flat.

However £108bn of national income is borrowed. The sensible thing for a government to do would be to close the deficit, leaving us with a saving of £137bn - £108bn = £19bn. Which would be enough  to reduce national insurance by roughly 18%, meaning your person on £15k would save £154.50, or £12.87 a month.

Even more sensible would be to take that £19bn and start paying off the national debt and actually give none of it back to the taxpayer (apart from in the sense of reducing the taxpayer's future cost of interest on that debt).

Using the current table, you will have:

To be one of the best ball handling defenders you have to be one of the best defenders. David Luiz is not.

He has improved, that's without a doubt, but he's not improved enough that we can rely on him week in, week out.

I'm not sure where you're going with this argument. It is possible to believe that both have underperformed and that both have been a mistake. It's not a choice between one and the other.

Again, controversial opinion incoming, beware. If we'd kept the £75m we spent on Torres and Luiz on the 31st January 2011 and spent it elsewhere then we'd be in a much better position.

To be honest, I'm starting to turn against these leaks.

It's totally right that Snowden should have leaked info about the mass surveillance of the public, mass collection of our data, secret agreements between government corporations etc. That's great that we now know about it.

But spying on Germany - that's fair game isn't it? We have secret services who are SUPPOSED to spy on other countries. I know they are an ally and it's a bit distasteful, but let's not pretend that Germany don't have spies here. Everybody is spying on everybody else. That's their job. It's why every major country in the world has intelligence services. Why is it right for one guy to interfere and sabotage with our overseas operations? That's not in the public interest at all. In fact, isn't telling the world about our secret listening posts simply called ""espionage""?

Some of these leaks now seem more about putting egg on the governments face rather than any public good or being legitimately in our interest. Mass data collection and google handing over our emails is one thing, but bugging german offices or listening to Merkels phone is entirely another matter.

Nationalising has plenty of problems, which the privatisation under Thatcher was meant to fix by creating competition, which would in turn drive the prices down. 

But - and I'm speculating here - it seems unlikely that a company which has spent a significant amount on buying a rail-operating franchise, and taking on the concomitant responsibilities in terms of maintenance and upgrade work, would be particularly happy about having their prices dictated to them. As I don't know the terms of the sales it's hard to judge, but you're talking about very heavy-handed interventionism, which a) doesn't sound very Tory to me, and b) may not be permissible under the terms of the original deal. 

To your point about the energy company enquiry... if you expect there to be any revelation about how these companies are behaving, you're going to be disappointed. The whole point they can get away with it is because a cartel is so hard to prove. Ostensibly they all have legitimate reasons they can point to for raising prices in concert. the only proof that they do it in collusion is anecdotal and empirical... it's almost impossible to find genuinely competitive prices between suppliers. 

The best example of this is moneysavingexpert: they're showing deals now where you can freeze your prices for a certain amount of time, based on a slightly higher tariff. The best deals they're showing - the biggest differences between suppliers - amount to less than £20 saving per year.

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Forgive me for quoting something without having to source to hand but: migrant labour typically has lower saving rates than native workers. So for a given job the immigrant will spend more of their income, this means that on average an immigrant increases domestic consumption more than a local worker would for the same job. In theory this expands the local economy creating more jobs. 

That is the official economic justification for immigration and has been true to a large degree. The problem is that lots of these jobs are being replaced by computers or become superfluous to requirements, so it's a structural issue as well as one of immigration vs. training.

I suppose the argument could be rephrased to: In times of higher unemployment, should the government be fully funding retraining of unemployed individuals or ignoring them and importing already qualified people?

As things stand, most franchises would be re-nationalised, but if people in some areas thought their private train operator was actually doing a good job, or if in the future people felt that their nationally run franchise would be better run in the private sector, it could be privatised.

\- expensively educated

&gt;Brand attended Grays School Media Arts College [who?] and in 1991, he was accepted to the Italia Conti Academy [who?] and had his first year tuition funded by Essex County Council. 

&gt;After his first year at Italia Conti Academy Brand was expelled for illegal drug use and poor attendance.

So,  no, not really. 

\-

\- establishment connected

Sort of.

&gt;He is the only child of photographer Ronald Henry Brand [who?] and Barbara Elizabeth Nichols [who?].

&gt;Brand's parents divorced when he was six months old, and he was raised by his mother.

&gt;While she underwent treatment [for cancer], Brand lived with relatives.

&gt;When he was 16, he left home because of disagreements with his ill mother's live-in partner.

\-  Admittedly, as of 2013 Brand has met and worked with a  lot of ""establishment"" types,  but  I doubt that many of them  consider him to be  ""one of us"". 

\- 

Brand is also a drug addict in recovery  (principally heroin, but pretty much everything else as well.)

[Please read -  I thought that this was very good](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8857821/fixing-a-hole/).

Imagine the computer isn't yours, but is... say... a public computer in a library. The only computer in town. Everybody uses it because they need a computer. However, you realize the computer is broken, but most people who use it do not realize this as it still seems to function enough so that it does not directly affect them. You try to tell them that you are sure the computer is slightly broken but nobody believes you. Russel Brand isn't the repair man, he is just a famous guy who uses this computer and realizes it's broken. He then appears on your town's local TV show and tells people the computer is broken. You don't expect him to know how to fix it. He is not a computer engineer. He just knows something is wrong and that something needs to be done to fix it. You need someone educated in the field of computer technologies to fix it. A professional. Perhaps during this television appearance he suggests a few ideas of his that he thinks may help to fix the problem. They may not be correct, but again, he is not a computer engineer so you cannot expect him to have a flawless plan of action on how to fix the problem. The important thing is that a lot of people in your town are now more aware to the fact that the computer is broken, and in time hopefully will educate themselves on the issue until finally enough people agree that a computer engineer is needed. And finally you can all decide together who the best computer engineer for the job is.

The problem is that a lot of people don't pay enough attention to politics to realize that the system has significant flaws, and fail to look hard enough for a candidate that will truly work for the right things. Often, this is because there isn't one.

However the study does not take into account the number of people displaced by in the incoming workers, who then end up being a drain. They state that immigrants are less reliant on benefits and social housing, while ignoring the fact that immigration may be the cause of that increased use of benefits by natives. Now, I realise I'm veering into the lump of labour fallacy here, but they would have to show that the number of people employed had increased in line with the number of new workers to show this isn't the case. As far I can tell, their study simply ignored these variables and did a simple comparison.  Also, they touched on the fact that EEA workers get paid substantially less than natives, and they try to guess at a cause, but they never account for it in terms of the effect it has suppressing wages and reducing tax revenues.

In summary, I think it is perfectly possible that immigration could have suppressed wages thereby reducing total revenue and displaced workers thereby increasing native dependency on benefits, and still have the data fit with this study.",0,1383662815,null,0,1383663006,0,cd79j69,t3_1pxsc2,t1_cd79j69,t3_1pxsc2,null,1428782451,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,troffle,null,null,"&gt; How is that hard to understand?

It's ~~hard to understand~~ utter **bollocks** because:

a) You keep saying they've been destroyed or killed **and they haven't** because they're **very clearly still alive** when they broke out of the Lock, they were very clearly still alive when they **went back into the Lock**. Meaning, to put not-too-fine-a-point on it, that you're ***wrong***.

b) ""Time point A and B"". Oh, I was afraid of this. I hoped I was wrong, but you had to go there.

I hoped otherwise, but I *thought* your previous post was trying to say that Time Lords ""some time in the past at point A"" can avoid their ""point B"" future and change it after they've seen it. Congratulations. You've invented your own theories on *Doctor Who* time travel by **completely disregarding** ***FIFTY YEARS*** of *Doctor Who* history.

## And you had the *gargantuan* balls to accuse *me* of ""fabricating"" arguments in my mind? Dude, you're *way* beyond mere ""hypocrisy"" by now.

You don't seem to understand that *Doctor Who* has **multiple mechanisms** for not allowing somebody to change their *observed past*.

For a start, anybody whose past is successfully changed is *no longer the person who started the change*. That's just a logical principle.

Not good enough? You want story characters instead? **Okay**. Whether it's Time Lord operatives from the Classic series, Time Agents from the new, classic Transduction barriers to prevent TARDISes landing out of synch with Gallifrey's time, classic series Symbiotic Nuclei to make [Kartz-Reimer fake TARDIS modules](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Kartz-Reimer_module) work or new series Reapers... it means that it **doesn't matter** that *they're sodding Time Travellers*. If they haven't escaped any time in their past history before ""the Doctor kills them"" (*which he bloody* **doesn't!**), then it means that **they haven't escaped**.

Still not good enough? You want Gallifreyan Science reasons instead? **Okay**. [The **Blinovitch Limitation Effect**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinovitch_Limitation_Effect). *This argument is done*.

Still don't believe it? You want to offer me a counter-example? Like, say, Rose saving her father or giving him extra time? *Go ahead*. **Still doesn't work** because the elder Rose was there to talk to him and see his extended life, but she still remembered his original death in order to have started the entire episode in the **first** place. Even super-Omnipotent SpaceTime BadRose didn't even undo Jack's killing, she just rebuilt him as an immortal.

In the **entire extended media history** of *Doctor Who*, the **only** two character/groups to have ever enabled the alteration of observed history were 1) [Faction Paradox](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Faction_Paradox) in Lawrence Miles's work and 2) an alternative Omega from an alternative Gallifreyan history where the Doctor stayed on Gallifrey in [*The Infinity Doctors*](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Infinity_Doctors_%28novel%29). Otherwise, **every single principle** that's ever run the Doctor **since the first 1964 episode of** ***The Aztecs*** is to **maintain** Cause-and-Effect and to **avoid** or **undo** Paradox.

The only reason alternative-Omega got away with it is because he controlled an effect that *altered the entire Universe to the sub-atomic level* from **outside** the Universe. The only reason the Faction got away with it is because **they're** ***bloody*** **Faction Paradox** and it's the *point* of their entire existence using corrupted, banned and dangerous Time Lord techniques operating directly on [biodata](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Biodata) in the first place!

And your Time point-A-point-B doesn't work for another very *Doctor Who*-specific reason. The only instance *ever seen* of *any* Time Lord going into Gallifrey's past, outside what Real-World Physicists would call Gallifrey's ""[Light Cone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone)"", was in the *now-undone*, **never happened**, *no-longer-officially-recognised* extended universe novel [*Lungbarrow*](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Lungbarrow_%28novel%29). And the **only** reason it happened *then* was because the [*Hand Of Omega*](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Hand_of_Omega), built by Omega, used by Rassilon to **create** ***Gallifrey's first [Eye Of Harmony](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Eye_of_Harmony)*** pushed the TARDIS to break Gallifrey's transduction barriers.

The **only** reason ***Clara*** managed it is because the Doctor was a used as a specific tunnel from Trenzalore to Gallifrey a subjective-thousand-years-earlier. And if Clara had done **anything** to change the first Doctor leaving Gallifrey or **in any way stopping the Doctor from being at Trenzalore at that time**, then the tunnel Clara used to **get** there would have **never existed** - ***right back to paradox again***. While Faction Paradox may use paradox to a couple of interesting effects, the only way the Doctor's universe can deal with paradox is to **split it into a different universe**.

[Breathe out. Breathe in. Okay, even **I'm** getting sick of having to argue this now!]

And ***all of this above*** is why the Doctor **never averted** the Time War to save the whole of Gallifrey. This is why he never goes to save Adric, Sara Kingdom or Madame du Pompadour, **even now**. This is why he never undoes any of the deaths he sees. This is why he undid the Master's re-configuration of the TARDIS into a Paradox Machine.

I have **been** and **met** people who understood even-merely-the-**logic** of the situation without the *Doctor Who*-specific knowledge by the age of **ten**.

Trying to sound superior and *smart-arsey* by simply saying ""This is a show about time travel"" and ""How is that hard to understand"" **does not** make you some kind of *Doctor Who* expert, a logic expert, a philosophy-of-Time-and-Causality expert and it very *unpleasantly* and *definitely* **does not** make you a **debating** expert. It makes you, let's be *perfectly*, **entirely** and ***irrevocably*** clear on this, simply **wrong**.

## And if you don't get this, then what the damn hell are you doing making any comments on *Doctor Who*?

**Do you understand this now**, ***please***?

c) for the **third bloody time**, you have **blatantly ignored the fact** that the Doctor had **no idea** the Time Lords were involved until about ten minutes before they appeared on Earth **and you have been called on this already!**

d) for the *I've-lost-track-how-many-bloody times*, you have **blatantly ignored the fact that the Doctor has lied about his role in the War**. ***The Doctor lies***. This has been said by him, *his assistants*, **his wife** ***and the bloody writers and producers of the bloody show***.

You refuse to accept him as a liar, but you're *perfectly happy to accept him as a* **double** ***genocider***? In spite of *on-screen evidence?*

##What the hell is with you?

He said: ""It struck me with Simon that people were being booked especially to have the piss taken out of them in a very overt fashion. Mark Lamarr didn't book people to rag on them, it was just in the flow of the show that people suddenly went a bit weird and Mark could turn on them.

I don't think there is doubt in anyones mind that Eriksen is the superior player, but until he is adjusted and able to play to the height of his ability Holtby may be a better choice.

Holtby also has a highly superior pressing game, this led to a number of turnovers against Everton and kept spurs on the front foot in the first half - I believe this is an attribute AVB favours highly. Holtby earned his starting place due to stand out performances in the fringe games he played, Eriksen (for all of his talent) is arguably yet to do something similar. Furthermore, Eriksen needs to adjust to the spurs system, Holtby is 6 months ahead in that regard.

I fully expect Eriksen to claim the no. 10 for himself, but as things stand, there is at least an argument for Holtby to have it. Integrating him slowly promotes squad competition and sends a positive message to new signings, established players and fringe players alike: You must earn your way in to the starting 11.

&gt; The average British household was only ""modestly"" affected by the crisis, said the OECD, but looking across its club of mostly rich nations many people were blighted by higher unemployment, involuntary part-time work, financial insecurity and poverty.

&gt; Looking at the UK, the OECD says that over 2007 to 2011 there was a cumulative increase in real household disposable income of around 1%, while in the euro area, income dropped by 2%


So why does this conflict with the ONS data:

&gt; Using another measure of household economic status, real disposable income, the ONS calculated that Britons are now worse off than those in several other nations.

&gt; In 2005, British households had the fifth highest spending power in the world, behind only the US, Luxembourg, Norway and Germany.

&gt; By 2011, British disposable income had fallen behind that in countries including France, Canada and Belgium, ranking 12th overall.

&gt; The ONS said that high inflation was largely to blame for the fall in Britons’ spending power relative to other citizens.

&gt; “Between 2005 and 2011 the prices of goods and services in the UK has increased relative to other countries,” the ONS said. “As a result, although household income in the UK has grown, when compared to other countries that income doesn’t stretch as far.” 

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10057560/Households-worse-off-than-in-2005.html

We surely can't have have had an *increase* in disposable income, when energy and commodities have skyrocketed and income has barely increased. Unless that disposable income is not adjusted for the real cost of living, making the OECD's figures utterly worthless - disposable income could have dropped by 2% in Germany without the real cost of living changing, still leaving them in a better position.",0,1383669585,null,0,false,0,cd7c0qt,t3_1pxwwn,t1_cd7c0qt,t3_1pxwwn,null,1428781278,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"Iva has been joining in, but he is just not comfortable as a wide player. Cole, on the other hand, has stopped. Fitness? Age? Tactic? Who knows at this point. 

As far as width goes, Schurrle and Willian has provided width for the team. I love the fact that every time I see Willian, he is on the edges. 

But, with all of this, this goes back to the midfield. Frank Lampard in particular. On the attack, he sits just outside the box. This also shifts the everyone, including Torres, usually to the right. With Mata and Hazard looking to cut in the middle, there is just no room for them to operate. 

With Lampard so high up, it only leaves Ramires as your lone defender in the middle. Ramires is just not physical enough to bully midfielders around. Nor he is able to control the midfield with precise passing. He is just not that type of player. Maybe this is the reason why Cole hasn't been joining? Just to help cover.

Frank Lampard, an attacking midfielder, playing as a defensive midfielder; I assume is there to add to the attack is counter intuitive.

as i understand it, credit ratings decay over time (ie: things that happened x years ago will no longer be taken into account), and you can take steps to actively improve them (like getting a shitty credit card and repaying it EVERY TIME).  i have never been in this situation, but i am told that www.moneysavingexpert.com is an excellent resource in this regard.  don't know if you've looked there already, but it should be a good place to start.

going forward: paying off the debts seems like a good way to go, though again i don't know exactly how credit scores work (but you'd think paying off a loan would be a good thing).  the only way to answer the house question is to speak to a mortgage broker/provider.  be aware that applying for a loan and getting rejected will hurt your credit score, so just ask the question in a hypothetical way. i would expect a bank to be prepared to offer some guidance if you summarise the situation.  

you may find that you can get a mortgage, but at a higher rate than you would otherwise see.  and if you are totally ineligible, presumably your girlfriend is doing ok and could get a loan on her own? you could then help repay in a more informal way, ie: she buys the house officially and you rent half of it from her or something? whatever, there are ways.  if you end up down this route, make sure that you are comfortable with the way the ownership is set out. if bad times occur and you split up, you don't want to end up losing whatever contribution you make (though perhaps that is a risk you may have to take).

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"nah. you'll need to try and build up your credit again though. Get registered on the electoral roll, get a credit card for building credit and always pay it off (See http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/bad-credit-credit-cards).

you also probably need to speak to some credit agencies and get things sorted out - have a look at http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/loans/credit-rating-credit-score#improve

&gt;One of the major problems people face are defaults on their file. These can easily hamper applications for new credit. If they're genuine and fair, they're tough to deal with. Firstly check with the other agencies that the default is there too, then try the following tactics, especially if the default is unfair.

&gt;  Negotiate with the lender. If you're prepared to settle the debt, either in part or in full, then you can negotiate with whoever you owe the money to. You can also make a condition of settlement that the default is wiped off your credit file. Companies can to do this for disputed defaults.

&gt;    Add a notice of correction. If all else fails and you believe the default's justifiably unfair, add a notice of correction to the file explaining the problem, eg, ""It was a joint account and the debt was run up once I had split from my ex-husband/wife."" This will slow applications down, as most companies will look at it manually, but as a substantial default is likely to stop you getting credit, that's usually not a problem.

so if you defaulted but have then paid off, you should be able to get the default removed from your credit file.

Plus Paulinho and Sandro are good enough in the middle and Pauly is actually a better attacker all-around right now than Holtby.

I know this is kind of off topic, but I'm seriously getting sick of AVB's tactics.  Why in the world is Lennon starting over Sigurdsson for starters?  The man scored a goal of the year contender midweek and is more than comfortable playing on the left, as opposed to Lennon, whose positional sense out there is very poor and who fails CONSISTENTLY in the final third.

And I'm sorry but Andros Townsend needs to move out to the left.  He puts in a good right footed cross but never uses it and when he comes inside, his shooting is not helping us and often finds himself wandering into the middle of the park and congesting things.  Lamela needs to get a run of games, and with him on the right switching places with Eriksen centrally and Townsend on the left behind Soldado, we would make chances and scores a goal, which is more than can be said of our production recently.

TL;DR: Eriksen needs to start.  And get Lennon off the field for fuck's sake and give Sigurdsson games if you want an inverted left.

A comfortable 2-0, with Yaya bagging one to silence the racists.


As for pellegrini it's still too hard for me to tell, so far he has failed to change our away jynx (1st place for home games, 15th for away games) although some of this can be due to individual player error. I love the new signings he brought in, unlike Mancinis hit and miss signings; I can see all of them being vital. Come back to me in 7 months!

You simply have to accept you are going to get wet.  You can either accept the British weather and get wet, but stay warm (wool and windblocking) or you can try and stay bone dry with waterproof clothing (which means you get wet from sweat).

Cycling when the weather is shit, is actually a lot of fun.  Have a towel and a change of wangers (underwear) at work or in your bag.  It's really easy to commute when the weather is shit.

The best thing is the more you cycle, the fitter you get, the less you sweat, the better you arse and legs look, the more you can last with the Mrs etc etc etc.

It takes me around 35 - 40 mins to do 8 miles, of which a lot of it is up a really bloody steep hill.  Which leaves me out of breath and sweating.  But that's ok.

This is a really big problem. I went to school that had a large Muslim population, and when we were all 12 year olds it was all hunky dory, everybody got along. As we got older however, many Muslims actively distanced themselves from everyone else, and eventually there was a complete separation between Muslims and everyone else. 

And I absolutely believe this was self-enforced. Attempts to befriend Muslims would result in condescending sneers and aggression. In the end, non-Muslims simply ignored them and went on with their lives. I can honestly say there was hardly any anti-Islamic sentiment and mild annoyance was the strongest emotion against them. After all, these are people we had grown up with, there was no reason to hate them just because they were 'different'.

Any avid PL fan last season (aside from some Man Utd supporters) would have told you that Manchester United overachieved. Their squad was the weakest it had been in a number of years, yet they ran away with the title. That stat you mentioned about their ability to be so clinical all season (thanks to the fact that they have 2 of the best strikers in the world and some very competent backups) despite having a relatively weak 58% TSoT indicates that they overachieved. A lessoned learned from this I suppose is that it's not always quantity that counts, but quality (more importantly, a nice blend of the two).

Although I'm sure it's a lot of work, I recall seeing someone compile the locations of all shots we've had this season so far and assigning a point system to grade the quality of a shot based on its location on the pitch There was some method to the point assiging. Ex: typically 40% of shots taken from here are converted into goals so this area gets 4 points per shot. The approach converted shots/SoT into a number that incorporated the quality of these shots.

It would be interesting to see this approach incorporated with your TSoT approach, as it would incorporate not only the quantity of shots, but also the quality of these shot. I'm not sure that the data is accessible enough to go back 5 seasons (or maybe I just don't know where to look).",0,1383674503,null,0,false,0,cd7e31c,t3_1py6az,t1_cd7e31c,t3_1py6az,null,1428780315,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Ivanovic has better defending and finishing than Dave but Dave has better overall crossing and a faster link up play going forward from the sides. Set pieces, Ivanovic is better at too. 

I think that in a case where the other team is expected to park the bus Dave should play. Ivanovic's defensive game is good enough to make him a necessity in the top games but in games where other teams sit back for the majority of the game, Dave's speed of getting back and going forward + crossing is more useful as they will either be sitting back or attacking with speed on counters.

Against top teams Ivanovic should start because of his more solid defensive style and how he can also transition in and out of the center. Also when we face teams weak at set pieces Ivanovic should be given a shot given his scoring record. One of the biggest differences from last year is just how less our defenders are scoring. They scored equal to our strikers last season and this season they are very hesitant.

Compared to your last two CL groups, this one is a cakewalk. So the fact that Pellegrini managed to progress isn't really any indication of his impact at your club. Furthermore that game against Bayern was absolutely shocking. I have rarely seen a team look so helpless against them for almost the entire match. It is left to be seen if this was just a one-off thing or if this kind of poor showing will repeat itself against some of the bigger fish in the knockout rounds. 

Furthermore and with all due respect, but I don't think you have a snowball's chance in hell to win the group as long as you share it with arguably the best side in Europe at the moment and one of the most likely bets to win the whole competition. So I think the smart thing to do for Pellegrini would be to give your fringe players and prospects some international experience and put the focus on the league until the end of the year. If he doesn't do this then in my humble opinion this should lead to a serious discussion about his priorities among the Manchester City fans (i.e. potentially winning stuff vs. fear of a trashing from Bayern spoiling his image or put another way Manchester City's best interest vs his own best interest, etc.).",0,1383675022,null,0,false,0,cd7eayc,t3_1pyjei,t1_cd7eayc,t1_cd7d2sm,null,1428780214,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

true,h33i0,eng-westmidlands,Now London...,"I'm not sure of the term, not having heard it myself.  You teacher may be speaking of the Industrial Revolution. 

The last revolution in a literal sense, was the [Glorious Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution) which occurred in 1688. The result of this revolution meant that Parliament sovereignty was secured and since that date till now, our system of constitutional monarchy has stayed the same. This is before the time period you stated though.

About the right to vote, I think your teacher though is speaking about the reform acts and representation of the people acts. They were acts that set out who can vote in parliament basically. Each one was a step closer to universal suffrage (everyone having the right to vote). Before these acts, the people entitled to vote had to be men with property worth at least 40 shillings. This system by and large lasted for 400 years until the first reform act. An act btw, is a law passed by parliament. The acts were:

[Reform Act 1832](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832) 
- Increased the amount of men who can vote. More info in the second paragraph under the subheading ""provisions"" in wikipedia. 

[Reform Act 1867](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1867)
- Increased Male suffrage even more (especially for working class men). Other areas to look into is the [Reform League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_League), they caused a lot of agitation of government to get this passed. Maybe related to what your teacher meant by revolution? 

[Representation of the People Act 1884](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1884)
- Increased Male suffrage even more and more. After this act, about 40% of men did not have the vote. 

[Representation of the People Act 1918]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918)
 - This is one is after the time period, but is the first one to give the vote to *some* women and now almost all men.

The weapon, said by police to be illegally held, and other legally-held firearms at the property were handed over to officers, the force said.

To me this reads as all legally held were accounted for and handed over and that there was a separate weapon linked to the 18 year old who is linked to drugs. 

This is the more logical conclusion rather than that the papers have been pin prefect in understanding the legality's of UK fire arms laws and have successfully linked that a legal weapon in the wrong hands is illegal all based off an initial police statement about the incident.

It started when I noticed the advert for VGZ in the Friday-Ad when I was at the peak of playing Quake 2 with bots (while listening to a bit of Prodigy and Chemical Bro's ;) ) and Red Alert. I headed down there after school and chatted with the owners (Jim &amp; Rick) on it's opening week who offered me the chance of a quick taster game. The hours of training had paid off and I (alias Fluff at the time) proceeded to run around the map, rocket jumping all over the place creating beautiful gib firework displays. I noticed they hadn't yet updated their games to their latest versions and, as they hadn't internet set-up yet, headed back a few of days later with floppy disks in hand and proceeded to update the PCs, in return for another gaming session. I was hooked! 

As a result I became a kind of in house network/gaming guy &amp; general lackey in exchange for free games and then a wage. We started doing 'kids club' on Saturday's where parents would drop their kids off for the morning and I would rush around trying to get all of the kids playing Toca touring cars, then 10 minutes later they'd be bored and playing Red Alert, 3 minutes later it would Quake, back to Toca and so it went for a good few hours. 

We had lots regulars, Tuesdays and Thursdays were Quake night which became and added additional machines downstairs, as well as arranging all night gaming session/lock-ins. Can't remember the names of the players too well but Chris who also worked there and some of his mates would come down and I though one of them with long hair was Pussycat, though that may have been Rick. The #2 seed UK Quake player came in once or twice and wiped the floor with all of us, literally a split second after seeing him you were sniped by a railgun.

I remember a hot summers day and having 10+ or so customers lose internet connection because the single ISDN modem was overheating, and they'd usually hang around while we stuck it in the freezer to cool down.

As the internet was becoming more popular it was renamed a couple of times eventually to netcaf1 (which might have been why you missed it), expanded next door, and after a while moved the gaming upstairs next door and they shut the old shop next door as it wasn't as nice. Battlefield 1942 was a firm favourite upstairs and me and friends would often wander back from a night out, pick up a Caspian and play into the early hours.

By a weird coincidence I was in the old shop just the other week (now a bar) reminiscing about the good times to a mate who took my place when I went to Uni. I find it funny to think that at that time the internet/gaming wasn't as mainstream and so every now and then you'd have drunk lads wandering down the street shouting 'Geeks' through the door, yet now it's so prevalent most of us carry it around with us in our pockets.",0,1383677084,null,0,false,0,cd7f72w,t3_1pxihp,t1_cd7f72w,t3_1pxihp,null,1428779796,2,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,2

Townsend and Lennon (when present) have been dribbling to mid, but haven't been providing many crosses with their weak foot to get widthful service in to Soldado, Holtby/Eriksen, or Paulinho.   We are missing the width that is provided with accurate crosses from the wings.  Other teams are exploiting that weakness by packing the middle with defenders.   Even with great pace and dribbling to the middle by Lennon and Townsend, they are left with little room to pass due to the lack of space created by the opposing defense.  I think that's part of the reason why Townsend has so many attempts on goal from cutting into midfield while still being outside the box.

I'd like to see a LF in the January window who can cross the ball well while still meeting AVB's requirement for inversion.  I don't know if that's similar to searching for a unicorn though. :)

All the profits from BBCW get put back into the BBC at home to supplement the licence fee.

As a knock on effect, my sales suffered. My targets got missed. And then I got penalised for it. Imagine you're in sales, told not to sell because you've got nothing to sell, then get taken to a managerial meeting for not selling. Oddly the DWP seemed to take sympathy with me on this. 

&gt; I don't understand your logic - surely staying in the job and at the same time looking for another job would have been the option that gave you ""extra time""

As for my logic about ""extra time"", it went like like this: I didn't have much leave left that I could book time off from work to attend interviews. I worked in Birmingham or Manchester but live in Nottingham. An interview for me wasn't just a quick ""pop over the road,"" it meant a whole day off for me. Plus, the proposal that was given to me at the time was basically: ""Quit, and we'll pay you the next two month's wage to buy you you off. Don't, you can work for us for another month, and then you get your money cut off the day we fire you."" 

I got paid to take 2 fucking months off to look for a new job, of course I was heading down that route.
