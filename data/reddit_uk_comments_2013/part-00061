Tough choices though. 
-Johnson has had some really great games. Scored some important goals
-Agger hasn't had his best season but is still out most consistent defenseman. Gives a 110% every game 
-Carragher has played great games recently but not enough game time to be top 3 
- Enrique has also played well this season but  hast been amazing and had injuries at the start of the season 
-Lucas has statistically made us a much better team. His ability to sit infront of the defense and break up the play has made a huge difference for us 
-Henderson has done really well with the game time available to him. Hasn't had enough of an impact to merit a top 3 choice 
- Sterling has had a break out season and really played his heart out. Still very young and I'm sure will have a great future at LFC 
- Downing took a lot of shit but really (including myself) showed this sub reddit wrong. Honorable mention!
-Gerrard. Enough said.

If it was your aim to be of benefit, instead of just to be a bitter snark, you would use a tone more likely to engender support.

Secondly, your experience does not apply to everyone.  Just because you got a major you have not been successful in finding a career for or you wasted your money does not mean that everyone else is making the same mistake.  It is those assumptions which are ignorant.

You also said in the comment chain that fulfilling college requirements was a way for colleges to squeeze more tuition out of students.  That may be true.  But what good will it do to go to college and not fulfill the requirements?  None.  You'll receive no degree.  So yes, this class does not apply to his/her major.  But it will not destroy his/her life. 

I understand you may have a lot of resentment towards colleges and degree programs.  A lot of people do.  They're a money and time suck.  Unfortunately, harassing well-meaning individuals over the internet won't win you your money back.  If you have so much resentment towards this malfunctioning system, it might be more beneficial to spend that time aiming to improve it.

true,DrRandle,null,null,"I think The Great Intel is The Master. To use your evidence to apply to my own:

1. The Master may have died physically, but because he always has a way, his intelligence could have been preserved.

2. The Master -is- a Time Lord. He could very easily see Time Lords as a threat.

3. No direct ties, yet, BUT! We do know that The Master has a terribly hypnotic influence on people. It would seem likely that his whispers to command Mrs Kitzel (or whatever her name was?) are just as reminiscent as the ones that helped get his wife and everyone else in his pocket during Series 3.

4. The Master totally has a cult, and totally hates The Doctor.

5. I have no idea what to make of The Silent ones, other than another race brainwashed by The GI... if they're truly related.

6. I like this theory, and you're probably right. 

Now for a bit of my own addition to my thoery...

From a narrative standpoint, it makes sense for the GI to retro-actively be The Master. It's the way to have this story lead to him coming back for the 50th, tie in an old enemy, and this all seems to be setting up for something huge. 

There's also the phrase ""Remember me you silly man."" That could, in fact, be The Master trying to reach out through Oswin, using her as a bait/trap to bring The Doctor to a point of resurrecting him. 

It's all a bunch of fan speculation and kinda fan-ficcy right now, but I like it and honestly I don't know what else to go off of, other than ""I'm reaching to far, the GI is just the GI and that's about it.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"As an amateur IT person, I geeked out over this entire episode. 

I've got a bit of a hypothesis about this season, the next one and the series in general. 

**FAN WANK AND SPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

The Doctor will end up asking the Question himself. 

The events of his past three incarnations have changed him in ways he never foresaw. He's been quite willing to kill, despite openly being opposed to it. He also developed somewhat of a god complex, which made itself known in *The Waters of Mars*. 

Speaking of god complexes, I bring up the series 6 episode *The God Complex*. I have a hypothesis that what the Doctor sees in Room Eleven, what he both fears and has faith in, is himself. His faith is in his certainty of his own identity, that is, Who he is. What he fears is Who he has become. 

I also point to the character of the Eleventh Doctor himself. He's dressed in a way very reminiscent to the Second Doctor. I make the case here that the visage of the Eleventh Doctor is an attempt for the Time Lord to get some of his younger, more ""innocent"" self back. He wanted to return to a simpler time, when he was just a cosmic hobo with a blue box. When he still knew who he was. 

I've noticed a certain instability to Eleven's personality. He's always seemed like he was clinging to what bits of himself, and possibly sanity, that he had left. His haphazard, hyperactive and slightly mad behavior might be a coping mechanism. It's like if someone you know went through utter hell last night shows up the next morning a bit *too* happy. 

I've heard many things about the rebooted series, for better and for worse. I've heard classic fans pan it for gross violations of established canon and needless, excessive angst. Regardless of one's opinion on the execution, I personally like the concept of a darker Doctor. I always find it interesting when a story's hero has to deal with the psychological trial of doing something he knows he will regret and living with the aftermath. That said, I would like to see the Twelfth Doctor's story be one of redemption. I want him to find out who he is. 

But I don't want *us* to. It ruins a huge premise of the show.

I think that's truly unlimited because [they go on about ""truly unlimited with no asterisks"" in the section of their site which lists their business packages.](http://www.eclipse.net.uk/business-broadband/reasons-to-choose-eclipse/truly-unlimited-broadband) (Their business unlimited for £30 seems only to apply to non-fibre ADSL connections - i.e. 10mbps - 20mbps).

Most people here aren't prepared to pay more to get better service. I have Eclipse's home fibre with 50GB usage, and I guess that, at £30 a month, I probably pay more than most people here. I think I have reasonable expectations - I get a very good quality of service from my ISP, it's not cheap, but I don't expect my service to be unlimited.

I get unlimited downloads between (I think) 11pm and 8am, and have my BitTorrent client, running on a network file server, scheduled to do all my downloading then. It can max out my connection, absolutely saturating it. It looks like I could download [about 1TB a week](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1TB+at+35mbps), using only my off-peak allowance.

I could pay even more, buying the unlimited service from Eclipse or going to [Andrews &amp; Arnold](http://aaisp.co.uk/).

[edit] im not sure why JBu92 and I are being downvoted for voicing opinions, but let me clarify: I have no problem with mentions of ""doctor who?"" as that is the 'final question' and Moffat seems to be doing something with that. The fact is that unless Moffat happens to have some ridiculous plot twist that involves the number 11 (which he really isn't the 11th if you count the meta-crisis doctor) or he makes an entire season where the pivotal moment hangs on the fact that bow ties are cool or something is timey-wimey, then all Moffat is doing is referencing his ealier writings so that neo-whovians will recognize something from an episode four seasons ago and chuckle, which while it can be humorous, when you do it in every episode of a show it becomes rather tedious. I know that DW is very reliant on continuity, but there is a difference between every episode having the number eleven in it and a scene where the doctor is taking care of unconscious Clara, and he nostalgically sniffs a pack of jammy dodgers in complete bliss.

The River Song story line had all these great moments like the silence, or the kid who might very well be a time lord or even the astronaught and they could have explored all of those storylines for multiple seasons.

Instead they drop everything that's cool in favour of it being about river song, those cool aliens we established as being the silence, so effective people cant remember, no problem the silence is actually a society/movement who are determind to kill the doctor. 

Their big plan kidnap river song and brainwash her.

That kid who's clearly american and also appears to be able to regernerate, yeah thats river song.

That person in the astronaut suit? river song.

Hell she even gets to marry the doctor who is supposed to be pretty much asexual.

The silence could have been so much more, they were established as a parasite unable to invent things on their own so they piggy back on the skills and ingenuity of others.

The silence should have been more animalistic, intelligent but acting more out of instinct rather than planning a head and the doctor should have only run into a small group.

Being an opportunistic race this small group would have realised the tardis was the ultimate ship and taking it would have made them the ultimate power in the universe allowing them to spread further and further like a virus.

They could have been a new stand out villain we'll always return to like the daleks and the cybermen.

The american girl that might be another time lord could have had so many twists and turns, I'm not saying she should have been a time lord but it needed far more exploration than yeah she's river.

I mean if you wanted to keep on with the doctor and river being in love, you could at least explore the possibility that she's they're child but being a half time lord her ability to regenerate is limited so she dies.

As for river being controlled by the astronaut suit, come on you already had her as a mind controlled slave that you've freed let someone else have a turn at trying to kill the doctor.

Moffat is great at setting up stories but his obsession with river song ruined what could have been an amazing two seasons and I badly, badly want him to be done with it. ",0,1364705488,null,0,false,0,c95kx7l,t3_1bc3h2,t1_c95kx7l,t1_c95kjaz,null,1431723899,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

He was a lot more open and flirty, and for a while it was just flirty. And then it became the BAM. So it just felt too forced too quickly. The pacing totally changed.

Martha's storyline was just ridiculous. This is an educated, independent woman. You're telling me that this doctor meets the Doctor and then just falls for him at the speed at which she did? I couldn't buy it either.

Totally agree with Amy. Amy's feelings trajectory was great. The audience got to see her fall in and out of love with the Doctor, mature, become committed to Rory, and eventually choose him.

And Clara. Oh that ending is going to be rough. I wonder how the writers will handle her and River's last goodbye.

true,altrocks,dalek,Dalek,"Eh, I don't know about that comparison. Babylon 5 was well scripted from beginning to end as a whole story, but the addition of the last season and spin-off shows/movies have to be ignored for that to work well.

JMS scripted things extremely well because he had an actual story to tell, characters full of real flaws &amp; strengths, and a world to build. The show ended after the season 4 finale's future retrospective showing the importance of the crucial time period that had just passed. Sinclair's role in it all was well entrenched before the Shadow War's importance was fully unfolded, let alone the events affecting Earth. He was an interesting character, but only one among many, and not even close to the star of the show or the keystone to the show's overall plot.

**THAT** is depth and complexity. And that show ran for 5 seasons. This is Moffat's 3rd year as head writer being wrapped up. Take a look at the 3rd season of B5 and the storylines going on there. Compare that to what we're seeing. I know, apples and oranges to some degree, but compare just the overall plot and story arc. How was it developed. Were the questions being raised actually interesting or merely pressing and insistent through repetition? Did the characters focus on those questions, or were they unimportant to the general happenings?

I get that Moffat could be playing the long game, but it really feels to me more like a person who's trying to tell a complicated joke and keeps messing it up and going, ""Oh, no, wait, let me start over..."" and then gives you something completely different from the previous attempt. I'm still watching the show, obviously, and enjoying it for the most part, but the difference from Davies to Moffat, and the comparison of B5 to Moffat's work with DW are not very favorable to Moffat.

If you define the guarantee terms and penalties sensibly, it helps motivate quality improvements while remaining affordable for the company, and even means that those who get the worst service (even if that cannot be avoided) pay less for it - either they get a contract with slacker guarantees at a cheaper price or they keep getting compensation payouts.

true,Defiledxhalo,silence,Silence,"Well, yes, attending several major universities *is* a ridiculous waste of money, but that doesn't mean you can necessarily apply the logic that college as whole is a waste of money.  I would like to ask why you went to four colleges.  Drinking in college is also another way to waste time and money, but I'm not going to judge and say that you were wrong in participating a fairly normal college experience.  It just didn't *have to* be a part of your college experience, and may have contributed in you thinking it's a colossal waste of time. 

It all depends on how you apply yourself.  Sure, if you can make a living doing something you have a talent for, then by all means, do it without going through an expensive and time-consuming university.  Of course in that situation, it wouldn't make sense to go to college.  However, for many other people, going to college is a very fulfilling experience for many reasons, and some are getting a job they otherwise couldn't get.  

(Me, for example, I can't be a doctor without going to med school, and I feel that career is what would bring happiness to my life, therefore the cost and time put I put in for med school is worth it.) 

Non-major requirements don't take an extra year's worth of tuition to complete.  While it may take two semesters to do them, it shouldn't be interfering with your major requirements, or else you're in the wrong major, or doing something very wrong with your studies.  For /u/fitter_h4ppier to be able to take an amazingly fun course as an elective is envious indeed, relevant to his interests, and gets the requirement out of the way.  Also, if s/he's taking classes as a full time student during a regular semester, s/he will be paying the same rate of tuition no matter how many extra classes they put on.  It's only when you are taking summer/winter part-time classes where prices are based on the number of credits you take.  So, if the previous conditions apply, they actually aren't paying extra for this class, just more time for studying it and physically going to the class.

Nonsense!

Pubs has always been a commercial operation that became a centre of the community mainly because it was the only place to have clean water, hot food and lighting at night.

It was about as much a ""community service"" as the blacksmith would have been.

No one is calling for the return of a blacksmith in every town though. Why? Because times have changed.

In a world where we have lighting at night, clean water in the home and decent kitchens... the pub evolved into what was for a short period of time, primarily a drinking venue.

And now times are changing once again, and people are interestingly, moving backwards a bit and now wanting pubs to serve decent food again. We might not take our pot to the pub and ask them to heat it up for us any more, but the pub as food venue is returning.

I was talking about rural pubs and not inner city bars btw. In terms of what they do for the community one of my locals has a social club where they have days out, charity fundraisers and also act as a pickup point for goods, some consumables, also it is the base for a pool team and cricket team.

I might have mentioned it before, but one of the other pubs has a 'gardening club' on Sunday mornings, whilst this is just an excuse to get to the pub at 11.30 it is a resource people enjoy.

all these things have been going on for ~50 years, so times haven't changed everywhere.

one thing i have seen change in a few places (even out of the way places) is the reliance on food services to deliver everything from veg to frozen yorkshire puddings to the pub kitchens. Many of the pubs in the sticks have always had good food and reputations, scaling things up and switching to frozen rubbish often reduces quality overall.

The French won it for you. Not the ""Americans"" considering they didn't really exist by this point. You seem to forget we were fighting wars all over the place at this point- and against the armies of Napoleon. No other country in the world would be able to sustain something like that. The War of 1812 was a clear American defeat. Burning your capital, forcing you to abandon your main aim of taking Canada, again inflicting more casualties on your side, and forcing you to sign a peace treaty. You call that winning?

Bailed us out of two world wars? I'm sorry that's laughable. By the time the American troops landed in France in 1917, it wasn't until mid-1918 before you guys could become an effective fighting force with the French and the British. And by that point the Germans where on the run anyway.

And WW2? I'm sorry, but have you heard of the Battle of Britain? We single handily prevented Hitler invading our island, it was his first defeat of the war, with not a single bit of help from the late-arrival Americans. If any country can claim to save us, it was the Russians. 

If you're not in the party from the start, you're not in it at all.

Non-employment is a different beast entirely, and covers people who aren't working but don't wish to do so for any number of reasons. This has an impact on the overall size of the economy, but doesn't tell us so much about how it's performing within social constraints. It can be changed and have a very positive effect - the most obvious example of which is the drive to involve women in the workplace which has hugely increased GDP/capita.

The problem, of course, is at the fringe of the categories. If somebody describes themselves as non-employed but would be prepared and able to work if a better job was available.

Is it too much to ask you to just be poilte about something even if you think it's funny? It's not about respect for beliefs or ideas, it's about respect for other people. As an ex-catholic atheist I think belief in God and Jesus is completely bonkers, but I don't make fun of that belief in front of my granny because it would upset her and my granny is a lovely person and I don't want to upset her.  
In fact *most christians* in the UK are actually lovely people (or at the very least, just normal people), and because I'm not a self-centred unempathetic cunt, I don't take the piss out of them and deliberately offend them just because they believe in God. I am quite happy to let them believe what they believe without creating unnecessary conflict between us.

Your marks may not count much towards your degree (I've heard plans for making first year worth 10% on some courses at my uni), but it's a way to get into good habits without risking failure too much.  Especially if you're doing a science, the things you learn in first year are the foundation of everything else you learn and if you don't understand them, you're kinda fucked.  So go to your lectures, find a quiet place to study, and meet all your deadlines.  You'll get in your lecturers' and tutors' good books, and you'll work out how much you can go out with minimal consequences.  

If you're doing an industrial placement or an undergraduate masters', you can often be kicked off that and back down to the regular degree if you don't get high enough marks in first year (usually above a 60% or 70% average), so it's important to get into good habits.

true,michaelisnotginger,cnty-scotland,"Scottish-Italian, will deep fry your pizza","Applying for jobs takes a LOT more time than you think. I'd recommend that you try and get an internship in first/second year. Some professions pay (Financial services) others do not (media/publishing though they'll pay for travelling if they're nice). If you're going for the big grad schemes my advice is to get an account with shl and practise numerical/verbal tests till you're sick of them. Get your knowledge of %s and ratios nailed down. It always shocked me as a humanities student (albeit one who had taken maths and science subjects till his final year) how many students prided themselves on mathematical ignorance.

Your uni careers service should do things like taster/assessment days/visiting days from relevant professions/drinks, where you should network like a mofo. Everyone hates networking but it is honestly very useful. Keeping a budget in halls will help you too.

Get involved in societies. It always baffled me the people who often had lots of free time and didn't join stuff. Sports/media/relevant interests are always huge, you make friends easily and you have lots of competencies to whack out for when you have the inevitable 'tell me about a time when...' questions. 

Don't get with a) someone in your halls b) someone on your course c) someone in a student house. Don't go for the person across in the other room because he/she is near. For some people it'll work out but for the majority it will not.

Be honest about yourself where you want to go. I had an offer from UCL which most people told me to take over York but I chose York as my insurance choice because it seemed quieter, nicer, friendlier and less expensive to live. The course was also equally as good so it didn't make sense to me to chase imaginary prestige points. As I missed my offer for my firm choice, it meant I went to a university I was very happy about studying at.

Get a George Forman Grill. Seriously. (But clean the fat out the trough).

Do NOT panic about a student house unless you're somewhere like Aberystswyth where it's mental. Don't club together with the people from halls you don't really know immediately. Also be wary of letting agencies who will try and hit you with massive fees and usually make you pay rent way over what is necessary (york can be bad for this). Instead look at the private landlord list, don't rush immediately into finding somewhere. Know your rights as a tenant, push them if there's something you disagree with.

I would say also that what was very important for me was finding people on my course who were as crazy about my course as I was - really helped when finals tipped around!",0,1364730443,null,0,false,0,c95okke,t3_1bcq3r,t1_c95okke,t3_1bcq3r,null,1431722106,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If the Government really wanted to save money on benefits they should be talking about all these bloody old people, sitting round, drawing pensions! It's Old Age Britain, not Benefit Britain that's driving both welfare and healthcare spending. All this hot air out of Westminster is ideologically driven.

I'm given to understand Dubai has a thriving gay community for example, even though it is a criminal offence to be gay there.

The mistakes he makes are mental; those will be fixed with a coach like AVB around. Moreover, those mistakes are getting fewer and further between.

I have to say, his progress this year has been much quieter than most of the other players who've flourished under AVB (most notably Bale &amp; Lennon) but no less important or impressive. At the beginning of the year, he was mistake prone, and teams began overtly going after him in the air. That's not the case anymore, because he's very obviously improved his aerial game. Whether it was Kyle or AVB or someone else, that weakness was spotted, and worked until it was gone.

Is that true though?  I didn't get *any* downvotes in recent thread in which I supported the idea of Religious Education in schools, assuming all major religions are taught equally.  In fact, my only downvote in the whole discussion came in a later comment in which I stated that atheism and agnosticism should be *also* be taught they as are equally valid views.  Although I did state the somewhat more controversial view that many atheists have beliefs and faith in things like their own conscience in the same comment, which may have been the cause of that solitary downvote.  The person I was replying to, who thought that religious education in any form has no place in schools wasn't downvoted either, but nor were they upvoted.

My religion neutral comments seemed to be much more well received than their anti-religion comments.

true,TheEvilScotsman,scottish,Scotland,"Hmm, I see a lot of this argument but I can totally understand the mods point. Compare the heavily moderated subreddits with the lighter ones.

On the heavy side we have /r/askhistorians which maintains a high standard of debate, very few irrelevant joke posts that don't have anything to do with the topic at hand, counter-productive comments are criticised by mods and considered for deletion. 

On the lighter side we have pretty much any default. Low effort comments, low standard of debate, awash with irrelevant jokes (even if somebody is asking a fairly difficult and personal question to /r/askreddit there will undoubtedly be hundreds of unsolicited jokes or pun threads). 

An argument could be made that a sub is only as good as its community, this I could agree with. /r/askhistorians early on established that it was going to do things right: that it was going to be a serious sub where serious historical discussion could be had. /r/askreddit however does not have a community, it has hundreds of thousands of potential commenters, many of whom are not interested in answering a question but are more interested in karma. The immense weight of commenters (who upvote others like them) leads to a low-standard.

Letting the community decide content is a reasonable suggestion at first, but when you really consider it there has been a recent influx of people from /r/askreddit who do not know what the majority of the community want. The majority of the core community, the people who were here already, want to talk about the UK and it's issues. The influx of new people may have different expectations of what is good content. This is why mods of certain subreddits police 'high quality' content. What brings people to new subreddits is a desire for something different, but if every single subreddit devolves into adviceanimals with one thing different - that it's about some interest or other - what is the point in any other subreddit but adviceanimals? In /r/unitedkingdom we do not want to be /r/adviceanimals with Union Flags. It is therefore imperative that the mods continue to delete content which may push the subreddit in that direction.

There you go, I think you may now understand why mods feel the need to delete content. Some of us don't want to be in adviceanimals.",0,1364735762,null,0,false,0,c95p8ip,t3_1bcp3j,t1_c95p8ip,t1_c95oew5,null,1431721794,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,Mr_Wolfgang_Beard,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Not as much as the parable of The Good Samaritan does.
&gt;Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, ""Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?""  
He said to him, ""What is written in the law? How do you read it?""  
He answered, ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.""  
He said to him, ""You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.""  
But he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, ""Who is my neighbour?""

&gt;Jesus answered, ""A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbour to him who fell among the robbers?""  
He said, ""He who showed mercy on him.""  
Then Jesus said to him, ""Go and do.""

Besides this doesn't actually conflict with ""You must not have any other god but me."" - None of the christians are worshiping Allah, they're just being good neighbours to muslims by not letting them freeze while they pray.",0,1364736884,null,0,false,0,c95pf1d,t3_1bcpub,t1_c95pf1d,t1_c95ofk1,null,1431721712,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

We get a substantial amount of rain here. You may be used to very heavy extreme rain in short snaps throughout the year, but we just get a lot of it. By that, I mean that the rain isn't very heavy, but it is a year round thing. In the summer, we get Sun which, to you, is probably not that exciting, but to us, oh boy! The sun normally hits around 16-23 degrees (C) if we're lucky.

And then there's all the measuring. An example is, to my knowledge, you're accustomed to measuring temperature in Fahrenheit, whereas we use Celsius.

Color = Colour,
Soccer = Football

'Aluminium'. I'm guessing you say it as 'al-oom-in-um', whereas we say it 'al-you-min-e-um'. That's something that's always bugged me.

I'd suggest setting your computer language/auto-correct  settings to English (UK) as you will get marked down on any assignments you may have.

If you're going to support a Welsh Football team, a good bet is Swansea City. They are the only Welsh team currently in the Premier League (with the likes of Man United, Chelsea, Man City) and are doing great in the table for their first year. Cardiff and Swansea have a football rivalry. I'd try to stay away from the City Centre when they play eachother. That's when all the scum come out of the woodwork and do anything to start fights.

Road signs here all have both English and Welsh on them, meaning place-names are different, but the signs are bilingual, so it isn't that bad. For example, Cardiff = Caerdydd, City Centre = canol y ddinas. http://i.imgur.com/EXC7Mi5.jpg http://i.imgur.com/qH8U9lI.jpg

There's a 99% chance you won't hear anybody speaking Welsh.

Rugby is our pride and joy, and whenever there's a match against England, try to get a seat in the Millennium Stadium. The atmosphere is immense. If you're too out of pocket for that, the pubs are another great place to watch the match.

Alot of people will ask you about being American. They will comment on your accent, where you're from, why you're here, and then probably an accent test to see how differently you say words. Use this to your advantage as a conversation starter, it'll work in your favour.

That's all I can think for now. There's alot more things that will probably come to mind later. Have a great time, Wales is a beautiful country.",0,1364738045,null,0,1364738436,0,c95pmfc,t3_1bbu8m,t1_c95pmfc,t3_1bbu8m,null,1431721610,2,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,2

Nevertheless, the idea that everyone is self serving and only interested in accumulating social, economic and political capital rather than being motivated by a genuine sense to do good in the world or leave an effective legacy is an exceptionally simple and undeveloped position which traditionally is just a shorthand for laziness and a wish to see the world more simply. There are countless examples where people do things against their own interests for the benefit of the nation including most politicians who in terms of an opportunity cost are sacrificing massive amounts of potential earnings and years of their lives to do thankless jobs with little direct benefit compared to what they could be doing driven out of a sense of public service. It also ignores the Widdecombes and Ron Pauls of the world who are legitimately driven by principle. Cynicism becomes a self-furfilling prophecy, if you assume the worst then only the worst candidates apply.

You say you have no sacred cows and believe only in merit, but are you sure about that? Do you give the same leeway to the BNP, EDL and Islamic extremists that you give Save the Children or Unite Against Fascism? Do you treat the Mail and the Express with the same cynicism as you treat the BBC and the Guardian?

Do you treat Oswald Mosely's legacy as cynically as Clement Attlee? Do you honestly believe that each of these people should be treated with similar levels of cynicism?

I assume everyone is trying to make a better world but that some ideologies are inherently problematic and flawed, and that the role of the public and media is to highlight those flaws and problems.

true,Owa1n,eng-Cornwall,DPRK,"Advice from someone who studies at an agricultural college in case you or anyone else is considering that. 

It's best to live in a local town and commute to college if possible, you will widen your sphere of friends simply by being nearer more people. You're near the shops, public library etc. and the taxi/walk to and from a night out or other activity isn't so pricey, in my experience living on a college campus is pretty depressing and ends up with this weird pseudo-social-inbreeding whereby everyone has slept with everyone else. Although you do have the benefit of being literally in the middle of the countryside.

I've observed that people from other uni's have a shit-ton of time and do literally fuck all with it. I doubt you'd have the time to do this at an agricultural college degree course. A large proportion of people keep their previous jobs or seek to get jobs alongside of the course or during the holidays to get a leg up into their industry. I couldn't recommend this enough, you'll have a fall back plan after graduation and it will help get your name out into your industry.

**Most importanly:** Start planning your dissertation early, sometime in your second year. Planning experiments to co-ordinate with growing seasons, lambing or whatever you plan to study takes time. You may be able to use laboratories but don't count on it. You may also need to contact land owners/managers to arrange use of land etc. Collecting data will likely take up a huge part of your time and a lot of people try and do this over the summer between their 2nd and 3rd years.

Martha had no story arch at all. She started out as an awesome chick who rocked and ended up as an... awesome chick who rocked.

Donna is annoying, I want to smack her every time she's on-screen (with maybe one exception). Her ending was, well, kind of a cop out, imho. 

Amy is ridiculous. She lies, she's terribly unfaithful, and she is completely self absorbed. 

Rory rocks hardcore, but that might just be the emotional side of me coming out. 

River Song, well, ok, she's awesome, but I don't want to spoil too much of that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've made the argument before that United's squad depth isnt just down to them having a good bench but ut's down to the way SAF integrates the second string players over the course of season. 

On paper we had the talent to win that game but you can never make too many rotations at once when you have out of form fringe players who have gotten barely any play time. You need a solid core to help support those players. 

Were Bertrand and Marin ever going to lock down a wing together? Were Marin, Moses, and Oscar ever going to work as a trio? Were long balls to Torres ever going to be an effective strategy? Have Lampard and Mikel played well together this season at all?

One of the main problems is that we never took the chances we had to play some of these guy. Our team as a whole is also very inexperienced compared to others. So I do think that it wouldn't have been easy to get that starting 11 to that level of chemistry. 

I still think it's absolutely inexcusable that those players were selected for that game. You can say that our reserve team 'should' beat Southampton but this is the premier league. If your side is that disorganized you won't beat anyone no matter what place they are in. It's simple. Rafa showed that instead of prioritizing the league he cares more about trying to win a cup and pad his CV. It was baffling and insulting and the team was so unorganized that I can't even begin to imagine what the hell is going on in training.

On some of the players vs Southampton...Ivanovic was absolutely terrible. One of the most apalling CB performances of the year for us. What the hell is going on with him? He's been out of form for so long now.

Lampard and Mikel....they just did not show up at all. Tremendously sluggish. I'm not sure why. Reinforces our need for more midfield options.

Then there are also a few issues with the squad in terms of midfield and striking depth that should have been sorted in january.

If you want more of the surreal elements of Father Ted then go for The Mighty Boosh. Also, watch Blackadder from Season 2. Season 1 is good, but when they added Richard Curtirs it really found its footing. If you wished Father Ted went a bit darker then find and watch everything Chris Morris has ever touched- The Day Today (radio and TV), Brass Eye, Nathan Barley and Jam. Also, Knowing me, knowing you! with Alan Partridge who was a 'break out' character from the Day Today.

Further brilliant uncompromising dark satirical humour doesn't get much better than Monkey Dust, which I really miss. 

I saw that some people were recommending Only Fools and Horses, but for some reason that never really float my boat. However, it is considered a classic. 

Talking of classics, stop reading this and watch Spaced. It's fucking amazing and full of references that will make redditors fell like they're not quite so alone... 

Others that must be watched are Peep Show and The Inbetweeners.

*Edit: My brother just reminded me about Green Wing- brilliany mixture of surreal and one-liners. Also, early series of Teachers which had some brilliant background gags and stories. Bonus- Andrew Lincoln is in it (Rik Grimes).

Someone might mention Miranda. If you want to watch Miranda, close your eyes and imagine someone falling over. Well done, you've just watched every episode of Miranda.

On a side note I understand that's no such thing as a radio sitcom in America. I recommend a forgotten radio sitcom called The Department which stars John Oliver and all kinds of comedic phenoms. On a side, note I also recommend subscribing to The Bugle podcast with John Oliver and Andy Zaltzman.

I'm sure I've forgotten a bunch but I hope those will be added. Happy viewing!

Edit: It only just occurred to me that you might have have been asking me about my thoughts on how much time has passed for the Doctor and not about the cast lineups for future episodes. If that's the case, I base my belief that a long time has passed on River's absence after she said she would travel with him when and where he wanted (he asked so why he choose to stop travelling with her right off), the way Vastra &amp; Jenny describe the Doctor as 'never helping anyone anymore' and that he doesn't help 'anyone, not ever' (implying that they have been with him for an extended period where he does not involve himself), and the general darker/isolated demeanor the Doctor turns to when he has been without a companion for some time. And then, in this newest episode, it appears as though he had been in isolation for a long while since he has a reputation amongst the monks and the elder monk is clearly more knowledgable about him than the older. Granted there he could be jumping around time, but he appears to have abandoned the TARDIS during this time until the 'Bells of St John' (the phone) rang.

true,crackinthewall,silence,Silence,"I actually prefer the grand plot arcs over RTD's grand ending that are loosely tied to plot details of each episode. With Moffat, his work started way before he became the executive producer. River's mystery spanned a few series before we got to know who she really is. And now we got this mystery over what Clara is. She's certainly human but we don't know what made her like the way she is.

The Pond couple is more interesting for me than Rose because they shifted the focus of romance from the Doctor to themselves. It was fun seeing Rose and 9th and 10th's love blossom but after that, we had Martha who pined for the Doctor during her tenure. Aside from being the parents of River, they themselves were central to the overall plot like Rose was during Series 1. The joy in watching the Pond couple is watching them grow as characters as they try to strike a balance between married life and their desire to travel with the Doctor. Amy wanted to travel with the Doctor while Rory is more reluctant. We don't get that with unattached characters like Rose, Martha, Donna and possibly even Clara. Sure they have a life outside the TARDIS but they can come and go as they like. If they wanted to travel with the Doctor, they can just get up and leave and not worry about anyone else.

For quite a while, his Doctor didn't have much depth of character to me.  That's improving now that he's lost Amy and Rory though, and I'm hopeful for the second half of this series.

In the more recent series, Moffat seems to be using a few too many contrived plot points and messing around with the rules of the Whoverse just a little too much.  Obviously, in a show with time travel as a main plot device, you're going to have a fair bit of messing around with storylines, but he changes the rules *in universe* willy-nilly.

In particular, I don't think I can ever become comfortable with the way the Weeping Angels have been used.  This has been discussed at length on both /r/doctorwho and /r/gallifrey, but the crux of the discussion is that they have been so far removed from what they were when they first appeared in *Blink* that they're barely the same monster.  When we, the viewers saw them move in *Flesh and Stone*, they lost a lot of their mystery, and the Statue of Liberty being an Angel in *The Angels Take Manhattan* was a massive shark jumping moment.

Applying for jobs takes a LOT more time than you think. I'd recommend that you try and get an internship in first/second year. Some professions pay (Financial services) others do not (media/publishing though they'll pay for travelling if they're nice). If you're going for the big grad schemes my advice is to get an account with shl and practise numerical/verbal tests till you're sick of them. Get your knowledge of %s and ratios nailed down. It always shocked me as a humanities student (albeit one who had taken maths and science subjects till his final year) how many students prided themselves on mathematical ignorance.
Your uni careers service should do things like taster/assessment days/visiting days from relevant professions/drinks, where you should network like a mofo. Everyone hates networking but it is honestly very useful. Keeping a budget in halls will help you too.
Get involved in societies. It always baffled me the people who often had lots of free time and didn't join stuff. Sports/media/relevant interests are always huge, you make friends easily and you have lots of competencies to whack out for when you have the inevitable 'tell me about a time when...' questions.
Don't get with a) someone in your halls b) someone on your course c) someone in a student house. Don't go for the person across in the other room because he/she is near. For some people it'll work out but for the majority it will not.
Be honest about yourself where you want to go. I had an offer from UCL which most people told me to take over York but I chose York as my insurance choice because it seemed quieter, nicer, friendlier and less expensive to live. The course was also equally as good so it didn't make sense to me to chase imaginary prestige points. As I missed my offer for my firm choice, it meant I went to a university I was very happy about studying at.
Get a George Forman Grill. Seriously. (But clean the fat out the trough).
Do NOT panic about a student house unless you're somewhere like Aberystswyth where it's mental. Don't club together with the people from halls you don't really know immediately. Also be wary of letting agencies who will try and hit you with massive fees and usually make you pay rent way over what is necessary (york can be bad for this). Instead look at the private landlord list, don't rush immediately into finding somewhere. Know your rights as a tenant, push them if there's something you disagree with.
I would say also that what was very important for me was finding people on my course who were as crazy about my course as I was - really helped when finals tipped around!",0,1364748073,null,0,false,0,c95rzcy,t3_1b8kxi,t1_c95rzcy,t3_1b8kxi,null,1431720499,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

It's ridiculous that you can ring the Police about being burgled and then the officer sues you cos it's dark and she trips over. Burglars prefer to operate where it's dark. 

As such the Police should operate differently to other citizens as we expect them to put themselves in harms way to protect the public, and not subsequently sue the people they protected for injuries incurred.

However, many officers feel that this ""special"" position is being eroded and that they're being classed as ""normal"" citizens, doing ""normal"" jobs. It's an opinion that's been put forward on reddit many times. Therefore, in theory, why *shouldn't* they sue the people they protect if they get injured doing the job ? It's only the police, they're nothing fucking special.

If you or I had tripped over the kerb and sustained injury we'd have grounds for a claim. The garage owner was at fault.

She shouldn't be suing the garage owner as she was there to help him and catch a burglar.

true,FutileTheodicy,uk,United Kingdom,"I used to work for a phone company, front line - in terms of handling customers and their feedback.

First of all, if your aim is to attract customers, you're on the right path. Networks often have a tariff system for plans and the single biggest thing that customers would say is, 'I don't use that many minutes, could you take off some minutes and add more data?'. My strong suspicion is that the network I worked for would purposely give more minutes and less data than necessary, giving the customer a sense that they are getting a good plan on the minutes side and a fall sense of security for the data. Mobile phone networks seek profit and they rely on overspend, the tariffs are purposefully inadequate for that purpose and are not designed with customers in mind. That should be no big surprise. Therefore customers love a plan where they feel they are in control.

The problem is that a perfectly customisable plan would mean zero overspend, which means the company loses money. So it's just not realistic. What the companies try and do is give the illusion of customisation. I see you work for O2 - they let you choose and change from three data plans: 100MB, 500MB and 1GB: £3, £6 and £10. 100MB is inadequate for anything, 500MB isn't far off and the prices are not proportionate. With the 100MB bolt on you'll incur charges. It's an illusion of choice.

&gt; if the customer is looking for a 4G tariff 
&gt; They can add or remove texts/calls/data/4G completely if they wish

Are you suggesting 4G should be a chargeable upgrade from 3G? Hardly anyone is with EE because of the ridiculous prices. Three will shake up the market when they launch LTE because it will be available at no extra cost. If you really want to engage customers, you need to be competitively priced. 

&gt;  If they want tetherable data, they get to specify how much data they need 

No. No. No. If I pay a network, for say 5GB of data, I should be able to use that however I like. 5GB is 5GB whether I tether or not, so why should I be chagred extra? What difference does it make to the network how I use that 5GB? The only time tethering should be a chargeable addon is when the data is unlimited (as with Three) because not charging extra would just open you up to a huge amount of abuse.

&gt;  If they want loads of calls but hardly any texts they can have that too and vice versa.

Text messages cost networks close to nothing to carry. Why not innovate and standardise unlimited texts on all plans? That would engage customers.

&gt; text messages are not just tiny; they are also free riders, tucked into what’s called a control channel, space reserved for operation of the wireless network.
&gt; That’s why a message is so limited in length: it must not exceed the length of the message used for internal communication between tower and handset to set up a call. The channel uses space whether or not a text message is inserted.

With things like iMessage taking off, SMSes that cost the network £0, and VoLTE on the way, networks need to hurry up and realise that they're just dumb carriers supplying us with a wireless data connection.

As for something a little out of the box. O2 currently are horrendously uncompetitive on their Simplicity plans. Consider this. Consider giving the customer money BACK when they don't all use their various allowances each month - rather than it just being a retentions consideration. £41 a month plan for 1000 minutes, but only use 10? Here is £10 for you. 1GB but only use 100MB? Here is £1. Have this return increase the longer you are a customer.

Magic. Suddenly you are cheaper than other networks, but the comparison capability is messed so you don't have to worry about comparison sites as the differential level is too complex.

Also. Consider a no frills plan. Something with 0 minutes, 0 texts, 0GB and has just a very simple, very fair, rate for calls, texts and data. Not your usual outrageous prices mind.

Since half time lords are basically uncovered territory and regular time lords a.k.a the doctor don't seem to get old (in fact recently its been younger) she has to question whether or not she's got another chance, e.g come back as an old person or if this is the last regeneration.

Moffat is great at setting up the story bit the endings are always lacking and too often it's ""love saves the day"" or something silly like that. I'm also starting to get bored of the doctor always using his screwdriver to work out what's wrong with someone / something. 

If you rewatch *The Girl in the Fireplace* you can see a lot of future references woven in especially references to what's in a name/the doctors name and other things. In *Silence in the library/Forest of the Dead* River tells of the time she's going to die ""You turned up on my doorstep with a new haircut and a new suit"" and now the doctor has a new suit brilliantly setting up the future end of River. It  is this foreshadowing that aides it's rewatchability and it was this foreshadowing that I was hoping would take us into a new age of more adult doctor who but in the end MS was too young for it.

I don't have any reason to suspect that a private company *can't* be trusted to run the roads any better/worse than the highways agency.

What bothers me is that privatisation will lead to more toll roads.  We'll still be paying the same tax on petrol, the same road tax, and all the other taxes we pay that currently contribute to developing and maintaining the transport network.  

Once privatisation becomes the norm that money won't be used to build new roads any more.  Instead the contracts will be given to private companies who will then charge us to use the roads so that they can recoup their costs and then continue to make a healthy profit.

The proposal treats homes as essentially financial liabilities to be funded by the state, so billing people per room needed sounds an eminently sensible decision.

Agreed, they should have thought out the exemptions before announcing the changes, and personally I think the charges should have only applied where a person is offered a smaller property and refuses. But that is a side issue.

They key thing is that we have a fiscal decision -- but it was about ""people's homes"".

Now, to me personally, I live in rented accommodation and within some constraints, it is just a place to live. But for a lot of people is is their HOME.

That is a very different situation and where people feel that are losing not a place to sleep, but their *home*, then you can begin to see why the proposal generates such anger among those affected by the prospect of being evicted.

Talk about full of bullshit. Taxing the *poorest* in society? What a fucking joke!

The only people that will be affected are those getting what they don't need or deserve! Not like any of them should have free housing in the first place but that's how kind the United Kingdom is. But people shouldn't be taking the piss.

Those getting outraged should be smacked across the face. Clearly they didn't get any moral guidance from their parents and are just a blight on the country. Don't pay any attention to their bitching and whining. It's quite simple: if they want spare rooms they can get a job like the rest of us.

The DHS droid (or whatever they're called these days) asked him a bit more about what was wrong and then decided (without even waiting to see what the doctor said) that this made him unable to work, disabled even, and switched him to disability benefit (or whatever they call it these days).

They spent their days out riding their bikes, not worrying about, or being hassled to look for work.  I'm sure you can imagine a DT or DM headline berated the ""disabled"" benefit scroungers who are unfit to work but spend their days performing ""death-defying stunts"" doing ""extreme sports"".  But they were just doing what they were told to do.

I don't have any particular anti-Labour axe to grind.  I'm sure all parties are equally creative in their accounting practices to make the figures say what they want them to say.  As ianvisits, says, one party shifts it one way and the other shifts it back.

&gt;The poll of more than 1,000 doctors, nurses and practice managers **working in GP surgeries** revealed deep dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided by many hospitals, with **just 54 per cent** saying they would be happy for a member of their family to be treated there.
Doctors’ leaders said the findings suggested many clinical staff would be keen to use their new powers to pull funding away from their local service and into the hospitals which are rated best by the public.
**Frontline staff working in GP surgeries were, however, far more confident about the quality of services at their own practice. In total, 77 per cent said they would be happy for relatives to be treated there.**

My point is that if the poll showed 77% of frontline staff (which I can only assume to be Doctors, Nurses, HCA, Midwives and other AHPs) are happy for their relatives to go into hospital, it's not too bad.  Obviously we should work to fix the issues and concerns that the other 23% have, but for those in the know and working with their colleagues in secondary care centres (aka hospitals), their opinion seems to be largely positive.

You should also check out the National Association of Primary Care - who also supplied a quote to the article.  Especially their partners:

ESA (Income Based) is the direct replacement for Income Support.

However the key differences;

- The WCA assesses whether you will be capable of work at some point in the future (WRAG or Support Grouping)
- It is much harder to score points in the WCA (ESA) than it is in the PCA (IB). You may also notice a lot of those in the WRAG group should actually be in Support. This was particularly apparent when they introduced the 1 year limit to NI contribution based receipt when quite a number switched over to Support.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"I've got a nasty feeling that's what's going to happen (although I am by no means an expert on such matters).

The official interest rate is being kept artificially low because mortgages are so cheap.  Housing costs contribute a fairly big chunk (25%) of the Retail Price Index (RPI)  and slightly less (I forget what) of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), both of which are used to calculate the official inflation rate.  This RPI percentage has been increased steadily (15% in 1993, 20% in 2003, 25% in 2013 - or thereabouts - if memory serves) so that housing costs contribute an even larger effect on the inflation rate now than they have done before.

The end result is that the official inflation rate looks much lower than it really is.  Everything is going up in price, except having a mortgage which is really cheap (thanks to the low interest rate).  Cheap lending is offsetting the rising costs of everything else as far as the RPI is concerned.

The danger is that the inflation rate is now heavily dependent on the interest rate and extremely sensitive to change.  The cost of housing only has to increase a little to push the interest rate up sharply.  Or something else that we're dependent on has to get expensive.  Oil, gas, food to name just some of the usual suspects.  

The usual response in the face of rising inflation is to lower the interest rate to reducing housing costs, the RPI and ultimately the inflation rate.  But at 0.5% there's nowhere left to go.

I don't want to see it happen, and there's no doubt to be had that they are looking to include the private sector into the model, but a far left commentator concluding that it's moving away from universal coverage doesn't make it so.

That's the answer to why Benn's revolution hasn't happened.  For all the private sector is being included, there's still the health budget and there's still universal coverage and even the Conservatives can't move away from it, only reshape it.  The idea of people not receiving universal coverage just isn't there; they've even actively bolstered NICE.  Not where people think they want to take it, not where people think their goals are - what the actual reforms they've proposed do.

I like the NHS as it is.  I don't particularly want hospitals relying on private sector funding any more than I want to have to rely on the private sector for service.  I realise there might be need for fresh revenue streams because you can't commit to endlessly increasing NHS public spending as a percentage of GDP but I want the service to be ring fenced so that the hospitals may profit more but can only provide less to the private sector...but the hyperbole surrounding this and how it's a fast track to the US model is off the chart!",0,1364764321,null,0,false,0,c95wr7o,t3_1bdgmf,t1_c95wr7o,t1_c95w5lg,null,1431718177,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

true,ThePhlogist,,Barkeep! Something local and barely drinkable on the double.,"When I say poor policy I mean privatisation would undermine their own position. I don't mean that it would be better if they discouraged it which you seem to be implying they should have.  

Aside from the fact that they shouldn't be opposing government policies or agreeing (with them with them being impartial and all), if you can show some examples i'd be happy to see them. You seem to be assuming that reporting something without a snear or without expressing an opposite opinion is implicit support. The BBC will indeed report what the government press releases  say because as the public we need to know that stuff but just because they don't call David Cameron a tosser every other sentence doesn't make them in league with the government and somehow colluding in their own abolition. 

What does the BBC have to gain? What's their motive? How is it happening? Who thought it up? What happens [when they report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21986041) on other people [opposing the government](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21985441), did that just slip through the net?

You can't just dismiss the argument as 'pretty weak' just because you do not fully understand it. I respect your viewpoint, and I agree to some extent. But there is an element of ignorance in what you have said in your posts.

The medical equipment for some people takes up a lot of room, and somebody relies on it to live (Or at least, have a decent life). I wouldn't classify it as 'extra storage space' to them. For them it's more vital than a Kitchen, or a Bathroom. If for example, somebody was born without kidneys and requires dialysis. They may have been lucky enough to own a dialysis machine through charitable contributions. But they need somewhere to store it. Without that extra room their health will deteriorate to the point where they need to be in and out of hospital multiple times per week, which will greatly inconvenience this person and their family. It will also cost more for the government in the long run.

Obviously this is a special case, but this legislation was so ill-conceived and rushed through that special cases such as this weren't taken into consideration, at all. That is why there is such uproar about it. They need to go back and amend some of the finer details and actually listen to public concerns about certain circumstances that have been overlooked.

Sure, again, a small minority of people may abuse the charitable nature of food banks, this doesn't mean they don't need to exist for those in need.

It SHOULD however be a source of national shame that we've let it get to this, that hard working people are having to turn to charity because full time work isn't getting them enough money to get by.

Whatever happened to the idea of working for a living?  If you're doing a 35-40 hour week, that should be paying enough to get by, and if not, welfare should pick up the slack.

&gt; Research by the NHF says that while there are currently 180,000 households that are ""underoccupying two-bedroom homes"", there are far fewer smaller properties in the social housing sector available to move into. Last year only 85,000 one-bedroom homes became available. The federation has calculated that if all those available places were taken up by people moving as a result of the ""bedroom tax"", the remaining 95,000 households would be faced with the choice of staying put and taking a cut in income, or renting a home in the private sector.

true,Leonichol,cnty-uk,Geordie in exile (Surrey),"I've another thing for you.

Go have a look at TuGo. Especially O2 and Telefonica Spain's implementation and market positioning of it. Compare it to BT's 21CN rollout (VOIP backend replacing PSTN). Notice how they're all behind the scene's with very little market perception. What if O2 were to take a different approach...

You will pretty quickly see they are just standard SIP implementations (especially in TuGo's case. As this is just TLS secured SIP with a bit of JSON for authentication - I know, I spent a little time 'interfering' with it).

See if you can pre-empt competitors based on a prediction of where this technology will take O2 in the future. How will it compete being just another VOIP provider with a bit of backhaul and some masts? Especially with the current Ofcom release of 07 personal numbers.

What if Google Voice managed a UK rollout before O2 was ready with TuGo?

Can O2 be the UK VOIP provider to end them all? Can it make a tariff which incorporates SIP and therefore become the worldwide provider of choice for all UK calls. Can it be the Google Voice of the UK? It has everything it needs to do it - the ability to port mobile phone numbers to its network. A SIP implementation, an online dialer, an established presence. Etc. Hell, it even had its own broadband network for awhile - ensuring even TuGo users from other networks could have WiFi dialled using their Access Points.

Can you alter your presentation to include this? I assure you it will be very forward thinking and impressive ;).",0,1364766166,null,0,1364766585,0,c95xb99,t3_1bcy7l,t1_c95xb99,t3_1bcy7l,null,1431717915,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not in social housing myself and, as a single man, have absolutely no chance of ever being placed in social housing.  But even I can see that there is something deeply fishy about what IDS is up to here.

I suspect that what is actually going on here is that the Tories are attempting to force people out of social housing and into the private sector, and are using the bedroom tax as tool to make that happen.

False.  I have yet to see a proposal of replacing funding with private insurance the like we see in the US.

False.  NICE has actually been strengthened.

That too already exists in part.  It also exists in places like France, who are known for not being like the US but for having world leading health care.  


I'll say it again; comparing the reforms to the US is hyperbole in the extreme, and it's being used that way.

Let me refer to a previous post of mine on the subject [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1aa2ks/north_korean_domains_are_becoming_inaccessible/c8vnzki). It shows how coverage of Libya and Gaddafi went through several complete about-turns over ten years depending on the UK governments mood. 

In the BBC's defence, they are less biased when it comes to domestic politics. Except for Scottish Nationalism, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1a2m4j/bbc_enemy_action/) for example, in that their bias is almost vicious &amp; full of outright lies. 


&gt; just because they don't call David Cameron a tosser every other sentence doesn't make them in league with the government and somehow colluding in their own abolition. 

They don't have to call him names but there is still an implied support for the policy when contrary positions are not mentioned. For example, in selling us the fairly recent ""[austerity meme](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=austerity&amp;geo=GB)"" they rarely offer opinions from economists who argue that it's counter to economic growth and it cannot fix a recession. The government policy is always presented in a positive light.

If you wish an example of a significant story ignored by the BBC, see [this for example](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2013/03/24/how-the-nhs-will-be-quietly-privatised-from-april-1st-while-the-media-ignores-it/). In just 60 minutes from now the NHS essentially becomes privatised but you won't hear about it from the BBC.

&gt; What happens when they report on other people opposing the government, did that just slip through the net?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that a program of outright censorship exists. It's impossible to ignore the mass opposition of the ""bedroom tax"" policy, particularly on Easter Sunday when all of the major churches are talking about it. Your second link is about a criticism of a education policy, hardly upsetting the apple cart. 

&gt; What does the BBC have to gain? What's their motive? How is it happening? Who thought it up?

[Not getting fired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Dyke#Hutton_Report_and_resignation_from_BBC). But as [this link](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1522875/Revealed-how-the-BBC-used-MI5-to-vet-thousands-of-staff.html) shows, you don't get hired in the first place unless you pass the government ""counter-subversion vetting"". There has been no suggestion that this policy has changed in recent years. Every BBC presenter has to be pre-approved by MI5. 


&gt; What about the BBC's apparently rampant liberal bias?

Doesn't exist in terms of their news output. To prove this we need to make an assumption that ""liberals"" oppose the actions of Israel in the West Bank, which I think is a fair assumption. See [here](http://www.glasgowmediagroup.org/content/view/4) for a series of academic studies into the BBCs coverage of the issue that clearly demonstrates full support for the more right-wing perspective. 

I will agree though that the documentary &amp; current affairs teams are pretty left-wing. They were early adopters of climate change advocacy for example. 

&gt;If you can't identify how, from whom or why your conspiracy came about then it's not much of a theory.

&gt; The story begins for me in July 2000. Alan Milburn was Secretary of State for Health and was in the middle of negotiating a so-called concordat with the Independent Healthcare Association. The concordat said that from now on the NHS would take advantage of private sector healthcare providers on a regular basis, not just exceptionally, as for example in the annual winter beds crisis. The Independent Healthcare Association’s chief negotiator was Dr Tim Evans. I interviewed Tim Evans at the time. *He told me that his vision was that the NHS would be just ‘a kitemark attached to the institutions and activities of a system of purely private providers’.*

And further:

&gt; The target date of 2008 was too soon, but the job is now being completed by Mr Lansley. All NHS trusts are now required to become foundation trusts, or merge with a foundation trust, by 2014, and all community health staff have to be part of a foundation trust or a social enterprise by this coming April. *By 2014 all NHS services – acute hospitals, mental health hospitals and clinics, ambulance services, community health services and, of course, GP practices – will be run as independent businesses competing for patient income in a healthcare market.*

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"They also need to sort out exemptions for other situations. For example, I read somewhere in this thread that some legal custody agreements require the Father to have a spare room for the kids. This isn't taken into account either I believe. The reason I think it should be is that that bedroom serves a purpose; it is not wasted space, the house is not under-occupied.

They also need to sort out the bedroom occupation rules for children. The rules are shaped in such a way that some families with a Boy and a Girl will not be eligable for a 3 bedroomed place until one of their children reaches the age of 10. The rules should not immediately impact families in these sorts of situations, because it causes unnecessary cost and disruption to the families in order to avoid 'under-occupying their home.

Many have cited the argument that some areas don't have enough homes to accomodate people downsizing where they live. I don't have the facts to hand, but it is a pretty shocking idea that you could effectively be penalised for not moving into a smaller home that isn't available to you. That's not to mention whether they can afford to move to that smaller home, there are significant costs involved in moving home which far outweight the savings from a lower rent (Bearing in mind that rent is not directly proportional to bedrooms. A one-bedroomed flat could cost £300pcm and a 2 bedroom could cost £350pcm, but would involve paying £700 upront (£350 bond + first rent payment) ontop of estate agent fees, which can be as high as £150. Add this to moving costs, and you get a situation where people don't have the option to move, but are being penalised for it.

The government principle is right, benefits should not pay for spare rooms. but the rules and guidelines that decide whether a home is under-occupied are just unrealistic. Let's be honest here, this is not about effective utilisation of social housing, this is about reducing the benefit bill at the expense of recipients. This legislation (in it's current form) is so out of touch with reality that it's not even funny. People who are effectively on the breadline are going to suffer as collatoral damage (Because I can't say hand on heart that there aren't homes that are under-occupied) just because it makes a few numbers on a page look better.",0,1364767610,null,0,false,0,c95xrqc,t3_1bdd42,t1_c95xrqc,t1_c95xctd,null,1431717699,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Currently, there are a large number of countries in a currency union with no fiscal union. If one of these countries collapses, leaves or has a sufficiently abhorrent government elected (Golden Dawn in Greece for example), the contagion could cause the Euro to collapse. For 4 years the Eurozone has desperately tried to prevent this and it's still not out of the woods yet. If the Euro collapses, this directly and immediately affects the economies of 17 countries.

Are you honestly saying that the complete economic collapse of 17 countries and a major world currency would have no impact on civil and political order both in the UK and elsewhere, and that the UK would not either through treaties (such as those with France) or through obligations with NATO be required to assist in military operations in the event of such a collapse?

By using the term ""conflict on our doorstep"" I'm referring to military action within EU countries, with the potential for contagion to spread further.

They have to treat a certain percentage of public NHS patients, or to put it another way, they're limited on their private services, although they are now allowed to charge those choosing to go private but using the same facilities more.

I was a Virgin Media customer since the days when they were Telewest.  When the Tivo boxes came in a couple of years ago they started offering them free to new customers but didn't offer me one.  When I rang up to enquire about getting one (in return for signing up for another year) they told me I would have to pay £50 to have it ""installed"" (i.e. plugged in to the socket) plus an extra £10 per month to rent it.  Needless to say, I declined.

Before Christmas I decided to move to TalkTalk (unlimited internet for £3.25 per month), so I rang VM to cancel my service.  The chap on the phone started to talk to me about giving me a good deal if I was willing to continue, but the numbers he quoted were just the new customer prices from the VM website, including the £50 installation fee.  I told him the cost of the TalkTalk package I was moving to but he refused to budge.  I even asked him if he would waive the installation fee, but he refused.  So I just went ahead and cancelled.

Since then they have written to me every few weeks asking me to come back, but they just keep quoting the same prices again and again.  It's as if they have simply decided what their service is worth, and insist that they must be paid that amount regardless of what their competitors are charging.

**Edit**: I notice that others have had more luck negotiating with VM.  Maybe it depends on the time of the month, or the region you're in, but in my case they just outright refused to offer me anything other than new-customer prices despite the fact that I had been with them for about 10 years.",0,1364771790,null,0,1364793503,0,c95z3ou,t3_1bd6ep,t1_c95z3ou,t3_1bd6ep,null,1431717072,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's nuts (and typical of the tories on this subreddit) to deny that poverty has increased in the last year or two.

Realistically, people don't like receiving charity - it's shameful. That's what keeps people from abusing these kinds of charities.

Myself, I would far rather have two or three quid to buy myself a ready-meal at Tesco than have to eat tinned carrots and mushy peas.

You are revising the official account, none of these people were insurgents, and it is clear from the video that the vast majority of these men weren't carrying any sort of weapon, real or contrived. There were clearly civilians here, a war crime in itself. Without hyperbole that event was essentially a bloodlusting target fixated trigger happy militant, killing bystanders.

&gt; The 'context' section is particularly relevant. It kind of invalidates a lot of your post.

That context section is trash and aligns with the general ""fog of war civilians got caught in a cross fire"" which is the initial fobbing off Reuters was given. The video is all the context that is needed, the CNN reporter (hardly a trustworthy source) is pulling in facts to smooth out the atrocity. In fact parts of that article feels incredibly sanitised. At least it included the part where they destroy a building they have no clue if it was occupied: ""the owner of the building who said that three families had been living in there and seven residents had died, including his wife and daughter"". The section titled [""2007–2009 coverage""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike#2007.E2.80.932009_coverage) is far more noteworthy.

The BLS in the United States is undoubtedly doing just that - massaging (by including certain things and not others, e.g, housing) and even [flat out doctoring their figures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwI3Nya5L9g). Their inflation right now is likely around 7-8 percent and rising, i.e over double what they report.

So, are we inherently more honest than Americans? Is the ONS a morally superior organisation than the BLS? Although I cannot be certain about them lying (do you consider [this](http://www.engagedinvestor.co.uk/inflation-understated-for-12-years/1462914.article) to be lying?), they undoubtedly give their figures a thorough ""massage.""
