For me it started with Sherlock, BBC version, created by Moffat and Gatiss. I liked Sherlock, and was mildly interested in other projects this pair did together. It was the first time I heard about Doctor Who and I decided to try these series sometime.

Then I bought myself a couple of t-shirts with Doctor costumes printed on them. They are still my favorites: I can wear a t-shirt and look like I'm wearing a complete suit, including a tie and a watch chain. People get fooled. Even my colleagues asked once why I dress so formally for work.

Then I decided that - oh well, I cannot wear Doctor Who's clothes and still have no idea who he is. I must at least try to watch it. I don't like watching series in general (Sherlock's 6 episodes were almost out of my comfort zone), so I told myself: just one episode. Just one. Let's see where it leads.

It was three weeks ago, and tonight I'm going to start with Series 3. I watched 2 seasons already, and I'm just happy there are another 5  to watch, so it won't end too quickly. I'm slightly paranoid on the street (especially in presence of uncommon lights and sounds), and a bit pissed off that I cannot discuss Doctor Who with my friends: none of them seen it, and they do not intend to.

GCSEs:Taken during Year 11 (5th year of secondary school) these exams consist of maths, English, science and other optional subjects. Each subject chosen is a 'GCSE' in that subject, and subjects can number over 10, for instance a student can achieve 10 GCSEs whilst at school or maybe 7 GCSEs, depending on how many they chose to study (although there is usually a minimum number that one must study) . GCSEs mark the end of compulsory education and are taken by 16/17 year olds. Some will leave school at this point whilst others will continue study if their GCSE grades are good enough.

A levels: 'Advanced levels', these qualifications last two years and are voluntarily taken at a sixth form in the student's school or an independent College (British understanding of the term), usually comprising of three or four subjects, such as maths or English, none of which are compulsory. These qualifications are required to apply to a university and range from A* to U in grades. A student will have to study the relevant A levels before applying for certain degrees, such as Chemistry/Maths/Biology  for medicine or perhaps English/Geography/History for an arts degree.

4,000 characters is their max, so stick to that.

Best advice is to search 'personal statement' + 'whatever your subject' is into Google, find an Oxbridge applicant, copy the structure and put your own experiences in. 

If you are in a full-time job, which you sound like you are, you've already done more than the vast majority of candidates.

They include English, Maths, Science and an entire range of other optional subjects. You can leave school with this qualification and gain access to work schemes, apprenticeships or a job at maccy d's.

A levels are the more advanced certificates, usually taken over 2 years and completed by the age of 18. AS levels are the first year of an A level course, and are a qualification in their own right, but usually people will complete the two years and gain the full qualification. It's possible to study a vast range of subjects at AS/A level, and it's usually done as part of a sixth form at a school, or a separate sixth form college.

A levels generally lead to a University place, an advanced apprenticeship or simply a nice way to add to your first proper CV. If you do wish to go to Uni, A levels are weighted on a tariff with UCAS (University admission type people) and determine the Uni you can attend.

There are A level equivalents in vocational subjects, such as a BTEC, which also help kick start a career or lead the way to further education.

Definitely go to a pub--not a commercialised one in a city centre (stay away from anything that says 'Wetherspoons' on it at all costs!), but a traditional one in the country. They're all over the place and most villages will have one. Since you're in Kent you have got to try some proper Kentish ale too.

As for food, I actually would recommend Wetherspoons if you want to try some traditional, hearty English food--bangers and mash and the like. Most restaurants don't actually serve traditional English food. Pubs will, but they can be a bit unreliable when it comes to food so I'd look for one that's recommended for its food.

Don't tip too much or you'll end up spending a lot of money--just 10% or so if the service has been particularly good.

Definitely nip over to France, but as others have said, keep in mind that it will take a while and probably involve some hassle. Perhaps you could consider staying overnight over there.

You should definitely go up to London since it's only an hour away on the train from Ashford (and you really don't want to drive there!). There's so much to do there that it's hard to recommend anything in particular, but you should be able to find plenty to keep you interested.

Definitely go to Dover castle and if you've got time have a walk up on the Western Heights on the other side of the harbour which are pretty spectacular (don't worry about looking at the town, it's a shithole).

Definitely do Canterbury--especially the cathedral, st. Augustine's Abbey and some of those pubs I mentioned earlier, and the shopping's good there too.

If you end up travelling around the country definitely get down to Dorset if you can--it's got some of the nicest countryside in England, lots of picturesque little villages--Corfe is probably my favourite, plus it's got a great castle--great rural pubs, a fantastic coastline and the best beaches in the country at Bournemouth. It's well worth a day trip in my opinion. The Lake District is also a must-see, and if you get that far north you may as well go that bit further and see Hadrian's Wall.

Edit: Wow, massive wall of text. Sorry. (not really.)


&gt; We are not of this race. We are not of this earth. Susan and I are wanderers in the fourth dimension of time and space.


-One


&gt; Logic, my dear Zoe, merely enables one to be wrong with authority.


-Two


&gt; Yes, well, the definition of the word 'humanity' is always a rather complex question, isn’t it?


-Three


&gt; A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting.


-Three


&gt; There's no point being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes.


-Four


&gt; I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast.


-Five


&gt; In all my travelling throughout the universe, I have battled against evil, against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed here. The oldest civilisation: decadent, degenerate, and rotten to the core. Power-mad conspirators, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen - they're still in the nursery compared to us. Ten million years of absolute power. That's what it takes to be really corrupt.


-Six


&gt; Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.


-Seven


&gt; So, in Year 50 at the Academy, it was me who fed the snapping wortfowl Valyez's summer project.


-Eight


&gt; You flinched! You flinched!! When I said 'time'! There!! You did it again there! Like an actor hearing 'MacBeth'! I-I-I mean the Scottish play!


-Eight


&gt; Break, damn you! Break! You've never had a spanner like this thrown in you! Chew on me till your teeth crack. Grind me up till your gears lock. I'm the nail in your tyre, the potato jammed in your exhaust pipe, the treacle poured in your petrol tank. I'm the banana peel beneath your foot, the joker that ruins your straight flush, the coin that always comes up heads and the gun you didn't know was loaded. I am the Doctor!


-Eight


&gt; Let me think. An utterly transparent ploy is called for.


-Eight


&gt; Well, this is a welcoming committee. Any tea? No. Perhaps some cake. I love a bit of cake.


-Eight


&gt; I am the man that gives monsters nightmares. The Daleks call me the Bringer of Darkness. I am the Eighth Man Bound. I am the Champion of Life and Time. I'm the guy with two hearts. I make History better. I am the Doctor.


-Eight


&gt; Do you know like we were sayin'? About the Earth revolving? It's like when you're a kid. The first time they tell you that the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it 'cause everything looks like it's standin' still. I can feel it. The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinnin' at 1,000 miles an hour and the entire planet is hurtling around the sun at 67,000 miles an hour, and I can feel it. We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... That's who I am.

&gt; There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Oh, you should have seen it! That old planet... The second sun would rise in the south, and the mountains would shine. The leaves on the trees were silver, when they caught the light, every morning it looked like a forest on fire. When the autumn came, a brilliant glow through the branches...


-Ten


&gt; I'm old enough to know that a longer life isn't always a better one. In the end, you just get tired; tired of the struggle, tired of losing everyone that matters to you, tired of watching everything you love turn to dust. If you live long enough, Lazarus, the only certainty left is that you'll end up alone.


-Ten


&gt; I just want you to know, there are worlds out there, safe in the sky because of her. That there are people living in the light, and singing songs of Donna Noble. A thousand, million light years away. They will never forget her, while she can never remember … But for one moment... one shining moment... she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe.


-Ten


&gt; There's something you better understand about me, 'cause it's important and one day your life may depend on it. I am definitely a madman with a box!

&gt;I'm not running away. But this is one corner of one country on one continent on one planet that's a corner of a galaxy that's a corner of a universe that is forever growing and shrinking and creating and destroying and never remaining the same for a single millisecond, and there is so much, so much, to see, Amy. Because it goes so fast. I'm not running away from things, I am running to them. Before they flare and fade forever. And it's alright. Our lives won't run the same. They can't. One day, soon, maybe, you'll stop. I've known for a while.

Last of my generation to get through uni before 9k fees.

In theory I have done everything right so far. Never found myself needing to sign on. Have been lucky enough to at least have part time work from the age of 16.

But...who do I vote for?

The Tories are ripping the country apart for ideological reasons. I appreciate some cuts and budget freezes were required though, i understand money doesnt grow on trees.

Labour overspend whenever they are in power, hoping somebody years down the line will pick up the tab. My parents generation took the benifit of that though. They were working class and did well for themselves, i was first in the family to go to uni. Social mobility for that generation was good.

I used to vote Lib Dem. I now look forward to seeing Cleggs resignation in the next general election.

UKIP? Some nice ideas. Sadly far more stupid ones. Also, letting any idiot represent the party locally is backfiring no matter what the intentions of Farage.

All I want from the next 10 years of my life is to be able to afford my own home. Tired of renting a shoebox with my gf.

I'm apprehensive to have children any time soon. I fall somewhere inbetween having enough money to support their upbringing, and having not enough for the government to support me in doing so. It does upset me to see other people having children that can cannot afford, and then being given bigger and bigger houses as their families grow. I've been working 10 years and cannot do that.

If anybody could show me somebody worth voting for, id appreciated it. If there was a GE tomorrow I would probably spoil my vote.

For mine I split it into thirds. Firstly why I was interested in my chosen subject (Politics), secondly why I think I was a good candidate for the place and thirdly a little about me.

Some of my friends spent weeks writing theirs, agonising over little details, but most of mine was bullshit and exaggeration. I got great offers for my chosen subject and had very little to actually recommend me on as my predicted grades were pretty bad ( BBD, previous years average offer was ABB and I got an offer of BB) and I had done nothing like volunteering or Duke of Edinburgh or anything really. So I have to think that my offer was largely based on my personal statement and teachers recommendations.


Here is a good example of one for my course

&gt;The unpredictability of politics is what makes it such a fascinating subject for me. A particular topic that sparked my interest is the extremely volatile relationship between one established superpower and one rising giant: the USA and India. The relationship between these two nations has been completely transformed in recent years following India's globalisation and development of nuclear arms. This is highly significant today as India is representative of an increasing number of rapidly expanding and politically-insecure nations arming themselves with nuclear weapons. My curiosity about their relationship led me to read Mira Kamdar's 'Planet India' which has given me a detailed insight into the political pressures India faces from much of the Western world. I especially enjoyed reading about Pokhran-II, when India defied the existing nuclear powers by successfully engineering the testing of nuclear devices in 1998, significantly weakening the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The political precariousness generated by acts such as this makes the study of politics in the current century more vital and relevant than ever before.

&gt;""The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it"". Marx's statement reflects the importance of being involved in politics, and inspired me to join both the pressure group Libertarian UK and the Conservative Party. I joined the latter primarily in response to my feelings on the different party reactions to the current economic crisis. The Conservative response, demonstrated by the proposal to tax non-domiciled residents, has ostensibly been more concerned with promoting social 'fairness' than some of Labour's recent policies (particularly the initial abolition of the 10p tax band), perhaps indicating a subversion of traditional left/right politics. To widen my political knowledge, I completed an internship at the Labour Party HQ and constituency office of Karen Buck MP. It gave me a valuable insight into the relationship between national and constituency level politics, and I was responsible for communicating with governmental departments and quangos.

&gt;I also attended a debate in the House of Lords which focused on the implementation of ID cards. This matter brings to the fore the question of our civil rights in relation to the state and whether an increasing amount of authoritarian legislation can be justified. Additionally, I participated in a Model United Nations where I represented the delegation of Malaysia on the Security Council. I enjoyed the opportunity to research foreign policy and
debate major issues such as the expansion of the ASEAN. The excitement of the London Mayoral election in May encouraged me to represent Boris Johnson in my school's mock Mayoral election where I was able to refine my public speaking and campaigning skills. I also run my school's History and Politics Society, through which I have organised and attended many lectures given by MPs and MEPs, such as the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development.

&gt;My love of languages prompted me to study French A-level where, in my oral, I examined the destruction of the French aristocracy and the birth of a democratic government. In Economics and Politics, I enjoy exploring fiscal policy and both its political and social repercussions.

&gt;I have completed Bronze, Silver and recently Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. I ran Football Club and Modern Languages Club at school, which considerably improved my leadership skills. On a weekly basis I volunteer at Oxfam and also visit a pensioner. Volunteering demonstrates the significant role that civilians can play in shaping a responsible and compassionate society. I was working with the very people whose lives are most affected by government policy, those for whom political direction is most important. 


First paragraph mentions why they are so interested in the subject, goes on to talk about specific examples, and give books and the like of what they've read.

Goes on to mention interests in linked areas in this case philosophy as well as shows they have experience in their chosen field by getting an internship and going to a debate in the House of Lords. 

Finally they talk a little about other things in their life, about their french a-level and their Duke of Edinburgh awards but note they use up little space relatively for this.

Firstly, Real Madrid cannot act like this and then expect to get the player anyway. Any punishment they would receive would probably not do a club with their power/resources much damage, with the exception of a transfer embargo which would be extremely unlikely. At the very least I would want our reaction to be refusing to sell to Madrid at least.

Secondly, and similarly, I do not want to see my club be bullied by Suarez like this. He is a magnificent player but this behaviour is unacceptable. I do not agree with the whole 'get rid of him, he wants to go and we'll be better off without him' stuff, he is simply too good and the repercussions of our club being seen as a). a selling club and b). pushovers does not sit right with me. If he LOVES the club so much I'm sure he'd be able to knuckle down and not sulk too much. Let him go in a year if we still haven't got the CL football he deserves, I might have been willing to let him go this summer for it but if you act like this you sacrifice that right to me.

For now, wait until he gets back. Bollock him and say that under no circumstances will he be sold please FSG. If only you'd kept your mouth shut and shown the club who have stuck with you through thick and thin some respect you might have been granted permission to be sold, despite the legally binding contract you recently signed and which has 3 more years on it.

true,heffalump232,null,null,"As a ""young voter"" who doesn't vote Conservative, here's why I think many of my peers would vote Conservative: the Left has produced no new ideas since Margaret Thatcher.

Whether you think that what the Conservatives are doing, what they are doing is new, in some ways radical. It's what brought many people from working-class backgrounds into the Thatcherite rank and file: doing something new. 

And even if the policies aren't new, 19th century politics such as Gladstonian liberalism remain ever more relevant today, such as free trade and low intervention and regulation, as London is back to being a world city, a financial hub as it had been in days of Empire. People, like in the 19th century, are flocking to live there in search of employment. 

Meanwhile, all I've heard from the Left in form of UK Uncut and the People's Assembly is re-hashes of old policies, ready to be stereotyped and lampooned: ""Jail the bankers!"" ""No cuts!"" ""Tory scum!"" ""Socialist revolution!"" It's the 1970s and 1980s all over again, and we know who won. As I read somewhere, they don't seem to have realised that the USSR ended 20 years ago. And all the while, they are ignored and the government continues its programmes of privatisation etc., safe in the knowledge that no-one is listening to them.

There is a reason why Blair was elected in 1997: he was something new. The Labour Party still fawns for him because he was a breath of fresh air. Indeed, someone like Blair, although I would prefer someone slightly to the left of him, akin to Hugh Gaitskell (best PM we never had), I think, would be welcomed by voters and by young people.

The price for a season ticket from Gillingham (Kent) to London is £107.40 per week including a Travelcard which means you can get to Barnet from Charing Cross. (You can also pay extra—£130.50/week—to travel on the fast High Speed One trains into St. Pancras.) There are substantial discounts if you buy your ticket for a longer period, and if it's an annual ticket (very expensive!) you also get perks thrown in like discounts on some other journeys, occasional free tickets etc. This is called a Gold Card.

National Rail Enquiries has a [season ticket calculator](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search) which you can use to work out the prices. It's worth noting that if you're studying at a university, Transport for London (London's public transport authority) also offer a special type of Oyster card called an 18+ student photocard—this gives you 30% off Oyster Travelcard fares. It *may* be cheaper for you to get a paper season ticket to the Oyster boundary and then a discounted Travelcard for the rest of the way. Ask your university for advice.

As for trying to commute by coach, it's not worth it—car, don't even go there!

true,Blue_note,null,null,"So, a couple things I feel should be addressed in your summation of Torres at this point. And I think it should be noted that your disdain for Torres is well documented, to a point that I think your frustrations with Torres blinds you to some of the positive things he does for this club. But I digress. 

&gt;Look at Ba just half season at Chelsea where most of his appearance was off the bench you guys want him gone because he not your ideal charismatic looking center forward 

I think your painting with a pretty broad brush here. You make it seem as if everyone wants Ba gone, which isn't necessarily true. I think we could all agree he's been slightly disappointing since joining our club. His goal return in the league was blistering with Newcastle before he came to SW6 (13 goals in 20 apps), and once he strapped on his Chelsea boots he notched an unimpressive 2 goals in 14 apps. I think the interesting correlation here is that much like Torres, we were able to bring in a Striker who is proven to provide a solid return in terms of league goals, and completely stifle their production. I honestly think it's worth considering that Torres' drop in goal production isn't *soley* his fault. We've now seen Ba, Torres and Sturridge all struggle with goal tallies in a Chelsea shirt, but bag plenty of goals in other sides. There seems to be a trend of striker's struggling to keep their goals/games ratio at Chelsea. 

&gt;Torres with over 100 plus games under his belt is defended every time you mention him.

For starters, I honestly think there are more Torres critics on this sub then there are supporters. There has been more than enough criticism of his play to go around, so don't play the victim here. Secondly, the reason he *still* has many come to his defense is because everyone knows just how great he was. He was beyond a proven world class striker, and bc of his age and health, there are still plenty of reasons to think it's possible to believe he could return to this form one day. I realize *you* don't believe this (and I'm not even saying I do) but it's understandable that some people do, which is why many leap to his defense. To this same point, Ba has not achieved half of what Torres has. Because of this, his performances (while often times as dismal as Torres' are) are not defended with nearly as much conviction because his abilities are still well within the realm of skepticism given his shorter list of accomplishments. 

&gt; **If you think we can win the Premier League with Torres as our main striker you must be delusional.** Look at the Barcelona, Madrid, PSG, United, City, Liverpool, and compare their front man to ours and see the big difference.

I'll be the first to admit to this *delusion* if you will. Over the last couple of years our squad has proven very capable of achieving success without having a striker that bags loads of goals. Obviously we won the CL last year, doing so without a single striker scoring 15 goals in all competitions (Drogba &amp; Sturridge led all Chelsea Fwds in Goals with 13 in all comps, Torres scored 11). We also managed to win the FA Cup as well, which is quite an impressive double considering we didn't really have a potent striker. The year before (2010-11) Chelsea finished 2nd in the league, and Drogba lead all Chelsea Fwds in league goals with a whopping 11 league tallies. Yet we still managed to finish ONE place off of the league title. Which leads me to my final point. 

&gt;Can Chelsea be successful with Torres leading the line?

I realize you didn't raise this question specifically, but nonetheless is clearly what you criticize anyone on this sub for actually believing. I think we absolutely can be. Not only for the reasons outlined in my last point, but bc this team has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that we can provide goals from **all over the pitch**. We don't need Torres (or any striker for that matter) to put up Messi/Ronaldo/RVP/Suarez type numbers because we have so many other players who score in the double digits. Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Lampard and Moses all scored 10+ goals last season. Hell Cahill, Luiz and Iva combined for over 20 goals! The point being that it's not necessary for our striker to score 30+ goals (as much as we'd all love to see that). Torres still directly contributed to 34 goals last season (22 g, 12 a) which means he was directly involved in almost a quarter of all goals scored last season. 

To wrap up (apologies for such a lengthy response), Yes I do value Torres as a contributor, Yes I **do** think he has provided value as a forward, and I **do** think his contributions (while not what anyone may have expected) are worth defending.

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"&gt;You make it seem as if everyone wants Ba gone, which isn't necessarily true. I think we could all agree he's been slightly disappointing since joining our club. His goal return in the league was blistering with Newcastle before he came to SW6 (13 goals in 20 apps), and once he strapped on his Chelsea boots he notched an unimpressive 2 goals in 14 apps.

You claim Ba been slightly disappointing since joining the Club with 2 Premier League goals in 14 appearance, Torres have 8 in 28 and have been given countless amount of chances to prove his worth Ba been here for 6 months and half of the subs want him gone because. Same thing with Torres he scored 65 for Liverpool in 102  games when he switched the Red for Blue he bagged an unimpressive 15 in 85 while costing us 50 million.

&gt;For starters, I honestly think there are more Torres critics on this sub then there are supporters. There has been more than enough criticism of his play to go around,

What are you talking about, Torres circlejerk on this sub is the strongest I've ever seen. There are more fangirl on here then anywhere.

&gt;  the reason he still has many come to his defense is because everyone knows just how great he was.

Nope, can u explain how great he was, he scored against minnows, He was great in the Europa League I don't want a Chelsea player best performance to  come in the Europa League what does that say about him. Torres wasnt great last season he scored 8 Premier League goals in 28 appearances that is not great iif we want to win the League. He scored 3 Champions League goals I was a keeper error and 2 came against Nordsjælland still cant consider that great. he's currently sitting on 5 goals in Brazil 4 came against Tahiti and 1 against Nigeria. Still not great Torres is being baby by the Majority of Young and new Chelsea fans I dont know if it just on here or in general. 

&gt;He was beyond a proven world class striker, and bc of his age and health, there are still plenty of reasons to think it's possible to believe he could return to this form one day.

Give me one example or anything that make you think he'll return to his old form.

&gt;I'll be the first to admit to this delusion if you will. Over the last couple of years our squad has proven very capable of achieving success without having a striker that bags loads of goals. Obviously we won the CL last year, doing so without a single striker scoring 15 goals in all competitions (Drogba &amp; Sturridge led all Chelsea Fwds in Goals with 13 in all comps, Torres scored 11). We also managed to win the FA Cup as well, which is quite an impressive double considering we didn't really have a potent striker. The year before (2010-11) Chelsea finished 2nd in the league, and Drogba lead all Chelsea Fwds in league goals with a whopping 11 league tallies. Yet we still managed to finish ONE place off of the league title. Which leads me to my final point.

Look at all the times we won the League or any other clubs over the last 6 years there have always been a striker in double digits in goal, CFC 04/05 Gudjohnsen had 12 and lamps had 13 with 16 assists, 05/06  Drogba had 12 with 11 assists while Lamps had 16 goals and 8 assists, 09/10 Drogba had 29 goals and 13 assists while Lamps had 22 and 17 assists. 10/11 United won with Berbatov scoring 27 goals, 11/12 City won and Aguero scored 23 goals, last year United won and RVP scored 26 goals. If you catch my drift, we cannot win the League with our main Striker scoring in 8 in 28. There is a difference between the League and Tournament we're great at winning Tournament but to win the League you have to be consistent for 38 weeks. You dont have to play at your best to win Tournament like Wenger said Chelsea is a great or the best Tournament team. when we won the Champions League Drogba scored 6 goals in 670 minutes while Messi scored 14 in 990. 10/11 was not a great year we just won the league the previous year and United kept it a close race we won by one points, When none of our players scored in the double digits the previous season we lost our crown by 9 points so  that wasn't a great achievement. (thanks for proving my point about having a double digit striker on our team)

&gt;I realize you didn't raise this question specifically, but nonetheless is clearly what you criticize anyone on this sub for actually believing. I think we absolutely can be. Not only for the reasons outlined in my last point, but bc this team has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that we can provide goals from all over the pitch. We don't need Torres 

All those players you listed were goals were crucial but you cannot always count on them to scored when we have a 50 million dollar striker on the field. Those guys bail us out because our 50 million man couldnt do his job. How fast was Mata had to pull of tricks to save our ass last season we will not get lucky every time. What the point of having Torres if he's not going to do what he was bought to do. It like buying a vacuum cleaner to vacuum your carpet but not using it because it is not sucking up all the dirt from the floor and you end up going to your old broom always come to your rescue in the clutch. If we pay 50 million for Torres and he's not banging in  goal he useless to the team.

&gt;The point being that it's not necessary for our striker to score 30+ goals (as much as we'd all love to see that). 

It not necessary for our striker to pay 50 million but if we pay 50 million for him we expect at least 20 plus goal per season. Madrid pay good money for CR7 and expected so much out of him and he deliver so did United so why should we pay the maximum for Torres and settle for less is he special that he should be treated differently from all the other flops we bought.

Consider this frog: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrobates_azureus; It's bright blue, very easy to spot...and are used by tribes to make poison arrows. 

Consider this butterfly: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly; It's bright orange / red, very easy to spot...and also poisonous. Granted, some predators are immune to its poison, or can tolerate a high level of poison before dying...or have learned to eat only certain parts...but there are waaaay easier meals. If you had the choice of an earthworm, which presumably has very little in the way of poisons, or a Monarch butterfly, where you will probably dance with death...which are you going to choose?

So it is with the Doctor...especially this one. He's toxic to his enemies, quite literally poison to them. He dresses garishly because he doesn't need to hide, like a prey animal, nor is he stalking anyone, like a predator animal...he's just telling anyone who's looking at him, and thinking ""I can take him"" that, if they know anything about animals, they are most likely going to come off significantly worse for wear from the engagement.

It's the equivalent of eating several cloves of garlic, shooting yourself up on some stimulants, then going for a stroll in a town filled with vampires while wearing an evening gown. The dumb vampires will think ""easy,"" and as soon as they sink as fang into you, will die; the smart ones will wonder why someone decided to drive to their little town, that everyone is fleeing from (or trying to), and decided to wear clothing that could only lead to one possible outcome...especially when you're reading a book in the middle of a park known for attacks, and haven't been asking around about joining up.

&gt;When I see this, I think of the lives of the 300 or so people - where they are in
life and where they are going. There is no truly mundane story in humanity, each
person has something important to share.  
I also think of the wonders of physics, and how we have captured this part of the
universe in our grip and forced its fluids to flow around us to lift us into the air.
With the stars I think of ancient mysteries, indeed each star is a slice of the
history of the universe.   
Closer to my heart, I think about my father who is out of the country while my
grandmother is on her deathbed.   
I think of my uncle who passed away from thrombosis after taking a flight.   
I think of my own family, who look to me as a father and a husband, and the
weight of responsibility I have chosen to carry.   
I think of myself, my choices, my place, my future. I could just fly away, but I'd

true,SouthPads,cnty-england,England,"Well in my view, marriage was about community and family honouring tradition. It was the strongest declaration of straight-faced commitment to love two people could make.

Nowadays it's just about the party and a short lived relationship which lasts long enough to knock out a sproglet or three but no longer. Resulting in endemic single parent families and fatherless homes where confused and angry children make the mistakes of their parents at even younger ages.

For this reason the ""tradition"" defence of the institution of marriage has very little merit. Gay people want to get married and before have not been able to. In my eyes they are far more likely to relish the ability to cast their commitment to love in iron than some twazzack who spends 20 grand on the party and is divorced within 10 years if not much sooner.

Tl;dr:

Gays aren't killing traditional marriage values, straight couples already butchered and repackaged any meaning it ever had.

Not in a line, more in a... group, really, at the bar. Serving staff will know who's next as the group filters people towards the bar, though mistakes are sometimes made. You may have to be a bit assertive about it if it's really busy. If you're served ahead of someone you know was before you, mention it - this is good manners and virtually guarantees that you're next. You'll read the situation and know how to act.

&gt;Is food ordered at the bar?

Depends on the pub, but usually, yes. If in doubt go and ask.

&gt;Is it true that no one tips?

Yup. You might tip the bar staff by adding ""and one for you"" or something onto the order and the staff will take a couple of quid from your change, but it's not expected and often just goes in a mixed pot rather than to the individual. Restaurants are different and you might leave a tip on the table if you feel the service/food merited it.

We needed Fernandihno for the position, we don't exactly NEED Isco for his position. The value of the player depends on how much he is worth to the club. Isco would have been great but in all honesty, we already have players who can play in his position.

While we can balk at the money we paid for a ""28 year old with 5 int caps"", we cannot deny that we need someone a little more world class than Barry to hold the midfield, so that we can allow Yaya to press forward.

Think about it, Fernandihno in De Jong's position, Yaya steam rolling through the centre, Silva on the left, Jesus on the right, Aguero lurking around and Edin ready to head-in. Then we have Nasri who can also fill in, Milner too, both good crossers of the ball.

The one thing I learned about trying to get cheap flights is that in the grand scheme of things, the cost of your flight compares very little to the overall cost of your holiday and accommodation. If you get a job, then the difference in the flight cost is a couple days work.

At the end of a 30hr+ multi-leg journey that saves you $200 you'll have wished that you took the 23hr flight straight to Heathrow/Birmingham via Dubai with Emirates.

The cheapest deals from Australia go via China with Air China or whatever the other ones are called. These sound like hell rides to me.

The second best are usually with Emirates and Etihad via Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Air Asia services Melbourne, right? So you could get a very cheap flight to Malaysia and then take something from there like Virgin or BA to Heathrow.

Flights are usually between $1400 and $2000 (return). 

Good luck.

Also, http://www.skyscanner.com and http://rome2rio.com.

But check the airline's websites to see when the deals are on. http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/us/en.html have a pretty website that makes it easy to check for when the best prices are.

Tipping in general doesn't happen much in the UK, especially compared to the USA. This is probably due to a difference in wage laws; it is illegal here for minimum wage to be ""made up"" with tips. An employer must pay someone at least £6.19 an hour, *plus* tips. Pretty much the only time tips are expected is in restaurants, where mostly there will be a 10% ""service charge"" included in the bill, which is shared between the kitchen and front-of-house staff (although you can choose not to pay it.)

In pubs and bars, you can say ""and have one yourself"", meaning ""I would like to buy you a drink"", but what actually happens depends on the pub in question. Some landlords insist that their staff take this literally and charge the customer for a drink, then either have a soft-drink then and there, or a beer after their shift. Others allow the bartender to pocket the price of a drink, or put it in a tip jar.

Except in restaurants, almost no one ever expects a tip, although they are happy to receive them. If I want to tip a pizza delivery person, I usually have to call them back, as they will be halfway out the door as soon as they have handed me the box.

Re: Any other customs

I often see in American TV shows that people order drinks, and then pay for them all at once before they leave, like food in a restaurant. In the UK, you almost always pay for drinks up-front at the bar. The exception is when you want to ""open a tab"", in which case you leave your debit/credit card behind the bar as security. Before you leave, you use the card to pay off the tab.",0,1372322656,null,0,false,0,car6g9b,t3_1h5zck,t1_car6g9b,t3_1h5zck,null,1430666996,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

You can also get a bus from Amsterdam straight to London, these are a cheap overnight bus ride.

Shop around, I managed to get an auto Mercedes for a month on a really good deal. It was about £800 for 28 days, which was about the same cost as most other places. I think it was a computer glitch, but always check what the 28 day rental cost is, sometimes it's cheaper than a 27 or 29 day rental. It's weird.

You can get cheap cars everywhere, outside of the airports. I'd recommend hiring a car from Hertz for about a week from Heathrow or Birmingham. Then return to the Hertz in Nottingham, and find somewhere local that's cheaper if you think you still need one.

Do you know what a CDP is? It's a discount code accepted by Hertz. IBM are the biggest user of Hertz in the world, and their CDPs are widely known.

If you book a car with Hertz there will be a place to enter your CDP. Google for ""IBM hertz cdp"". It will *sometimes* give you a better deal.

The first link have nothing but **predictions** not actual accounting. Even if it was 2 billion it would be from people already in the country not a net addition to the UKs economy from foreign tourism and you didn't read the final paragraph:

&gt; **The Confederation of British Industry calculates that a bank holiday costs the economy £6bn in lost productivity and overtime**, but the government thinks the impact will be far less. The day off for Queen's golden jubilee in 2002 affected growth and economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland suggested the late Easter combined with the royal wedding could shave between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points off growth in the second quarter.

That could mean a net loss of 4 billion. Great stuff. On to the telegraph:

&gt; The Royal family generate close to £500 million every year for British tourism with The Tower of London, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace the most popular Royal destinations. 

I can tell you where they got that from, they got it from the propaganda VisitBritain page I linked you too, the same one that bangs on about the queen and postcards. They spin this negative into a positive:

&gt; [Then potential tourists were also asked to choose from 15 postcards that they would send to communicate that they were in Britain. They ranged from The London Eye, Tea to  Red Phone Boxes. The icon picked by the most respondents was a red double decker bus (24%) followed by a stone castle by the sea (20%).  But the third most popular choice, at 11% of respondents, was Queen Elizabeth II, well ahead of fish and chips or draught beer.](http://media.visitbritain.com/News-Releases/Monarchy-brings-in-500-million-a-year-from-foreign-tourists-says-VisitBritain-research-5d2.aspx)

It's a stupid survey that means nothing really, yet to support the royal connection to tourism  VisitBritain has to fluff the queen's poor 3rd place showing into a victory. Buses and castles are more important to tourists. VisitBritain is a PR agency not a reputable source of statistics:

&gt; [VisitBritain is Britain's national tourism agency, responsible for marketing Britain overseas.

Prospective signings: 

* Moutinho, a good centre midfielder, proven at Porto
* Paulinho, frighteningly good
* Various talented strikers from around Europe, which is currently their missing link

Current players:

* Dawson, has his flaws but is currently a more complete player than Gary Cahill
* Bale, says it all really
* Huddlestone, strong and technical and has had good performances this season
* Walker, strong and fast. Had a bit of a shitemare at times but still very young and has lots of promise. 
* Adebayor, loves to score against us
* Defoe, hassles and hassles and stretches defence. Has a sickening work rate but a bit too sporadic

[The Crown Estate belongs to the reigning monarch 'in right of The Crown', that is, it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign, by virtue of their accession to the throne. But it is not the private property of the monarch - it cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch.The Government also does not own The Crown Estate. It is managed by an independent organisation - established by statute - headed by a Board (also known as The Crown Estate Commissioners), and the surplus revenue from the estate is paid each year to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers.To explain further, one analogy that could be used is that The Crown Estate is the property equivalent of the Crown jewels - part of the national heritage and held by Her Majesty The Queen as sovereign, but not available for her private use](http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/about-us/faqs/) CE Website



[The Crown Estate as a whole dates back from the time of the Norman Conquest. In 1760, George III reached an agreement with the Government over the Estate. The Crown Lands would be managed on behalf of the Government and the surplus revenue would go to the Treasury. In return, the King would receive a fixed annual payment, which today we call the Civil List. The Crown Estate is not the personal property of the Monarch. It cannot be sold by the Monarch, nor do any profits from it go to the Sovereign. The Crown Estate is managed by an independent organisation, headed by a Board, and any profit from the Estate is paid every year to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers. The Treasury is effectively the principle Government stakeholder and is kept informed of the estate’s overall business plans and strategies](http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/CrownEstatesxyz.aspx) Monarchy official website

Legally, the estates are owned by the holder of the crown, who is given that office by act of parliment. If parliment were to declare the crown vacant the lands would continue to be run as they are today (by a corporation whose profits fund the government) plus the cut currently going to the holder of the crown (EII)

[The Crown Estate as a whole dates back from the time of the Norman Conquest. In 1760, George III reached an agreement with the Government over the Estate. The Crown Lands would be managed on behalf of the Government and the surplus revenue would go to the Treasury. In return, the King would receive a fixed annual payment, which today we call the Civil List. The Crown Estate is not the personal property of the Monarch. It cannot be sold by the Monarch, nor do any profits from it go to the Sovereign. The Crown Estate is managed by an independent organisation, headed by a Board, and any profit from the Estate is paid every year to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers. The Treasury is effectively the principle Government stakeholder and is kept informed of the estate’s overall business plans and strategies](http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/Royalfinances/CrownEstatesxyz.aspx) Monarchy official website

true,fzzgig,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"Consultancy of this kind is used so that the management that knows what changes need to occur in a company but cannot convince enough key decision makers of the necessity can get changes through.

 Good consultants and good managers often reach similar conclusions about what changes need to be made, though the consultant may be a little more on top of recent developments in management theory. Consultants can convince people that management can't because they are seen as more impartial and as experts, so the same advice from them is weighted higher in the minds of decision makers than from their own employees. The high fees they charge also increase the perceived value of their advice. 

This is a benefit in the real world, but not an ideal world. It applies wherever there is not perfect communication and perfect trust between every level of management. Moving more quickly towards necessary changes can save companies huge amounts of money in the long term, and may be the difference between survival and collapse in some cases.


A good consultant may also spot issues that even a good manager might miss, simply because they're looking on as an outsider and a fresh pair of eyes. This is a benefit in an ideal world, and the real one.


I hope that this explains a bit better.

If you are circumventing their geographic restrictions that may be a breach of their [terms of service](https://signup.netflix.com/TermsOfUse) (see the limitations of use paragraph), a breach of which terminates any licence they give you. So arguably, once you've done that, everything you download, both content available via the UK service and the US is illegal/pirated.

If not on that ground, the licence that Netflix has with the copyright owners will have geographic limitations (otherwise they wouldn't need to impose them on users), meaning that Netflix probably won't be licensed to give you access to the content (or licensed to sub-license you access).

Piracy still wins, and will keep winning while publishers continue to pretend that the Internet cares about geography.

According to the map in the link the UK constitution guarantees the right to education for children with disabilities (which is guaranteed in Swedish law just not in the constitution), the british constitution protects from discrimination based on ethnicity (which is protected against in Swedish civil law but not in the constitution). However seeing as the information in that map is taken from a website that does not seem to understand the law at all I would not be surprised if they got that wrong too.

edit:

I looked around a bit on that site and I am not impressed!

Sweden:

&gt;Do citizens have a general constitutional right to education or a specific right to primary education?

&gt;Compulsory and free

It's not in the constitution but there is a legal right ot education for all children and primary education is mandatory and free.

&gt;Do citizens have a specific constitutional right to secondary education?

&gt;Not granted

Well again there is no mention of school in the constitution but there are legal right to secondary education if you are under the age of 20 (IIRC) also it is free just not compulsory.

&gt;Do citizens have a specific constitutional right to higher education?

&gt;Guaranteed

What? No! Not in the constitution or in any other law for that matter higher education is not seen as a right however if you wish to pursue a higher education then it is free. What the hell is this crap?

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"2.7% as quoted by a government who benefit from low inflation?

2.7% inflation is calculated from a standardised basket of goods.  Each good is weighted in its individual inflation to calculate the overall inflation.  There are therefore two parameters available to government manipulators:

 - Selection of the goods in the basket.  If you look, you'll notice that they include many luxury/electronic/rare purchase items.  Coincidentally, these are items from industries that are permanently lowering prices.
 - Selection of the weighting factors to make deflation of said items have a disproportionate impact.

Now having looked at them, and realised that you buy many of the items in their basket maybe once every two years, get your grocery bills, electricity bills, gas bills, clothing bills, and petrol bills out for the last five years.  i.e. the items you buy _all the time_.  Have a look at how much they've increased over this same period.

I don't know about you, but the it's a fact that my once-a-month broadband bill has gone from 19.99 to 13.99 isn't having as much an effect as my once-a-week food bill having gone from £70 to £160.

2.7% inflation is a total lie.  Never mind plus-or-minus 1% of the target.  A moments thought about what you spend your money on will tell you that inflation over the last five years is in the 50% to 100% range.  And the poorer you are, the closer will be your personal inflation experience to the high end of that range.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Real Madrid have been tapping players up for decades and getting away with it. They did't get in trouble over Figo, or any of the other players they have done exactly this with. They don't get in trouble when the tapping up works, and they don't get in trouble when the tapping up fails. The club are *experts* at doing exactly this. They not only get away with breaking football laws, but also EU laws (current Euro investigation into the state aid case).

This latest Marca story matches up the playbook exactly. Float interest in a player via Marca and tempt to player into taking the bait. Once they do, and Suarez certainly has, you get the player doing the work for you. Immediate upper hand in transfer negotiations, a lower transfer value and you pick a player up on the cheap.

The only surprising thing to me is that Luis' agent didn't find out *earlier* what his possible wage and package would be. You would think that Suarez would want at least some certainty around that *before* he made all of those statements to the press. It would be very embarrassing to him if he went through all of that to only face a situation where Real Madrid didn't really want him and were canvassing him as a backup.

99% of the dismissal of this story in this sub is people not wanting it to be true. Just like how until recently all the Suarez comments in the media were either bad translations, a misinterpretation, being taken out of context or journalsits making it up. In the same way we had to crash back to reality with that story we are also going to have the accept the reality here that it is very likely, infact almost certain that Suarez has representatives speaking to Real Madrid right now.

true,BaBaFiCo,,Pint of the Porter,"* Wait to be served at the bar, don't try to force yourself in front of anyone. The bar man will know who is in the queue for a drink and will serve people in the order they approached the bar (with perhaps a lesser wait for regulars). Any attempt to 'jump' the queue will result in you being pushed to the back/rudely put down. 

* Feel free to ask what's best. The bar will probably pride itself on the beers it serves and if you can, try to sample some local, traditional ales, and avoid imports such as Carlsberg (which can often be more expensive too)

* Conversation is fine with anyone who is sat at the bar, they're usually there to talk, and if you sit there expect to be spoken to. However, if people are sat at tables they probably don't want to be bothered.

* Feel free to stroke any dog/cat/ferret/parrot that a patron may bring in. 

* Tipping isn't customary over here. However, telling the bar man to ""keep the change"" or buying him/her a drink when you buy your final one is greatly appreciated.

* If you want to play pool/snooker, place your money on the table. No-one will steal it, and it reserves your place to play next. 

* Table service isn't provided at most pubs, unless you were greeted and shown to your table by a server. Most pubs, find yourself a table, read the menu, and approach the bar to order food and drinks. Again, if you're paying for your food at the bar, tipping isn't expected. 

* Try to bring your glass back to the bar when you finish your drink and order another. It saves a lot of time for the bar staff and keeps your table looking clean.

* All measurements come in pints here. I believe in American bars that drinks are served in the ""house"" measurement which can vary by bar/state, but over here, asking for a ""A Pedigree"" will get you a standard pint governed by law. Asking for a half is perfectly acceptable. 

* Ask the bar staff anything. They usually have a good knowledge of the regulars, entertainment in the area and anything else you might wonder. Plus, they're probably bored. 

* Smoking is banned in all public places here. Smoking must take place outside, usually in a rain proof shelter. ",0,1372339239,null,0,false,0,car8ysj,t3_1h601j,t1_car8ysj,t3_1h601j,null,1430665738,14,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,14

To say that national performances are not important in the valuation and opinions of players is stupid.

Now, an argument that supports disregarding national form for Cavani. He doesn't play the same role for his country as he does for his club. This is vitally important to understand when trying to understand Cavani. His ability is so great that they still try and work him into the team regardless of the tactics or philosophy of the match and team respectively.

I'm sure you have no issues understanding a love story and can relate to it regardless of the sexual identity of the parties. It's not as if, as a straight male, we're falling in love with the doctor's companions (though I suppose some might) making the storylines relate that much more.

Having watched his play quite a bit he almost has the same finishing ability as Falcao. Cavani can pretty much put it anywhere on demand and if he can't he stops his play to set up someone else or goes on a strange lateral run to get an angle he will score from, something which pretty much only RVP has had in recent seasons in the PL.

http://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/manchester?keywords=admin

yeilds so many results, just looking quickly at worst paid to assume the ones that don't expect much, there appear to be a huge number of a oppertunities.

Do you have a CV that has been checked by a friend/family member who has hired people?  At uni most of the advice they gave me was really incorrect, and not what people wanted to see at all.  In the end I lost count after about 50 applications, a good 20 completely re-written CVs (to draw out my experiances and skills to match what they were looking for).  It is in a way a numbers game, you must deal with rejection and keep looking.  For me I found out I was *computer says no* rejected for most graduate schemes because I don't have many GCSEs.  The trick is to just find something that is looking for what you can be, and make sure you represent your CV that way.  Ultimately you are lucky if they will give it more than a cursory glance, so you need to format it accordingly.  Personal statements are not half as important as people tell us at school.  Hell myself I never read them until the CV has made the maybe pile, this is because the majority of them tell you nothing, but take a fair few minuites to acomplish this. 

&gt;(If anyone knows an admin job that they can give me, anywhere, anywhere at all. Please. Please give me it)

It's not *give me it*, it's what you can do for them.  No one wants to employ people who don't add value, that is to say, they don't provide more worth to the organisation, than they cost.

Yes people come to see the palace, it is one of the sights in London, and having been inside it myself it is impressive. However, as evidenced by the VE figures it is not the be all and end all of tourism in London/England and it certainly does not generate billions in tourism revenue. 

The royal family do not usher people into the country personally, they do few engagements at which they smile/wave/accept gifts. Occasionally there will be an event that will bring in a few tourists (Jubilee)  but many of the people of the world do not care, and having a royal family has little to no impact on their choice to come to the UK as a tourist destination. Just like the fact that France no longer has a royal family yet Paris (although extremely underwhelming in my opinion) is still one of the worlds most popular tourist destinations. People come to the UK to see some of the sights, and enjoy the historical richness of the country (of which the royal family is a part but it is not a huge factor since many tourists will not personally see the members)

There is little to no evidence that having a royal family personally brings in 'billions' in tourist money and yet people seem content to parrot off the rumor whenever they get a chance.

Edit to include; One of the main reasons people come to see the palace is the changing of the guard, which is not a royal event it is a military event and continues without the presence of the Queen at Buckingham palace",0,1372341304,null,0,1372341538,0,car9ihl,t3_1h61u5,t1_car9ihl,t1_car91pq,null,1430665480,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"I'm not suggesting that we standardise on me; I'm not insane.  I'm suggesting that they are using weighting factors that don't match reality.  That the point of inflation measurements is to show us what our money is worth relative to what it was worth.  It's nothing to do with the economy, it's to do with expenditure.  As for ""ignoring a major part of the economy"" -- that's exactly what the inflation basket does by selecting a subset of items.

I'm glad for you that your expenditure has dropped over the last five years.  I'm afraid though that my experience, and the experience of anyone I've spoken to, the reports in the media and the concerns expressed by the government do not match up with your experience.  Worse: going simply by what I observe in prices everywhere, on the things that my money goes on, the prices of those things has gone up by far more than 2.7%.

Over a decade, you're right, I've bought one television.  I splurged and bought a fancy one too.  It cost me about a grand.  Over that same period, I went grocery shopping every week.  I'm willing to be conservative and call that £100 a week (although it's distinctly increased in the last 5 years).   That makes TV/Groceries equal to 1000/(10*100*52)... pretty much 2%.  So, unless the weighting for TVs is 50 times smaller than the weighting for groceries, it doesn't reflect reality.  Perhaps I'm unusual, but I'm not a factor of x50 unusual.

Here are the [weightings ](https://www.google.com/search?btnG=Google+Search&amp;q=ons+basket+of+goods+pdf) if you're interested.  You'll notice that Food/Catering add to 163; and Household goods is 60.  That is a factor of x2.  That means they think you spend half of what you spend on groceries on tvs, microwaves, and fridges.  That is completely unbelievable for me.  Over the last 10 years, I could easily see how I get to 52,000 worth of groceries.  There is absolutely no way I have also spend 26,000 on household equipment.

This item has Doctors on it which makes it intrinsically sweet and worth 5 stars by itself, but once I tried it on, that's when the magic happened. After checking to ensure that the shirt would properly cover my pasty white abdominal-flesh, I walked from my house to the library with the shirt on and was immediately approached by women. The women knew from the Time Lords on my shirt that I, like a Time Lord, am a mysterious loner who knows how to 'bend time and space' from time to time (if you catch my drift!). The women that approached me wanted to know if I would be their boyfriend and/or give them trips through time and space. I told them no, because they didn't have enough of a British accent, and frankly a man with a Doctor-shirt shouldn't settle for the first thing that comes to him.

I mean Jim Cassell was only beloved by every member of the technical team, immensely respected in the game and created one of England's most successful Academies on a shoestring budget, what could he possibly know about football?  Let's instead have our Academy managed by a man whose only qualification is that he ran an IT department and planned by a guy whose qualification is signing Adam Johnson, Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell and being excellent at rimming the right people.

Fuck Soriano and Bergstrain.  The sooner they fuck off back to the original Barca instead of trying to clone us into them the better for the Club.  They're destroying every single part of the organisation (or ""restructuring"" as they call it) and throwing away key figures in our history who are extremely talented because they don't fit their idea of what a great coach looks like.  

If you would have asked me in 2008 if I would rather be challenging for the league after completely changing everything that City are or challenging for the UEFA Cup/midtable spots by keeping our heritage intact I'd take midtable every day.

These people are fucking destroying the Club that we know and love all in the name of ""progress"".  What they are turning us into has absolutely nothing in common with the Club in 2008.  We're a name above the door, that's it.  Bunch of fucking cunts.  

And despite all this, they still couldn't do the one thing that they were brought into do:  ensure we stop missing out on big players and get value for money on the players we're selling.

When my music player has to [brute-force decode it to seek](http://www.foobar2000.org/FAQ#why_is_seeking_so_slow_while_playing_mp3_files), yes.

FLAC is generally a little over twice the bitrate and utterly eliminates the entire question for *every* track and *every* ear, which is a nice bit of piece of mind.  It's also convertible to *any* other format, *any* bitrate, *any* encoder, with zero concern over unnecessary loss of quality from converting one lossy format to another.

I see spurs favouring players like Siggy, Holtby, Carroll, Dempsey and arguably Dembele (in an AM role) over Ceballos. If a new signing comes in he will slip even further down the pecking order. 

The guy is 20 and would probably cut it for a low level PL side.

Firstly, this blog **did not** post saying how good Mkhitaryan was a few weeks ago, like /u/unusuallylethargic said. This blog is more than capable of letting the stats speak for themselves. If you read the other articles, they are fair, unbiased analyses.

Secondly, anyone who stopped reading once he states ""his stats aren't that good"" is ignorant. Just because he scored 25 goals does not mean anything other than he managed to score 25 goals last season. We have to look at *why* he scored those 25 goals, what the likelihood he will repeat anywhere close to that number is, and what else he will offer the team in other positions. If you buy a player based purely on one fact, we'll end up wasting our money again and again.

The problem with this blog piece, and that the writer admits, is that all these stats are from 8 matches. That's not nearly enough of a data sample.

I don't think for one second that Mkhitaryan would be anything other than an excellent signing. I don't say this from experience, but from a few of the scouts/journalists (Tor Kristian Karlsen, Jonathan Wilson) who have said he's fantastic. I don't watch Ukrainian football, so I'll take the word of those who do, especially Wilson.

1) English lessons (and sanctions for not going to them) is already a feature of JSA (albeit in a less formal way)
2) ESOL lessons have been cut since 2011
3) this is shameless votegrabbing 

The problems you mentioned would probably be better solved by having ESOL lessons for non-jobseekers (in a family the jobseeker is the one most likely to have the best English skills)

The other thing that George hasn't mentioned is that Jobseeker's Allowance is being abolished and replaced by Universal Credit. Are all these whizzy new ideas to apply to UC as well as JSA? Because not everyone on UC will be unemployed (its a sort of merger of the out-of-work benefits, housing benefit and Tax Credits). Is there going to be automatic testing of non-British working claimants, and ESOL lessons if their English is not up to scratch even though they are working? What about their non-working spouses (who might have work conditionality imposed on them)?
I'm not sure this will save money.

Both great.)

For parks, I'd recommend the **Royal Botanic Gardens** and **Inverleith Park** in the north of the city, which is great and has amazing views back south looking to the castle and **Arthur's Seat/Salisbury Crags**. Also, head up **Calton Hill** for more great views of the city and to see the National Monument of Scotland.

If you fancy a nice walk by some water, the **Water of Leith** (a small river) flows from Balerno down through the city to the **shore at Leith**, with numerous places you can join or leave the path. Not all of it goes through nice areas, but lots does, including from **Dean Village** downstream to **Stockbridge** or upstream to the two **Galleries of Modern Art** (which are definitely worth a visit)

Other great galleries - **Royal Scottish Academy and Scottish National Gallery** which are just off Princes Street, and the **National Portrait Gallery** on Queen Street.

If the rates aren't being changed, then loanees are not getting shafted, and it seems like a reasonable way to quickly realise a long term asset in order to help boost the coffers in this time of need.

If they've loaned out £1 billion, sell the debt for £900 million, and offer to guarantee a 950 million return for whoever buys it, given that the default rate is normally about 40%, worst case they'll have to fund is 350 million. 900 million it was sold for, minus the 350 million they'll have to guarantee = 550 million short term realisation of an asset that would do us a massive favour that we need right now, sacrificing a long term benefit that would have taken decades to realise as an asset. So yes, it is a loss for the taxpayer, but given that the default is approx 40%, the asset is only worth about 600 million, to us anyway, plus interest. So it's not a huge loss by any means, and we could really REALLY do with those funds right now.

* Being able to move house vs not being able to move

* Searching for a job in 2007 vs 2008

* Searching for a job while holding a job vs not holding a job

All these small, seemingly benign things cost her at least one job each during this time. In no small part this is because of the sheer VOLUME of applicants for places, at one point she was interviewing alongside 60 other people for a place to wait tables at a hotel. Think about that, there were 60 applicants who had written covering letters good enough to force an interview (from 300 applicants) for one part time place. 

Another quick point, the shift in employment has massively disproportionately hit certain demographics (18-24 year olds, new graduates, women) so if you are in those groups then yes, a job can very much be that hard to find.

&gt;I knew I was too intelligent for a BTEC and after a few months I left.

And now you want to leave what you're moved to.

I'm going to be quite blunt here - have you considered that no matter what you do, you will rationalise that it's the wrong thing, that you're capable of better and use that as an excuse to stop?

You dropped out of school because it was too hard. You dropped out of college because you were too intelligent and you're now going to leave your apprenticeship because it's too hard.

My suggestion is you accept that you're the problem, that you've already messed up twice and you're about to mess up a third time. Pull your head out of your arse and do all you can to turn it around in your current role. Work out what you need to learn in order to do the job properly, and learn it or get help learning it. 

I would guess that your boss can already tell you're disgruntled and isn't prepared to put any effort into helping you - it is a two way street - so you'll need to put a lot of effort into changing their opinion.

I'm a lot older than you and I've seen your problems in myself - I fucked about until I was about 30. I'm very bright and can be hardworking, but I can also convince myself I deserve better and I can be lazy. I'm now nearly 40 and I've got a good job, I earn lots and life is pretty good... but I had to get over myself first.

Now that I do manage people I see an awful lot of your attitude around. 

Life isn't always nice. Not everybody is a winner. There need to be toilet cleaners, there need to be telesales reps there need to be all sorts of shitty jobs. Nobody wants to do the shitty jobs, but when it's all they're left with then they end up learning to tolerate them.

You seem to be labouring under the illusion that the ideal job is out there for you. Frankly it's not. You have to make the best of what you have. You're in a decent position in that if you knock your pan in and do a very good job the company you're in will look after you - or you'll be able to move company to one that does. If you don't then they'll just manage you out of the door and someone else will take your place.",0,1372348005,null,0,false,0,carbqnt,t3_1h6d1g,t1_carbqnt,t3_1h6d1g,null,1430664432,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If the Psychology courses are anything like those in the Maths and Sciences departments you should never be out of your depth. They all have ""are you ready for this course?"" quizzes on the course pages, where you can test your own knowledge and decide whether or not you think you're capable of following the course.

Even if you don't have any formal schooling in a subject, you can start your OU degree with introductory and foundation courses, which should be enough to bring you up to GCSE or A level equivalent (whichever is appropriate for the course).

The OU is very modular and degrees are well planned, so you start out doing Level 1 courses (equivalent to first year at a traditional university), and then gradually as your knowledge increases you progress to Level 2 and Level 3.

I would thoroughly, wholeheartedly recommend the Open University to anyone. My only point would be to make sure you've correctly budgetted for the time involved. If you're working full time then suddenly having to find an extra 8-10 hours a week for studying can be a bit of an impact on your lifestyle. Especially when the weather turns nice in May/June and you're stuck inside working on an assessed paper or revising for an exam.

If you're on Facebook then I recommend searching for your prospective OU degree code, there will almost certainly be a group there, as well as smaller groups for each individual module.

1. It is respected, in as much as a degree means anything these days. In some ways the hard work and commitment is more respected than the degree itself. 

1. Some degrees lead to work, some don't. Psychology is probably one of those degrees that would help generally (E.g. general management jobs, teaching, care professions). I think most degrees don't help for specific vocations unless you go on to postgrad qualifications (Masters, Ph.D, MBA, PGCE, Chartered accreditations, etc). 


Of the people I know who have done OU degrees, most have been post-retirement in liberal arts. My partner did Physics which doesn't seem to have helped much with a career in Countryside Management, but she could easily walk into any technician job if she needed the cash. 

Another person I know did Psychology, went into an academic stream, and isn't very happy. On the other hand I have relatives in academia:  no-one in academia is turning cartwheels in the current no-funding, publish or die, back-biting culture.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"I think SlindsayUK is trying to say that selling gilts would make the Government's debt look bigger with a set term of repayments.  Selling the student loans would raise money without appearing to make the debt look bigger, but would still come with a set of 'repayments' (the difference between what they've guaranteed and what they get from student loan repayments).  If these repayments for student loans are higher than if the Government sells gilts (is that the right phrase?), then why don't we just sell gilts?

PFIs work in the same way - in theory you place all the risk on the private company who gain during prosperity, but lose out if things start to go badly as the repayment terms are fixed.  Of course we did the PFI thing badly by not fixing repayment terms because we thought we were in an endless boom.  The end result is the same though - you have a period of 'repayment' that just comes out of a different budget instead of 'debt repayment'.

If *we* as in taxpayers have spent all this money educating someone, we need to get a return on that money.  If they have a debt for it as well, we bloody well need them too.

Sadly, most of the graddies I've interviewed recently have unrealistic expectations.  They've no employment history whilst demonstrate no aptitude for learning something they've not been taught.  In my mind that is what university was about.

I will be brutal though, I still say I can't believe it is that hard.  It will at the end of the day be about compromise and choices.

&gt; Being able to drive vs. not being able to drive

If someone has money for three years of higher education, but the job requires a driving license (test £100, lessons £160) they have their priorities wrong when it comes to making them valuable.  For instance in London a car is a decadent luxury for most, but in say Cornwall it is rather essential.  Choosing what to spend money on, and what not to, is important life skill.

&gt;Being able to move house vs not being able to move

Sometimes people do have reasons why they can't uproot and move, but they are generally a minority and ultimately have to put up with that.  Someone who say needs to tend to family in a remote part of wales will have a hard time finding work, but it will have been obvious during school that this would happen.

&gt;Being a woman who might have a kid vs. not being one

Last time I checked having a kid was optional for most people.  I have no sympathy for someone who has a kid, but doesn't have financial stability.  I wouldn't have a kid now, despite *owning* a flat and such.  I'm mortgaged far too high, working in a volatile area (startups).

&gt;Searching for a job in 2007 vs 2008

Things haven't changed *that* much, as I was saying with the stats.  Sure its going to be harder, but the difference between 45 rejections and 60 rejections isn't something to cry about.

&gt; Searching for a job in Newcastle as opposed to almost anywhere else in the country

In parts of computer science, people have the term ""problem space"" or ""problem defintion"".  It is commonly said that mapping this out 
often presents the solution.

&gt; Searching for a job while holding a job vs not holding a job

Myself I've found searching for a job much harder whilst holding one, but then I consider searching for a job a 12 hour a day activity, I am dislexic so even with the magic of MS Word it takes me a while to write letters/notes I guess.

&gt; Think about that, there were 60 applicants who had written covering letters good enough to force an interview 

How many places were available?  Because spending time properly interviewing 60 people for one role, of low value (which the description implies) is no way to run a company, you simply can't spend that much time on it.  (If it takes 1 man hour, it is highly unlikely that the exercise would cost less than a few grand.  Assuming they were paying an above average wage, that would be a hiring cost of about 50%+ for a low/no skilled worker.  Good companies don't even spend that much on a search for a CEO!)

It is not the norm to tip and it is not expected, but you can tip if you wish to, the normal way to do this would be to pay £5 for a £3 drink and say 'keep the change' don't be ostentatious about tipping as that comes across as flashy. 

If you're going with a group of people take it in turns to buy rounds (one person buys everyone's drinks) but you must agree before hand that everyone will buy a round, so exclude those not willing to join in. Unless they are genuinely poor and you feel generous. 

If you spill someone's pint, even a few millimeters of it, you must immediately offer to buy them a new one. 

If there is money on the pool table or the juke box that means someone has reserved it. 

Never put your pint on the pool table, if it spills it can ruin the felt. 

Most places require you to order food at the bar then wait for it at your table. It is okay to ask how long food will take to be prepared, most people will have half a pint or a glass of wine whilst waiting for the food. 

If the pub has a designated outdoor smoking area you should use it rather than smoking on their doorstep and blocking the entrance, if not smoke outside but a few meters away from the pub so as not to bother people entering.

The problem is, where do you draw the line? Why/how does **anyone** own land if you start thinking about removing the royals estate from them. 

If you trace it back far enough, all land was purchased at some point from a Duke, Lord, Whatever. If you start thinking about taking away the crown estate from the Royals, then when does it end? 

By implication the land was never anyones to sell or anyones to buy. 

The most pressing issue though is I trust the Crown Estate to keep the land and keep getting a return on it for us. 

If they were to hand it over to us commoners then it would be in Saudi hands withing a few decades. Each time a PM got into a bit of trouble, they'd sell some off to balance the books.

Yes, but only if they want them to.

&gt; As you might guess I'm not generally in favour of people being employed generally on the back of their being religious

It's not really 'on the back of' their being religious - there's a good bunch of work to do to get into the clergy and more still to become a chaplain. It's a bit like claiming that anyone in a job is there 'on the back of' having had interest in it.

&gt; Often people will say ""Well the religious people should be allowed to have a religious person take care of their needs."" I'm not sure that there are specific alternatives for non-religious people.

I don't see the problem here. If a non-religious person requires a religious person to take care of their needs then they can use a chaplain. If they require a non-religious person to then they can use a counsellor. I'm not aware of a form of atheism (yet) that has the concept of a clergy; I can't think what would differentiate a non-religious chaplain from a counsellor - what, in non-semantic terms, would be the difference?

&gt; what would happen if someone decidedly anti religion (let's say years of abuse at the hands of a clergyman left them fearful of any and all religious leaders) needed a counselling service but only chaplains were available?

Everyone is going through cuts (except the NHS and education sector and they're still adjusting their funding to be more affordable).

Despite all of this about cuts I've recently learnt that the binmen aren't actually having their pay cut. Brighton and Hove council are just fixing their hodge podge of a claims system which means that the bin men can no longer play the system for expenses claims. 

My income is low because I'm a student, yes but that doesn't change the fact that I can live off a lower income just by living with in my means, something most people don't seem to be able to understand or comprehend, and, just for the record, I am not one of those students who left their parents house and went straight to university without having any experience of the real world.

I am of course aware that there are other bills than council tax but they are all things that someone chooses to pay:

Road tax - you live in brighton you don't need a car.

Income tax -  they pay pretty much nothing and If i paid it then I'd still get less than they do. 

Pension - state pension is funded by national insurance (which I do pay by the way so you're wrong about that) and contributions from your employer, stop using the same excuse twice.

Medical costs - I'm not sure why you think these don't apply to me, I pay the same amount everyone else does for prescriptions, optometrist fees and dentist fees (coincidentally the only thing you have to pay for in the NHS and even then prescriptions are £7, if you don't look after your teeth you will have to pay to have them fixed and if they decay through something other than not looking after them then you don't, also if you can't afford glasses the NHS pays for them). 

Children, childcare, family food bill, school uniforms etc - I get extremely angry about this one, IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOK AFTER YOUR CHILDREN THE DONT HAVE ANY. I have seen so many children from broken homes in the schools and hospitals I work in (to pay for my degree) that really would've been better off not being born. You as a parent should be 100% sure you are capable of looking after another human being before you have one (breaking even does not mean you can look after it properly due to unforseen circumstances etc)  

You are obviously one of those people who expects the government to pay for everything they want rather than put in a decent amount of effort to make there lives better, it's disgusting and in my opinion fraudulent and I am done discussing this with you since you obviously don't understand what recession means or seem to accept that having children is a huge responsibility (I do, that's why I don't have any and wont until I can support them adequately).

true,DHChemist,null,null,"I think it's a bigger deal than losing our ""fifth choice goalkeeper"". Camp has left as his contract expired, and Rudd is out on loan at Preston for the season, making Steer third choice going into the new season. Now whilst last season was arguably extraordinary in the way we had to use 3 keepers, should we have similar issues this season, we'd run into difficulties. As I see it there's 3 options:

1) Rudd has a 24hr recall clause in his loan agreement, and can be recalled if Ruddy or Bunn get injured.

2) We risk going the season with two senior keepers, and should anything happen to one we stick Remi Matthews or Tyler Reading.

3) We sign a third senior keeper who's likely to be over 21, which takes up a spot in the squad.

Judging by McNally on twitter saying ""Jed was very much in our plans for next season"", I think he was definitely meant to be that third keeper, which would imply Rudd doesn't have a recall clause, or we'd have been looking to loan Steer out too. So of options 2 or 3, I think it depends on who comes in. If we sign some U21's like Redmond, then the 25 man squad limit is less of an issue, so we could perhaps afford the luxury of a third keeper. If our signings are over 21, then signing another keeper is going to cost us outfield options.

Personally, I think option 2 is best. We survived our first season in the Prem with Ruddy/Rudd/Steer as our keeping options, and I think a season like we've just had is unlikely. Also whilst Rudd is unlikely to have a 24hr recall clause, if things get really desperate and either Ruddy or Bunn have serious lay-offs, I imagine we can buy our way out of the loan agreement, which shouldn't be too costly.

Since I was comparing it with 50x; I didn't think it mattered that much.  But fine; 19k instead of 26k.  You're now playing a bit unfair though, because I only included a minimal weekly shop to get to 52k; whereas you've included every possible thing you can in your household goods.

I'm still genuinely interested to know what he can bring to us. 

Leave aside the 25 goals for now, as I'm guessing most people haven't seen much Ukrainian league football or know too much about the standard of it (though if you do, I'm very interested to find out more). 

Does he usually create many chances? Thread through balls? Is he quick, slow, mobile? Powerful shot? etc etc 

I read so many tweets saying we should sign him, and panicing if he's seen here, there and everywhere, but I've still not seen anybody say exactly why we should buy him.

And for a rumoured £25m, I'd like to know why. 

Hope that makes sense; I realise it's my own ignorance that leads to these questions, but as I say at the start of the piece, I simply don't watch much football.

true,nine8nine,null,null,"In Massachusetts I was surprised to find that my drink came on a little white napkin, and that when I ordered another it too came with a little white napkin. 

As I looked to my left and right I saw men drinking on their own at the bar, either watching the TV above the bar, or chatting amicably to the bartender, and getting their own drinks with little white napkins.

I think the ""sitting at the bar when you're alone in a pub"" thing doesn't quite translate here. You owe the bartender nothing but the money you pay him, and he in turn does not really want you to hang around the bar chatting with him, or her (well maybe female bartenders are friendlier). After years of going to the same pub it is considered good form to say ""hello"" the landlord (with no expectation on either part of striking up a conversation, by the way), and give a polite nod of recognition to the bartender, before you are served your drink and free to wander to the nearest table and pretend you are waiting for friends, when in fact you do this every day, and are an alcoholic.

In quick order.


*Do people queue?*
If someone is at the bar when you reach it and hasn't ordered yet, you are in a queue of two. The correct protocol is to extend a hand or elbow onto the bar to inform others who may approach that you too are waiting.
*Is food ordered at the bar?*
Yes, it is unusual to be waited on by any pub employees, and if they do, then you are either in a gastro pub or they are in a good mood. Don't cock up your good luck by taking too long to order or expecting them to bring you drinks.
*Is it true that no one tips?*
I once laughingly tossed a pound coin at a bartender I was having a rare conversation with, as a joke. She told me she was getting the broom and if I was still there when she got back she'd sweep me out of the pub ""with all the other rubbish"". So no, don't tip.
*Any other customs?*
No but if you ignore my advice and end up leaning on the bar you will probably have a conversation with someone at some point. There, I've warned you. Go and find a nice quiet table and don't bother anyone.",0,1372357961,null,0,false,0,carfmt5,t3_1h5zck,t1_carfmt5,t3_1h5zck,null,1430662524,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

&gt;Umm.. during the Troubles, Irish people were treated with more suspicion.
Don't forget how bad the Irish used to be treated as well. I don't really get the whole white guilt thing, loads of different groups have been persecuted and there are assholes in all groups.

My grandparents on my mothers side moved over from Ireland and my mother grew up in an Irish community in St Helens. Historically I'm well aware of the problems Irish people face but as a contemporary example after the manchester bombing my grandparents and my mother weren't told to go back home and didn't have people calling their religion one that inspired nothing but hate. There was some retaliation by idiots but it was largely a reaction to the *political* motivations and while Irish Catholics faced discrimination, especially in northern Ireland, Catholicism has never faced the same level of fundamental scapegoating as evil for otherwise complex political issues.

Afterwards I never faced a single moment of persecution for my heritage and my nature as a peace loving British citizen has never been called into question. Is that because there are people in the EDL who have responded so wonderful to 40 years of peacebuilding and bridges of understanding? Or is it that because I'm white and as such, walking down the street, presumed to be a ok? Personally I strongly feel that it's a bit of both, racists don't like people who are different but the Irish are enough like that there is room for understanding and in the light of people who are very different a threat they feel is even more external the differences seem smaller. They might be Irish but at least they're not muslims and so on... which I'd like to point out is based on my anecdotal evidence in that I've talked to a group of people (some who were ex army and stationed in Northern Ireland) who pretty much said that about me. I'm not going to call it definitive but for me it was a very informative evening of drinking that one. 

The other bit leads me handily on to this

&gt;In a time of terrorism though such profiling isn't racism, it's just rationally wanting to avoid a painful death.

I'm basically half Irish if we just, for a second, make the presumption that the EDL would treat me the same as they would if I looked half vaguely ""foreign"" in a way that they would associate with being a muslim do you think I would face the same level of discrimination? I don't think so, based purely on my race and the baseless assumptions people can make about me as a result I can largely avoid their discrimination. So while you might not think it's racism it's functionally the same fucking thing.

I'm a freelancer, which for letting agent means something between satan and a cabbage. Luckily my partner got a full time job, so we're set. But one of our freelancer friends is single, so...


He had to move and couldn't find any private landlords, so he went to the agents. Every letting agent says they do credits check, and they need to pay you a lot for that.

He said he is employed in a Company X (his trade name and website name). They asked for contact details for that company, which he gave (his own contact details, just a business phone number and an email). The letting agent emailed the Company X, asking how much does he earn, got a reply that satisfied him and that was it - he got the flat.

I really wonder how they justify taking so much money for those checks.

I first rented a place in the UK in 1998, and I encountered the fees/scams then. Everyone I spoke to just shook their head and said, ""Yeah, we know it's different in Australia.""

Fast forward to 2012 and it's still the same. 

In Australia the MOST you will pay for signing a lease is $20 or $25 (about £15). This fee covers the legal cost of the contract and is split between the agent and the tenant. You  have to pay 2 weeks rent in advance, and 4 weeks rent as bond.

http://www.tenants.org.au/

http://www.tenants.org.au/factsheet-02-starting-a-tenancy

In most cases, the landlord pays the agent a percentage of the rent in return for management of the house, collecting rent, etc.

All bonds are kept with a central authority and any disputes go through that authority.

There is a standard tenancy agreement, alterations and additions to the agreement are generally non binding. e.g. ""Tenant agrees to steam clean carpets"".

Every tenant HAS to be given a guidebook which explains tenancy in detail. All rights for both tenant and landlord are standardised.

It adds a lot of weight as well so the car has even less acceleration ability not to mention a lack of ability to get off the line (4W/AW drive systems are notoriously bad at getting going from a dead stop).

actually that sounds exactly what you are based on your lack of cogent arguments.  Either that or a UKIP voter. 

&gt; You are obviously one of those people who expects the government to pay for everything they want rather than put in a decent amount of effort to make there lives better, it's disgusting and in my opinion fraudulent and I am done discussing this with you since you obviously don't understand what recession means or seem to accept that having children is a huge responsibility 

aaaaah hahaha.  hah.  You know nothing Jon Snow.   

Actually I work with families and women in need including benefits and financial inclusion support and I spent 10 years as a secondary teacher.  I suspect I understand a huge amount more than you do you about both the current economic situation and about children and families you supercilious ignorant human being. In fact I was sat in a meeting today with the local council, voluntary sector reps and other organisations discussing the current economic situation. I must have missed you there. 

&gt;I am of course aware that there are other bills than council tax but they are all things that someone chooses to pay:

buh?  You can live without water can you?  and electricity? and food?  wow.  Skills.

&gt;You are obviously one of those people who expects the government to pay for everything they want rather than put in a decent amount of effort to make there lives better,

No, I expect the government to ensure everyone has a quality of life commensurate with living in apparently one of the most developed countries in the world.  You should try volunteering at a local food bank and talk to people who are working poor who are utterly humiliated by having to take hand outs. 

One day something might happen to you that means you have to rely on benefits or live on a low income. Unfortunately pay cuts, unemployment and reduncancies, illnesses etc all happen and mean nobody can perfectly plan out their entire life based around finances including children.  I hope if that ever happens you're dealt with with a damn sight more humanity than you're capable of showing. 

I think I've called it right, hence why you're so irate, that you're a uni student who's had no experience of dealing with any of these things that you're turning your nose up at other people for.

Two comments on the Guardian page:

&gt; I used to work for a college in Lewisham that taught IT skills, charged about £10,000 to foreign, mainly Nigerian, students for the course. It allowed them to come over on student visas whereupon they disappear into the fog of unregistered, illegal workers and never get seen again - or pay taxes etc. Never in all my time there did I actually see any students or teachers ! My employer didn't even pay my PAYE (tax and NI). So if colleges like that get closed down then its a good thing.

.

&gt; there was a flaw with international students. I knew students who kept on enrolling the same English course (on the same level!) over and over again and kept renewing their student visas. The college wasn't bogus. It's just how many years do you need to learn English..? They were all allowed to work max 20 hours a week but they all worked more than that.


As for your and your gf's situation -- I think it's fair if the rules are strict for boy/girlfriends.  Why should your gf get a job in the UK, and a British person go without?  And then the rest of us have to pay for the British person's dole and housing benefit?

 1: Where did the clip of John Hurt come from? I’ve seen a lot of his movies and in none have I ever seen him looking like that. Prove me wrong please.

2: The scene with Elevens new TARDIS console exploding in what episode does that occur? 

3: What of the shot with Rose? where did that come from? surely you can tell me and provide the exact moment it happens in what ever episode that is from cause i have never seen it? That shot of Rose was not in Tooth and Claw at all as she did not once look through any pieces of wood. she stayed by the Doctor the whole time. 

4: What about the scene where Eleven and Ten meet? How can you explain that one? sure Davids face is similar to the one he made in TEOT but have you honestly never seen an actor make the same face twice? while Davids faces is similar to the one he makes at the 50 minute mark in TEOT is it not at all logical that an actor can make the same face twice? and is it not logical that Steven thought that his facial expression in that episode would be perfect for him meeting the Eleven doctor for the first time just as DrRad pointed out.

5: Near the end of the trailer you see Matt in the dark with candle light and no coat on. Well people said it was taken from Hide, but in Hide he never took off his over coat and never was near any candles?


6: In no episode of the series 7 did we ever see Elevens console in flames

7: People have said that when Eleven says “Hello again"" his mouth doesnt match the words well clearly after watching it for 11 times now it certainly does. also in what episode of series 7 does Matt ever where his bowtie like that?

8: and another thing in no episode have WE EVER seen the shot of the

All of the footage is quite clearly taken from elsewhere in the series. The characters are stood more or less still (this makes the 3D conversion process significantly easier than with people moving around too much), apart from the shot of the TARDIS and the helicopter, which is distant enough from the camera for 3D to be planar rather than detailed (this was shot in Trafalgar Square, very publicly, some months ago, so it's hardly impossible to get footage of the event). There's also that awful shot of 10 walking down a hallway which is clearly a still image animated to look like walking.

The dialogue is all from the series, right down to stuff lifted from ""Blink"".

Aside from the direct reasons, any trailer would be embargoed and the BBC would have had it removed from Youtube by now if it were an official leak. The 50th anniversary is one of the BBC's flagship productions this year: the trailer won't retread old ground and won't use dialogue from old episodes; why would they do that?

And finally, it's not a very good trailer. Technically it's quite impressive; clearly the person who made it knew their way around VFX software. But from the point of view of a trailer, which should showcase some storyline and invoke some excitement, it's insipid and boring.

I was lucky enough to leave south africa as a british citizen when I was younger to avoid the financial difficulties my family would have faced otherwise (minimum wage much lower than here, no health care, sky rocketing crime rates and no job prospects).

the AWD systems is debatable, if its a system that can monitor/alter the power at each wheel on the fly (which i guess it can, cos its prototype etc) then getting off the line and getting around corners shouldnt be a problem. as the electrickery behind the system will have a ton of information fed into it from sensors to provide the right amount of power, to the right wheel at the right time.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; The being a woman who might have a kid thing is about maternity pay

It is actually more than that.  Sometimes it would be a pro, but often a con.

If you have someone who has no dependants, you know they won't be sick as often, won't have to leave suddenly because the kid is in school etc.

Having a kid impacts you in employability, you can pretend otherwise and lie about it, but its true.  That is why having a proven track record in work before having one makes it easier.

It can also be a motivator, people might assume that they are more mature.

But at the end of the day, it isn't discrimination, if you have the two hypothetical identical candidates one has a child, the other doesn't.  Why would you pick the one with the child?  Even more so if they are young and not in good shape financially.

People often don't understand the level of impression you can make on someone, for a graduate level role a friend of mine had a candidate come in who when asked why he wanted the job replied ""I have credit card debts, so I need a better paying job"", considering he had been sat with both his iPhone 5 and iPad retina and MBP retina on the desk, he effectively told the interviewer he had no good control on money.  Given the company involved needs to trust (and requires certain background checks too) around peoples ability with money he had set a really negative impression of himself out before the interview even started.  The point of the story is that people are often looking for a lot of things you might not appreciate.  Whilst some get their employment law from tabloids, most don't last long doing that.  The FSB provide a simplified version.

&gt; The job was 20 minute group interviews and in the waiting room she met a guy with a PhD among others. I wont list because I suspect you wont believe me.

Oh I can, many companies are run very, very badly.  But I will hazard a guess that they were hiring a lot more than one person to go to that level of trouble.  This makes it a little less bleak than it sounds.

When it comes to Phds, that doesn't surprise me at all, a friend of mine waited bars, whilst another friend worked part time for a major autogroups R&amp;D department.  Both earn't about the same money!  Having a Phd doesn't qualify you for a job per say.

true,SiPiPy,derbyshire,Derbyshire,"I had no experience of studying psychology before i took my OU degree, so having studied for, even if you didn't complete the A level, should be an advantage for you.

Whether you study psychology at the OU or elsewhere, one important thing you need to consider is whether the degree is BPS accredited and so confers the ""graduate basis for chartership"" - GBC. If so, that will make it far easier to study at a higher level later on - which the vast majority of jobs in psychology require - and then to subsequently get a job and your professional chartership.

Specifically about the OU - the BSc degree is accredited and confers GBC provided you achieve a 2:2 or better. You do need to be confident about studying independently and mostly online, although books, some face to face tutorials (around 6 per module) and a couple of one week residential schools are part of the degree (at the moment ... more and more is moving to online only). But, you won't be alone - it's the OU's most popular degree (outside of the open degree) - when I was studying, there was around 4,000 students studying the 2nd year modules and 1,500 to 3,000 studying the 3rd year modules.

I finished my OU psychology degree at the end of 2011 and have had absolutely no problem landing a place on an occupational psychology MSc at Leicester with the qualification, so it would seem to be well respected.

There are lots of OU Facebook groups around, and there are a number specifically covering the psychology degree and the individual modules. You're also most welcome to look around the blog I kept while working towards the degree between 2007-2011 - see: http://www.tenpencepiece.net/blog/

AWD/4WD systems will never be able to keep up in handling, and no matter how good they are at launch control they will never be on par with a RWD car.

This is more of a 'look what we can do' matter, and as I said it's astounding what they have done... but it's not a great supercar because of it.  It's just a supercar that is more environmentally friendly than any before it.

The reason why most super-expensive car companies are going with a 4WD/AWD system with computer assistance? because often times it's not the real hard-core drivers who buy their cars, but the rich people who want to show off.  AWD is the easiest of cars to handle outside of FF.


Also, as a note: superchargers and turbochargers don't create more responsiveness, they do exactly the opposite.  It's why Ferrari went with a naturally aspirated V12 in their new 'La Ferrari' (hate the name, the car is pretty badass) They also mentioned in the video that peak HP was gained around peak RPMs meaning this car is slow going at first.  The supercharger should help that some, but it won't help the lag this car will have.  It'll probably feel like a car does in overdrive normally... of course it'd pick up rather quickly once it hit higher RPMs so the numbers should be fairly good aside from maybe 0-60.  I'm seeing about 3.4(still not much to go on, going with what I've found) for it, so in that 800 HP it can almost keep up with 560 HP Porsche 911 Turbo at 3.2 seconds (3.0 w/ Sport Chrono).  Keep in mind that the Porsche I'm talking of is also turbocharged and 4WD... so it's got some disadvantages to if it.  

If we look at the Porsche 911 GT3 for comparison, it's got only 470 HP and yet can reach 0-60 in 3.3 seconds.  Mainly due to it's RWD and the fact it is naturally aspirated.  It still get's up to 195 as well.

You'd think then, that of course the Porsche must be much lighter... but it's not the case, the GT3 comes in at a whopping 3,153 lbs (that's actually light, but not as light as...) the C-X75 coming in at 2976 lbs.

Do you choose how long your degree duration lasts? (Is it a nailed on 1/2/3/4 year thing or is purely based upon your input?)

I have shitty GCSE's and no A Levels, but I'm a very intelligent person and in my A Level mocks I got A's all the way through in Psych but left before the final exam. Will I be at a disadvantage because I only learnt a tiny bit of the A Level module.

true,dwair,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Yup - I did an OU degree years ago with out any A Levels at the age of 26.  I studied electronic engineering. Before I started I knew very little about either maths or electronics.  I couldn't get a grant to go to Uni (back in the days when you could get those sort of things) as I was a mature student - so I did 3 years with the OU instead and got my degree that way.  

I thought it was a great way to learn but sometimes very, very hard going.  I figured on working at it 9-5, much in the same way as you would do at an bricks and mortar university but found that I often had to put in 60 hours plus a week.  Possibly this was because I didn't have much back ground knowledge and primarily in my case having to learn maths as I went. On the plus side, the course materials were extremely good and my tutors were receptive to dumb questions and pointing me in the right direction when I needed help.

In retrospect I feel I missed out on the whole ""going to university"" thing and I don't think my degree has helped much in terms of a career - but it did get me into computers in the early '90's, let me discover maths and subsequently I have  a reasonable career writing software and web app's which I enjoy.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I think you are quite hard on all of our existing central midfield options.  Gerrard did fantastically well as a deep-lying mid who also tracked back.  Based on last year, his legs are just fine for the defending he should ever be doing.  He was 5th in tackles per game at 2.4, tied with Wisdom, and the only midfielder in the top 6 besides Lucas.  He was also 7th in interceptions with 1.4 per, and Allen and Lucas were the only non-defenders ahead of him, and avergaed 1.7 clearances per game, the highest by a non-defender.  Also, he was 10th in blocked shots per game, behind only Lucas and defenders.  These stats indicate that he did very well at his defensive duties, and in fact much better than Henderson, who you seem to head-scratchingly rate better defensively.

Also, I find it funny you don't think Stevie can make the transition to a Pirlo-style deep-lying mid when that is really what he did last year.  He was 3rd in passing accuracy among non-defenders or GKs at 85%, first in passes per game, accurate crosses, and had nearly twice as many accurate long balls per game than the next closest outfield player, Joe Allen.  He was third in accurate through balls, led the team in assists, and was third in goals.  These are all tools that a deep-lying playmaker would have, and clearly Stevie has them in spades.

Also, you might not think any of Allen, Henderson, or Lucas are good enough to play the Barca mold of central midfielders because they are not those players.  Allen is not a playmaker or passer who can unlock defenses like Xavi, Henderson is certainly not a skillful, tricky player who can beat defenders and carry the ball into the box to score, and Lucas is most similar to his Barca counter point, but without venturing forward as much (and, of course, without the Busquets bullshit).

Fact is that we are skillful or technical enough to play exactly like Barca.  That's okay, so few clubs--arguably no others--are.  We will lose possession more often and we are not quite calm enough on the ball yet, to a man.

If you don't make it a GCSE, you risk it becoming an irrelevant course that, even if compulsory, nobody pays attention to in class because the results don't matter.  

Perhaps you're right that it should be a GCSE option, but the powers that be have decided politics should be a subject studied at 17-18, not because it is necessarily too complex for younger people but probably because they feel as a subject it deserves being treated with the depth of study that an A level can give.

true,rhinoseverywhere,null,null,"To me, Lucas is without a doubt one of the best players on the Liverpool squad, especially in terms of work rate and defensive ability. Just because he's frequently in the right position and so doesn't have to make dramatic dashes doesn't mean he doesn't work hard, it just means he's a smart player. If he doesn't get injured I can't imagine a starting 11 without him. Your negative opinion of him makes me disagree with the whole first section of your analysis, as I feel that Lucas does provide the defensive skill and the work rate we need, as well as consistent, if not inspiring, ball movement that can be counted on.

The comparisons to the Barca midfield are sort of misplaced as well, because our defense isn't nuanced enough to support that type of set up. When forced into a defensive posture, Busquets frequently plays more of a center back position when Barca is on the attack, dropping back towards the central defenders to allow the fullbacks to move up the pitch. This takes a really well organized defense, something we've lacked in recent years. Furthermore, in my opinion, Lucas doesn't play like that, playing higher up the pitch, though still in a defensive position, and closing down attacks earlier. Because of that alone our midfield is never going to look like Barca's.

I do agree that having a 35 year old Gerrard still in our midfield would be less than ideal, though. He definitely isn't the Pirlo type, preferring to roam around and exert physical control over the game. I think he'd still be more comfortable in a four man midfield that allows him to run box to box, and that definitely isn't a good thing both in terms of squad limitations and increasing the effects of aging.",0,1372371284,null,0,1372399469,0,carkunw,t3_1h7cux,t1_carkunw,t3_1h7cux,null,1430660064,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

It was such a great character discovery watching his portrayal unfold from appearing harsh and nonchalant to realizing how deeply he cared. 11 is boyish and lively, but definitely in the darkest place of the 3 due to many deep loves and losses. Tennant started on that route, but I feel like to such a lesser extreme. He was more intense on the surface, but very little nuance to his true nature. Everything was exactly as it seemed for his actions and feelings and though his monologues were some brilliant dramatic acting, it came to be exactly what was expected of 10. Again, not that I didn't enjoy it, but not as interesting. A great mid between the two, but not as remarkable to me. I think the next Doctor will be by far the darkest of New Who if Matt's storyline continues as it has. He is in a serious downward spiral and try as he might, the weight of the Doctor mantle is crushing him though he seems to take it lighter than all.

&gt;Torres alone on top, surrounded by 6 Italy defenders.
Seems legit Spain.

And your point on the subs you know Silva and Pedro were subbed of before Torres are they bad players. I guess Spain has zero faith in Silva, must be why the keep playing him ahead of Mata. 

Look I'm with you if Torres ever gets to the form that he showed in games like vs. West Brom early in the season, in the slumps when it was like playing with 10 men, I will be the first with my pitchforks out wanting him out. 

And you're just in general a bit thick you have VdB who was just as successful at Real Madrid as Jose arguably more successful , a managaer who has won 2 EURO's, a world cup. SO he has all these accolades is obviously a world class manager if he plays Torres for a full game that obviously means he has faith in Torres.

1: Where did the clip of John Hurt come from? I’ve seen a lot of his movies and in none have I ever seen him looking like that. Prove me wrong please.

2: The scene with Elevens new TARDIS console exploding in what episode does that occur?

3: What of the shot with Rose? where did that come from? surely you can tell me and provide the exact moment it happens in what ever episode that is from cause i have never seen it? That shot of Rose was not in Tooth and Claw at all as she did not once look through any pieces of wood. she stayed by the Doctor the whole time.

4: What about the scene where Eleven and Ten meet? How can you explain that one? sure Davids face is similar to the one he made in TEOT but have you honestly never seen an actor make the same face twice? while Davids faces is similar to the one he makes at the 50 minute mark in TEOT is it not at all logical that an actor can make the same face twice? and is it not logical that Steven thought that his facial expression in that episode would be perfect for him meeting the Eleven doctor for the first time? what about how his bowtie looks? in what episode has he ever worn it like that?

5: Near the end of the trailer you see Matt in the dark with candle light and no coat on. Well people said it was taken from Hide, but in Hide he never took off his over coat and never was near any candles?

6: The rings of akhaten also had nothing in it that was from the trailer

7: People have said that when Eleven says “Hello again"" his mouth doesnt match the words well clearly after watching it for 11 times now it certainly does.

8: The helicopter scene carrying the TARDIS where you can obviously see jenna and matt in there series 7b attire? how do you explain that since ive seen set photos of it and its to clear to fan footage and is shot in an angle consistent with how doctor who is filmed. 

9: the opening wide shot of london telling me what that is from?

10: and another thing in no episode have WE EVER seen the shot of the tent in the field with a cyber-woman or knight approaching it. that tent has only been seen in that same field in behind the scene photos for the 50th

In all honestly I believe it is legit. If you buy into the lie that it is fake then i ask you this: Do you Honestly believe everything you hear online? That website is a fan run site that has no associate with the BBC at all? go ahead and see if you can see those words anywhere in the about section. also the bbc has screwed up before with the early shipping of season 7 dvds to certain folks in america well before the series ended! whether it is fake or real there is undisputed evidence in this trailer that is too good to be CGI trickery.

Though I'm now looking at getting into health care, I was able to get several IT jobs thanks to my ongoing OU studies.

It's hard work, not just the studying but because of the flexibility the OU offers it's all to easy to let other commitments intrude and take priority of your time. Moreover without the regular pacing element of lectures it is all to easy to let things slip and end up struggling to catch up. You need to be organised and self disciplined.

The academic content is strong, however what is lacking in comparison to a regular university is direct contact with people who are the sharp end of academia. Reading a course text, however excellently prepared, doesn't quite compare to being lectured to by someone who is active in the field. Take advantage of your tutorials and look for other methods you can get a taste for what's happening research wise in your field.

OU study is respected, though the question I got time and time again was ""You're studying with the OU, while you're working full time?"" A good proportion of that respect is from the commitment it takes, the expectation is that you're studying part time while also doing something else. But of course with the changes to fees full time OU students may become more common.

Dont worry too much about being out of your depth because of lack of prior studies. You dont need any prior qualifications (though they of course help). The OU is geared up towards students from non traditional backgrounds, the first year content is very much about brining everyone up to speed. That said, there are short courses you could take before embarking on a full degree programme that you could do to get a feel of what OU study is like and whether it's for you.

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; The NHS does provide counsellors, however chaplains claim they serve all people no matter what faith or none, all the time: effectively the same as counsellors.

Nurses also claim to serve all people no matter what faith, or none, yet they are not the same as counsellors. You do seem to be a bit fixated on this ""serve all the people"" thing.

&gt; The point I am making is that chaplains are there specifically for the religious aspect.

Yes, I've been taking that as given. It's sort-of part of the definition.

&gt; Many people, including yourself I think, say ""Ah well, that's alright isn't it because some people are religious?"" But we don't afford this service on the taxpayer in any other situation or institution (save the armed forces and the like) and the question being raised is whether or not the service is essential, and worth the high cost, when other posts (nurses) are being cut.

I don't think anyone's suggesting it's essential, just that it can be *helpful*; either way, the article is reporting exactly on cuts to the number of chaplains in the NHS.

&gt; With regard to being a chaplain without religion: Humanist chaplains are a real thing elsewhere, but not on the NHS as you have to be ordained in something to qualify. That was the point I was making.

This doesn't appear to be that odd - if you have no notion of clergy it doesn't seem that weird to also not know what to ask of a chaplain.

&gt; Actually that raises an interesting point: What does a chaplain do that a non-religious person can't?

They're religious. Precisely what they 'do' depends on their religion, but generally they offer a form of spiritual reassurance that is acceptable to their faith.",0,1372375974,null,0,1372408993,0,carmfvq,t3_1h5zma,t1_carmfvq,t1_carlv1b,null,1430659316,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"&gt;inflation is something that happens in pretty much any economy. We've weathered a fairly bad one without a catastrophe. That's good enough IMO.

True, and i don't disagree that what we've suffered doesn't constitute ""mass inflation"", but at the same time i know that *everyone* I know who's earning less than about £20k a year is suffering quite badly from increases in food, utilities, petrol, council tax, and for food especially meat prices, you can't not notice that now is a seriously good time to become vegetarian (yeah, no.)

But like I said:
&gt; And we're 5 years into a recession... and if that either sounds '**okay**' ... **or** ... '**terrifying**' in relation to 5-7% *then you still don't understand exponentials.*

From the gist of what I've seen so far of the spending reviews, most of the new investment into the economy won't kick in until 2015, and might not see real results until a few years later, and that's assuming I have any confidence in the current government's proposals in spurring growth within the economy... which I don't.

Even if we generously assume that real-world inflation is only 3%, and even if policies that kick in at 2015 are effective almost immediately, say within a year, which they won't be, in that time compared to 2008 there will still be an effective inflation of 30% in 8 years with no significant rise in wages or comparable economic output.

And for me personally, nearly 30% inflation over 8 years is exactly what it feels like, but hey, I mostly_posts_drunk, so I might be well wrong and that'd be lovely, but I still think this way when I've not been out on a thursday night, and thats a little bit worrying.
