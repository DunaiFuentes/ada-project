You do realize you can watch the anniversary without ever visiting this subreddit, just like *most* of the people who will watch the anniversary, right?  

You don't have to associate yourself with any group or website or anything you don't wish to associate yourself with.  You can lurk and think to yourself how crazy everyone commenting is.  You can never visit at all.  

It's your choice to comment here and thus choose to associate yourself with the group you're denigrating.  If you share a different opinion on something, share that and why, don't just attack those you choose to associate with, even if they have different opinions.

true,Real_Rodriguez,null,null,"The latest contract news on this guy comes from February of this year, it seems he penned an extension rather than a new deal. He's signed on until 2017 with reports also suggesting he'll receive incremental increases in his salary.

No doubt he expected to get a raise earlier than that, lets not forget in the pre-Balotelli days he was easily one of their best players but for whatever reason he has been unable to translate his success with Mario and as a result the club are digging their heels in with the deal. Just to illustrate in the league he had scored some 17 goals in 22 games before Balotelli arrived and only 1 goal in the 15 games after Balotelli joined. Mario meanwhile dropped some 12 goals in 13 games. That is a huge drop in form and it might be just down to team dynamics but El Sharaawy isn't as important there as he once was. If Galliani is really the one holding him back from game time it might be an attempt to preserve his falling value.

I gotta say the club might be in the right here, he signed on for a long term knowing he'd have to wait for the cash to come but he's fallen down the order and now the wait is too long for him so his agent is just shopping him around to get the club to back from their stance. If he goes he'll leave on the club's terms meaning he wont go cheap.

I would say he is one of our better midfielders and is quite well rounded. He has been paired with Paulinho in the middle of the pitch but I and many others believe that a Sandro-Paulinho and Capoue-Dembele pairing would be better as Paulinho and Dembele seem to play more similar roles and perhaps more importantly Sandro and Capoue are both beasts and recovering the ball. We may see Dembele get a chance up front more given AVB has yet to establish firm roles for the squad and Eriksen recently has been interested (he would then rotate with Holtby as a CAM), but AVB could always give Gylfi a shot there instead of out wide. In any case I think Dembele is pretty critical to the squad though I wish he could make some more crucial passes. Sometimes it seems he has that Scott Parker turn the ball/ play around for no reason and lose the build up mentality that can be frustrating but he's a professional so who am I to say. Its always great fun to see him manhandle players who try to dispossess him and or manhandle them to take the ball; I just wish he was more productive with it afterwards.

Personally I just easily get bored with stand-ups whose material centre too much on where they're from or the race card. Once that's been established ('Anyone in from [x]?' 'The difference between you Brits and my people is...' and a few more), which is done rather quickly, I usually sit there and think, 'Right. We've all heard tons of gags on the difference between Brits and, say Americans, or between ""white people"" and quite a few of the alternatives (black, brown etc.) Got anything new?' And then, I dunno .. I guess his sense of humour, as you rightly put it, fits well with the British. It just his actual points and punchlines which I feel are based too much on the character he cuts to the point where I just lose interest.

Anyways, this really wasn't meant to pitch a deconstruction of his stage persona, and I guess a large portion of the nationality-based gags are brought to the fore by the platform on which they usually perfom on the telly: short sets and as part of a bigger line-up, either on a panel show with other panellists or as one of a host of comedians doing a special gig.

true,yellowyeahyeahyeah,1953,,"I say keep them both. As of now Torres and Eto'o are playing better than any striker we had in the past years and Ba was solid either. They're all no Lewandowski or Suarez though but I don't think it's worth the money with Lukaku coming back in Summer. He absolutely deserves t have a shot at becoming our starting striker but the arrival of a topstriker could rob him this chance for at least another 2 years. 

And for KdB - the season only gets longer and longer. We could still have to play League Cup, CL, FA and PL in January. All it takes is one injury and he could get way more playing time. 

Also I still think it's possible that Jose tries to convert Mata to a winger. Oscar seems to be his favoured 10 and Mata is too good to be just a benchoption.(granted Willian and Schürrle are both very good too). Then KdB could take over the cam-backup spot as I feel the quality-difference between CAM Oscar/Mata-KdB isn't as big as the difference between him and our other wingers.

If nothing of those things happen there's still nothing lost. He's a great player and a very bright prospect, sure but if he grows uncontent or stops developing we could still try to loan him out in summer or just sell him. With the depth we already have in the attacking midfield and the players we still have on loan(Piazon, Moses) we will need to sell one or two players sooner or later. 

Loaning out KdB in January is only a short-term solution as he'd come back in summer and still have the same players in front of him. All of them should still develop too. So I'd say keep him and our super depth this season and hope he gets a few good games instead of loaning him and then still have no position for him next year.",0,1384760901,null,0,false,0,cdh0ns1,t3_1qu5lz,t1_cdh0ns1,t1_cdgiau9,null,1428613043,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

2. When the doctor pops back and forth from France to the ship it is more of a sign of trust that he sees Rose as being strong and capable since surviving the time vortex and a desire to escape the coupled dynamic of his two companions (remember at this point that he is still just beginning to have feelings for rose, it is at the end of this season that he won't be able to bring himself to say that he loves her)

I don't condone Qaddafi's dictatorial rule but in many ways but it was certainly the safest country in N.Africa to visit.  Basically he locked up all the nutters (and any one else he didn't like) in camps out in the desert.  As far as ""iffy"" places go - it was one of the nicest I have ever been to.  Ok there was the all persuasive influence of ""The Colonel"" in all his mad glory but compared to its neighbors Algeria, Egypt, Tchad and Niger, I thought for the most part as a country it was kinda getting along and developing quite nicely really.  You could buy stuff, stuff sort of worked, kids went to school and university and there wasn't an obvious crippling poverty seen in many N.African countries.

Since Europe oil motivated (got to protect our oil!) involvement, crime has risen, areas in Eastern Libya are virtually no go zones, inflation is rampant and the economy is in ruins. There are now enough religious nut jobs running around the desert to destabilise Mali and take over half the country for a brief period. Niger and Tchad have become very iffy due to the influx of armed groups of Libyans since the war. Tribalism is rampant, unemployment is high and the disaffected are turning to fanatical Islam.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; But then there's the zerocoin altcoin coming out and I'm not sure why anyone would stick with bitcoin if zerocoin is truly anonymous as they say it's going to be.

Zerocoin has its own set of flaws.  Here's some comments made by gmaxwell:

&gt; Zerocoin has a number of serious limitations:
&gt;
&gt;  - It uses cutting-edge cryptography which may turn out to be insecure, and which is understood by relatively few people (compared to ECDSA, for example).
&gt;  - It produces large (20kbyte) signatures that would bloat the blockchain (or create risk if stuffed in external storage).
&gt;  - It requires a trusted party to initiate its accumulator. If that party cheats, they can steal coin. (Perhaps fixable with more cutting-edge crypto.)
&gt;  - Validation is very slow (can process about 2tx per second on a fast CPU), which is a major barrier to deployment in Bitcoin as each full node must validate every transaction.
&gt;  - The large transactions and slow validation also means costly transactions, which will reduce the anonymity set size and potentially make ZC usage unavailable to random members of the public who are merely casually concerned about their privacy.
&gt;  - Uses an accumulator which grows forever and has no pruning. In practice this means we'd need to switch accumulators periodically to reduce the working set size, reducing the anonymity set size. And potentially creating big UTXO bloat problems if the horizon on an accumulator isn't set in advance.

Who knows though -- I'd be as happy with ZeroCoin as with Bitcoin, or many of the other Altcoins.  My interest is in free movement of value; not profit (the profit will be nice, but I'm not really a ""more profit"" type of person, I would trade my personal profit for bitcoin's global success if that were a choice).

&gt; I like the idea of cryptocurrency. I think it's clever and could have its uses.
&gt; 
&gt; I just don't really like bitcoin.

That's unusual.  Your objection was that bitcoin is some kind of ponzi; that it's value is not real.  Given what you say here it sounds like you're against Bitcoin the currency, not Bitcoin the technology.  In which case, your objection is merely to the set of rules (21 million coins, no inflation, blocks every 10 minutes, halving every 210,000 blocks) that have been chosen for bitcoin.

All your objections were nothing to do with those rules; and would be true for any cryptocurrency right now.  Any new currency is going to have to go through a monetisation process -- exactly what bitcoin is going through now.  Exactly as every other currency on the planet has gone through over thousands of years.

My interest in bitcoin is primarily as a way of taking gatekeeper power away from the current finance industry -- it's not their job to allow or disallow transactions, and yet they do.  So, if you have a different set of cryptocurrency rules that you like -- fine, I have no problem, we're basically in agreement; the market will decide which is the best set anyway, there is no force stopping competing currencies.  Why don't you give the alternative rules as your objection, instead of all this ""decentralised ponzi"" nonsense?

My Mum was late for work the other week due to this. The scenario was as follows:

1. Watching ITV+1 before bed.

2. Turn off TV and go to bed.

3. Wake up, turn TV on, go to put kettel on.

4. TV defaults to the channel it was on when you turned it off, showing the incorrect time.

5. Enjoy your coffee and breakfast, thinking you've got a couple of hours before you need to set off.

6. Turn your laptop on to check your emails 20 minutes before setting off for work, realise you're 40 minutes late.

It certainly helps if you have a watch/clock or use your phone to check the time. Some people don't. I really think they should blank out the time for the +1 showing.

So someone didn't ready the article then, as the point Boris was making, albeit not very well, was that they do pay their tax.

But like most redditors on this sub you have made the baseless assumption that all millionaires are tax avoiders. Not just some, not most, all of them thieving out the mouths of staving children on the breadline.

Whilst I don't agree with Boris here, everyone having a moan at him has tactfully avoided the facts he mentions that the top 1% pay 30% of all income tax, but that's just inconvenient to a jolly old Tory/Rich bashing.

Don't get me wrong I have no sympathy for rich people but I'm not so naive and ignorant as to ignore the facts when I have a moan at them.

The second requirement: Any sensible person should be saying benefits should be just enough to live on, not comfortably, but enough. Then work should give you all the extras- a comfortable life. 


The problem we have is that a huge number of people don't earn enough to live comfortably. These people therefore don't earn more than the benefits which give you just enough to get by. 


So what we need to do is separate that, and the only way to do that is to raise the living standards of those in work- which is difficult because it was put under pressure by the recession- which is why we're having this political discussion in the first place. You shouldn't be lowering the benefits significantly - because the requirement that you need to be able to survive on them.


The problem with the current political approach though, is they take the first requirement but not the second. Instead of driving up living standards for those in work, they drive it down for those who aren't. This then puts more pressure on people to desperately find any job- this then adds extra pressure to the job market. It drives down the living standards of everyone because the supply of cheap labour gets forced up (especially with all the work schemes).

The scam part is people claiming it can be a replacement for cash, and getting others to think that too. They then buy in thinking it's going to be a replacement for cash when, imo, it's not suitable for that. 

Like I said, if they just admitted it was nerd gold I wouldn't give a fuck. 

I find zerocoin more interesting because it will facilitate black market transactions better. That's a huge plus for zerocoin. That was bitcoins initial 'killer app', and imo probably still is. There's just that annoying and costly 'tumbling' step that you have to do with bitcoins. 

If zerocoin can eliminate that step, then that's a good thing. 

Will be interesting to see if zerocoin goes for a higher coin limit. I think it's better to keep the coin limit high so that you don't end up with hugely valuable single units. There's a (psychological) barrier to entry when 1BTC is worth $500, and it's also confusing to buy something like a mcdonalds for 0.01 of a unit of currency.

In places like Belgium you can legally grow 1 plant yourself for personal use. A good friend of mine has setup a 'business' that grows plants (any plant, even veggies) belonging to others. They are working on the fringes of the law in Belgium but so far so good. They never own any plants themselves, with ownership staying with the 'member' of the 'club'. They simply take care of the plant for the owner in the same way that big food production works.

If the UK law were to change a little to allow for personally growing, I can see a huge business opportunity in a similar model. Of course, its not an instant thing, you must wait for your weed to grow but this model has huge benefits. You would know its been grown by experts who take pleasure in producing a quality product and you can visit your plant, get updates on predicted yields and get regular high-grade cheap dope. Once the first plant is harvested, the next seed is planted the process starts again. 

We don't need to have a big change to pure legalisation with head shops popping up everywhere. A slow process with things like personal grows are a great stepping stone to getting middle England accustomed to the changes.

true,Arkyl,null,null,"Okay, I've had enough of the *bullshit*. It is misleading and downright disingenuous to say ""But the rich pay so much of our tax"".


There is a very simple reason why the wealthy pay so much of our tax: they have all the money. The top 1% of earners pay 30% of tax, but as sources say, the top 10% have 40% of the wealth[1](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/wealth/table13-8.pdf)[2](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/research/SocialSciences/Key-Facts-Background-Paper-BPCIV.pdf). Let's assume the top 1% have half of that wealth - so 20% (not unreasonable, honestly I would guess it's far higher than this because wealth is generally distrbuted logarithmically). This means that the top 1% are paying 15x as much as the average briton. Are they only 15x as rich? Do they only have 15x the disposable income? Nope. They have far more than that. 



Then let's look at this sentence: 

&gt;Of all the self-made super-rich tycoons I have met, most belong to the following three fairly exclusive categories of human being: 



Yes, and what about the majority of the super wealthy who have inherited the wealth? No let's exclusively talk about black swans shall we.



Now let's look at another fallacy from Boris: 

&gt; no happier than the man with just enough to live on. 

So he concludes:


&gt;There is no point in wasting any more moral or mental energy in being jealous of the very rich. They are no happier than anyone else; they just have more money. 


Except, because the wealthy are rich and not contributing enough people do not meet the threshold of ""just enough to live on. "". So his argument doesn't even work on it's own terms. 


&gt;We should be helping all those who can to join the ranks of the super-rich, and we should stop any bashing or moaning or preaching or bitching and simply give thanks for the prodigious sums of money that they are contributing to the tax revenues of this country, and that enable us to look after our sick and our elderly and to build roads, railways and schools. 


Whilst undermining our government with donations for laws and pricing our locals out of the capital.



&gt;we should stop publishing rich lists in favour of an annual list of the top 100 Tax Heroes, with automatic knighthoods for the top 10.

Tax is actually so low that when we lower the top bracket threshold this figure fluctuates by fractions of a percent. Even if the arguments that lower income tax 'increases GDP' (which is a meaningless single number designed to capture all human endeavour in a country) were true (which they aren't), the amount of effect this has on society as a whole is minimal because such a small percentage of people have such an astronomical fraction of wealth. And when I say astronomical, I really do mean that. There are plenty of probability distributions and demonstrations that show me how messed up it really is.

The system we maintain just doesn't work on a local level; for example the issues faced by government bodies such as the social services and the NHS for example, would be fixable if just a few more people could be employed and trained in their departments but they lack the funding. Fun fact; there are more abandoned houses than there are homeless people and enough unemployed people that we could give them jobs fixing the abandoned houses and helping the homeless people but we are trapped in a situation where we don't do anything.

Why? Because people have to get permission to do work, to get training, to get skills to build things, to buy derelict houses and even to get food. These are all fixable issues that almost all of us want fixed!

Get your CV/applications up to speed. Because you are at a disadvantage to other candidates, you need to get your application shit hot. I know where I am (no vacancies atm, sorry), we are getting a lot of applications for every post, so you need to stand out. One of the biggest mistakes I see is people not using the job specification, advert or description to form their application or tailor their cover letter or CV. When I'm going through applications I have the person specification in one hand, and the CV in the other. If anything is missing that is an easy way for me to cull that CV. So for instance if the job spec says must have typing skills, I'm looking for ""I have typing skills"". Even better than that would be ""I have strong typing skills, scoring 50 words per minute"". 50 words per minute isn't spectacular, but it shows that the applicant has bothered to actually read the application and isn't just doing this to keep their JC+ adviser happy. Mention negatives in a positive way, so if it said ""Desirable: Experience using a flugelhorn"", even if you don't have it, put something in about it, it will make you more likely to survive the initial cull, so ""Whilst I do not have direct experience with a flugelhorn, I am a quick learner, and eager to expand my skillset"", or even better, google a flugelhorn, find out what it does and why the employer wants you to use it and put something in there to show that you've put the effort in. 

Also massively helpful is getting your face known in the organisation you are applying in. This can be tricky, but I know all the ""Dear Employer"" standard issue applications I get go strainght in the bin. Find out the name of the person who you are applying to and address them. Even if you don't get the name right, getting the name of a manager in the organisation is helpful. Best way to do this, I find, is to just phone up. ""Hi, I'm looking to apply for a job with Knobheads Limmited, I was wondering if I could have the name of who makes your hiring decisions please?"", ""That's great, is Sally Buttcheeks available for a quick chat at any time?"". Don't expect to be put straight through, or even always get a call back, but putting the name on can help massively. If you do get through, be prepared to ask questions. Have some written down. I would go with something like ""Hi Sally, I really like your organisation, I am looking to start a career in your sector, I was wondering are you accepting applications at the moment?"", ""Would there be opportunities to progress my career within your organisation"", ""is there any chance I could do a trial day with you?"", ""What are the most important attributes you look for in a new hire?"". Stuff you can use to tailor your application or interview is great. 

Try to get some voluntary experience in whatever you want to do, but run this by your JC+ advisor as I know this can be problematic sometimes. This will look better if you are applying within the public sector, I don't thing the workfare type stuff is hugely helpful,  but it might be better than nothing depending on where you are up to. 

TL;DR: It's quality you want to go for, not necessarily quantity. Good luck.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Basically, I think deflation should be taken out of the mix. That's what makes it a scam, imo. 

Sounds like you hate bitcoin in 2140.  Bitcoin at present is massively inflationary -- so you've got exactly what you want for pretty much your lifetime.  ""Scam"" is wrong though -- no one is obfuscating the rules that govern bitcoin, so it can't be a scam.  You think a deflationary currency (actually it's only mildly deflationary, it's actually neutral since the supply is fixed apart from accidental losses) is bad, but how does that make it a scam?  Only if I were saying ""bitcoin is an inflationary currency"" is it a scam.

&gt; The scam part is people claiming it can be a replacement for cash, and getting others to think that too. They then buy in thinking it's going to be a replacement for cash when, imo, it's not suitable for that. 

You use scam as if it's a fact.  I'm also not clear on why your objection would make it a scam?  If I said ""I think wool makes an excellent material for car doors"", it's not a scam, it's an opinion.  I can be wrong, but I'm not trying to tell anyone that my woolen car doors are actually made out of titanium.

You've said that ""in your opinion"" it's not suitable as a replacement for cash; but you've not said why.  If you mean it's not yet used a lot, then I understand -- I would be foolish to say that you can use it as cash today.  But it's perfectly suitable as a technology that _could_ replace cash (or at least augment it, just like debit cards do).  I can carry it around on my phone, I can transfer it person-to-person; there is no outside authority that can prevent the transfer.  They all sound like reasonable features for a cash replacement, and are nothing whatsoever to do with bitcoin's deflationary or non-deflationary nature.

&gt; No one's going to realistically spend a deflationary currency.

Why not?  Will they not want to eat? Heat their home? Watch films? Buy christmas presents for their children? All deflation does is change time-preference.  People buy electronics today, knowing full well that they can get better, faster, cheaper, next year because they include ""one years worth of use of that technology"" in their buying preference.  That's the equivalent of buying with a deflationary currency.

&gt; Like I said, if they just admitted it was nerd gold I wouldn't give a fuck. 

Who's this ""they""?  It's a public protocol, it's users are a mixed mass.  Each has made their own decision about what it is or isn't.  It seems a little arrogant to assume that your opinion that it's ""nerd gold"" is the correct one.  It certainly could be thought of like that; but saying ""my problem with it, is that lots of people who use it won't use my definition"" is wishing for something that's never going to happen.  Getting nerds to agree?  Herding cats.

""Admitted"" is also strange; it makes it sound like all the bitcoiners secretly know that things are as you say they are, they're just keeping it secret.

&gt; I find zerocoin more interesting because it will facilitate black market transactions better. That's a huge plus for zerocoin. That was bitcoins initial 'killer app', and imo probably still is. There's just that annoying and costly 'tumbling' step that you have to do with bitcoins. 

You should have a look at the CoinJoin project.  It's a peer-to-peer, decentralised mixing technique that can be implemented on top of bitcoin, with no changes to the protocol as it stands; it's perfectly capable of being transparent from the users point of view.  I expect that it'll get implemented more and more by wallet software (in fact, Blockchain.info have anonunced support for it today).  At that point, privacy and anonymity will be built in, there will be no ""tumbling"" step.

&gt; There's a (psychological) barrier to entry when 1BTC is worth $500, and it's also confusing to buy something like a mcdonalds for 0.01 of a unit of currency. 

That's an objection that's easily removed.  The single unit selection was entirely arbitrary -- in truth the protocol deals in so-called Satoshi's as its ""units"" at present.  They are 0.000000001 of a bitcoin.  There is already talk on the developer's mailing list of changing the default display format in the reference implementation to micro-BTC.  It's just a scaling factor though, so it really makes no difference what denomination you show them in.  $FIELD_IN_PROTOCOL * $ANY_ARBITRARY_NUMBER is fine if it makes the human user happier.

The problem is not so much a psychological barrier, it's that humans seem to find it harder to deal with fractions more than about two decimal places.  Much easier to let them say 5333 microbitcoins than 0.005333 bitcoins.  Hence I'm very much in favour of us all talking about milli-BTC instead of BTC.  One milli-BTC is at time of writing worth $0.50.  One micro-BTC is worth $0.0005.

&gt; I'm not sure if you can have open ended amounts of a cryptocurrency, as isn't that part of the deal? So I guess I'd say that a trillion would be a decent hard limit. 

No problem at all.  The rules that bitcoin operates under are easily changeable.  There would be nothing to stop you making a few changes to the bitcoin source to remove the ""half the block reward every 210,000 blocks"" and then they would continue being issued forever.  You might find it difficult to persuade people to use/mine your inflationary cryptocurrency though.  The Freicoin people certainly have.",0,1384775892,null,0,1384776810,0,cdh30b0,t3_1qs3sh,t1_cdh30b0,t1_cdh2mgw,null,1428611947,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's telling someone that emotions they felt were false, or a total waste of time.  

That makes people sad and angry, which aren't things a TV show should have directed at itself.

In the worst cases, it can drive people away from a show, or at least cause them to stop getting emotionally invested in it.  Hell, I had that problem during the worst bits of Seasons 5 and 6.  Moffat was so willing to just pull shit straight out of his ass that I gave up caring about following the plot because he was just going to wibbly-wobbly his way out of whatever corner he painted himself into.

I mean, seriously, how many times has he rebooted the universe in his term?  It's reaching 70s Marvel Comics levels of ludicrous.

And THAT is the danger of tossing canon totally to the winds too lightly.  Granted, Who is a special case.  It will probably live on for decades or centuries more, in various forms, overcoming the silliest ideas previous writers have inserted.

But bad retcons are still really goddamn *annoying*.  

Hell, just look at the outrage Lucas got for Han shooting first.  *There's* a great example of how disregarding canon can end up backfiring terribly, and how angry people can get if you try to change their childhoods through authorial powers.

No TV story (or even novel, comic, or audio drama) has used it as a plot point which would make a significant distinction between the specific number cited at the time, and simply saying ""inhumanly old."" If Doctor Who's narrative corpus were a building, his age would be a picture hanging on a wall: Decorative, and easily replaceable without affecting the rest of the story universe.

The 12 regenerations/13 incarnations thing has been a plot point of varying importance in several stories. It's important. It's been cited many times. Stories have relied heavily not only on the fact that regenerations are limited to a small number, but even on the specific value of that number. If you were to change that value by even 1, it would require reworking multiple stories. It's load-bearing. In the building example above, the regeneration limit would be a structural column on a lower level. To modify or remove it would require putting some other structural support in place which could plausibly carry the dependent plots.

Will the BBC end with the 13th Doctor? Not if there's still money to be made by continuing the series past that point. Will it be a problem? I'm not a professional writer, and I can conceive at least a dozen explanations off the top of my head. Some would require handwaving of other points, some might even strain the credulity of the show, but a few are internally consistent and would themselves add an interesting plot strand which could be explored more in depth across multiple stories. My favorite approach would be to have him regenerate without explanation, but also have him notice and explicitly comment on the fact that he's lived beyond what should have been his absolute end. Have him point out that this is very wrong, that it breaks all kinds of rules, and turn it into a persistent mystery.

- He didn't say they are better than us. He gave two general traits which are common to ""most"" super rich, and then thirdly pointed out ""luck"". And then went on to talk about how the first two traits are far from exclusive to the super rich and are in fact held by many kids everywhere. He then says we should be widening the circle by trying to reduce the importance of luck by providing the right educational opportunities and encouragement to kids everywhere. He even criticises the financial industry for holding back economic development in this country. 

- He didn't forget that the rest of us pay tax. He merely pointed out that the super rich do pay their tax. The top 0.1% pay 14% of all income tax. So everyone who whines constantly about how none of the rich pay tax, they all hide it in off shore accounts so they can purchase middle class children to stuff as furniture blah blah blah is actually not as true as many seem to claim.

The fact is, we always end up talking about people at the tail ends; people whose willingness and ability to sell their labour is so terrible that they would only really be employed if there is a massive shortage of labour and wages skyrocket. Some people are just *lazy*. But by it's nature of being a *tail end*, they aren't worth worrying about.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"They aren't facts of life, they are facts of our economic system which is significantly more designed than people give it credit for.  I'm not a believer in Keynesian economics; tax the rich more use it to pay the poor. Which is just like a reset button for the excesses of capitalists who believe that their right to ""free enterprise"" trumps literally everything else in the entire world. But, to be blunt, the point you specifically attacked my earlier comment on; training people to refurbish abandoned houses and placing homeless people in, has been done before in the name of Keynesian economics and it actually worked.

We could do this now, would probably even work as a valid solution to our economic problem and is even supported by a huge number of Capitalist economists (e.g. the do-nothing-but sell-his-next-book Paul Krugman), but instead we're cutting public services and borrowing more money off the same class of people that caused the economic crash to begin with. We haven't even introduced a regulatory system to make sure they can't cause another crash. Remember ""project Merlin"" hasn't that turned out to be the very definition of a damp squib. Where do you derive your belief in the success of this system? I really want to know, because all I see around the world are the inevitable products of a society based on propping up a continuous power struggle.

&gt;  I guess your hinting at taking away even more money from rich people who have already paid half their earning into the tax pot and the rest back into their businesses which help grow the private sector and reduce unemployment and help get us out this economic black hole we're in

Frankly, this is just how most debates go into the inevitable ""oh but we'd taking people's stuff"". I would love the wealthy elite to go ""you know what, the acquisition of possessions and power beyond the point at which one can live a pleasurable and contented life is somewhat meaningless. We need to reset the balance."" but they will never do this so we don't have many choices. 

In the same week that the prime minister stood at Guildhall and said that the Austerity is permanent, and a week later, a man who is practically his clone, Boris Johnson, says ""we shouldn't bash the rich, we should be thanking them"" a few days after someone bought a painting for £90 Million. I'm not going to say I have worked out a solution to everything, but I am going to say that If I did have said clear cut solution paintings would not sell for £90 Million whilst  millions around the world to suffer, we would not be selling weapons and allowing a world cup to be hosted in a nation like Qatar that employs people that are essentially slaves and we would not be blaming the poor and unemployed for their lack of hard work as the cause of so many problems in this country.

The economic system we have is not something immutable, it is not a law of nature that we have to have this imbalance, it is just the status quo. 

&gt; But you're right, fuck it, we have beter things to do with their money right?

To me It isn't really about money, the start of the solution is about changing how we derive its value.

In fact that is extremely moderate if you compare it against the Digital Economy Act which the previous government passed into law (it allowed a civil servant to just ban websites at a whim without any oversight at all).     

Honestly this is the best case scenario in many ways:    

 - Only websites who's **primary purpose** is copyright infringement are thus far subject to it.     
 - Owners have a legal right to defend themselves.    
 - The decision can be appealed in a **court** using **evidence**.     
 - ISPs aren't being required to rat out their customers or otherwise deploy sweeping filtering.     

Also the movie industries profitability has absolutely nothing to do with other people's rights to infringe copyright.

You could do a season (or seasons) of Doctor Who where the Doctor doesn't (as far as he knows) have a safety net. Death suddenly has potentially much more sting for him. How does this effect him? Does he take less risks? More risks? Even if it *doesn't* effect him, seeing him explain *why* it doesn't effect him would be interesting, ""I never give up my life lightly. It always hurts. I always lose something. The only difference is this time I won't be around to remember me."" *The Doctor pauses and looks into his companion's eyes,* ""Promise me you'll remember me."" *Gives his life heroically.*

Of course, they won't want to end Doctor Who there. However, artificially extending your own life past your own expiration date just isn't the Doctor's style. Therefore, the most likely plot route would be to make the new regenerations *forced* on him somehow. Tell me that's not potentially interesting? You could have him be all sanctimonious saying things like, ""Everything dies. Everything ends. Even me,"" and then at the last moment the Master saves him and gives him more regenerations. This leaves the Doctor as a dead man walking indebted to his lifelong enemy. Or not. Or something else. The point is there is so much story potential here.

It would just really suck to see all this story potential wasted if they choose to just have the Doctor make a throw-away comment like, ""Well, I used to have twelve regenerations, but now that the Time Lords are gone so are the rules...""",0,1384783525,null,0,1384792121,0,cdh4h2v,t3_1qw48w,t1_cdh4h2v,t3_1qw48w,null,1428611263,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

*Estimates from the 2010/11 BCS show that around one in three adults aged 16 to 59 in England and
Wales (36.3%) had ever used illicit drugs
in their lifetime
(almost 12 million people). Amongst this age
group, 8.8 per cent (an estimated 2.9 million adults) had used illicit drugs
in the last year
(Figure 2.1
and Tables 2.1 to 2.4).
It is known that drug prevalence is greater amongst younger adults than for the adult population as a
whole (a finding that has been consistently shown by the BCS since the drug module was introduced
in 1996). Therefore, additional analysis is presented for adults aged 16 to 24.
Around two in five young people aged 16 to 24 (40.1%) had ever used illicit drugs in their lifetime, an
estimated 2.7 million young people in England and Wales. Around one in five young people had used
illicit drugs in the last year (20.4%, an estimated 1.4 million young people; Tables 2.5 to 2.8)*

*Recent cannabis use (i.e. within the last 12 months) was reported by 0.4%* of people aged 65 and over, and by 1.8% of people aged 50-64 in the England sample. In the inner London sample, these proportions were 1.1% for people aged over 65 and 9.0% for those aged 50-64*

I don't think he ever played central per say, but he did spend a lot of his time cutting inside and making good runs through the middle before Balotelli showed up and filled all of the space he liked to play his way into.

His situation seems kindof similar to how Coutinho's was at Inter... he had an awesome run of form and then got pushed out of regular playing time due to injury, roster changes, and managerial changes.  SES hasn't really had to deal with a manager change but the arrival of players like Kaka and Balotelli could certainly change the way Milan plays and keep him off the pitch and the club is just in a huge clusterfuck right now, which surely is only making things more difficult.

He's very obviously a hugely talented individual with buckets of potential and just 21 years old.  if FSG want to cultivate future superstars then he's a very ideal target to go for, even if he's going to be expensive now.  Sure, he could flop, but I bet if he's in a squad where he knows he'll get some time and he knows the manager and players are behind him 100% then he'll get back to his best.

Diame's very important to West Ham, which means he won't be cheap. But the thing is, what sort of DM are we after? Everyone keeps suggesting these box-to-box types, when if we're looking for someone to challenge Lucas, we need someone who sits and patrols the space - more like Arteta, just as an example (though he's not a proper DM).

Diame is better than Tiote, but still suspect with positioning - he likes to chase the ball rather than protect the space. He also likes to run with the ball at his feet, and isn't a great passer - neither of which suit Rodgers' midfield template. If Diame gets dispossessed dribbling forward, then we'll be overrun in midfield.

And while I would like to use it again, I live in the countryside so it's a lot of effort to source. Thus I am now no longer using it, and it just so happens that I'm older.

Here are a few more factors that I can think of that would skew the data:

* As you get older you don't want to admit to it for fear of career impact.
* Younger people may falsely admit to it because it's ""cool"".
* Time required to source/cultivate may no longer be available as people gain jobs and children.
* May not have the time to enjoy - depending on the means and quantity of consumption it can have an affect over a couple of days
* May end up with a partner that disagrees with the use
* May have a lower level of disposable income due to additional fiscal responsibilities.
* Different generations have differing views. It usually turns that newer generations have more liberal views about these things.

It helps to think about multiple aspects of things before jumping to conclusions.

That said, that is still contrary to how the Doctor currently is since according to Inforarium he is removing all knowledge that he even exists so he can 'be left alone'.

I do think that this probably hurts him still though, he just hides it. He already has the weight of the universe crushing him for his actions in the Time War (although that weight was mostly only seen on the 9th and some of 10th, you can assume it still affects him he just manages to hide it better), after all the time he has existed I am sure it must sting that he saves people over and over and over again and nobody will ever remember him for it or know who he is at all - except for people he probably doesn't want to know who he is and the few scant companions he has had.

The interesting thing here, and what makes this comic so good, is the Doctor and Superman have a lot in common in this regard. They're both aliens from an extinct race, sole survivors of their kind, who have special powers (although Doctor Who is mostly Batman in this respect with regeneration being his only real ""superpower"", he mostly relies on tech) that they have to mostly try to hide, with a companion who is in on their secret, and save people constantly while the masses are blissfully unaware (except for their worst enemies, they know of him).

Superman *at least* gets gratitude because the public knows of Superman, but he will never get remembered for being Kal-El or Clark Kent, just Superman. I think fundamentally both characters are fully aware that this is for the best (contrary to this comic, I think the Doctor is aware of this), since the public knowing more about them personally would make both of their jobs much harder and much riskier, but that doesn't mean it doesn't come without emotional turmoil. I think it's hard for us as viewers to think about that because it's not really a topic covered in either of their mediums that much and because these characters are technically aliens that, even if they look completely human, it's hard to think they could succumb to a feeling of neglect when they are such grand heroes that seem so perfect and non-human - and after all *we* get to see them be awesome and respect that so it's difficult for us to think differently about them, but in the context of the universe, no one really does.

And I didn't say he was 

&gt;He is not saying that we shouldn't question them.

So...

&gt;We shouldn’t bother ourselves about why they want all this money

Is not telling us not to question why the wealthy want to be rich?

&gt;He is not saying that all we need to do to be one of them is work harder.

I'll deal with this as part of the one bellow.

&gt;He didn't say they are better than us. He gave two general traits which are common to ""most"" super rich, and then thirdly pointed out ""luck"". And then went on to talk about how the first two traits are far from exclusive to the super rich and are in fact held by many kids everywhere. He then says we should be widening the circle by trying to reduce the importance of luck by providing the right educational opportunities and encouragement to kids everywhere. He even criticises the financial industry for holding back economic development in this country.

This is pretty much simply meritocracy, those who have the talent, work hard, and are lucky enough to be able to exploit them make up the supper rich and those who could join them. The implication is that the super rich are super rich largely due to merit meaning they are largely better than the rest of us because we are not supper rich. He suggests that there are some unlucky kids with the ""Chutzpah"" to be supper rich would, given equal opportunity be so.

And that's the point, while he allows for some luck it's luck to exploit talent and hard work not *just* luck. His stance suggests that given equal opportunity (in this case education) that we'd all have equal chance to rise to the top based on our own merits. Which is just bullshit and he knows it hence the whole ""but being rich doesn't make you happy"" angle his trying to spin.   

&gt;He didn't forget that the rest of us pay tax. He merely pointed out that the super rich do pay their tax. The top 0.1% pay 14% of all income tax. So everyone who whines constantly about how none of the rich pay tax, they all hide it in off shore accounts so they can purchase middle class children to stuff as furniture blah blah blah is actually not as true as many seem to claim.

The top 0.1% represent around 4% of all taxable income (which is absurd in and of it's self but lets skip by that for now) so of course it *seems* unfair that they paid 14% of the total but it's utterly disingenuous to look at income tax in a vacuum. It's ignoring things like VAT and NIC which make up most of the over all tax income in the country and how lots of the ways the super rich make money wouldn't be covered by income tax at all in the first place. 

From this rather good article on the matter 

http://niesr.ac.uk/blog/fair-taxes-not-just-about-income-tax

&gt;So what can we say about the overall ""fairness"" of the UK tax system?  The definitive source here is the ONS annual report on the effects of taxes and benefits on household income. Looking at Table 14, we can see that the top 10% have gross income averaging £107,500, of which they pay £35,000  - just under a third - in all taxes, direct and indirect.   Meanwhile, the average household has income of £37,700, of which they pay £12,700, or just over a third, in taxes.  There are lots of other tables and other ways of presenting the information (table 9 has a simplified version of the same table, by income quintiles for non-retired households, which again shows the top 20% paying very slightly less than the average as a proportion of their income). 

and

&gt;(It should be noted that none of these figures tell us anything about the super-rich - the top 0.1%. It seems likely to me that, given that much of their income will be in the form of capital gains or otherwise not subject to income tax, their effective tax rate may be lower than the one third which seems to apply to most of the income distribution, but this is speculation.)

The conclusion is that while there is a level of wealth redistribution in the UK when taking in to account things like benefits it's hardly the kind of awful burden than focusing just on income and income tax would make you think. 

&gt;He correctly points out that many many people are employed in industries which rely on the super rich demographic for their market.

And, again, if that wealth was spread out among the rest of the UK equally it would still get spent and create jobs. The top 1% and again the top 0.1% have been increasing their share of the pie consistently over the last 40 years. Even though the mess that some of their number made of the economy they've been able to consolidate more and more of the nations wealth and income and we are meant to feel *sorry* for them? *Thank* them? Because they pay 14% of the income tax that only makes up 27% of total taxation? ",0,1384787520,null,0,false,0,cdh5m4p,t3_1quyba,t1_cdh5m4p,t1_cdh3x5m,null,1428610731,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think a better question to ask is how well any economist can make realistic models, for any country, over that length of time.

An economist from the 1960s could probably have said ""capitalism will probably do better than communism"", but beyond that their predictions would have limited value. I would be very surprised if a single economist from 50 years ago had predicted the extent to which London would distort the UK's economy, zero-hour contracts, the exponential rise in executive salaries, etc.

While they do provide some useful analysis, and to their credit they have considered both the Scottish government and UK government's what-if cases in their predictions, it is by no means a ""this is how things will unfold"".",0,1384787962,null,0,false,0,cdh5r9h,t3_1qw4sp,t1_cdh5r9h,t1_cdh4x3d,null,1428610665,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

What looks dangerous to me is the right turns. If you took those widely and slowly in a bike, you'd risk a vehicle turning alongside you and getting worryingly close or cutting you up.

Looking on street view, you can actually see this almost happen to a rider (approach the junction from south to north and look at the blue jacket cyclist and the black Masda).

http://niesr.ac.uk/blog/fair-taxes-not-just-about-income-tax

&gt;So what can we say about the overall ""fairness"" of the UK tax system?  The definitive source here is the ONS annual report on the effects of taxes and benefits on household income. Looking at Table 14, we can see that the top 10% have gross income averaging £107,500, of which they pay £35,000  - just under a third - in all taxes, direct and indirect.   Meanwhile, the average household has income of £37,700, of which they pay £12,700, or just over a third, in taxes.  There are lots of other tables and other ways of presenting the information (table 9 has a simplified version of the same table, by income quintiles for non-retired households, which again shows the top 20% paying very slightly less than the average as a proportion of their income).  

In short out tax system it more than simply income tax and it's largely ""fair"" if you think that rich and poor should be paying the same cut of their gross income to the state.

Explanation edit: I'll be very brief on this because there is lots and lots and lots that could be said and I'm in a rush to do actual tactics boards for Wednesday. (so ignore players in wrong places, briefness of explanation and what not and ask questions and ill answer them fully when i get back and have 5 minutes)

[Tactic Board of passing and moving options](http://i.imgur.com/MUSl65l.jpg)

Yellow: Optimum Passing Routes
Blue: Role Routes

The heart of Liverpool for the last couple of seasons is our 2 CM, more specifically Lucas and Gerrard who act as DM and AM respectively when required and they do so very effectively but this formation only increases the importance of their roles.

Although recently the ball has started to shift up the wings via our pressing RB/LB/WB's the ball is predominantly and encouraged to be played back to the center to open up our actions and release pressure on the wings.

[The great wall of defense](http://i.imgur.com/1jwnrv6.jpg) IGNORE where the opposition players are i just threw them on as an example..

The easiest way (ignoring a million technicalities and variables) to break down this formation would be to overwhelm the CM by defending and thereby blocking off most routes of attack.

In this example say Hendo ends up with the ball his best bet would usually be;

* to get forward and cross or cut in and pass the ball forward
* but he has a player marking him so his options are now limited to beat the player or pass to safety
* the closest opposition CB will come forward to assist the player marking further limiting Hendo's options and forcing him to pass or attempt a wild card cross
* the oppositions CM's know the likiest otpion would be to send it back to CM  to ease the pressure however the oppositions CM are waiting and 2 of them are attempting and waiting to intercept the pass so even if Gerrard gets it he's under immediate pressure AND a futher 3rd CM can come in to assist without compromising their own defense and the furthest CM can drop back as a temporary DM until the group recovers
* in this situation the likeliest route would be back down to Johnson, but again his passing options are limited as Hendo has a man marking him and both CM have 2 players marking and a player ready to jump in to help and/or drop back to defend and he is likely to be under pressure from the forwards
* his likeliest option is to carry the ball up the wing himself and hop with hendo's mark drops him to pressure or the OP CM's come out to pressure freeing up the middle.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"There is a difference though. Generally 18 is the age you are considered old enough to make adult decisions - get married, sign contracts etc. The decision to appear in published porn falls into that category. You are too young at 16 to make a decision which could come back to haunt you years later.

Logically, the age of consent ought to be 18 too. But that would be so widely ignored that we would effectively not have an age of consent at all. So it is set at 16 for practical reasons, and even then it is only prosecuted if there is an age gap.

My view is that it would be sufficient to make it illegal to *publish* anything involving 16 - 18 years olds. Then people would not be getting prosecuted for sexting, or having an image of themselves.

But porn involving consulting 18+ adults engaging in what is probably quite a common kink, why should that be illegal?",0,1384791230,null,0,false,0,cdh6xp6,t3_1qw1an,t1_cdh6xp6,t1_cdh3dxr,null,1428610044,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Without the benefit of context, it looks like he can control the ball without having to look down much at all, so he can certainly see the game, but there's not much here to suggest that he can really read the game yet.

And that really is equivalent to looking at a bit of ice poking out of the sea and saying that I can't see anything to suggest that it's an iceberg - there's not nearly enough for me to go on (that said, it's great to see what some of our younglings are up to).",0,1384792179,null,0,false,0,cdh7aum,t3_1qtzts,t1_cdh7aum,t1_cdggt7l,null,1428609874,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

I happen to agree.

There is no legal requirement to wear a helmet, hiviz or headphones, its not right that police stop people going about there business to say otherwise, or imply that wearing these things will stop you getting crushed by trucks (which I would say offering misleading advice is dangerous) 

I would bet good money on these factors (helmets/highviz especially) having nothing at all todo with the recent deaths.

if a lorry does not see you in daylight Im not sure what use hiviz is.

And a helmet wont save you from being crushed.

The Tony the Tiger case, along with the PornTrial case (and arguably the recent TwinkTrial one) show how the CPS and police are overly-aggressive when it comes to prosecuting this sort of thing, and often seem to be in a rush to get a conviction.

So in the TwinkTrial case (which was about indecent images of children, but arguably only prosecuted due to attitudes towards homosexuality) the CPS's position was that it was up to the jury to decide based on looking (and being told by the CPS) how old the models were, rather than basing it on evidence or expert opinion.

Once these cases get to trial, they tend to fall apart (as with all the above ones, including the Tony the Tiger case).

Not correct. If a director can be proven to have taken action that caused the company to go bust or continued to trade when they knew the company was insolvent they can be held personally liable. 

Dividends are paid from post tax profit and are also taxed at the same 20% rate as income tax so you can't use them as a way of avoiding paying tax. What you do save is employers NI.

You don't need to be limited to avoid tax. One reason for going Ltd, other than protection from company debts, is that many suppliers tend not to offer trade accounts to sole traders.

While we have a good number of combination options for midfield, the future of our squad looks better in that shape. While Lucas-Gerrard-Coutinho are great right now, the idea is two have all three central midfielders moving forward. Gerrard isn't quite as pacey, although he offers a lot of technique, but going forward means requiring to get back FAST. Lucas, while great at defending and a clean passer, isn't very dynamic going forward.

5 years from now, a midfield three of Allen-Hendo-Coutinho could be insanely dangerous for opposition teams, while still solid enough for us. Those three need to absolutely BOSS the midfield. You can see why Juventus play a 3-5-2 when they've got Pogba, Pirlo and Marchissio in their midfield. Having Isla and Assamoah is also crucial - box to box wide midfielders/attacking fullbacks.

The general idea is that people should be licenced to have 'em, and that licences are only granted to those who are thought to be trustworthy and sensible. That pretty much rules out anyone who wants to carry a gun around all day just in case he sees someone of a different ethnicity. And that's how things were, roughly, until the late 80s.

And then there were two isolated incidents, in which loonies shot a bunch of people, in Hungerford and Dunblane. For some reason the press and politicians went ape-shit about them despite far more people dying every year in industrial accidents or on the roads or from accidents involving horses, and whole classes of weapon were banned entirely, for no good reason, but instead just because that's what the shooters used. It would have been far more sensible to look into how those people managed to convince people that they were trustworthy and, if necessary, fix the problems that let them get guns in the first place - or, and this is crucial, not change anything because to do so would cause more harm than good and effort is better spent elsewhere, such as reducing the number of fatal accidents involving horses.

Even before those bans, gun crime wasn't a significant problem in the UK. Yes, some criminals had guns, just like they do now, but you know who they mostly used them against? Other criminals. Yes, it's very sad that they did, but yer average law-abiding person wasn't ever affected.

I wish the laws could be relaxed and reset to what they were in 1986. Shooting is a fun, safe sport that almost no-one takes part in, just because the amount of bureaucratic faff involved because of legislation and the related insurance issues makes it too much like hard work.

It would probably end up just being something like being able to manipulate the emotions of others. For Jess and Alex, I think you're spot on. Finn's would either be the ability to freeze objects (not literally, but stop their movement), or some form of levitation (ability to control movement of objects vs ability to control movement of himself).

However, this is mostly just us taking the power itself and trying to find the opposite. To handle it like the show did in season two, you would have to take the aspect of the person that influenced their power (which can be existing personality traits, existing skills or interests, desires, etc.), flip that, and then base the power off it. For the characters that received a power from the storm, those would be:

- Finn: power based on how hard he tries to hold onto things, also affects his ability to use it. The inverse of that would be a power based on easily letting things go or pushing them away, so the power would probably be similar in that he'd get a weird type of force push away from himself versus the more controlled telekinesis he has now.

- Jess: power based on her ability to tell if people are lying to her, i.e. see through their bullshit. The inverse of that is naivete, but I'm not sure how that would manifest as a power.

- Rudy: power based on general suppression of his emotions. The inverse of that would be...being extremely emotive?

The condition for you to be 'allowed' to stop in a box junction was that the exit was clear when you entered (ie something turns into it in front of you and then blocks the exit or there's oncoming traffic when turning right).

There's a common situation where the box junction is signal controlled and there's another set of badly timed traffic lights shortly ahead of that. You go through as part of a stream of traffic soon after the light turns green, only for the light ahead to turn red and for the traffic to come to a stop, trapping you in the box junction and resulting in a fine.

------------------------------------------------------

[flat formation](http://i.imgur.com/fuLlIkQ.jpg)

Blue = Defending movement/zone

Red = Attacking movement/zone

[likely positional line up with movement routes](http://i.imgur.com/gcVjbaM.jpg)

*In theory* the formation should allow for us to have 7 players back or forward at any time once the ball passes either zone safely. It also ensures that we don't get over run at the back but at the same time have enough players forward to counter quickly and proficiently. It also means there is at least 2 passing options to every player from every position 

[Optimum passing routes added](http://i.imgur.com/zpPfPs5.jpg)

The only way for this to really work effectively is to have 2 class WB on either side that can get forward and back when the ball is in either zone to do their role, yet can intercept and tackle and also cross and shoot if need be up front

Note that when in the attacking role the CM's positions may vary depending on which side offers the most resistance

I am not to blame if your kids are little shits. It's people like you that need to get a clue and stop passing your responsibilities, like raising your own children, onto others.

No, I want you useless fucks to raise your own children and not make it my problem, or better yet don't have kids. If you're not competent enough to prevent your children getting pissed at the age of 13 then you definitely shouldn't be a parent.

 He's not the defensive midfielder type, he's more of a Belgian Wilshere, one who likes to receive the ball and start the attack.

This season he's given the same role, but with Paulinho he has to hang back and play through Paulinho sometimes too. With that in mind, he has to perform 2 jobs as does Paulinho mind, to drive forward and to hang back, this after a hip injury. Speaking of injuries, Capoue has been injured and so has Sandro, the partner he needs. KuriousInu put it best in that he needs to be paired with Capoue who will perform the defensive duties for him.

An employer does not want a square block for a square hole. An employer wants a block that morphs to fit whatever hole they create whilst also jumping through hoops. Ideally paid for and trained by someone else other than them but with enough experience to prove they're the block for the job.

No careers guidance can hope to encompass that. To be fair, I think the education system in the UK for anyone over the age of 20 is incredibly rigid and restricts a lot of people who would like to retrain.

They should redesign the whole jobcentre. Rather than an exercise in ticking boxes, it could do so much more and be a lot less unpleasant about it.

The issue is not that its worthless (I wear highviz myself) the issue its its avoiding the real problems as telling cyclists that these things will protect them. Which is the mistake that's been made in the Superhighway where cyclists assume they are safe because of bad design.

Educate cyclists, improve road design, change truck activity.....Those are the real issues.

And I didn't define how ideology would influence voters.

You could hold a portfolio consisting entirely of Mutual Funds and Unit Trusts and not pay anything for the time being.  I harp on about this a lot, but there are changes coming in to effect in April relating to the payment of trail commission from Fund Managers to platforms.  This is a fairly large revenue stream and many brokers are changing their pricing structures.  From what I have read, Barclays are not yet compliant with these changes and so you may very well see a change to their pricing structure.

In addition, standard closure fee of £50 plus VAT and a transfer fee of £30 per line of stock. To be frank, you are unlikely to escape the transfer out fee with the majority of discount brokers.

Hargreaves are due to launch a new pricing structure to comply with the changes - http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/2265078/hargreaves-to-launch-rebate-free-charging-structure-in-january.  

Right now, for both ISAs and standard trading accounts, many brokers could change their pricing structure in anticipation of the changes.  Some brokers have already made the leap, such as III, or are about to, such as Hargreaves.

Cyclists of course do silly things, as do drivers. The issue for many cyclists though is not necessarily careless activity,  its not being seen.

The issue many cyclists have is not being seen is not their fault (and law for the most part would agree with this  - as do I). That does not excuse ""ninja"" cyclist and that does not excuse careless cycling in general. But more often than not law breaking is not the issue as recent stats show.

On the right due to how balanced and dynamic the Johnson/Henderson partnership is, its a bit like having both a right winger and an inside-right going forward, but still being very secure against counter attacks. In the centre with coutinho, suarez and sturridge regularly attracting two defenders and all able to carry the ball, with the right combinations we will open teams up. For example the two or three times against fulham these three players pulled both fulham CM and CBs out of position allowing henderson to run in behind.

The weakness, that may be exploited by teams with strong individual attackers or who are willing to take risks and push forward in numbers is in the lopsidedness defensively. Basically the -2- of coutinho and henderson have dual roles, coutinho as a number 10 on attack but supporting the LB defensively, and henderson to work with johnson and make runs into the box but also to support the CMs. Teams that are clever enough or who shift the ball quickly may be able to catch coutinho high up and central and expose the LB, or force Henderson wide to outnumber Lucas and Gerrard in the centre.",0,1384803428,null,0,false,0,cdhc86g,t3_1qwfed,t1_cdhc86g,t1_cdh6x35,null,1428607575,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

You reall should think of better questions.

How about 

If you were organizing a party, would you a) go to the supermarket or b) use this service.

Then try and make your service better than going to tesco to buy loads of cheap stella. 

or for when a party has been organized, and more people than expected turn up.

consider stocking BBQ supplies in summer. turn up with charcoal and lighting fluid, upsell stella and red bull. 

find a way to target people who've gone home from the pub with loads of mates. 

and, how is this different than sending a taxi driver to tesco then to the kebabs. 

good luck, sounds like fun.

&gt; He said: “I certainly think the Government’s policies on austerity with cuts in public services and welfare benefits have been a contributory factor. I suspect, with increasing fuel bills, many low-income households in the North East, especially older people, are **having to choose between heating and eating**.”

&gt; Mr Morris said changes in welfare reform have left families unable to cope, reflected in an “exponential increase in the reliance on food banks across the region”.

&gt; ""Get your chequebook out, Roman,"" was the general consensus

I really dislike transfer rumours, especially ones that come far in advance of the window. But, it's hard to ignore something about Falcao considering the massive price tag he'd carry.

I think everyone remembers when we spent £50 million on a certain striker, and I don't think I'm wrong in saying that Falcao would command a similar if not higher fee given his wages in Monaco (Estimated at around €14 million annually). That being said, a growing assumption in media is that Falcao isn't enjoying his time at the Monégasque outfit.

He isn't third party owned, and if he wants to leave a team after six months - could he leave for less than his value? Probably not, but either way would it be worth picking him up?

This also brings up another issue which is the amount of strikers we have on retainer. Torres, Eto'o, Ba, and Lukaku on loan who most people 
see as our future hitman. 

I see us picking up Falcao as likely as our prospects were in picking up Cavani or Aguero, a lot of bluster and no real movement.

What do people think? Would he be worth the price tag, would we end up offloading Ba in the window, could he fit in the system?

1) Is this back three just the three players you chose, or BR's favored three?


2) How exactly does this system generate offense? Is it through counterattacking, as you suggest above, keeping possession, or is it not as clear-cut as that?


3) Does BR see this as our best formation, or is he using it now based primarily on the personnel he has available?


4) Do you think the team is happy with the players it currently has in these roles, or do you think we're looking to improve i.e. more athletic CMs, Glen Johnson's successor, a new LB, etc.?

Cheers, thanks for the tactical insight!

You can send a SEPA transfer (its not as complicated as you think, your bank will handle everything regarding the currency exchange into EUR, and Bitstamp will on their end handle the exchange to USD). But you will wait for 4-5 working days for the transfer to go through (sometimes shorter). The price of BTC may be even higher (or lower) by then...

Using fast bank transfers within the uk or cash you have:

Localbitcoins is fine but there is less control and verification. You are sending money to whatever the seller messages you. (or if you are buyer, you post a deposit address via chat).

With Bitbargain, your seller will have a verified bank account. He has had to prove he is the owner of the account and so even if someone has hijacked his account everything is more or less controlled. The buyer can be required to have specific data registered and verified on the site. As a result it has very much become a premium escrow service.

Seller are therefore able to charge what the want, and limit sales to specific people. I for example will sell you 1 BTC at a large markup if you want to remain more or less anonymous and don't want to share who you are. If you have verified your Bank, phone, and ID I will sell you larger amounts at a heavily discounted rate, but still higher than the exchanges.

Right now however it seems the vendors are basing their prices on the chinese market prices. If you can sell BTC for 500£, then why not do it?

2) Theres a lot more to the formation, I gave just the quickest insight I could, there's lot and lots of what to do's if this happens.. the main focus is to retain possession as possible, with this formation we can retain possession comfortably AND securely in either half either defending or attacking and because the players have multiple passing routes and the opposition having limited passing routes we can expect a high retention. Like i said there is a LOT I've left out but generally its if they have it in our half get players back recover, retain, gradually move forward, if were in their half its keep, press, and attack.

3) Not sure on either.. I think he likes the options this formation offers and I also think its the most practical with the players we have. When you think about it depending on which half the ball is in the formation allows for 7 players to be defending or attacking in an instant

The indifference you display to the rising generation and what society can do as a whole to assist in the raising of a child is stereotypical of the individualism (read: selfishness) which tears social contracts apart.

An argument can be made that policy creates culture which then impacts on social contracts (case in point: Thatcher's policies gave rise to the rampant individualism which destroyed the country's social contracts, particularly those of the North) but even then a counter-argument can be made that even after she crushed the unions the people elected to keep her in Number 10, and even after the Poll Tax episode the country voted to keep the Tories too: the democracy of Britain showed an underlying culture of individualism had already taken hold and people no longer wanted to be beholden night and day to Socialism.

If it is Soft-canon/beta-canon/2nd tier canon (many people have different words for this type of canon) it stands until something over rides it. Examples would be like the EU in Star Wars, most of the EU is soft-canon. Only things in the movies and TV shows are top level canon and can over-ride anything that is soft-canon.

What you mean to say is that many parts of *any* nation which uses first past the post will not be well represented, due to the nature of the system.

I've said it before but it bears repeating. The Conservative / Labour divide is much more strongly urban / rural than North / South.

Where there *is* a North South divide, it's between Labour / Lib Dem, with the Lib Dems either winning or acting as a spoiler for Labour in many parts of the South.

My own constituency, which is considered the safest of Tory safe seats, is an excellent example. Note how the Conservatives enjoy a permanent majority because of the awkward split between Lib Dem and Labour voters.

This doesn't make any sense. Yes, it's heavily implied that the Doctor and River are married at some point along their timelines, but they're not going to be related. River is called 'River Song' because in *A Good Man Goes To War*, it's stated that that's how Melody Pond is translated into the language of the Gamma Forests. 

Now, we admittedly don't know a whole lot about the marriage ceremonies and conventions of either later-century humans or the Time Lords, but neither seem to be particularly matriarchal. There's also been no mention of River ever calling the Doctor ""Mr. Song"" or ""Mr. Pond"". And River doesn't seem to have changed her last name at any point, other than becoming known as River Song as some point during her training at the hands of the Silence.

""In American constitutional law, a statute is void for vagueness and unenforceable if it is too vague for the average citizen to understand. There are several ways, senses or reasons a statute might be considered vague. In general, a statute might be called void for vagueness reasons when an average citizen cannot generally determine what persons are regulated, what conduct is prohibited, or what punishment may be imposed. Criminal laws which didn't state explicitly and definitely what conduct is punishable for example are void for vagueness. A statute is also void for vagueness if a legislature's delegation of authority to judges and/or administrators is so extensive that it would lead to arbitrary prosecutions.[1] R""",0,1384809845,null,0,false,0,cdhf9dz,t3_1qw1an,t1_cdhf9dz,t1_cdhf2s2,null,1428606066,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You are if you support this policy. You are arguing for the majority of men in the UK to be forced onto what will essentially be a perverts register, simply for looking at pornography on the internet.

No. Children shouldn't be looking at pornography. It's the parents responsibility to make sure they don't in their own home, and to regulate the internet in their own home and not other peoples. There is far, far more content on the internet that shouldn't be viewed by children in addition to porn. 

&gt;Frankly, all people should care about children's emotional and mental welfare, not just those of our entourage.

Porn is not plastered on the walls all over society. It is not sold to children. It is not televised. It is completely concealed in public.

Rayo supporters are very niche because they're based around Vallecas which is an exclusively working class area in the centre of the city.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"Except that the decisions  on the EU are not made for Scotland's benefit anyway, they're made mainly for the City. At least, with independence, Scotland can *argue* for what she wants. Furthermore, Scotland *would* be a big contributor, we have 25% of the EU's oil capacity.

Personally, I have seen nothing to suggest that the power surrendered to the EU would be any greater than the powers that has been surrendered to Westminster. 

What's so good about Westminster being in control of most of our administration? It only results in Scotland being sacrificed time and again for England's benefit.

Why wouldn't a free movement border, or a low disruption trading relationship work if both parties wanted it? Do you really think the UK government would destroy the trading relationships of hundreds of businesses across England, Wales and NI, potentially causing losses of millions of pounds purely because Scotland went independent? It makes *perfect* economic sense.

On the currency union, the exact same arguments against the Euro apply, Scotland has little control over what rUK might do with it that can sink it, for example, the English economy being buoyed up by astronomical house prices in London.

I can think of no country, none at all, who would willingly give up control of 84% of it's economic levers to be able to be part of a currency, trade or political union in order for some nebulous ""stability"".

Many different things have been proposed, such as join the EU but not the Euro, as Sweden has done, and creating a new currency and tying it to the English pound as Sweden has done with its Kronor. There's also talk of joining a Nordic union, which from little I've seen from Scandinavia the idea is fairly popular over there.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Because the base human reaction to change or a lack of pattern is to distrust and dislike it, the Daily Mail knows this and capitalises on it. These two things are true about the world today:

* Asian people in Britain represent a lack of pattern, they are the minority. They are not what is normal and accepted.

* Most people in the world are stupid and do not like to think.

With these two things in mind, it is easy to see why the Daily Mail exists. It takes a real concious effort to accept that Asian and other ethnic minorities are actually entirely normal and decent people (for the most part). In fact, the only thing that separates us from them is the colour of our skin. 

People in 1950s America, 1600s Witch-hunters in new England, Gay hating people in uganda, take whichever group of people it is that is acting in an intolerant and as we see it unacceptable way, and it's the same. I think It's complete bollocks that New England settlers were uneducated or genuinely thought the people they were putting on trial were actually witches, but they were different. They invariably were socially undesirable, so they got the chop. or the plunge. Or the tied to a stake and burned. Calling people witches was just their way of rationalising difference and unconformity. 

Fast forward to the present day. Witch-hunts and distrust of black people never went away, now it's called ""**BENEFIT SCROUNGING FAMILY HAS 18 CHILDREN!**"", or ""**ASYLUM SEEKING FAMILY SEEKS NEW HOME FROM TAXPAYER**"" The issue isn't that we're giving these people benefits, I don't think I've ever met a Brit who believes the welfare state is a bad thing. The problem these unthinking gorillas have is that the so called ""scroungers"" have given birth 18 young where the norm is 2 or 3, or the ""scroungers"" have entered a country without going through normal immigration routes, or they are further diluting what the conservative reader base of the Daily Mail sees as their pristine and racially pure homeland.

Going back to my original point, it takes real effort to see that these things aren't bad, they're just different. it's what makes this island so beautiful and alluring and desirable. People know that you will find here a community who accepts you and a welfare state that acknowledges you're just down on your luck, and gives you a helping hand. It is easy to not put this effort in and just register asylum seekers and a lack of contraception as bad, as wrong, as alien. That is where the Daily Mail comes in. It is owned and operated by very smart businessmen and women, who know that there is a sucker born every minute who will purchase the Mail and accept it's racially fuelled diatribes as gospel. 

So to answer your question, the Daily Mail isn't bad, it's part of a free press that I'm glad exists in this country, but the people who read it are shit. They are unthinking servile morons who simply refuse to think about what they are reading. The Daily Mail just got to the business opportunity first.

Surely some of the credit needs to go to, well, every other worker in the company, none of whom are getting 14% pay rises.  
Instead, in a lot of cases, they're getting pay freezes, or below inflation wage rises. 

Even if we assume that it is mainly down to the directors, when the directors do well, they get massive bonuses, and everyone else gets a small increase.  
When things go badly (again, down to the directors, if we're assuming they're the main driver), they either just get a small bonus (for doing a **bad** job) or leave the company (with a big payoff) and people at the bottom get laid off/pay freezes.

true,MrFandang0,null,null,"Reminded me of this that I read a while ago:

Suppose that once a week, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten
comes to £100.

If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something
like this: -

The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.
The fifth would pay £1.
The sixth would pay £3.
The seventh would pay £7.
The eighth would pay £12.
The ninth would pay £18.
And the tenth man (the richest) would pay £59.

So, that’s what they decided to do.

The ten men drank in the bar every week and seemed quite happy with the
arrangement until, one day, the owner caused them a little problem. “Since
you are all such good customers”, he said, “I’m going to reduce the cost
of your weekly beer by £20. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just
£80.

The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the
first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free but what
about the other six men? The paying customers? How could they divide the
£20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share? They realized that
£20 divided by six is £3.33 but if they subtracted that from everybody’s
share then not only would the first four men still be drinking for free
but the fifth and sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his
beer.

So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fairer to reduce each man’s
bill by a higher percentage. They decided to follow the principle of the
tax system they had been using and he proceeded to work out the amounts he
suggested that each should now pay.

And so, the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (a 100%
saving).
The sixth man now paid £2 instead of £3 (a 33% saving).
The seventh man now paid £5 instead of £7 (a 28% saving).
The eighth man now paid £9 instead of £12 (a 25% saving).
The ninth man now paid £14 instead of £18 (a 22% saving).
And the tenth man now paid £49 instead of £59 (a 16% saving).

Each of the last six was better off than before with the first four
continuing to drink for free.

But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings. “I only
got £1 out of the £20 saving,” declared the sixth man. He pointed to the
tenth man, “but he got £10″

“Yes, that’s right,” exclaimed the fifth man. “I only saved £1 too. It’s
unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me”

“That’s true” shouted the seventh man. “Why should he get £10 back when I
only got £2? The wealthy get all the breaks”

“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in unison, “we didn’t get
anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor”. The nine men
surrounded the tenth and beat him up.

The next week the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, so the nine sat
down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the
bill, they discovered something important –they didn’t have enough money
between all of them to pay for even half of the bill.

And that, boys and girls, journalists and government ministers, is how our
tax system works. The people who already pay the highest taxes will
naturally get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much,
attack them for being wealthy and they just might not show up anymore. In
fact, they might start drinking overseas, where the atmosphere is somewhat
friendlier.""

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"Labour nosedived in the polls after Iraq and they never recovered. And voter turn out has also dropped to new lows. This current coalition government still has less than 50% of those that voted (But just enough to win under ""first past the post"").

Since Iraq, we've had the Arab Spring where commitment of forces was minimal whereas before boots would have been on the ground in force, especially with all the oil contracts on offer. Instead we had to sneak ""advisers"" into the country so as to not loose influence completely, but at the same time not fall foul of the public mood.

The government knows how damaging wars are to their ratings. Previously if you were low in the polls, you had a war with some natives with spears to bring yourself back up. 

Thatcher had a rare modern example of that with the Falklands, it was very touch and go both militarily and politically during the campaign, but the victory gave Britain a much needed moral boost. This used to be par for the course in previous centuries, but Blair learned quite quickly how much of an exception to the rule the Falklands was in a modern context.

This disgust of wars in the modern age is entirely down to the change of view after the Great War and those that keep trying to remind us. For the first time, the common man had a say in his own future (or at least the beginnings of it).

This will only remain true if people continue to remember why war is so bad. It's easy to forget in this world of night vision camera footage and short sanitised clips on YouTube (Anything through a lens removes you from the reality, just ask any war correspondent). That's not all that different than how the Times used to report on our wars with those pesky natives, it's other worldly, detached, ""but now in colour!"".

War isn't detached to my generation. My house was bombed by the Germans, many of my family killed. I grew up with the fear of death without warning, as did everyone around me of all classes, wealth did not spare you from dying. When my generation goes, there will be nobody left with first hand experience of what it's like to be on the receiving end of a war in this country. If we don't keep reminding people, then war will become attractive again further down the line.

Indifference is already happening, look at how divisive a simple act of remembering has become. It's history to most now. No different than the Battle of Trafalgar or Waterloo. History almost always repeats and this is previous/our generation(s) trying to save your generation the misery we went through.

The message isn't patriotic or nationalistic, it's ""don't have wars"".

true,NeverDecided,null,null,"I cannot agree more with this but I will add my own two cents. I work in a bar and we get people coming in all the time asking for jobs. The most common applicant is this: They come in with a handful/ bagful of CVs and ask me do you have any jobs ? These are the people who have gone round maybe every bar and restaurant in the area asking the same question. These people are 99% likely to fail, yet from their perspective they think they have asked everywhere and thus think they have tried really heard. So, how should you do it ? :

Dress: Common sense, you want to make a good impresion, so why do so many people come in like they have just got out of bed. Even if you are applying to be a kitchen porter or a job that maybe wouldn't require you to dress smartly, you still should. I would always recommend smart trousers and a shirt, it shows you are making an effort and don't take the easiest route.

The speech: As Snay said, know who you are going to talk to. So many people ask me if we have any jobs, I am not a manager, and whilst I will be happy to take your CV, you have missed out on a chance to make an impression. Ideally, find the managers name out first but even if not, always ask for him/her. Don't just blindly hand your CV in, tell them about a bit yourself, why you want the job etc. My manager always makes a few notes on the CVs of people who do this, was well mannered and presentable for example.

The CV and covering letter, again as Snay said should be specific to the job position and company you are applying for. Don't just say things like, I think your company would be great to work for or I really admire your company, back it up, as you will get asked why in further depth in an interview. Don't skimp on your research, in a job for Sainsburys, I got asked what I knew about the company, having done extensive research, I was able to reel off a short history of the company, there future plans, how many stores they had etc. Some people would think that is ridiculous and over the top, of course you aren't expected to know that much  but the interviewer was genuinely impressed that I had taken the time to do that, and that might have been the difference that got me the job over someone else.

I know you mentioned you were looking for an office job ideally, but now is the time that most retail and food/drink establishments will be hiring for christmas temps. Taking on board the advice of Snay and I, and applying to such places should really boost your chances of getting a job.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"Or they might decide to use tax loopholes or havens, or avoid paying it altogether through use of offshore accounts, or maybe they'll even just straight-up buy their way into parliaments through lobbying and use of whatever companies they may hold high-ranking positions or collossal shares in.

Your example might have been apt and accurate fourty years ago, but not anymore. A number of the rich, super rich, mega rich and holy shit is your bed made of diamonds rich have made it clear that there are numerous ways to avoid paying tax and getting better breaks for yourself. If you can afford the accountant, the lawyer and the lobbyist. Those that don't have either made themselves known and are immune to such criticism or have not for whatever reasons they choose, but know that they could. You categorically cannot criticise the common citizen for crying ""cunts"" at the current colossal chasm in the contributions to the country's collective cash cache. 

The simple fact is this. When the Government stops fellating big business and big spenders and saying ""Does this please the sir?"" while kicking down the people that didn't vote them into power, then maybe we'll have a tax system worth using, and maybe the rich will be made to pay their fair share as your example states, and maybe we can begin using our status as, you know, the world's sixth largest economy and major hub of global trade to our advantage rather than act like a bullshit banana republic with the same economic stability as a two-legged giraffe on stilts.

true,JimmySinner,null,null,"**Edit:** I'm putting this here because this post got really long. I forgot to say who David Nutt, mentioned in the first paragraph, actually is. Here's his Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nutt

The comment didn't say that we should ignore the law and do whatever we want, though I understand how you could infer that. Laws aren't infallible, they're just rules written by people who might not be the most knowledgeable about the subjects at hand. I mean, David Nutt was dismissed from his governmental position as chair on the board of the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs after he said that ""the obscenity of hunting down low-level cannabis users to protect them is beyond absurd"" and that horse riding was statistically more dangerous than ecstasy. Unfortunately there's a moral majority who would rather sweep that under the rug and maintain the status quo for the sake of ""traditional values"".

Violating another person, regardless of whether or not it's subject to a law on the act, is a terrible thing to do. You're aware of this obviously, you stated yourself it's a ridiculous notion. What you've done, perhaps unawares, is created a straw man, by misrepresenting OP's position and presenting it as a ridiculous idea that twists OP's words. It's often a form of trolling (and also a tactic used by politicians such as those in government who like arrests rates high and MPs peachy), but I don't believe you've done it maliciously. It seems that you've genuinely just misunderstood what OP was trying to get across.

I recently read a quote in a Reddit comment on morals that went something like ""if everybody did this, would the world be a better place?"", and obviously if everybody was to do something like you're suggesting the answer is obviously no. But that's a straw man, because you're not actually trying to suggest anybody should do that.

My point is, and I apologise for rambling on, that some things need not be governed by law. Regulated, perhaps, for the protection of its citizens. Rape is something people just shouldn't do, regardless of whether people have written rules about it. It's good that society can punish rapists and murderers and anybody who commits a serious breach of trust by writing punishments for the people that do it. Personally I like a system the Irish used to have by which a murder was given to the victim's family as a slave to do with as they wished. He was considered property now, so the could kill him with impunity or they could put him to work, or release him.

Keeping them off the streets is a pretty good second, I suppose. However, acts that are not harmful to other human beings needn't be considered crimes (so long as they are regulated to prevent breaches of trust and protect the people, working hours and minimum wages, social housing and so forth) and I think that is what OP was trying to say. I'm sorry for your confusion.

As a Scot, even this bothers me how our MP's can vote on stuff that has no effect on us, there should be an English parliament to keep things fair, but when is politics ever fair... Thats another story...

true,Prairie_Dog,cyberman,Cyberperson,"They only have a selection of the Classic Series on Netflix, but that's fine. It is not necessary to watch it in order. The classic episodes mainly consisted of two to eight 20-some minute serials. The classic series didn't usually consist of multi-story or season-long arcs like the new series does. Each story can be enjoyed as a separate experience. You can skip around and try out different Doctors and their TARDIS crews.

I would suggest starting no earlier than the Third Doctor (played by Jon Pertwee). The series was first broadcast in color during his run. A lot of his adventures are earthbound and involve UNIT. He was sort of a rough and tumble doctor who often confronted his enemies with martial arts, as well as by outsmarting them.

The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) is a fan favorite, and had the longest run to date. Some of the most well known and loved episodes occurred during his tenure. He's a quirky and alien Doctor, and has some great companions. Definitely recommended!

The Fifth Doctor (Peter Davidson) might also be a good choice. He often had a fairly full TARDIS, and was a warm and more fatherly portrayal of the Doctor.

Both the Sixth and Seventh Doctors had much shorter tenures. They suffered from the BBC neglecting the show, and from production values and special effects that were substandard even in the '80s. Still, their good episodes were very good. They had uneven runs though, hit or miss.

So, you should certainly watch the Classic Series. However, when you do so, you have to view it as a product of its time. Special effects were NOT what we enjoy today. The stories and characters were what made good episodes worthwhile. Approach it with patience and an open mind, and I think you'll come to love it.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I agree with a lot of what he says but I think he downplays the importance of the French Revolution. Liberté, Egalité, Franternité was not a cheap knock-off of the American version - it may have taken serious inspiration from the Americans but there is a significant difference between a group of rich land owning nobles taking control of the colonies they control over a dispute about the legality of taxation and a very poor population rising up, storming the Bastille and not just separating from a monarchy but destroying it entirely. The French Revolution was a great deal more radical in what it achieved even if it didn't immediately result in peace and democracy. 

It was the French Revolution not the American one that influenced European thought over the next few centuries especially French and German thought. Kojeve claimed The French Revolution (not the American Revolution) was the 'end of history', i.e rights and equality had definitively won out over aristocracy. Marxists too take this idea seriously giving the French Revolution a lot of importance. You have a whole string of philosophers through Hegel, Marx, Adorno, Kojeve etc who used the French Revolution above any other event as the basic foundation of their ideas. 

I think you would be wrong if you thought Germany and France have been more influenced by English libertarianism and capitalism than they have by their own philosophers who took their cue from the French Revolution (not Britain or America).

Edit: My point being that France and Germany and their colonies developed under similar principles derived from a source other than 'English freedoms' and both countries are modern democracies with similar protections and freedoms as us. Their former colonies are hit and miss like ours but you can't say that French and German influence has made these peoples less likely to succeed because they didn't have access to the idea of democracy. Their mother countries demonstrate this is not true as they have derived these principles from an event that predates the independence of colonies. The concepts of freedom, democracy, the rights or man etc had been floating around Europe and their colonies long before those colonies tried it for themselves. Non English colonies weren't ignorant. 

Besides I think a lot of the reason these places mentioned are generally successes is money. That doesn't mean they're any nicer places to live or have any more 'English Freedoms' than anywhere else. He's confusing the ability of some people to make profit with the whole country's freedom.

true,northerncal,lfc68,,"I get what you are saying, and I'm not necessarily an advocate of this formation, but I don't think it's as simple or weak as you are describing it. 

Your explanation of how to defeat this formation is for the other team to use all 4 of their midfielders to pressure our 2 CMs? Of course this would stop Gerrard and Lucas, you're doing 4 v 2, in any match-up the side with twice the numbers will come out top. But that doesn't mean this is a good strategy for opposition to play, quite the opposite actually it seems to me. This completely drags their wide mids out of place. In order to exploit this Liverpool has a couple options. 1. Henderson out Coutinho could just drop a bit deeper, making themselves open to passes, or 2. either of the fullbacks can be passed to who could then pass forwards to our wide midfielders. In addition, either of our fullbacks would push forwards past the midfield line (simultaneously, Gerrard + Lucas drop away from 4 opposition midfielders) and boom, you now have 2(Enrique+Coutinho or Johnson+Henderson) vs. 1 (opposition fullback), which, I'm sure you know, is a recipe for disaster for the other team if we can consistently get 2v1 against them. If we want to make matters even worse for the other team trying your defensive tactic, either of Sturridge or Suarez can drift wide that way, threatening a 3v1 on that side, and if their marking center back tries to follow them to provide assistance there that leaves the second center back facing a 1v1 centrally in front of goal, a potentially suicidal outcome vs either Suarez out Sturridge. If their midfielders retreat to try to prevent this, we just pass back to CM and start this whole thing over again. 

There is a reason teams don't really do this against 4-4-2s, (which essentially this almost is) you just can't afford pushing that many players into one area without exposing other areas on the pitch, as again, I'm sure you're well aware. 

On defense I don't think it's particularly suspect, as long as (and this is key, and yes, could sometimes be a little difficult) coutinho and Henderson (or whoever is playing wide mid) track back when we are without the ball. If this happens than our shape without the ball is essentially a 4-4-2, which is pretty reliable defensively. 

I recognize that it is not a perfect formation, and that sometimes, probably particularly against stronger foes it may not work out, but I don't think it's something to be so easily discounted. It's not exactly an ideal formation because it requires a fair amount of tactical versatility (and therefore allows for less specialization) from our wide midfielders, but as a fairly adaptable formation to have in our rotation of options, I think it's a useful one to have.

true,Acefighter66,null,null,"Don't know if you'll read this but I wanted to say something that I don't think has been mentioned yet. Like most in this thread, I am also a huge fan of both Superman and the Doctor. It has also taken me up until relatively recent before I was able to understand why I enjoy these two more than almost any other fictional characters I can think of. There are distinct similarities among these two that very few also face, which are conflicts of pure morality. Each are the very ultimate in one specific field. Superman's being pure force while the doctor's being pure intelligence. Superman is also smart and several iterations of the Doctor have shown physical prowess, yet in that once single skill or ability each are for arguments sake the absolute specimens of the universe. I'd expect that superman would be considered one of the most intelligent of those among the human race due to his alien biology but Lex Luthors must be superior in order to have him cornered as many times as he has while the doctor being as adept, if not more so, physically than many other humans on the earth; it is his intelligence that is his real weapon against the unrestrained might of all the cosmos.

 This leads me into my main point. 

While I constantly hear about how I'm lame for picking Superman over Batman as Superman is invincible, has unlimited strength, one very specific and usually hard to acquire weakness and in all accounts over powered. Yet, it's not his abilities that have inspired me to look up to him. I look up to him for the moral choices he is forced to make and the way he makes them which no villain in his universe aside from Lex could conceive nor fund. I'm talking the choices he must make such as saving all of humanity or leaving them to die so as to save Lois from burning up in a distant sun he cannot reach unless he forsakes the people. It isn't the lack of strength or physical ability that hinders him it's a real human decision that ANYONE would struggle with. The doctor faces many similar challenges. He is individually more intelligent than the Daleks, Cybermen, Zontarans, etc combined, yet they repeatedly back him into a corner because they attempt to exploit his most prominent and easily threatened weakness which is his love of life. He cannot save everyone as he is physically unable to, yet simply using his intellect to destroy all enemies who stand in his path is possible but he refuses to become that doctor in the iterations we've seen. (Don't know about the Hurt doctor yet) Because of his overwhelming knowledge of the universe and the way it works he is forced to make choices that will save as many lives as he can while still suppressing or eliminating the threat for the time being without killing them. Both of which goals would be easier if he would simply throw aside such morals for the sake of the ""greater good."" 

It's choices like this that make characters like The Doctor and Superman continue to be so highly revered by so many people for such a long time instead of living long enough to see themselves become the villain.
