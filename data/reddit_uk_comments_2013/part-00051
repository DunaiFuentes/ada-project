1) His own self love. Now, I accept that you want the manager to be confident in his own abilities but Warnock's ego is so big he seems to think he's doing us a favour by just being here.

2) His love of Michael Brown.

3) His pure hatred of Becchio to the point where he seems to attack him in any public speaking he does. He called him a 'dud' the other day. Fuck off Colin, the man is one of the top 10 goal scorers in this club's history and scored 19 goals this season with little or no service. Today you had the gall to say that we would have won if we had a goal-scorer. Now where might we find one of those? Oh, you fucking sold him. I don't have a problem with Morison (apart from his lack of an r) but I would have liked to have seen him alongside Becchio, not instead of.

4) His management of Ross Barkley.

5) The way he defends his own signings but doesn't do the same for players who were already here. Byram, McCormack, Lees, Becchio have all been attacked for making mistakes this season. But never Browneh or Tongey or Pelts.

6) His disdain for the fans. He likes to have a dig at us, never once thinking that we could be right and he might be wrong. His ego is too big for that. The sarcastic hand clap at Boro epitomised him, the smug cunt.

7) How it doesn't seem to be about the club getting promotion, it's about him getting his 8th promotion. He seems to make any interview about him and getting another promotion, it's all he cares about. That and his family who he manages to bring up in every interview. ""Our Ameh says to me, have a go in the cups dad. So I did"". Fuck off Warnock.

Now, all of that could be forgiven if the football was anywhere half decent and not some of the worst performances I've ever seen from a Leeds team. But it isn't and so I can't.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"I agree.  Besides, Huddlestone moves the ball better than all our current midfielders, and not just over forty yards.  However well Dembele is playing at the moment (and Parker too), there have been many occasions this season against teams who are packing the defences when I've wished we had a central-midfielder on who saw the pass as the first option.

Take, for example, Bale's goal against Southampton: neither of our currently playing midfielders would have played that ball.  Defoe's movement is always better with Huddlestone on the ball too, IMO, because he knows it can be played first time if he's spotted.  There have been a couple of others, such as Dempsey's goal vs Everton, where (though it would be a stretch to call Hudd's contributions as assists) his willingness to pass the ball first time without needing to carry it has released other players into space to shoot.  Simple stuff and something Huddlestone and Carroll offer that Dembele/Parker don't, with their propensity to run with the ball, and that Livermore seemingly can't do.

There are limitations to his defensive side, of course.  AVB has been quoted as saying Huddlestone can be important in a 4-3-3, presumably with two more mobile central midfielders.  In a 4-4-2, Huddlestone can do a job against weaker teams but otherwise needs someone like Sandro/Palacios/Zokora to do all the defensive leg-work.

The biggest downside at the moment is just Huddlestone's lack of match fitness.  He hasn't had a decent run of games for about two years due to injury.",0,1363475566,null,0,false,0,c8wy9wh,t3_1adpvk,t1_c8wy9wh,t1_c8whfc8,null,1431608221,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

&gt;Crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 8.4% between the years ending September 2011 and September 2012, according to the latest crime statistics.

&gt;8.9m crimes were reported in 2011/12, down from 9.6m the previous year, and 29% lower than ten years ago, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

And oh look, near the bottom, a nice little paragraph that states:

&gt;Another of the more interesting figures is that of the perception of crime. The CSEW asks people whether they think crime is getting worse where they live and nationally. So, people think crime is getting worse - but not where they live. It's the gap between what we know is going on and what we think is going on.

Guess you're in that particular group, but your world is not the real world. You already stated you live in the sticks, away from cities. I've lived in the heart of Manchester for a couple decades now and only once even seen a violent crime and it was one that nearly happened to me at 1am in the worst part of the city and was entirely a wrong place, wrong time situation.

Either way, keep your guns out of the city, they'll only do more harm there than good.

I can only add that Christianity has extremely unpalatable views mixed in, but most modern denominations don't hold them to be true. Religions can change, and they can adapt to modern society and modern values. 

The issue is that it seems many Muslims in the UK are out of step with British values. And as you say, we can't fix this problem by turning our backs on them, or by labeling Islam a ""problem"". Such ways of speaking radicalise both sides of the debate - turning Muslims into a legitimate target for abuse for the Far-Right, and in turn segregating them from society and making Jihadic views more attractive to them.

I think it's clear that multiculturalism has failed, not because letting people into our country was a mistake but because it has resulted in minority enclaves within Britain's borders. Here, but separate from us. We need to somehow integrate them, and part of that will involve challenging views that are unacceptable to us.

I think it's fantastic to see how the ships are coming on.

Personally, I'd rather cut personnel in the armed forces than projects like this. Because when you need them, you can push infantry through basic training in 30 weeks or draft up reserves... but things like this take a decade of planning, infrastructure and materials. You just can't make them at short notice. Not to mention the fact that as a military project the government can preferentially choose UK industries for most of the work, boosting the economy at industrial sites like Rosyth and Portsmouth that badly need it.

I remember all the same rubbish with the Eurofighter - ""It wasn't designed for the post-soviet world""... ""we don't need it""... ""it's too expensive"" etc. Now that they're on runways, in Afghanistan and doing their thing everybody seems pretty peachy about it. Give it a year or two after being at sea, and the first natural disaster this thing can help out with and the nay-sayers will eat their words. Seems like a completely sensible purchase for an island nation with overseas interests and 75% of its imports delivered by sea.

Plus, they will have aircraft... just not jets for the first few years. No reason why Chinnoks and Apache helicopters can't operate from the deck.

Football is all about two teams attempting to defeat each other.

The friendly aspect of the game is what 90% of fans go for, and they have a good time 90% of the time.

That 10% chance of shit going wrong is where the police step in.

From your POV maybe it looked wrong and over the top, but the eye in the sky can see a lot more than you. Maybe the away fans path was coming into contact with the home fans at a junction up a head so they had to divert you guys. Maybe some known trouble makers were spotted within a group and so the police had to up their level of surveillance. It is not unusual.

You have to consider that the police have a whole lot more situational awareness with their methods of communication than you do. There is ALWAYS a reason for the actions of the police (excluding the actions of individuals of course), because the police are under such high levels of scrutiny they need to be on the ball.

Sometimes mistakes happen, but like you said this isn't an every day occurance. I'd have the very strong assumption that the police knew something you didn't...tried to remedy the situation and then some fans didn't like it and the whole thing got heated.

Sometimes the police need to issue instructions to civilians, and when questioned, they don't always have the authority to inform you of why a said instruction has been given.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;Do you have an opinion on this or some kind of comment?

Well, yes I do.

It's a recurrent theme, but in my view still not being addressed by MSM: When we have sporadic loyalist riots and the world's camera crews get invited in, 'everyone'* demands that the bad old days don't return and we have this kind of mania against absolutely anything that can be connected to loyalism - a great deal of that politically motivated. Conversely, we've had regular attempts at the lives of the security forces (and god knows how much 'collateral damage') without the merest hint of a similar outpouring of vitriol. In fact I remember a highly rated comment from a few months ago that 'bet nothing would happen' after the police warned about terrorist activity. The next day a bomb attempt on a policeman's family failed. And still the upvotes came.

Even just last week an Alliance member tweeted about how inconsiderate loyalist &lt;terrorists&gt; were being with their bomb planting, causing traffic disruption for thousands! I'd have thought the attempt to end a few people's lives was more pertinent. But there you have it, the nuanced perspective I have an issue with summed up in 140 characters.

TL;DR I'm pointing out there's a disconnect between mainstream perceptions of actual violence and protest-related mania.

n.
1. Lack of interest or concern, especially regarding matters of general importance or appeal; indifference.
2. Lack of emotion or feeling; impassiveness.

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/apathy

It is termed bystander apathy because in these cases, despite there being a crowd there is apathy towards doing anything to help the victim, for a variety of reasons. The social influence would be that *someone* would intervene or help, yet in these cases no one does. Apathy as in ""Lack of interest or concern, especially regarding matters of general importance or appeal; indifference"" it is a collective expression of all the bystanders, not their own individual feelings.

The average smoker spends £500 - £2000 per year - all proceeds going to criminals at present rather than the tax man.  

Not to mention the costs of policing it now (helicopter fuel is not cheap), court costs , etc.

One other bonus of this is that if would help improve relations for the police - right now thanks to the present law the police are effectively at war with 100 000's of otherwise law abiding people who do no harm to society.

2) Make it mandatory for all tax payer funded organisations to use Linux + open source software - This would save a lot of money long term...

Yes you may need initial costs in retraining (if you replaced Windows for KDE you would need barely any for the main desktop) and re-writing software - but **long term**  you would save.

As well as increased reliability (in our office it is nearly always Windows desktops (we have a 60%/40% Linux/windows split on our office) that actually crash (i.e blue screen)/ become unbootable/ lose data.) you would also havew the bonus of the tax payer improving technology for the whole of mankind - rather than funding Microsoft lawyers to go on a patent troll jolly (which suppresses innovation for all)

At present all taxpayers are **forced** to fund Microsoft when there is no need - the reason we do stems from tactics employed by the company since the 90's when no viable competition existed - they have since done their utmost to ensure fair competition cannot exist since

Here is one example of a city converting to Linux

!0 million euro savings - according to Munich - the only people to dispute these facts are a HP/Microsoft backed study (which even Munich council say is rubbish) - this is a prime example of preventing **fair** competition.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"A similar event happened to me. 

I was waiting for a bus and finally it pulled up. Some white chav cunt was having a right go at the black dude on the back of the bus. He was going fucking mental telling him to step off the bus, punching the window next to him, I think he even punched him a few times in the face. Nigger this, nigger that, etc. 

Anyway, this guy was quite a weedy looking guy but he had such confidence and that's all it really takes to win a fight. 

So, I'm watching this unfold for about a minute and literally no one is saying or doing anything. The bus is full and not one person wanted to get involved. 

So I walk over, step on the bus and say something along the lines of 'Come on mate, calm down. He clearly doesn't want a fight.'

Well, this was clearly not the smartest move as when he turned around I realised he was both drunk and extremely coked up. Coked up enough to not be drunk any more, but still angry. The worst kind of coked up. 

So he squares up to me and asks me 'What I want to do about it' or if 'I want a fight?'.. It's about this moment that I realise that my bravery had just about run out and not a single other person from the bus stop was encouraged by my actions. So I stepped off the bus and socially awkward penguined out of there. The black guy was bigger than me anyway. I'm not sure what I thought I was bringing to the situation. 

Eventually the guy stepped off the bus and motioned to the black dude to come out and fight him. The bus driver quickly closed the door and drove off leaving the chav cunt and me standing at the bus stop. 

Luckily he just walked down the street kicking stuff and seemed to totally have forgotten about me. 

Basically, what I'm saying if fuck getting beaten up or stabbed for someone else. Isn't worth it.

true,whatforums,null,null,"Looks OK to me. On Wonga at the moment, £80 for 10 days is £93.93. Also remember that the 4214% figure for Wonga ONLY relates to their representative example (£207 for 20 days): for less money and less days the representative APR will be higher because the set fees represent a bigger chunk of the money owed.

This is, I believe, how representative APR is calculated:

* £80 borrowed for 10 days, to be repaid as £111.20.

* We can calculate the daily compounded rate of 'interest': 80*x^10 =111.20 =&gt; x^10 =1.39 =&gt; x= 1.03347858... so there is the equivalent of 3.3% interest charged every day.

* If you borrowed at this daily rate for the whole year, you'd owe 80*(1.03347858...)^365.25 = 13387687.49... ie. £13,387,687.49 (over 13 million quid)

* So the annual rate of interest, y, is given by 80*(1+y/100)=13387687.49... which gives y=16734509, ie. 16,734,509%

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;because Downing and Coutinho sometimes cut in means we don't play with wingers?

My reasoning for us not playing with wingers is because neither of these players, or whoever play in the wider parts of the 3, go wide to deliver crosses with great frequency. They barely go wide at all. The width is predominately provided by the fullback overlapping. If you split the pitch's width into 6, 1-6 left to right, wingers would occupy 1,2 and 5,6.. These players are predominantly occupying 2,3 and 4,5, with the full backs in 1 and 6.

It's not that they ""cut in"", it's that they *start and predominately occupy positions* that're infield.

&gt;We weren't playing with only two CMs until Henderson came on? Because the wide and two forwards swap positions and drop back?

We were playing with a DM and a CM/deep lying creative player... notionally. But Gerrard had to keep covering for Allen, so they were basically occupying the same space.

&gt;You're implying that a 4-4-2 means there is a flat midfield/winger line throughout the game, and any variation from that is some other formation.

I didn't imply that, I pretty much stated that a 4-4-4 gives you pretty much 2 configurations of the midfield 4.

Perhaps the difference between us is that I'm attempting to give a more fine grained account through formations than you. A coarse grained approach would consider a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-5-1 the same formation...",0,1363481182,null,0,false,0,c8wzsbg,t3_1aeycc,t1_c8wzsbg,t1_c8wyw3b,null,1431609000,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I can definitely see Luiz, Mata and Oscar being with us for a long time. Personally, as much as it pains me to say this, I don;t think Hazard is the sort of player who will settle down in one club for most of his career so he won't be a long term Chelsea player in my eyes. 

Lukaku will if he gets playing time, which he deserves. I would say he is our best striker right now..and he is on loan haha.

Azpi I reckon will stay long term, and Cahill won't want to leave, but I'm not sure the club will keep him long term but thats just my opinion, I do think he is a good defender and his last-ditch tackles have saved us on a number of occasions but I'm just not sure he has consistently got everything that we need.

I don't think Piazon will stay long term, I hope McEachran stays but I don't think he will stay beyond his contract. De Bruyne and our other loaned players in the foreign leagues, no clue but I don't think so. Our youth policy isn't great simply because no manager wants to take risks with the youngsters because there job is riding on practically every result.

Then;

- Implement progressive taxation. 0.05% per £100 after £10000. Up to a maximum of 70%
- Increase benefits to the unemployed (since they will likely respend it locally)
- Identify benefit schemes less likely to regularly spend and optimise their receipts (i.e. pensioners)
- Move some benefit payments to a voucher system which gives discounts to things such as local spending, healthy food, etc. As opposed to spending with big corporations such as Sky or Eon.
- Remove savings limits on benefits provided they keep the savings with the NS&amp;I and agree to spend anything over £15,000 within 5 years on approved purchases.
- Get rid of ATOS. Trust Doctors.
- More public infrastructure projects. FTTH everywhere. Highspeed rail. Social housing projects.
- Tax fuel more. Remove road tax (tax those that drive more, don't tax those that drive less. Encourages fuel efficiency).
- Link council tax to income rather than flatrate based on house value
- Implement a minimum nationalised car insurance scheme to encourage young drivers and thus social mobility
- Make available easier loans for small businesses. Reduce interest rates based on number of employees
- Give new multi-employee start ups two years without business rates
- Create freetrade zones in deprived areas where business rates are nearly nonexistant for a certain amount of years, and income tax for employees is artificially reduced.
- Abolish minimum wage. Create means tested, area dependant, minimum living-wage benefit (diverts minimum wage costs from companies to government. Disincentivises the type of EU immigration that drives down the job supply. Creates jobs.).
- Incentivise second jobs by making all additional jobs earning less than £5000 a year income tax free
- Rejuvenate town centres by throwing money at councils who encourage independent shops 
- Pass laws to be able to monitor (but not personally identify) debit/credit card spending. In order to provide data on which areas need which kind of development.
- Give preference to British companies when awarding Government contracts
- Reduce IT spending by preferring smaller firms with more to lose. Encourage open standards and open source.
- Assist/pay people who drain the system to emigrate.
- Reduce military spending. Increase cooperation with EU military projects.
- Scrap trident. Replace with French or homegrown system.
- Legalise trivial drug use to save on enforcement. Tax sales highly.

This included many old episodes of Doctor Who, mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. In all, 106 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the program are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, &amp; 5, from which 88 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying 'spare' film copies had been brought to a stop.

&gt;Removing road tax and taxing people on the amount they use the road doesn't seem like the best of ideas. Especially since that may hurt many small businesses.

Why not? It's fairer. Taxation relative to use. Therefore being as affordable as an individual wishes it to be. I don't see how it would effect small businesses unless they're haulage firms.

&gt; Why does /r/unitedkingdom[1] have a fixation on reducing Military spending and scrapping Trident?

Because military spending is a large chunk of our expenditure. It doesn't need to be.

I want to scrap Trident to spend money here or in the EU. I don't wish to scrap our nuclear deterrent. Just to use a system we create and maintain ourselves. More specifically, to keep the spending here rather than in the USA.

&gt; Honestly, reducing Military spending is losing people their jobs and we've already invested so much in the Trident programme scrapping it would be a stupid thing to do.

You can reduce spending without job losses. Although, that is a pretty effective way to do it.

-------------------------

* Relax planning laws, especially in regards to public projects. Diminish NIMBYs right to protest, remove Scottish nuclear veto etc

* Invest in new social housing stock and make it easier for private individuals to build their own homes. (and perhaps try to knock down London so that we can rebuild it). 

* Improve on our transport links, particularly regards to cycling in urban areas (i.e. copy the Netherlands)  

* Invest in long term energy projects. Primarily generation III nuclear, natural gas, wind and biomass (Although biomass produced UK/Europe in suitable areas. Lets not trash Borneo with palm oil plants). Keep the solar power feed-in tarrif subsidies for private homes and businesses. If possible set aside funds so that we can commercialise new technologies as they come onto the market.  

* MDMA and cannabis regulated and legalised. Advertising regulations similar to tobacco. Police force given the power to fast track new substances into a classification Z, which carries similar legal consequence as class C. Classification Z substances await review by David Nutt at the Ministry of Bob Marley.

* Get tough on tax avoidance/evasion. Merkel and the boys will need to be in on the action too. We'll have to do things like force internet gambling companies to pay our local 15% tax rate and not 1% they pay over Gibraltar.

* Bring minimum wage back up to previous rates (inflation adjusted rate). 

* Stop subsidising companies that do well already with 'workfare' schemes. ",0,1363493529,null,0,false,0,c8x33it,t3_1afpfw,t1_c8x33it,t3_1afpfw,null,1431610524,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"I think it's not just ho many things they kill, it's how easy that they're killed and how much damage they are able to cause before dying.

The scariest possible villain, in my opinion, is one that can cause serious damage and not be harmed. Something that can wreak havok and then escape unscathed or at *least* cannot be brought down easily.

In many ways the torture of being captured, dislocated, or converted are much more damaging and thus much scarier than death. The idea of being trapped in uncertainty or losing you humanity or being torn from everything you've ever loved are all terrible pains. Terrible pains that the enemies are able to inflict without suffering themselves at all.

But in Asylum what pains do the Daleks cause? We hear an off-mention of a concentration camp (which the Doctor swears doesn't exist, as Daleks don't take prisoners). We see Darla, whose clearly been deliberately converted, and then we have Harvey and the other members of the Alaska (although it was the impact and the cold that actually killed them, not the Daleks so points off there).

You've got Oswin, but she keeps her free will despite the Dalek conversion (a fought free will, but a present one). And the fact that she apparently doesn't even die(?) makes her fate all the less scary.

So keep in mind how little harm the Daleks are actually causing. Add on a heaping helping of ""incompetent"" on top of that, because incompetence is probably the *least* threatening thing to see in a villain (unable to fire weapons, unable to shoot a point-blank target, crappy plan that allows the Doctor to survive being surrounded by Daleks *multiple times*) and you've got an ineffective foe.

But *then* consider not just how little harm the Daleks cause but how easily they are killed. The Doctor kills over a dozen just at the episode's half mark, and he does so over the course of ten seconds *with a screwdriver*. He just tricks the Dalek into stupidly activating its self-destruct, then pops the thing open and blows up a room of them with ease. 

Point being, you knew that none of the characters were in any real danger. Sure you get the tired ""Amy's about to turn into one of them"" that's lifted *verbatim* from ""Flesh and Stone"", but there's nothing else. You've tacked on the pointless novelty of ""they make you just like them"" to distract the audience from realizing how very *un*scary the Daleks are.

And I'm surprised at your note at ""character interactions"" as being the main selling point of this episode. I mean, there are some good bits to the episode, unfrightening Daleks aside, but character interaction was arguably the *worst* element of the episode.

I mean, you have this cheesy soap-opera divorce thing that gets solved in just twenty minutes with overdramatic face-slapping and ""I can never bare your children!"" decrees of melodrama that feel *horrendously* phoney. Add the garish Mary Sue that is the flirty bisexual supergenius Oswin, whose character development manages to be both one-dimensional *and* inconsistent (she's frightened and confused in the opening and then bossy and confident the next? What?).

true,M_McFly,cnty-uk,London,"As someone who was close to the incident, I feel like I should state what I saw.

Firstly, the tram was absolutely packed. We'd been queueing for a tram for over half an hour and anyone trying to get on on subsequent stations practically had to run into the carriage to make space for themselves. I was located at the other end of the double doors and could hardly turn around, let alone move.

I heard the group, partially because there were only a couple of people (if that) between myself and them and partially because they were fairly loud. Initially it was just relatively standard banter between mates, so I sort of zoned it out. However, I did become aware that after a while they were directing their talking at a passenger who wasn't part of their group, but, being more focussed on how much longer the journey was going to take, I didn't pay much attention to it.

It was only when I heard a commotion that I turned around to see what was going on. My main concern was my sister who was much closer to the incident (she was on the same side of the double doors as the victims). They soon stopped (I could just about make out that someone had stepped in) and I managed to make eye contact with my sister so I could see that she was OK.

The group then got off at the next station and I could see some people checking if the victims were hurt. By the time that we got off, also at Piccadilly, I heard and saw a couple more people confirming that they were witnesses and that they would testify in court.

I do find her comments condemning all 200 of us unjust. Firstly, the commotion was seemingly all over quite quickly, giving little time for an intervention (like I said earlier, however, I wasn't paying attention originally, so it may have been longer than I thought). Secondly, as previously stated, the tram was packed. I doubt more than around 30 people were able to see what happened. While that may be considered more than enough to provide an intervention, most were in my position of not being fully aware or being able to see it all. Thirdly, I didn't recall seeing anyone ""jumping up to get a better view"" (although they could have been behind me). Lastly, several people gave her support after the event. While this can be considered too late, I think she is doing a disservice to the people who attempted to comfort her and her father in the aftermath.

However, I perfectly understand why she said what she said and why she holds those views. If the same thing happened to me, I would undoubtedly feel the same.

CB - Ledley King - really doesn't need to be explained, this dude played at a world class level with no cartilage. Think of what he could've done without those injuries. A true captain.

LB - Assou-Ekotto - Up for debate but there really isn't anyone better.

RM - Lennon - he's had his best season this year and has had some late game heroics in the past, little legend.

CM - Modric - so fluid with the ball, the magician

CM - Davids - crucial to us having some decent seasons while he was here running the midfield

LM - Bale - my favorite player, don't really need to explain this. he is legendary in every way

One's a reflection of a person gone man. You can see the insanity in their eyes, the mad rage on their face, the glint of the wildly swinging blade. There's so much more fear there because the anger, the enemy is so intimidating, so rabid. There's something very scary about seeing something similar to you but utterly detached and deranged.

Meanwhile with the Daleks you don't see the madness. You just see a dust-covered, dented, broken tin can firing lasers at you. Sure, lasers are scary and you're going to be afraid of that, particularly if said tin-can is yelling at you, but it's a different sort of fear, a less gripping or immediate fear.

It's less about rationalizing, in fact it's a great deal about emotion. With that crazy madman you have the chance at disarming or overpowering him whereas you don't really stand a chance with a Dalek. If the crazy gets you with the knife it'll hurt like hell but you may live. If the Dalek gets you with the laser, that's curtains for you. The Dalek is clearly the more rational thing to fear when compared against the two.

But emotionally, looking at it from the perspective of telling a story, one is far less threatening. One is far more terrifying while the other seems dangerous but ultimately ineffective.

true,NorthStarHomerun,tardis,TARDIS,"I definitely liked Martha more than Donna and even Amy and Rory (sorry but they were annoying.) I agree that the series dropped the ball in quite a few places with Martha (and series 3 in general) but overall I liked her because she was more his speed, like when they're talking over what's happening on the moon during Smith and Jones or at the end of Blink. I think some of the things that are pointed out as complaints by the author, like being subservient to the Doctor, were important to her story arc and character development (why would it matter that she walked away if she hadn't been so infatuated by him in the first place? etc.)

IMO, this article would be much better if it was refocused on why Martha is the most underrated companion rather then ""If you didn't like Martha, you're a racist."" Here's why:

&gt;But I think that dismissing Martha due to romantic complications or bad scripts discounts the overall impact of finally having a person of color as a major companion.

I don't think it discounts the overall impact but it certainly undermines it. I'm not obligated to like any character in any series, especially if it's poorly written. 

&gt;The viewers’ reactions against this depiction of reality reveal their own subconscious stereotypes to themselves and to others.

I'm not a psychiatrist but I'm pretty sure the author isn't either. Nothing about what has been pointed out about the 'casual racism' depicted in the show has rubbed me the wrong way.

That's what I thought white flight was. Mainly traditionally working class people depopulating city centres to raise children live in a nicer environment, whose old city centre homes are taken up by other members of the working class and these people are immigrants or children of immigrants. White flight isn't a conscious ""the darkies are coming let's move"", more of a natural process.

Ultimately, hope our team isn't too fatigued. Dempsey is back from injury, which is good but I can see Siggy or Holtby still getting the nod over for this game. Hopefuly, Dembele's head is all right and same for Lennon's hammy. As for striker, I say Ade.

true,Andydav,null,null,"Hi there! I'm from Chester - but unfortunately, i'm not much help in the hotel department as i live so close. I've only ever stayed in one hotel NEAR chester and that's Rowton Hall Hotel and Spa. It's really lovely, and worth the money but like i said, it's not actually in Chester, it's a couple of miles out.

[Here](http://www.laterooms.com/en/k16283350_chester-hotels.aspx) is a list of the hotels in and around Chester, but i'd also suggest some quieter B&amp;Bs.

Some of the things to do in Chester:

- Go and have a drink at [Telfords Warehouse](http://www.chester360.co.uk/restaurants/images/telfords-warehouse.jpg). It's great and it's right next to a subsidiary of the River Dee, so it's on the water

- Make sure you go and grab your lunch from [The York Roast Co](http://www.robot-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_5110-600x400.jpg). on Bridge street. You wont regret it (Get the Garlic &amp; Rosemary Lamb!)

- Make sure you AVOID town on Horse Race days. It's too busy and in the evening it's filled with drunk yobs in suits.

- Rent a peddle-boat on the River Dee! It's great fun!

- As far as eating out in the evening is concerned, my recommendations are Carluccio's on Bridge St, The Blackhouse Grill at the end of Newgate St and Piccolino, which is just along from The Blackhouse Grill.

- If you can get out of Chester, go to Delamere Forest. There is a direct train line and it's quintessentially Cheshire in character. It's only about £5/6 for a return. It's also where i'm from, so i'm biased.

2. Scientists make policy, politicians implement it.
3. Loophole closing
4. If the effective tax rate still isn't near the number then rise the number and the effective tax rate will rise, especially with corporations.

I could go on but it doesn't sound too different to the ideals of the government, just that they suck (sometimes by choice) at implementation. An outright tax like in France would be a bit circlejerky, closing loopholes is better. Legalisation/decriminalisation is something I don't know much about. I'd rather there be limits on what each seller can have in stock, frequent checks and so on. I'm not sure on cannabis, I don't think of it in the same (low abuse, low addictive possibilities) as pot.

Read [this](http://www.eplindex.com/23894/liverpools-positional-system-explained-tactical-analysis.html) EPL article on how we change our systems, and in particular the point that we use *formation changes*, rather than *changes of players* to affect change in the game.

The Death Penalty has been shown to be more costly than life imprisonment. If you want to really punish murderers in a way that will eventually lead to their deaths, just have special prisons where prisoners are locked in a big room with no food or water and left to starve/die of thirst. The prisoners will kill each other and practice cannibalism. All we'd need to do is made sure nobody escapes.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"Not sure what your point is on being judged but the gist is I'd like to see a lot more public anger being directed towards those attempting to carrying out murder on what is practically a weekly basis now. Those 'peace' protesters have been nowhere to be seen since the disruption to their daily commute stopped while the level of terrorist activity has increased markedly. Thus it's difficult to see such personalities as anything other than anti-protester protesters. 

Those z-list local media names who came out to support it - Barra Best, etc. Where's their equally strong stance on the rising level of terrorist activity? As a personality in the public domain, once you are seen to 'take a stand', the onus is on you to deliver a consistent message in that regard. I'm not saying they support violence, but they aren't exactly coming down on it like a ton of bricks either, which given their stance on the flag thing is disappointing.

Let's face facts, a large number of role models in the nationalist community got to where they did by carrying out the same things this current mob of terrorists are doing. Their words are going to fall on deaf ears as a result. In the absence of strong non-woolly faced role models and a dearth of public criticism in complete contrast to the failings of so-called 'loyalist' gangsters - what's to stop this current terrorist threat from establishing itself? 

The current tactic appears to be turn a blind eye while 'pro-agreement' terrorists fight a turf war against 'dissidents' in nationalist areas e.g. the Sean Kelly farce. That kind of attitude embeds the rule of the gun in communities and will not end well.

It's actually been suggested on here (I know) that as &lt;insert version of the IRA&gt; are a terrorist organisation you just expect them to do what they do. Like you can't protest against criminals for committing crimes because that's their job. Words fail me.

I know it's not some kind of low orbit ion cannon you can just flick a switch on, but if the public level of intolerance towards flag protesters and associated rioting was aimed towards those who have been trying to/actually killing for the past few months/years then perhaps they'd feel a bit less sure of themselves in their communities and the rate of attacks would be decreasing rather than increasing.",1,1363521406,null,0,false,0,c8x79mh,t3_1aesbg,t1_c8x79mh,t1_c8x0ndf,null,1431612584,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

true,whistleflute,null,null,"A lot of these are good, and reflect people's individual history with spurs, but few of them could be called a good team. We've always had great attacking midfields throughout the years and I think any greatest XI would have to revolve around getting the best out of them. The dirge of world class left-back means you'd play Bale there (he can still be deadly on the overlap), I think it'd have to be a 4-2-3-1 as we've never had that many world class strikers in the last 25 years. Two defensive midfielders would give free reign for a midfield three of Hoddle-Gazza-Ginola to cause havoc. God, just the thought of it makes me salivate. Davids would be one, and then it's a tough call between Carrick or Parker (Sandro is too new, Zokora not good enough). Parker is more industrious, but alongside Davids I'd favour Carrick's passing ability and vision. The rest of the back-line is fairly easy: Carr-King-Campbell-Bale. There's a reason we hate Campbell so much: he was a colossus, and the sight of him playing with Ledley would be a joy to watch. Post Jennings all our keepers are flappers, so I'd break my own rules and put in Lloris for now. Finally up front would be another hard call: do you want a natural finisher to mop-up the inevitable plethora of chances created, or do you want a target man to hold-up and link-up play? Berbatov would be the latter, and I confess: his laid-back, all-natural skill would fit in well with the rest of my team's mercurial genius. But someone like a Keane just doing the easy work of putting the ball in the back of the next and getting in the right positions in the box might just edge it. Maybe play Berbatov away from home. 

Subs would take too long to sort, but safe to say Modric would be champing at the bit to start in that attacking midfield trio. Mabbutt would be the calming, experienced leader in the dressing room.

This is all 1998-2004/5. Well before the more famous financial crisis. 

Argentina was dependant on loans from the IMF to support the entire functionality of its government. 

Being dependant on the IMF is kind of like borrowing money from the shark who lives on your estate. 

The IMF will force you to restructure your economy and your government, and operates on exceptionally conservative economic theory. This in turn essentially forces the institution of conservative political ideology on the population. 

Welfare payment and civil service wages were slashed (13% in just one of seven reductions) *before* Argentina defaulted, which is arguably the source of the large percentage sliding from ""supported"" to ""below the poverty line"". 

These cuts were still not sufficient for the IMF, who then withheld the next tranche of lending, despitr Argentina attempts to meet their requirements. This wasn't Greece in 2008-11, Argentina had a handle on public spending but the social results were devastating. 

Facing huge political pressure from the electorate, and with the IMF withholding funds anyway, they defaulted on their debt. 

They managed it ok, but not very well. Their currency was massively devalued, they couldn't get loans and had to make cutbacks essentially as severe as what the IMF would have ultimately demanded anyway. 

Then they recovered. 

The low peso meant that their exports shot through the roof. They refocused their economy on agricultural exports (soy in particular, which luckily was experiencing a surge in demand) and started experiencing growth of 8% year on year. Wages shot up, from 11-25% (average 17%!) annually, and although inflation was high, this was typically 4-5% below wage increases which translates as a real terms pay rise for the average Argentinian. The high inflation figures were possible even fabricated to sustain the pesos low exchange rate. 

Don't just look at the immediate aftermath, look at the longer term. 

Defaulting freed the Argentinian government to pursue economic policies that actually worked (austerity anyone?) and provided a period of high growth and restructuring, a great way to get people who've been out of work back in to it in new fields (ha) and establish new areas of economic strength. Argentina was broken long before they defaulted, and it's wrong to act as if their choice to default caused all the problems. In fact, the extensive lending had mostly just staved off the real issues artificially.

I agree, it's less about ""saving money"" or ""detering crime"" and more about seeing someone you hate screaming out to Jesus in the same way we used to burn witches.

However I am not really swayed by the deterrent argument as the majority of Murders are unplanned. The Psychopath killer who kills because s/he can or the ""lets kill this person for his or her life insurance"" is actually quite rare and it's rarity usually leads it to be reported on the news making it seem more common than it really is. the majority of killings are done to force someone to do something, like robberies.

In that sense, I do have concern that they have become a workaround for police not having guns, given the expansion of tasers, it's not unreasonable to think that all police could be equipped with them in the relatively near future.

The best savings rates on cash ISAs tend to have fixed interest rates, so say you got 4% fixed for 5 years, if the BoE puts their rates up in 2 years then your ISA would be locked in to a low rate and if you have a tracker mortgage, your payments would also go up.

The fuck? Are you for real? Iceland 'isn't having any problems financially' because it isolated its self from the rest of the financial world. They have a  worthless currency which makes imports very expensive. 

Their currency literally lost half its value after the crash and it's not recovered at all. 

Imagine if the GBP lost half its value and went from equaling 1.15 euros to 0.575 euros. Everything we imported from Europe would cost us double what it used to. 

We have a trade deficit. If we were to do the same it would absolutely kill us. It would ground our economy to a halt and then some. 

Next time you go shopping, have a look where your food is coming from. After you get to the till, when they checkout attendant reads you the price double it in your head. That's the kind of clusterfuck we'd be experiencing if we tried anything similar to what Iceland did, except it would be worse because we would also have lots of people made unemployed after our finance industry became worthless. 500K+ easily. 

Oh, and we also have a lot more of other peoples money than Iceland did so our global punishment would be much much worse. We'd frankly be lucky if we got off with a devaluation of just 50% to our currency.

true,woadgrrl,scottish,Western Isles,"Number 4 is the obvious answer, especially in terms of how it's become a hugely-marketed event.  

But number 2 is actually important.  Whatever the arguments about people co-opting one heritage or another, the fact remains that many of the Irish immigrants to the U.S. settled together, either in urban ghettos, or in frontier towns with high Irish populations.  This was due largely to persecution they faced.  So, even in the days before green lager and flashing novelty shamrock bow-ties, St. Patrick's day was celebrated by these communities, Irish-American social clubs, etc., as a way to remember, express and celebrate their heritage.

Meanwhile, English, Welsh and Scottish immigrants didn't face the same kinds of persecution, didn't turn up all at once in the same way, and so became much more a part of the background of U.S. culture, rather that forming little islands within it.  

These days, it wouldn't be surprising if any of them did start to be celebrated, simply as another way to sell a lot of booze.  But there are practical considerations as well.  St. David's Day wouldn't gain much traction, because it's too close to St. Patrick's Day.  St. George's day is too close to Cinco de Mayo (even if anyone had ever heard of it), and St. Andrew's Day is just after Thanksgiving, and so would be lost in the midst of all the existing Black Friday/Football season/Hunting season promotions.

Or even how looking for work works.

Listen up, rabbit, because I've typed this out a dozen times and I'm buggered if I'm talking to the wall.

Applying for positions that are already open and signing up to job sites (which is basically the same thing) **does not work**.

If it did, it would have worked for you by now.

Why not? Well, there's a whole host of reasons but the biggest reason is a simple numbers game. A prospective employer in your area only has to stick an ad in the paper and s/he will have a couple of hundred CVs to go through within 24-48 hours. They're only going to want to interview 5-10 people, which means they'll be looking to eliminate applications from the pile and will do so ruthlessly. The tiniest excuse will be enough - whether it's an obvious cockup you can help like writing ""Dear Sir"" when you were instructed to write to Mrs. Jones - or something you can't help like having a name that the prospective employer can't pronounce.

What nobody tells you is:

 - Hiring staff is incredibly expensive. A single newspaper ad can cost £500, a recruitment firm will charge 1-3 months' salary. That's before you deal with eliminating CVs and conducting interviews, which writes off at least one person for a whole day.
 - Hiring staff is also incredibly risky. Anyone who's ever had to hire more than a few people will admit, given sufficient beer, that they've made more than one hiring mistake. Every one of those hiring mistakes meant the newspaper ad or recruiter's fee was wasted, along with all the interview and induction time (because even unskilled staff aren't going to be terribly productive on their first few days).
 - Because of this risk and expense, many companies will do everything in their power to avoid it. At a very basic level, this will involve asking existing staff if they know anyone who's looking for work. Larger organisations may even operate a formal scheme - something along the lines of ""recommend a potential employee; if we hire them and they stay on for more than six months we'll give you £500"".
 - As a result, most companies put off advertising for staff until they really can't avoid it. There's an enormous number of jobs that simply don't get advertised because someone was in the right place at the right time; I haven't had a job that was advertised in the paper or through a recruitment firm since.... oooh, something like 2001. But I have changed jobs in that time.
 - Most of us at your age have only ever really seen retail businesses on the high street; it's natural to assume they're a large percentage of employers. Rubbish. For every shop on the high street, there's a whole army of suppliers and contractors they use, all of which are businesses in their own right.

You're far better off looking for firms that are likely to require you and contacting them direct.

If you need to prove you've applied for advertised jobs to keep your benefits - obviously do that. But don't make it your only - or even your main - method of jobhunting. It'll drive you nuts and it won't achieve anything at all.",0,1363531874,null,0,false,0,c8x8vfl,t3_1afrdv,t1_c8x8vfl,t3_1afrdv,null,1431613382,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I hope the average Catholic will have the good sense to look to international law and basic principles of justice and to the spirit of the gospels before they pay heed to any clergy man of whatever rank, speaking from purely secular motives.

* Vert feeling his hamstring is like noticing a cancerous mole on Papa Smurf's skin. We'd be fucked without Jan.

* Gotta love Senderos for the look of staggering confusion on his face. [Give this vid a watch later](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYTcf55B-oY). I cried laughing.

* We are starting to make some impact on corner kicks! Gareth... the fact that even his heading-game is improving is incredible.

* **Dejagah** sounds like a fucking solar system in the Star Wars universe. Example. Han: *Sure, Chewie, but keep in mind that shitstorm we found ourselves in back in Dejagah.*

* Good ol' Dimitar Berbinho's bound to be sporting a tshirt with a message on it. Let's hope we don't get to read it.

* Bale may not be aware that a goalkeeper is allowed to catch a ball that's been headed to him from a teammate. Interesting.

* Parker with a long shot. Good on him, he's usually more charitable than Mother Teresa on ecstasy.

* Bale hair appear a bit grayish. Thousands of Yiddo vaginas are getting more moist than the tall grass characteristic for planets from the Dejagah solar system.

* Moussa rescuing that ball in his best b-boy stance. Oh god.

* This Fulham kit is beautiful! [Our third one](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/29/article-0-14BBE561000005DC-359_634x714.jpg) looks like a pyjama designed for fitness freaks.

For those who don't know, she was a Companion for The Fourth Doctor. At first, she had to make sure that he got The Key to Time. Once that was taken care of, she kinda became a renegade like The Doctor since, well, she hung out with him for so long. She has the most badass reason for leaving The Doctor: she wanted to protect a universe.

Here's where it gets a little tricky. Our universe has an antimatter universe (not the alternate one that Rose is in). There are articles that can explain antimatter far better than I can, so I won't go into that. There's a universe between our universe and the antimatter universe called ""E-Space"" (not the alternate one that Rose is in). The Doctor and Romana went there twice. One time involved them fighting the last vampires, which was awesome. Millennia ago, there was a long-fought war between Time Lords and vampires that was so bloody and terrible, Gallifrey swore off violence (until the Time War). The last vampires managed to slip into E-Space. Anywho, the second time The Doctor and Romana went to E-Space, she decided to stay behind and protect the few inhabitants of it.

Depending on who you ask, Romana is either still in E-Space or some other thing after the Time War. The audio dramas say that she's president, but Rassilon was president in ""The End of Time"", and that took place at the end of the Time War (sorta).

I don't want tasers to be the go-to method of policing in the UK and it's irrefutable that giving them more will only make it worse.

Politicians are not capable of evaluating the right or wrong thing to do. They hail from a privileged class of professionals who's minds are bamboozled by formal education. They are typically the types of people who will say anything to be likes and do their homework when mummy tells them to. They are the types of people who will scheme and plot to get what they want. 

Maybe you could name a politician to whom this description doesn't apply. Maybe two? 

&gt;The problem isn't the politicians, its the public who refuse to support tough decisions unless they affect other people.

The public haven't got a clue what's going on. Try to talk about the reality about how the economy, the political system, the labour market operate and most people will freak out. How would you expect the public to evaluate anything and decide which self-serving bureaucrat might possibly be capable of making a decision? 

&gt;Its the people that's the problem, not the politicians.

I wouldn't go as far as making it a dichotomy. 

&gt;That in turn is the problem with democracy - it puts the power to elect a government in the hands of people

It doesn't really. People have the power to choose between two sides of the same coin. There is never the option of actually electing someone with a view that doesn't chime with the dominant paradigm. 

&gt;who dont understand, and dont want to understand the issues. 

People don't understand stuff because they are never taught in such a way as to cultivate intelligence, enquiry and an open mind. They don't want to understand the issues because they have been conditioned to care for little else except material accumulation. People are largely the product of their culture and culture is presently manipulated to serve the powerful, albeit in a haphazard fashion. 

&gt;We outsource the decision making process, but then complain when decisions are taken that we dont like.

Who are ""we""? 

I don't remember anyone being consulted about the decision making process.

You can see why people are all too happy to go on benefits. You've seen it, I've seen it too.

I've worked since I left school, and I've got an education without going through the college/university system, my girlfriend is out of work but we don't get benefits, we're living off of my wage alone and we're not going to ask for benefits. The country doesn't need more straws on it's back.

Unfortunately, though I know we deserve it and won't take it, there are people that believe they *do* deserve it and do take it.

Why do they deserve it? Because we're a free and able country where no-one should starve to death? People don't starve to death. When people get hungry I'll tell you now, they *will* find food. There are soup kitchens everywhere.

I tell you what happens when people get hungry, and they aren't given money to buy food. They find money, and they buy food. They find money by thinking ""if I *don't* make money, I *will* starve.""

This is an old thread. I think it was about disability. So my response may be a little bit off canter, for which I apologise.

I believe there are multiple groups that should be supported, these are people who cannot actually work, either through mental or physical impairment.

People who can't work because they don't have skills, can still do some stuff. They can carry stuff, they can answer phones, they can stack shelves.

People who can't work because they're ill or disabled *cannot* work. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out.

Unfortunately, the country cannot support all of the unemployed people. There aren't enough jobs for them even if they wanted to work. This is partly because we import, rather than produce. But even if there were more jobs, I doubt a lot of people would *want* to work, because they don't *have* to work.

That's the sad part really. They're happy to never advance in life. To never put back into the community.

I don't know, maybe you've not experienced what I have, or maybe you're one of the people who I'm discussing and have different views.

I come from a family where i am the only City fan in a house full of United fans which made match days interesting. Ive supported City for 32 years through some good and bad times and my support has never wavered.
Growing up in the shadow of Old Trafford also means that i have a good mix of friends who support both.

First, my take on City fans and i will be as unbiased as possible.
City fans tend to be quite humble in victory and dignified in defeat. If we win, we don't start spamming United forums spouting hate and gloating. This tends to promote quite a good friendly relationship with other clubs which is evident with constructive banter on sites such as vital football.
We have experienced our hard times and appreciate what highs and lows football can bring.
Now onto United fans. Whenever United win, regardless of who they play, they go straight into gloat mode like its their god given right to win. The same goes for when City lose. Forum posts on many sites that don't even involve United get hit with some terribly immature comments always aimed at City.

United have never seen City as a threat until the past couple of seasons and i think panic is starting to set in that they cant always have it their way. When they win a match, observe some of the more popular football sites and you will witness an arrogance that is the ugly side of football.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"""The alternative is de-escalation, something which has been used for many years with great success."" In my experience, we actually can calm down the vast majority of people. Some people however are going to to fight and there is nothing you can do about that. They have too much motivation to not. The only item of equipment with respect to use of force that I use routinely is handcuffs. There have been very few occasions where I have had to use anything other than open hand techniques. There are officers who have used things like batons and CS spray more than I have. That partly is down to circumstance and partly down to things like physical stature. An average height/build female PC is more likely to need to than a 6'4"" lump like me if someone is going to physically fight. Bare in mind some open hand techniques can actually constitute more force and leave longer lasting damage than a TASER. 

""I'd rather take a baton to non lethal areas (as per training) than a very high voltage stun."" 

Voltage isn't in itself harmful. The amperage is, and that current is so low its very, very unlikely to prove at all harmful. I'd also suggest that you do not understand what damage a baton can actually do. A high level strike (which is a lower use of force with a baton and is directed to a green zone) is certain to induce bruising, motor-nerve damage and is likely to cause a fracture to the humerus, if you bring your forearm up when the baton is swung expect damage to the radius and ulna and forearm bruising too.  The training when it comes to batons is to try and go for areas which will sustain the least damage however broken bones are not unlikely despite this. Swinging a metal stick round has never been an entirely safe thing. Oh and if the situation calls for it and yes those situations are extreme, batons have been used to target the head. CS spray is a much better comparison to TASER. I can honestly say after having been assaulted many times over the years I can honestly say I'd rather take a TASER than catch a good punch to the head. 

""If we are to believe the crime statistics that crime is falling, why the need to suddenly arm normal officers with these kind of weapons? ""

Overall crime is allegedly falling, however violent crime is on the up. We get a lot of violence and aggression directed our way. My personal thinking is this. I'd rather be able to go out on shift, carry nothing other than a uniform, radio and paperwork. I'd love to work in a world where that could be a reality. The truth is, we face people with weapons, who are very aggressive, who have mental health issues, who are dangerous to the public, dangerous to police officers etc, I'd rather have it and not need it.

true,Raffles_Dad,null,null,"I don’t think it is a question of don’t care I think it is a problem of belief. I’ve had to spend a lot of time with politicians and with some it is the same as talking to an extremely religious person. Every fact and observation you make gets translated by their belief system to be twisted to prove their point of view. A religious example would be the fact that some christians considered AIDS god’s curse on homosexuals and yet gave thanks to god for the cure, the dichotomy of these two states of being is just lost on them. With some politicians it is just the same they can only view the world through a highly selective view point and thus they consider things have to work (or can only work) a certain way.

Now when dealing with any zealot you must recognise them for what they are and consider that an intractable position despite overwhelming evidence is in fact a delusion and must surely be considered a mental illness.   

So it is not a lack of compassion towards others it is an overwhelming belief that their way is the only way, perhaps we should consider that religion and politics are on a continuum. But within the UK they do have a problem, every four years they have to be re-elected.  So they must win a popularity contest, this is where writing to your MP come in handy. 

My world view puts me to the left on most issues within the UK (but when faced with overwhelming evidence that I am wrong I concede I am wrong) and I live in a conservative stronghold (only one labour MP in the last 60 years) but my MPs have to reply to my letters and give up their time to deal with me. As I’m reasonably smart and can form a good argument I do get my point across but it does amaze me that the mental gymnastics that my MP goes through translating things into a conservative concept. 

I’m sure my MP would rather not deal with me but he has no choice, it is his job and a letter from an MP gets results. Any MP that failed to represent any of the people he is elected to represent will have a hard time being re-elected. A local paper that ran a story of how an MP failed to represent the people in that area would have the effect of losing that MP votes.  Not a lot of votes are needed to swing an election, as I have said I live in a very conservative area but if my MP ignored us then it would only take one person in five to change their minds and he will lose his seat. 

I recently found out just how close we came to a revolution in the 19th century, I consider that we would have a better society now if that had of happened. But social media and modern technology have demonstrated that it is possible to create social change in a more peaceful way. I consider that societies that are bourn from violence will always be somewhat violent. 

I’d rather see what could be achieved by a peaceful movement, so writing to your MP will have an effect on ATOS if the DWP suddenly gets letters from MPs asking about the accuracy of the assessments and the amount of appeals things will start to change. I know that the DWP and ATOS have misled people, I have won appeal after appeal and helped people get the support they need but a politician is the one with the power to stop this cruel farce, facts will not work as many are zealots but the threat of not getting re- elected will change things.   

I do support eating the rich but consider that the use of the ballot box the best way to do it, and that will really scare them.

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"""The only thing that really scares me about tasers is how they've become a method of first resort for a lot of coppers.""

Care to back that up? They have a very clear place on the use of force continuum. It comes long after tactical communication and most open hand techniques and then depending on the situation it may be preferred to CS or CS may be preferred. In terms of force its considered to sit roughly level with incapacitation sprays.  

""Bfore tasers you wouldn't see every policeman/woman immediately reach for their baton and start whacking the offender about the head, yet quite often I see (admittedly in videos) taser-equipped police step back and shoot at the first hint of any physical confrontation, need for restraint or most importantly the tried and tested method of de-escalation.""

So you're basing this on videos? So you don't have the knowledge that the officer has? You don't know if for example this person is known for being violent against police, carrying weapons, having mental health issues or any other mirriad of factors that the officer may be considering? In the UK in the vast majority of instances where TASER is used, it is in fact not fired, its presence being enough to resolve the situation. 

""In that sense, I do have concern that they have become a workaround for police not having guns, given the expansion of tasers, it's not unreasonable to think that all police could be equipped with them in the relatively near future""

They are not and never can be a replacement for a firearm. They may look a bit like one if you squint but that's about where the similarities end. I would not go into a situation where I could avoid it with a TASER to face a deadly threat. It is used as a less lethal alternative to a firearm where viable however in those sorts of situations you still need a firearm in case the TASER doesn't work. I think police officers are accutely aware that it is not a cure all.

 "" In addition, I see people complain about batons a lot, but you're not going to kill someone by hitting them in none-lethal areas as per their training. A taser is none-discriminate it does maximum damage immediately regardless of the situation, they're also a lot more lethal than people realise, I think there's a problem with everyone thinking they're completely safe."" 

I don't think you understand what damage a baton is actually capable of. In some situations an officer can justify striking a suspect around the head, something which can be easily fatal (obviously). If a suspect has a knife and runs at you, you have no obligation to try and disarm them. If you have to stop them then you can justify using lethal force, the law is quite clear on that. A TASER would be a good option to try and stop that situation before it escalates into an issue. If I suspect someone has a knife, the TASER is a fantastic way to prevent them using it before they can even get it out of their pocket. At the same time if they do what they're told then there is no need for it to be fired. So again it isn't all or nothing. Simly drawing it and red dotting a suspect can often have the desired effect.

It's not personally enough to turn me away from it, but then again, it's really dependent on your attitude and appetite for risk.

All returns are paid without any tax - even basic rate - deducted, so you should declare your gains to the Inland Revenue. At the end of the tax year we'll make an annual income statement available to you to download from your account showing the total gross interest you've received over the previous 12 months, less any bad debt and fees. For more information on how to declare your Zopa earnings please see here.

&gt;Please also note that HMRC don't currently permit lenders to offset any bad debt losses against their interest gains. We don't consider this to be fair and are lobbying the Government and Treasury for Zopa lenders to be treated in the same way as commercial lenders.
Please note: Zopa does not provide advice on tax.

It wasn't consuming anything and it wasn't getting bigger, most of the other cracks were like that. Really the only crack we saw that did that was the huge one in Flesh and Stone.

You have to understand it wasn't the cracks that were destroying the universe, it was the TARDIS exploding. The cracks were an after-effect, but because the TARDIS explosion took place all throughout time and space, some of the cracks appeared before the explosion actually happened.

Think of it like this, a grenade explodes in a room and shrapnel goes flying everywhere. Somehow, that shrapnel travels through time as well as space. You come into the room a month before the grenade explodes and there's a bit of shrapnel in the walls. As the weeks go on more and more shrapnel starts appearing, but you don't get a huge hole from the explosion in the middle of the room until the grenade actually detonates. That's exactly how the cracks are, the grenade is the TARDIS, the shrapnel is the cracks, and the room is the universe. Just like shrapnel, some cracks are bigger, some are smaller. Some lead to other places in time, others lead to nothing. There's no real order to it, it's just shrapnel flying off in a random direction.

Furthermore you don't really know people like Craig went on to live a happy lives with the crack, it might have absorbed him too after the Doctor left. The universe was rebooted at the end of season five, the cracks no longer existed and everything that was sucked up was put back in place, so there's really no way of knowing what did and did not end up being consumed by the crack.

-(Based on a quick-read novel): The Doctor, Amy and Rory neutralised the Angel by making it make a duplicate of itself through its reflection on a mirror. After a brief panic of more Angels appearing, the mirror was smashed, leaving the two Angels in quantum lock.

-(Based on The Brilliant Book of Doctor Who 2011): During the Egyptian era, a Weeping Angel was found at the entrance to a village.

And finally the last point is just silly - Doctor Who was always intended to be a kids' show, and lots of kids still watch it, so I don't think they'd show the Doctor touching herself. What's more, to suggest that that would be such an integral part of having a female Doctor that having a female Doctor would be an impossibility without showing her touching herself is a notion I actually find quite insulting as it sexualizes the Doctor/women without placing any importance on the new personality, worldview, etc. Yes, suddenly discovering that you're a woman would be strange, but that's a silly excuse for clinging to the tradition of a male doctor. Even if we had a female Doctor and she turned out to be just an awful character, it's not like she would have to stay that way forever.

What a fucking joke we are. How can a team that aims for Champions League qualification have two strikers who are barely good enough for the ChampionSHIP. The squad is good on many positions, but you can't rely on your defenders and midfielders to score all the goals.

Our strikers don't seem to be able to score goals anyway you put it, and the fucker AVB is in constant denial and insists on playing our two worst players together for 30 minutes, after seeing how the fuck they have faired over the season.

AVB, you were supposed to be a somewhat decent tactician, but the things you do in a match, I can see 3 year olds do better.

I'm fully behind the club, but this team is nowhere near Champions League standard. NO WHERE!

With Lennon injured, we have absolutely no width. We were dumb enough to send out Townsend on loan, at a time where we have so fucking many games, that he'd be sure to play almost as much as he does at QPR.

But his decisions over the last couple of games have left me fuming, and how he reacts to it in the next few games will define our season and possibly his Tottenham career. 

I'm beginning to doubt us being able to qualify for the CHL. We knew we had a tough programme, we knew the team really had to turn up in the easier games, and now with two losses in a row. Whilest Arsenal won yesterday and Chelsea are leading against WHU, I can easily see them picking up much better form than us over the rest of the season. 

I really hope that won't happen, and I'll try to stay positive. I guess the one thing I can take away from this game was, that Adebayor seemed really fired up. He didn't play well, but he worked hard. I like seeing that and if he keeps it up, I'm hopeful he will be able to pick up form very soon.

Looking at Europa League  though, it definitely takes a backseat now. Hopefully we can rest a few players against Basel and pick up a few points in the League. We can do this, we just need to get our priorities right. To end up outside of the Top 4 now would be an absolute disgrace, worse than what happened last year. All teams competing with us will drop points, that's a certainty, we just need to focus completely on the League.

It's a hard fucking pill to swallow, the last 3 matches have been shockingly abject compared to the Spurs team I know we can be, but I have faith in this manager and this team. This break could definitely help us if they all come back hungry. Lennon, Walker, a rested defence and a fully fit Bale. Not many teams can beat us when we're at our best.

Don't listen to the WUMs from other teams, there's a reason we were third for so long, we deserve to be there, let's just hope the team pull together for the last few matches.

3.) Carroll had more touches than Dempsey and Defoe COMBINED. Dempsey was coming off of an injury, but he played 45 minutes. Defoe is just useless. 

4.) Parker is wasteful. I don't want him in the team. 

5.) Ade is the best striker we have. Deal with it.

true,HezzyUK,eng-lancashire,Preston,"I think you've seen a lot of videos of American cops doing this, the training the UK cops receive is vastly different and TASERs are quite high up on the officer response chain. The amount of paperwork generated from a TASER discharge serves as a deterrent from flippant use as well as being a vital part of accountability. Also the vast majority of TASER deployments in the UK have just been ""red-dotting"" the person in question, they are rarely actually fired.

There are a few mnemonics that the UK police use such as PLAN and JAPAN;

* Proportionate
* Legal
* Accountable
* Necessary

and

* Justifiable
* Authorised
* Proportionate
* Accountable
* Necessary

Any force that the police use needs to be reasonable as laid out in Section 117 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 as well as Section 3(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. If it isn't reasonable, it is unlawful and will most likely lead to a custodial sentence.

You also have to remember that TASER can immediately disable the person with minimum harm to the person, the public and the officer. It can't really be compared to the use of a baton because that causes bruising, fractures, broken bones, etc. I know for sure that I would much prefer to use a TASER to subdue somebody stronger than me rather than grapple with them, spray them or hit them with a baton.

He wins the ball and on the whole his ball retention is decent, people seem to forget past games when he's been the only creative force we had in patches.

Adebayour doesn't offer a lot but he offers more than Defoe, he's our best bet. Lennon being out is a massive blow, I'm not sure what is wrong with him but he is sorely missed and people don't realise how important he is until he's gone. 

On the bright side, Carroll looks like a fantastic sub for Dembele, and I think he should get some more game time against Basel, Caulker looked fairly solid apart from a few lapses in concentration. With Townsend playing well at QPR, those are some fucking good options come next year. 

We need to knuckle down this week and do some heavy rotating to keep different people fresh for each game, more so than we have before. I predict a win against Swansea and Everton (possibly Chelsea too); keep the faith.

Bale/Dempsey

Both Bale and Dempsey would be free to alternate between the wing and the hole. 

Dempsey was at his best cutting in from the wing at Fulham and is comparable to Defoe at pure poaching.

Bale I dont need to explain on the wing, and in the center, we push our best player at goal.

What do you think HMS Ocean does? - Deliver daffodils and poems around the globe? Don't get me wrong, carriers are great to have when you need to do some humaitarian disaster relief/evacuation type stuff... but they are tools of forceful military power projection not friendship ambassadors.

What confuses me about your argument, is I can see there being a genuine discussion about whether 65,000 tonne super carriers really are the way forward. But the alternative is not HMS Ocean... it's HMS Invincible, a light 'through-deck' carrier. The logic is these are cheaper to build but provide similar utility. HMS Ocean is not a carrier, is not intended to be a carrier and despite external appearences, does not perform the role of a carrier.

Comparing HMS Ocean to the new carries is a bit like saying a ford fiesta can do anything a 9 ton truck can do... but it isn't about capability - it's about capacity. I think the RN realised as far back as 1982 that they had made a mistake building light carriers - and when the shit hits the fan and you actually need a carrier, you almost invariably need one with significant capacity - both in terms of the size of the air wing and the ships ability to keep them in the air (i.e. daily sorties). This is the direction our navy has chosen, it is also the direction the US have chosen with their new Gerald R Ford class carriers - which can support about 110 sorties per day (compared to the QEClass's 90 sorties per day).

true,Memoriae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"The only thing really is that you need to remember it's not instant access by any stretch of the imagination. Your addition to that person's loan is effectively bonded until their loan is paid off (You can apply for a rapid return, but they're not guaranteed, and there's a fee as well.) which is between 1 and 5 years, although you can decide to not provide funds for certain groups and timescales.

Other than that, having to sort out paying tax yourself, instead of having it done automatically. Apparently there's a few people who have been stung by HMRC for forgetting to declare the interest from Zopa, as they think it's money-trading (It's actually classed as an investment vehicle linked to a cash market, so you still have to pay tax on your interest).

And obviously that it's a very volatile market. If your lending offer is too high or too low, then your money might sit there for a while, waiting to be allocated. You only earn interest on the money if it's lent out, so while the lending offer is valid, there's a lot of management that you need to do with rates.


//e There's also a lot of balancing that you need to consider as well. How much attitude to risk you have will probably reflect in the amount you lend to each applicant. £10 is the default, but you can increase it to whatever you want to, at the increased risk of possibly getting a lower return, or that borrower defaulting.  
Then you've got the issue of supply and demand. Looking at the Zopa graphs, there's about 4 times as much supply for some of the groups than there is demand (A* Long is currently at £1,6m demanded, and £6,4m supplied)

There's also a huge amount of market data as well. Just the last update was 26k loans, and the most recent figures for bad debt show 0.12% of all loans are arreared or defaulted, with only 0.04% actual defaults (as of 18/2/13)

Really, think about how many changes our club has undergone in the lead-up to this season. Think about how most of them have been taken for granted and long forgotten because we've exceeded our expectations. 

Obviously the rhetoric is that we want to be ambitious and move forward so it's good to expect a top 4 finish, but I suspect it's not essential for Levy right now. We're laying foundations for something more long-term and hopefully AVB will be given plenty of time and even more support.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"&gt;Unless he scores, Defoe contributes nothing to the game.

I respectfully disagree. He actually detracts from games he doesn't score in. He does this by wasting chances to pass to players in better positions, dawdling on the ball looking for space and getting tackled by anyone and everyone, and blasting the ball into opposing defenders.

Defoe is still as good as he always was to be fair. It's just the team has developed and moved on. Our style and attacking setup no longer favours a hardline striker who creates something from nothing, and our far more threatening central midfield means teams crowd out the middle more. It's not that Defoe is a useless cunt who has drastically declined as a footballer, it's just that we are a better team who (theoretically) are no longer in need of a striker like Defoe.

If he ships off to the current QPR side at the end of the season I wouldn't be surprised if he put away 20 goals easily. A lower tier team that would applaud his endless shooting, and the fact teams may be less wary of him would probably give him an instant resurgence. The same way Jenas is doing well with QPR.

In short, Defoe is surplus to our specific requirements now. He made some huge contributions to our team in the past, but now it's time for him to move on for the benefit of both Tottenham and Defoe.",0,1363542611,null,0,false,0,c8xbpi3,t3_1agyq1,t1_c8xbpi3,t1_c8xb8xq,null,1431614679,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

The replica (the Celestial Toystore one is what I'm using as a base in this example) is made of the correct materials; copper, leather and all that, has the correct mechanism (manual sliding, but the CT model can be reliably flicked, unlike the Robatto model), has been based precisely upon the filming props and indeed improved upon, as the props themselves are far from perfect, and will include strong sound when it's finished.

If we really wanted to push for 3rd or even 2nd, we could have surely bought a striker in January to ensure it, no? Maybe a wide right player for Lennon cover? Legitimately if we had bought a striker even capable of scoring 5-6 goals, we would be 3rd comfortably right now. 

Now let me immediately clarify that I don't have a problem with this. Our chairman knows the situation a lot better than any of us and I trust he's simply doing what's necessary to keep us in a competitive position for when we DO push forward. 

That said, I think what Levy and co. say is one thing, and what they're actually planning for is entirely different. The burden of completely revamping the club's infrastructure with a new training ground and a stadium / redevelopment project is massive and very few clubs pull it off without some serious complications. 

It's a delicate balance between improving the squad and staying frugal and I think we're doing fine with it, but I do think it's fair to say we haven't really matched our ostensible intent with action. 

Can you name a team that's moved forward massively without serious investment and taking a loss? I sure as hell can't.

Slave owners didn't just force their names on their slaves but also their religion. Only a tiny number of African Americans today are Catholic, roughly 2 million and most of them have roots in the former Spanish colonies such as Puerto Rico. Black Hispanics in the United States number roughly 1.3 million. The remaining 700,000 African American Catholics are mainly newer immigrants from Africa, 17% of Africans in Africa being Roman Catholic.

So while there probably was a very small number of Irish slave owners it really was more nuanced than you are making out.

&gt;1. What do you guys think of United fans? Is there hostility? 

Yes and no.  There's absolute hostility but it comes from a place of warmth and most fans can put aside their biases to have an actual football conversation.  That said, around Derby Day me and friends....well we don't get on well.
I'm disappointed in United more than actually hating them.  They could have been so much better as a Club than they became; not on the footballing front but on the community and social front.

&gt;2. How do you feel about the people who jumped on the bandwagon once you were successful?

People from abroad don't know a lot about City because we haven't been in the limelight very long, but we have a very deep connection to Manchester and the working class poor in particular, as well as an ethos about community work which has been the driving force of the Club for our entire history.  

City fans also have a legendary gallows humour.  We accept the rough with the smooth, never become a short termist in thinking and never talk about football without our tongues firmly in our cheek.
  
We've been through a lot together as friends and a community; from relegations and bankruptcies to the Sheikh and the title.  Being a City fan is a very wild ride where you experience every possible experience in football.  People in /r/MCFC will attest that I'm much less tolerant of City fans than I am people on /r/soccer because I expect new fans to be respectful of our history and shared experiences.  This is why I have a huge hostility towards the ""sack Mancini, sell Silva"" lot.  When you've experienced Stuart Pearce as Manager and put all your hopes on Darius Vassell or Bob Taylor to grab you a goal, you respect somebody who has brought you more success than you have ever experienced.  A man who pointed at the banner at OT and proclaimed that he'd make them rip it down, the did.  A boy like Silva who has ""mercurial"" talent.

I'm not annoyed by new fans but I'm sometimes concerned that they completely miss the City culture that we've forged since World War Two.  Our owner and board try so hard to keep our pre-takeover culture intact and are hugely helpful to fans and invest in the local area, so I think it's a shame that some as a robot for a City flair then immediately believe themselves to be an authority about Manchester City without integrating into our culture

&gt; 3. Is there a large consensus for a second team? (Do most City fans have a soft spot for another team?)

Not really. We used to be big friends with Stockport County until we were relegated and they became tossers.  Brentford are a team that we look out for because Rosler is in charge and Oldham before Dickov went.  We've been quite friendly with Lech Poznan fans since we played each other and regularly hear of Poznan fans coming to City and vice versa.

Out of all though, I would class Rangers as the second team of many City fans.  Celtic and United are so close due to the Irish connection and there's a religious argument in there somewhere too, but City and Rangers fans have always had really good relations and I myself have been to Ibrox a few times with other City fans and own a Rangers shirt",0,1363543625,null,0,false,0,c8xc0ka,t3_1agt9j,t1_c8xc0ka,t3_1agt9j,null,1431614823,22,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,22

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Care to back that up? They have a very clear place on the use of force continuum. It comes long after tactical communication and most open hand techniques and then depending on the situation it may be preferred to CS or CS may be preferred. In terms of force its considered to sit roughly level with incapacitation sprays.

How many police officers have been successfully prosecuted for not following these guidelines when deploying the taser? Failing that; how many have been disciplined for it and in what way?

&gt;So you're basing this on videos? So you don't have the knowledge that the officer has? You don't know if for example this person is known for being violent against police, carrying weapons, having mental health issues or any other mirriad of factors that the officer may be considering? In the UK in the vast majority of instances where TASER is used, it is in fact not fired, its presence being enough to resolve the situation.

I'm basing it mainly on videos even though I have witnessed it myself, because unsurprisingly I am not physically present in all public-police interactions, go figure. Are you saying that because I'm not a police officer without decades of experience in the field I'm automatically wrong or not allowed to have an opinion based on visible evidence and experience? Are you saying the videos are fake? Are you denying that if there are a lot of these videos in existence, that it must be happening with a lot more frequency off-camera and that shows a training failure?

&gt;They are not and never can be a replacement for a firearm. They may look a bit like one if you squint but that's about where the similarities end. I would not go into a situation where I could avoid it with a TASER to face a deadly threat. It is used as a less lethal alternative to a firearm where viable however in those sorts of situations you still need a firearm in case the TASER doesn't work. I think police officers are accutely aware that it is not a cure all.

I'm glad you called it what it is, less lethal, as opposed to none-lethal which is what most people believe. I think people would have a much different attitude to arming all police with tasers if they knew the truth.

&gt;I don't think you understand what damage a baton is actually capable of. In some situations an officer can justify striking a suspect around the head, something which can be easily fatal (obviously). If a suspect has a knife and runs at you, you have no obligation to try and disarm them. If you have to stop them then you can justify using lethal force, the law is quite clear on that. A TASER would be a good option to try and stop that situation before it escalates into an issue. If I suspect someone has a knife, the TASER is a fantastic way to prevent them using it before they can even get it out of their pocket. At the same time if they do what they're told then there is no need for it to be fired. So again it isn't all or nothing. Simly drawing it and red dotting a suspect can often have the desired effect.

I'm well aware of what damage a baton is actually capable of and am trained in the use of it. Once again we're talking at cross-purposes, you describe a situation where a suspect is clearly intent on causing you harm with a deadly weapon, of course you can then respond in kind.

I'm talking about the scenarios where people get tasered as a **first resort** when encountering any none-compliance whatsoever - a situation where batons would not usually be deployed and if they were would not be smashing them in the head with it.

You wouldn't point a loaded gun at somebody who called you a pig when you detained them, the fact that you think it's okay to do the same thing with a taser worries me and makes me hope you're not a serving police officer.",0,1363544084,null,0,false,0,c8xc5j9,t3_1agi91,t1_c8xc5j9,t1_c8xa4w7,null,1431614887,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I saw one last year where a guy has been tased, was pinned to the ground on his face by several (each much larger than him) cops and was being repeatedly tased by another standing officer whilst he was down, not because he was a threat, not because he was a flight risk, but because he wouldn't comply with the directions to be handcuffed (which I had doubt he even could considered he had people sitting on him).

Now you may say that his none-compliance justified the repeated use of the taser but if you knew how much pain they cause and how they actually work (they are not none-lethal), I'd say that was either tantamount to torture or woefully dangerous. He was originally tased for standing in the street and shouting.

In that case, nothing happened to the officer(s). So what if he had died or been seriously injured and it wasn't being videoed? Nothing would have happened. Ian Tomlinson is a perfect case of relative impunity.

I have serious questions as to how good Bale is in the middle. He had a good streak where he was basically free-scoring, and playing more centrally does help him get into scoring positions.

However, he's not a great playmaker for that spot. In theory, playing Gylfi there and Bale on the left would help set the others more up for goals, Bale, Ade and Lennon. 

This of course, isn't as great an idea, since our strikers aren't really scoring goals, but it ends up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy since we're not doing our best to help them get into scoring positions either. 

It seems like a tactic that's way more dependant on Bale scoring a few goals than the team would need to be otherwise.

In fact, the only reason *Monty Python's Flying Circus* still exists is because one of the Pythons (Terry Gilliam?) found out the BBC was going to wipe and re-use their old tapes, so he bought all of them and kept them himself to prevent it from happening.

So yeah - pretty much every episode from the first 6 or 7 seasons of the show was wiped, never to exist again.

Except that they had made film copies of some of the episodes to sell to overseas markets.  Many lost episodes have been recovered this way.

Also, every episode's audio track has been preserved, as apparently that was a popular way to record your favorite shows before VHS came around.

There are fan reconstructions of missing episodes (still images synced to the episode's audio track), and some incomplete stories have been released on DVD with the missing episodes included in animated form (*The Invasion*, *The Reign of Terror*).

Is the reason the incident is being filmed in the first place because it is out of the ordinary? If Taser appears to come out quickly in your opinion, would that be because the person filming has been watching the situation escalate to a point where the officer has backed off to get his taser out, just when it's getting ""interesting"" to the bystander?

I can tell you for free as someone who carries Taser that it is NEVER a first resort that's used to dispense compliance for the sake of it. The length of the home office deployment form alone is deterrent enough, but joking aside it's because it's classed as Lesser Lethal force and your every usage is scrutinised.
The slightest sniff of an inappropriate deployment in my force and you're off for retraining... It's yet to happen that someone's deployment decision raises eyebrows more than once, so the training is clearly working.

You have to remember that policing is made of a culture of ratting each other out anyway, especially when promotion boards are coming up, nobody would be routinely stupid enough to use Taser as a convenience, in the same way you wouldn't use a baton gun as one.

I have to say I'm not particularly interested in ill-informed opinions or concerns from the likes of yourself, simply because Taser is tested and heavily regulated, I'm aware of the likely outcomes of the alternatives in given situations, plus it's saved my life once already... 
Do my job, you'd be grateful for something like Taser to level the playing field against violent criminals who try taking your head off with all manner of implements... Theirs aren't home office approved and they don't play by any rule book requiring self restraint.

Unless of course you'd be happier I kicked the hell out of people and broke bones; or maybe get a kicking myself? I don't fancy either of those last two options personally, I try to help people not hurt them, but Taser is another tool in the inventory when it's needed.

A man who has been tasered to the ground with the taser barbs still in his chest, writhing in agony and trying to pull them out. He is then tasered for at least a second time then asked to hold his arms out whilst the effects are still in force (which even I know is ridiculous given how tasers work). Backup arrives, they lay him out and try to handcuff him again, he still has his hands clutched to his chest and is stationary, tasered for at least a third time, an officer then tries to bend his arm back and when he can't he begins to punch and kick the man in the back of his head and neck.

He was stationary the entire time, he didn't lash out a single time, he didn't reach for his pocket or attempt to escape at any time. So beyond the none-compliance with the handcuffs, why is this man tasered at least three times then punched, kicked and kneed repeatedly?

****************

You are right in saying that our playmakers in the midfield are distributing well, but also understand that the playmakers are pretty accomplished goal scorers themselves. Every now and then, they will have a pop at goal, too. 

With Ba &amp; Torres, you have two different styles of play - one likes chesting down long balls, the other likes them on his runs. Both are known to be very uncomfortable with the other kind of play. Ba is technically a second-striker kind of a player, i.e. he like to chest the ball, lay it off, and then follow behind with a one-two or a 'poach' after a goal-scoring attempt by someone else. If you've played FM, then think of Ba as a Target man. A link up like Sturridge or Cisse would work in a two-player formation but Torres, not quite.

Torres likes passes where he gets to run on to the ball. The Torres we bought liked to position himself on the shoulder of the last defender and chase down balls that cut through the opposition defense. Gerrard was pretty good at it, too.

At Chelsea, however, Cech, Drogba, Lamps, Ballack and co. liked going the long route - Lob it up to Drogba, he'll bring either Lamps or someone else into play, quick one-twos and he'd usually end up scoring or assisting. Mou's game was a quick, pacy counter-attack that either blazed along the wings or drove straight and high through the center. Through balls were few and far between but Drogba, the beast, still managed to muscle off defenses and eventually score.

Torres' subsequent existence at Chelsea is well-known and the 'lack of service' has been discussed in lengthy detail quite a few times. His unhappiness at Chelsea's style of play is well-documented. We were patient with him, too. We knew it was a rough patch. He was supposed to go back to his 'natural self' and the 'Torres of old' once Drogba left.

What happened?

If you have been watching games around the year-switch Dec 12 to Jan 13, you may have observed that he kept drifting to the wings and even put in crosses at times for others to head in, when he should have been the one on the end of them. If you watched Ba today, you'd probably have observed that he was doing the same.

All teams have one player who is always the focal point of the attack. Often, these are also marquee players for their teams. Every pass, every move is designed to bring them into play at the most crucial juncture - in front of goal or to set up a goal-scoring opportunity. For Barca, it's Messi. For Atletico Madrid, it's Falcao, for RM, it's CR7, for ManU it's Persie or Rooney. When they are not in play, the other players are constantly scanning and noting their position and planning moves that will bring them into play.

Can you guess who that player is for us? Until two years ago, it was Drogba and, to some extent, Lamps. Since last year, it has been Mata. 

His distribution, positional awareness, movement, and passing is so awesome that you know he can create opportunities out of thin air. As a result, every player of the team scans for Mata when they receive the ball. Heck, we have suffered horribly when teams have managed to shut him down - not an easy feat by any stretch of the imagination. (That's why we got Hazard and Oscar this year, too.) 

However, this also means that our strikers are NOT the focal point of our attacks. Who gets to score the goal? That is decided by Mata, Mata's moves and the player with the best positional sense in front of goal. This year, Lampard and Hazard have often ended up slotting into the third category. 

Shouldn't that be Torres or Ba? Yes, it should. But it isn't.

Now imagine Torres and Ba together on the pitch. With three of the following six - Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Lampard, Moses and Ramires - around them. (I'm guessing Mikel or Luiz would be absolutely required to stick around as a defensive midfielder if this were to happen.)

Ba prefers long balls but he isn't getting any, so he starts drifting to the wings. Lamps likes to run in late into the box, Mata and Hazard are in the form of their lives, three midfielders already in and around the box. Crowded out by superior talent, Torres starts drifting to the wings hoping to PROVIDE service rather than RECEIVE it. (Also because he is Torres.) Neither of them is a true winger, and even if they were played on the wings, they aren't really any good at tracking back. 

That, right there, is two players, nay, two STRIKERS who are pretty much useless on the pitch.

Notice something else? All these playmakers - Mata, Hazard, Lampard, Oscar, Moses - prefer to hang in and around the box. Mikel and Luiz are usually found staying back. (I said, usually.) That leaves the middle of the pitch... vacant. Neither Torres nor Ba can drop back that far because, let's face it, they weren't meant to play there and neither Mikel nor Luiz can venture too far up for fear of exposing the defense.

What we thus have, is a box-to-box game that has lots of running from one goal to the other, a few goals for either side, almost impossible chances of keeping clean sheets and 11 players who will almost definitely become complete exhausted at the end of 90 minutes.

With Hazard, Mata and Oscar being good dribblers of the ball, Ramires' propensity to make 'dribbling'-ish runs from box to box and Lamps' preferring to hold on to the ball rather than spread it, the wing-midfield combination ends up hogging the ball more than the rest of the team. (In fact, our transitional play has come to rely heavily on our marvelous midfield - meaning, when they are pressed hard and shut out of a game, we tend to concede early and concede often. But that's off the topic.)

I am in the minority here when I say this: our marvelously talented midfield is somewhat responsible for this behavior and under-performance of our strikers.

Don't make the mistake of being fooled by stats.

I will say though that as a result of our weak justice system and changes in society's attitude toward each other, violence toward Police is more common. I'll qualify that by saying I am constantly spoken to like shit on the shoes of certain people... I notice that the older generation are FAR more polite, but the younger lot are far more over-familiar and abusive.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Is the reason the incident is being filmed in the first place because it is out of the ordinary? If Taser appears to come out quickly in your opinion, would that be because the person filming has been watching the situation escalate to a point where the officer has backed off to get his taser out, just when it's getting ""interesting"" to the bystander?

I think the majority of people on an average street have a smartphone capable of video recording, I think people film clashes involving police all the time, it may be true that the videos I describe are *uploaded* more often than normal since you wouldn't put a perfectly amicable resolution on YouTube.

&gt;I can tell you for free as someone who carries Taser that it is NEVER a first resort that's used to dispense compliance for the sake of it. The length of the home office deployment form alone is deterrent enough, but joking aside it's because it's classed as Lesser Lethal force and your every usage is scrutinised. The slightest sniff of an inappropriate deployment in my force and you're off for retraining... It's yet to happen that someone's deployment decision raises eyebrows more than once, so the training is clearly working.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3POG4LEQQ - I'm genuinely curious as to your assessment of this, I'm not being pedantic, I have and teach riot training so I'm willing to hear you out on how their training was applied in this situation.

&gt;You have to remember that policing is made of a culture of ratting each other out anyway, especially when promotion boards are coming up, nobody would be routinely stupid enough to use Taser as a convenience, in the same way you wouldn't use a baton gun as one.

Yes I believe the police have a stellar record of being transparent and not covering up for each other. Truly though, I hope that is the case today but don't blame me for not taking your word for it.

&gt;I have to say I'm not particularly interested in ill-informed opinions or concerns from the likes of yourself, simply because Taser is tested and heavily regulated, I'm aware of the likely outcomes of the alternatives in given situations, plus it's saved my life once already... Do my job, you'd be grateful for something like Taser to level the playing field against violent criminals who try taking your head off with all manner of implements... Theirs aren't home office approved and they don't play by any rule book requiring self restraint.

Oh how I love being patronised, I serve alongside the infantry, I'll be sure to do your job for a day and experience true danger. Don't assume things, it makes you look foolish.

&gt;Unless of course you'd be happier I kicked the hell out of people and broke bones; or maybe get a kicking myself? I don't fancy either of those last two options personally, I try to help people not hurt them, but Taser is another tool in the inventory when it's needed. Just remember we're not 'MURICA and we're a little more restrained on the whole.

By that logic you should be equipped with the same weapons I am when carrying out your duties right?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; [1] What do you guys think of United fans? Is there hostility?

It depends really, just like everyone is saying here, some are okay and some are cockends. For example, my old local was a United pub, which means the majority of people who watch football there are reds. 

I would go in there to watch the derbies, and there was this one old chap -- in his 70s I'd guess -- who I would usually sit near every single time. When we lost, he'd shake my hand and tell me maybe next time, in a very polite and friendly way, and when we beat them 6-1, he shook my hand and told me we deserved it.

Meanwhile, in the 3-2 community shield loss, I was there with my dad and some friends of his, when we were winning 2-1, I was cheering, a group of about ten young, skinhead rags stood up and started telling me to shut up and sit down. One of them in particular carried it on, telling me he was going to shut me up. I stood my ground, and they were kicked out and subsequently disappeared. 

So it really depends. There is this one guy at my work who is a dick, and he's a united fan, and his dad works there too, who is also a dick AND a rag too, however, I think that they are dickheads who are united fans, not dickheads because they're united fans.

&gt; [2] How do you feel about the people who jumped on the bandwagon once you were successful? 

I welcome them if they want to support the club, everyone started at one point and it's no different for them. I keep my eye on them though, to see how they deal with the losses, to see how strong they are, if they really support the team or just enjoy the success. Some have the makings of good fans, others, well, they won't be around for long the way this seasons going ;).

&gt; [3] Is there a large consensus for a second team? (Do most City fans have a soft spot for another team?)

Not collectively as far as I know. I like Oldham, though I'm a bit disappointed Dickov has gone. I was a regular at Stalybridge Celtic throughout my teens, though not anymore. I cheer for Blackpool, Peterborough, and generally the underdog. I did like Swansea until that faggot ballboy fell on the ball, now I don't like them. And of course I support any and all teams from Bermuda because [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zXk68KeS54U/SEaXnZ56wGI/AAAAAAAAADo/KmifycoZVeU/s320/goat.jpg).

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"&gt; "" How many police officers have been successfully prosecuted for not following these guidelines when deploying the taser? Failing that; how many have been disciplined for it and in what way?""

So I take it you actually can't back up your original statement that it is used as a first resort. TASER works as far as use of force is concerned the same was any other use of force and the final arbiter of what is justifiable or not is the criminal law. Force is rarely ever the first option even in firearm sieges.

&gt; ""I'm basing it mainly on videos even though I have witnessed it myself, because unsurprisingly I am not physically present in all public-police interactions, go figure. Are you saying that because I'm not a police officer without decades of experience in the field I'm automatically wrong or not allowed to have an opinion based on visible evidence and experience? Are you saying the videos are fake? Are you denying that if there are a lot of these videos in existence, that it must be happening with a lot more frequency off-camera and that shows a training failure?"" 

Well firstly there really aren't that many videos from the UK being that TASER is an emerging technology. I'm not saying that your opinion is any less valuable either. All I am saying is that it is that it is impossible to make a judgement call based on video alone. It does not tell you much about what the officer is thinking, feeling or any prior knowledge they may have. It doesn't for example give you access to things like PNC which the officer may have already got information from. It doesn't show concealed weapons. What I am saying here is that videos give a limited view and there is more evidence than simply a video. I would not judge whether or not a use of force is fair based on the sole evidence of a video. Evidence from statements, multiple different camera angles, if we can get it, forensics, police records etc, are all still incredibly valuable.  I think its important to recognise, when we form an opinion from a single source such as video, that we are not in possession of all the facts and any judgement call made has limited value. Especially if its from a TV program rather than raw footage because they try to make everything seem a lot more exciting than it really is. As to your last point, I don't think that its possible to determine what goes on off camera, with no evidence at all and I'm not one for making wild leaps either. In fact with mobile technology, and cameras being as portable as they are, and police work, especially where force is concerned being seen as exciting, people tend to get their camera out readily. I would also suggest that if a situation turns into a damp squib and becomes uninteresting it will not nearly as likely be uploaded to the likes of youtube. 

&gt; "" I'm glad you called it what it is, less lethal, as opposed to none-lethal which is what most people believe. I think people would have a much different attitude to arming all police with tasers if they knew the truth.""

The term Less lethal, or less than lethal is an interesting one. It acknowledges the chance that whilst the device in question (be what it may, a baton gun, baton, TASER, CS, open hand techniques, handcuffs) may be designed not to kill, there is some level of chance that it may happen. I also find your stance on TASER being less lethal when compared to baton as you call batons ""none lethal"". Even if the baton lands in the correct, low risk place, there is still a chance of seriously harming or killing. ""you're not going to kill someone by hitting them in none-lethal areas as per their training.""  Further to this point there are times when TASER may be used, eg in a scenario with a knife, where it would constitute as much force as it always would and provide a less lethal response, where as to garuntee a safe outcome for the officer they would have no choice other than to use their baton in such a manner that it will likely be lethal. 

&gt; "" I'm well aware of what damage a baton is actually capable of and am trained in the use of it. Once again we're talking at cross-purposes, you describe a situation where a suspect is clearly intent on causing you harm with a deadly weapon, of course you can then respond in kind.""

I'm worried that if you are indeed trained to use a baton that you do not recognise that it is less lethal rather than non lethal, I'm worried that you think it constitutes less force than a TASER because it seems to me you do not understand, even post training the issues involved with baton and the potential after care issues. 

&gt; ""I'm talking about the scenarios where people get tasered as a first resort when encountering any none-compliance whatsoever - a situation where batons would not usually be deployed and if they were would not be smashing them in the head with it.""

Again we're back to this first resort thing. Please back this point up or like the proverbial dog chasing its tail, we're going round in circles. Lets also be clear that we're talking specifically about UK policing here. TASER has been in the Met, with SC019, the TSG and royalty protection for some time and its usage keenly monitored. These units are not ones where use of force is unlikely. If it is a first resort than that should be an easy claim to back up. TASER has never been billed as an alternative to firearms to deal with only the most dire of circumstances. Police have never tried to put across the position that it would be used as such. I think it was a mistake to initially only give it to firearms officers because it has now got that label attached to it in the media. As long as the force used is legal, proportionate, accountable and necessary in the circumstances, it is reasonable to use a TASER. The current model for any use of force is that it should come after tactical communication, unless the scenario dictates that such communication is not possible. That has been going on since back to the days 14"" wooden truncheon. 

&gt; ""You wouldn't point a loaded gun at somebody who called you a pig when you detained them, the fact that you think it's okay to do the same thing with a taser worries me and makes me hope you're not a serving police officer.""

I am a serving police officer, I have been for some years now. How you can cast aspersions and believe that I think its OK to start using a TASER because of a bit of the usual verbal aggravation amazes me. Please say where I have stated that it would be OK, or what part of what I have written has given you that impression. Honestly I'm at a loss to find which part of my posting I would make anyone think that. In fact stood in custody with three TASER trained officers on a Friday night shift not so long ago with five very loud, verbally abusive drunks, that would have gotten a smack off of most people saying what they were, and guess what, no one even touched them let alone used a TASER on them.

I expect to see most of his signings (Brown, Kenny, Varney) leave in the summer, and good riddance to them. I think Ashdown has been waiting for his chance and should be given just that. I also think, against popular opinion, we should be keeping hold of Peltier. He's been a rock since he was put in the middle with only a few nervy moments. If we can keep hold of Byram, and the majority of the team and bolster in summer we're in for a treat. 

We need a creative mid, a pacey winger who will cut inside and a proven goal scorer. I don't think we're that far from having a team that can compete with next years Championship.

I've lived in central Cambridge (renting), Soham (first time buyer) and now Great Shelford (moved and bought here). Soham/Ely/Burwell/any of the villages to the 'east' would suit a commute to Stow, but you'd be miles out of town - trust me. We lived in Soham for nearly six years, and while it started out as an awesome novelty to own our own home, it became a massive ballache to not be able to go for Friday drinks without having to plan the entire night around the last train home, or stump up £45+ for a taxi home. The second we were able to move, we were out like a shot. You say your wife would like to be based as close to Cambridge as possible, so I'd say that over the 'east' side of the county, I'd really only consider Ely, because of the good rail links - if you find you can't afford anything nearer. Even saying that, though, Ely wouldn't suit your job in Stow, because of the huge commute you'd face. 



I'd say if you're hoping to make Cambridge your base for shopping/entertainment etc, then definitely, if you can, try for a location which is cyclable to the centre of town - if cycling is your thing of course. The Romsey area - Mill Road and all of its side streets - are ever popular, although rent prices will reflect this. There always seems to be a reasonable amount up for grabs in Cherry Hinton, although a lot of roads around that area suffer from traffic nightmarishness in rush hour. Cherry Hinton would probably tick both of your basic boxes - it's very close to Stow, and is only about 2.5 miles from town. 



Trumpington is pretty popular too, and seems to have a reasonable amount come up for rent. It's very close to Addenbrookes (the local hospital - I dunno if you're brand new to Cambridge or not, so apologies if you already know the layout) and a lot of the colleges, if your wife needs to job hunt (though I dunno what she does!). I assume when you say you need easy access to the city for your wife to work, you mean Cambridge and not London via transport routes?! If you did need transport links into London for employment, then I doubt very much that £700 pm would get you anything right on top of the train station, but maybe a couple of miles away. 


Best thing to do is to come and look round at a selection of different rental properties in different areas, to be honest. The only major ones I'd say you should avoid are the Arbury area and Orchard Park, because they're considered to be the rougher bits of the main city boundaries. But then, that could well just be me being a massive snob. I've only ever been to them once or twice, and have never lived at either. 


Oh, and they might be perfectly good now, but we rented with Saint Andrews Bureau (SAB) and they were a shower of incompetents back in the day.

Here's how an American Southerner sees it, which may or may not be what you're looking for:

1. United fans: You are glory seekers, and usually assholes. I either dislike them (because they're glory seekers), or pity them (because they're awesome people stuck with glory seekers. To be fair, we've got a lot of temporary MCFC glory seekers these days, but with Utd, I see it more as a constant thing.

2. I jumped on the bandwagon while we were rising up. I had never (ever) see a soccer/football game before then. So I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. I don't take offense when people call me a glory seeker, and I try not to call others a glory seeker (though I still may feel it, see above). 

To note: a lot of people do not want a team who always wins and also does not want a team that never wins. We want a team who is a roller coaster because we find that fun to watch. City is a good choice for people like this, but isn't a good choice for glory seekers. Last time we won the title, we got relegated the next season.

3. I haven't heard of any consensus. But, my husband is an Arsenal and AFC Wimbledon fan so... so am I. I've recently fallen in love with Tyrone Mings, so I think I'll be following Ipswitch for a while, but just a mere fascination.

Seriously, though, where in the south are you? Atlanta is pretty central, so if you're in Birmingham, Chattanooga, Charleston... well, I know of a great bar to watch with tons of other football fans, and that's not easy to find down here. :)

Though, caveat, I said ""Husband, I'm inviting a united fan over.""  ""What? In our house?"" ""Er, well, I guess not... to see the game together."" ""He can only come into our house if he kills Van Persie."" (He can be an Arse ;) )

But back to my point. Time Lords could go to the Sisterhood at any point and get immortality (drink some potion when you feel death is near and buy yourself a few more years/decades/centuries/millennia/?). But they don't.

I guess my confusion is directly to the fact that, she (River) sort of showed up kind of out of the blue, and I can follow the plot line generally,  to get to where we currently are in the series, but as of this moment (beyond giving him someone he can really, truly relate to because she's similar and a lot like him) her entire purpose hasn't really served yet.

Although he's stopped innovating music genres, he still doesn't stick around, preferring to jump from genre to genre. Creating different iconic characters, he's been a chamelian of sound and vision.

It's hard to get all of that if you hear them after the fact years later. What might sound normal to your ears now, were pretty damn new at the time. He also has a knack for creating popular songs that aren't just catchy, but also have an intelligence behind their construction and especially lyrics. That still comes across now, especially if you listen to albums in their entirety. You could even say he was one of the first to really take forward the concept album.

1. Everyone hates united fans other than united fans. As mentioned by others, united fans will gloat every win and it's not subtle, but in-your-face gloating.

2. I've definitely seen an increasing amount of city jerseys since two seasons ago. Back when I started supporting city, I wanted to get a city jersey but couldn't find it anywhere. That was before the city store was selling it online. Anyway, back to the point. An increasing fan base is always a good thing, but will they still be here even if we're shit? Will they still be here with Michael ball at left back and Samaras upfront? My experience and memories as a city fan help me take defeats that much better, unless the players look like they don't give a fuck about our team.

3. See devineman's post.

One thing new city fans would have missed out is the emotions you get when a city fan scores against united. Example: Trevor Sinclair (city fan) scores against united - the joy and pride on his face.

true,danybride101,null,null,"So here is a good summation- Aka Spoilers! 
 
Rose: The Doctor had been alone for a decent amount of time before saving his pink and yellow human that is Rose, the first human in some time to make an impression. She was willing to be his friend, and there was a mutual attraction that was drawn out as time went- since time is wibbly wobbly as we know, we don't know 'exactly' how long Rose was with the Doctor, but it was some years at the least spent saving galaxies and lands together. 9 was attracted to her as early as the episode where Jack makes his appearance in old Brittan during wwII and some lighthearted flirting and dancing takes place between Rose and the Captain and then later Rose teaches the Doctor to dance. Their relationship is an unstated one, she wanted adventure, he wanted a companion- they were a perfect match. Then came the daleks- luckily Rose saved him (and made a sexy Harkness immortal) which resulted in a kiss.... aaaand the Doctor regenerating into 10! 
10 is a great example of how the Doctor's regeneration is both a new body and set of quirks but essentially the same soul if you will, since his feelings for Rose Tyler transfered- there was still a palpable attraction (further solidified I believe by what 11 says to Amy later about how she was the first face his eyes had seen after his regeneration- in my eyes thats sort of a bond that cant be broken- that instant friendship). Granted there are the moments where 10 is committed more to his being in the moment, lets not forget Madam Pompadour and how she knew his name and instantly he was won over (the doctor has a thing for bold blondes).  That more plays into the thought though that 1, rose still had mickey, and 2 anyone who can know you fully (she knew his pain and his name and his past) can understand you on a level no one else can- someone alone immediately clings to that. But any who, that ended, madam Pompadour died, so back to Rose and the Doctor. They loved one another, the Doctor almost said such when he had to leave Rose in the alternate universe. Too bad, so sad, The Doctor sheds a tear for the woman he had come to love, his best friend who he would never see again (....though he would!) 

Martha: Can we say rebound? He wasn't looking for someone romantically (he hadn't been looking when he found Rose) but after having to leave her behind (yet again) he was firm on only wanting a friend... and sadly Martha didnt really see it that way. I mean lets face it, who can blame a girl after she's kissed (albeit for the Doctor to get human DNA so he could save the planet) but yeah... martha and him not gonna happen. We get to see that the Doctor is open to wanting to be a human, to wanting love and a family, to getting back what he had in Galifrey when they must use the Chameleon Arch to go into hiding, but even then he isn't into Martha though she's right there and very much about some John Smith. He knows that his role in the universe is too big for his own happiness- this human woman isnt ready to lead a life of danger, to accept him for the Doctor as opposed to who he was to her as John Smith and so he breaks it off and leaves. Eventually Martha tires of unrequited love and moves on (and thank God, she was pretty annoying). 

Donna: The best friend and the perfect person for the Doctor to have by his side. She and he both put out from the get go- no romance, just friendship- and stuck to it, which was something he needed. He needed someone to call him out on his lofty ideas at time and bring him back to the humanity of his own self without just following him around like a love sick puppy (cough-cough- martha). She was his bro- who helped him past his broken hearts, as well as gave him an opportunity to show off. Now enter another woman who knows the Doctors name... ""Hello Sweetie"" and so is the kick ass future...erm..current... depends on who's point of view this is... wife River Song (or Melody Pond). The Doctor, 10, knows she must be something important to him because she knows who he is, acts as if they've known one another for quiet some time and are friends, and is more than flirty with the brunette, then there's that whole- having his Sonic Screwdriver and knowing his name. She however tragically doesn't know Donna... so we knew that wasnt going to end well for our favorite red head (well favorite up to that point depending on who you are). 
Any who, River 'dies'... well... she gets 'saved' to a huge computer in the largest library in the universe so ...I have a feeling we may see her again- but thus starts the Doctor's relationship/intrigue of the woman, Doctor River Song. All too soon the Doctor faces three big losses--- first is the race of time lords- the Master, while evil, was kindred and he was loath and in tears to loose him (this being the first time), secondly is Rose -again- love those wibbly wobbly time limes right?! So this is the part where the Doctor gets to see Rose Tyler again!!.....only to loose her in order to save the crumbling universes she leapt through to save/see him. She gets a parting gift in the form of his clone- its the Doctor, same style, same big brown eyes, same memories-- same words and feelings of the 'i love you' he never got to say...and he's human so the clone can give Rose what he never could. He must walk away Again from Rose and then proceed to lose his best friend, the one person that helped him keep it together. He will see her again, but she wont see him or know him... very tragic. 
The Doctor does however proceed to find the Master again, not as dead as he originally thought, only to have to kill him along with the timelord race... and this time loses this life in the process... poor regeneration 10 really had an unfulfilled time, hence the pain of not being ready to go- he'd lost everyone, literally everyone this time, and rants as much- that its always his burden to save the galaxy at no gain to himself. 

Amy + Rory: Enter some true friends, both equally fond of waiting, and thank goodness because with their waiting/romantic/cool pondy-ness powers combined they make one helluvah kid named melody pond aka River song all the while keeping 11 as grounded as possible (which lets face it, he had gone from bitter 9 to elated 10 then lost everything and so was becoming again slightly embittered) 

Riversong: 11's relationship with Riversong is innately complicated because ever meeting he has with her from the start are her last meetings with him, the more he gets to know her- the less she knows him. However lets not forget- for Melody- growing up as Amy's best friend while also being focally brainwashed to kill the Doctor, her life was surrounded with images and tales about the raggedy man with the blue box, so in her goal to kill him she also has a fandom of him, a love if you will. She realizes after kissing/poisoning him what she's really done and gives up her healing energy to fix what she's wronged- I think even so early as that she loved him and realized how she was manipulated and thus fought to fix the efforts of silence in using her to kill the Doctor. This is why she (being the river in the space suite and not on the beach) tears apart time much later for him so that he may live because she loves him so vastly. By this point the Doctors encountered the river song who already knows all this- knows that time will be torn apart, knows they will wed, and during their encounters we see her go from a Doctor and free woman back to the woman incarcerated for his murder (even though it was a dummy him). He marries her at that point, because he's gotten to see the woman she will become and see that all along she's loved him that much- and knows the only way to save the universe is to wed her- marriage isn't a huge deal for someone that knows she is going to die in a library at some point- he can give her the best times of her life, save the universe, and get some of his own male fun in (lets face it- he's still a guy as he and river love to flirt about their interludes later) by just saying i do. The Doctor is unconstrained by time and can visit River any time, but only once a night/event (sine he cannot cross himself) while she is in prison all of her days (not really since she gets let off), the Doctor says - ""Her days. Yes. Her nights...well, thats between her and me, eh?"". So thats where most of their relationship comes from- the time he makes with her there is time she's had when she first meets him. I feel upon marriage, he didn't love her but it was a necessity but he grew to love her- besides he knew it would end eventually, he always knew her time would come. She was someone he could be himself with completely though, who understood time travel, wasn't a burden to his time and adventures, and had in a sense an expiration date- the perfect wife- then again it had to have grown harder the more he grew to love her. I really hope there is an episode where we get to see their finale date together, the last of river song (which im sure they'll do since Moffet said River will be back this season). 

Clara aka Oswin: This is the most recent companion for the Doctor, introduced to us as a human conscious stuck in a dalek (so again another temporal end for a character we like and another heartbreak im sure for the Doctor). This is before we tragically lose The Ponds to Newyork. We are not sure how much time passes between losing the ponds and meeting the plucky nanny Clara, but its obvious that she's going to be a spit fire and a possible romantic interest for the Doctor- after all she does kiss him in the first episode, and in some way is very forth going and plucky woman like River, and Rose. However that is that little quirk where she dies....so far each time we meet her. 

So there it is, a break down of the Doctors and his (their) relationships with the companions. 

(edit) TLDR:
Rose- love of 9 + 10, and 10's doppleganger human clone
Martha- rebound= sucks
Donna- Bro, total Doctor's bro= tragic ending 
Amy +Rory= besties and ...mother and father in law? 
River= Kick ass, loved the doctor from obsession to kill him, then married him, a lot of love/adventures created during her nights in jail. Doctor came to love her after necessity to save universe (plus she's hot) 
Clara/Oswin= dies.... alot... but def has a crush on the Doctor, eventually hilarious/awk moment between Doctor, River (jail river? or saved river?) at some point.

true,FitToPrint,null,null,"This all comes from a very new City supporter from the NY/Boston area of the U.S., so I can only speak to what I see here.

1.) I'll be totally honest, one reason I was initially drawn to City was because of the obnoxious United fans around me. I find, to a large extent, the United fans I run into here are generally fans of the team because it's hip. United have huge global support, and as the EPL gets bigger over here in the States, I've seen some people gravitate to the Red ranks because — well, it's easy. You can't really argue with United's recent successes. I do find that most around me here have a very cursory understanding of the game and/or the team. I know supporters who can't name a player outside Rooney. Granted, I know there are intelligent and well-spoken United fans out there. You seem alright! But my experiences have been almost entirely negative, so there's a wee bit of loathing there.

2.) I can't say, because most would say I was one of those people. I didn't follow the EPL until just a few years ago, so the only City I've ever known is the Mancini era. Since then, I've tried to dive into being a supporter. I've read up on some of the history, I get up each weekend morning at the crack of dawn to catch the games live, I even was lucky enough to see two City games in person when I went to visit a friend in Oxford this year (Home vs. Arsenal and Away at Fulham). It's frustrating to be called a gloryhunter, because it was really the players and the supporters that drew me in, not just the success. I love the way the supporters are so driven to helping others and the camaraderie, and the gallows humor is very familiar to me (I'm a hockey fan — a New York Islanders fan — so I know what it's like to be awful...). Being stateside, and the only City fan I know, it's tough to find that connection to the fan base a lot of times. But I'll still support the team. I know that if and when the bad times come, I'll still wear my kit with pride.

3.) Hell if I know. I don't really have another team I support and I have no idea what the fan base's thoughts are on other teams. ",0,1363572584,null,0,false,0,c8xkrmx,t3_1agt9j,t1_c8xkrmx,t3_1agt9j,null,1431619112,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

Since we have the core of an excellent squad that will be with us for years, perhaps it wouldn't be so bad to bring in an older, cooler head (and since we already have Lukaku to be the young striker). 

Someone I imagine would fit in really well is Soldado at Valencia. He's seems consistent, has played in similar systems to Chelsea's/what Chelsea wants to do, and has enough leadership quality to play as captain for Valencia. Also, he has the added benefit of having played with Mata already, so should fit in quite nicely. Someone else who has a similar description is David Villa. He also played with Mata. I love Mata.

I live in America and never really watched Soccer (Football, sorry) but got into it during the World Cup in 2010. 

The first BPL game I saw was between City and United at the bar I work at. I'm from Chicago and am a White Sox fan. I hate the Cubs. The Cubs are the favorite despite not being very successful. Even though United is more successful they're the favorite among Americans so I naturally felt for City. I believe the match was played to a 1-1 draw and two British ex-Pats in our small bar kinda kept me informed as the match went on and the subtle off the ball aspects of the game. I started to watch more and more BPL matches (City in particular) on a streaming site and became a fan. I plan on going to a match once I'm done with Military service but I follow them and support them!

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think it will vary for each fan, but I see it like this...

Rose: She was the Doctor's one true love. Their relationship developed much like the typical friends who eventually fell for each other (with a few aliens thrown in there). And their love was mutual. I see them as lovers. 

Martha: I wouldn't exactly call her the rebound, but she had the tough job of following Rose. I see Martha as much more independent than Rose, which was a good thing for the Doctor. He could count on her to help him out in sticky situations, even after she left. The difference between Martha and other companions is that she chose to leave the Doctor. She recognized that her feelings for him weren't reciprocated, so she chose to move on. I don't think the Doctor expected her stick around for that long anyway, but I think he was still disappointed to see her leave. I see them as close co-workers. 

Donna: Oh, Donna. I'm a little bias, because Donna is my favorite. She wasn't afraid to put the Doctor in his place and stick up for herself. She didn't see him in a romantic light, which made their relationship less complicated than it was with Martha. They were buddies, who could tease each other and joke around. I see them as friends. 

Amy: The Doctor's relationship with Amy is a little strange too, because I genuinely think that she had feelings for him for a bit. I think the writers took that too far, personally, but anyway.... I view their relationship kind of like Harry and Hermione. Could there be something between them? Maybe, but only if Rory didn't exist. That's what made the difference. Rory was Amy's husband and they both cared about the Doctor. I see them as family. 

River: This is the most complicated of all. I hope that we get to see more of their relationship, because I really like River. What's neat about them is that I think the Doctor is impressed with, and maybe a little intimidated by River. She's bad ass and can take care of herself. Because they keep meeting in the wrong order, we don't really get to see things from both sides. I think they're close friends. I don't really buy that they have romantic feelings for each other. It seems contrived. Maybe we'll see more in the future. ",0,1363575815,null,0,false,0,c8xlsss,t3_1ahlat,t1_c8xlsss,t3_1ahlat,null,1431619583,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The prints actually cost me around 25 dollars to order and ship. I charge 55-70 depending on the print. Since it is digital photography it is easier for me to sell multiple's since I already took the photograph. I put in the man power one time and can profit from that, so I don't charge as much for my ""hourly"" wage. I still do a lot of editing and take my time but it is easier for me. With manual art it is a whole different ball game. Hell I have seen people charge 300 dollars for paintings half that size and quality. 
The key is finding a good balance. If you charge too much no one will buy it. If you charge too little you won't make money. Go to some local art shows and see what others sell their work for in your area. Or check out artists online or Etsy and look at what prices people sell their art. Some if it is outrageous. Some people low ball to make a quick buck. Be sure to look at the size of the person's artwork and how it is relative to the price. Big artwork usually means big price.
As far as selling prints of your work goes obviously you cannot charge as much since it is not the original piece. BUT prints can be massed produced much easier. Hand made artwork always sells for much more money.

Playing Coutinho, suarez, and Sturridge as your front three, with Suarez playing that false nine type role, which leaves space for sturridge to burst through as an inside forward, works better than having downing on the right.

I understand downing is in form and is being rewarded for that, but still, wasn't this the plan with borini? The movement looked well then as well. 

Also, imagine the havoc that would then be created when sturridge and suarez switch positions, the defence which used be to pulled forwards by Suarez, is now being pushed back by Sturridge's pace and off the shoulder runs.

This allows room for three midfielders, like Henderson, which suits Allen (for example) in attack, and provides support in defence, especially since Henderson has more or just as much physical presence as Gerrard and Allen.

The longer answer is that you can set it to auto-lend your money based on rules (i.e. you set the percentage you want to lend at... the lower the rate, the faster the takeup, but the lower your returns).

In theory, what they're supposed to do (if they're banking the old-fashioned way; HFT and fancy schemes  to bundle up mortgage debt and sell it on notwithstanding) is give you 5% interest on your savings, lend that money out to someone else at 10% and pocket the difference.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Not true. I do own the freehold on my house - and for that matter the land it's sat upon. 

A debt secured on it doesn't mean I've given up ownership, it just means I've signed a legally binding contract saying ""If I can't keep up repayments, you have the right (subject to various laws surrounding how these things work) to kick me out and sell the house to recoup the money you lent me. If I sell the house myself, you get to see your money back before I get the cash for the house"".

Years ago, the mortgage company would keep your title deeds because they were essentially a magic bit of paper and whoever had it owned the property. Not because the mortgage company owned your house, but because that way you couldn't sell your house and do a runner. Today, the Land Registry means that title deeds are pretty meaningless - they're only really of interest for historical reasons.

Leasehold is rather different. It's a bit like renting a property, except you're allowed to decorate, you have to fix the boiler when it breaks down and the landowner can't come and kick you out on a month's notice just because they feel like it. However, a lease doesn't run forever - 99 years is fairly typical for a residential lease - and there's nothing to force the landowner to renew your lease at the end of 99 years. They're perfectly within their rights to kick you out once that 99 years is up and do something else with the property - such as sell the freehold.

This has been in the news lately as a lot of older people bought somewhere leasehold years ago with a mortgage, have lived in it ever since and long since paid off the mortgage. They never really understood what ""leasehold"" meant, so what's happening now is that the landowner is approaching them and saying ""Right. Your lease is coming to an end and I'm selling this property. You can either buy it yourself at market value or get out"". They've spent 25 years paying off a mortgage and have now discovered that they have precisely nothing to show for it.",0,1363600988,null,0,1363601609,0,c8xqn21,t3_1agih1,t1_c8xqn21,t1_c8x7afj,null,1431621897,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Rather than relying on the existing laws, the politicians and some rather shrill activists demanded more laws to sit on top of the existing laws.

The conflict comes from the issue that the press is seen as an independent observer of politicians, and giving anyone the ability to regulate their ""regulator"" is seen as a dangerous precedent, and even more so when the regulator is a bunch of politicians.

The problem as I see it is three-fold.

Firstly, the actions of the tabloids was already illegal, so no new laws were needed.

Secondly, the egregious actions were concentrated in the tabloids, and hence regulatory oversight of the broadsheets who do the most to ""regulate"" the politicians is seen as worrying.

Thirdly, the tabloids only did what they did because it sold more papers. There has been minimal debate about why the general public want such salacious gossip and whether the public would be willing to accept newspapers that are a bit... boring.

The Welsh and Scots don't seem to have had the mass emigrations to America, etc that the Irish have had.

So in the case of the Irish, huge, involuntary emigrations of oppressed people led to the strong sense of ""Irish pride"" that seems to exist in America particularly.

The key is A) Only entering sensible competitions.
Ideally you want a promotional comp - new products/films/albums, advertising a new business move/partnership/offer etc - If it's not a promotion then it's probably trying to sell your email etc beware. (These days one common promotion is getting more twitter fans/facebook likes - but that's a very personal recommendation so I tend to avoid those). There are rules on competitions I'm sure, but I don't trust the pure competition sites to not sell data/actually run a fair contest. And any big competition place falls fowl of my text tip:

B) Try to do the ones with lower odds.
I used to just enter loads of random comps online that were quick and easy to do. Not a bad plan, but others do that as well so your chances go down. The more effort required however, the less people are likely to bother. I quite like newspaper competitions as they often need you to read text etc or own the paper and they often close fast. (Florida was in a paper - I had to find the 'secret word' in that issue, then enter it online - how many people do you think bothered to do that?)

C) Remember it is luck. The more you enter the more you're likely to win - but I refuse to pay/call anything. (Although if you have to enter a code or something from a thing you've bought most people won't bother - so if I'm already buying the thing anyway, I tend to make the effort to enter. See rule B. (Also surveys - loads of shops have online surveys with a monthly draw via code on receipt. Can't imagine many people bother - if it's worth winning, I will.)

So yeah I enter quite a few. But I've won quite a bit as well - luck comes to those who enter!

What I don't like about Allen, even when he was how he was like early into the season, is that he really slows the tempo a lot and provides little to the attack. When we're pressing the opponent very, very hard, in a way that even if we lose the ball in their half and they clear it up, it just goes back to our defenders who have already pushed up to the halfway line. That kind of pressure. When we're in that kind of tempo, forward passes and the ability to play passes with the cutting edge are absolutely key. Lucas can play these kind of passes every once in a while, one example out of many is that pass for Suarez last game. Henderson can make smart passes and chips too (see: his set-up for Sturridge's goal against... Norwich was it? The one with Downing's right foot volley cross). I don't feel like Allen can do that kind of stuff. We can't have his back passes and sideways passes when we're pressing high. Heck, Wisdom got booed (well not really booed, kind of exasperation ringing out in the stadium) one game a little bit by the crowd for passing it all the way back to the keeper (from the halfway line) when we were pressing high for a goal.",0,1363605398,null,0,1363617904,0,c8xr3h8,t3_1aij97,t1_c8xr3h8,t3_1aij97,null,1431622082,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

This is a good point, my GF being a journalist who knows quite a few of those involved in the phone hacking personally ( although not involved herself ) we've had many discussions over the hypocrisy of the general public when it comes to this i.e. they were quite happy to read ""shocking"" stories and buy the papers that fed these stories, but when it comes to the source they were suddenly all up in arms pleading ignorance. 

I mean where did the public think theses stories actually came from in the first place? Didn't they ask that simple question? 

Yet they lapped them up without even asking. 


FTR I'm not defending anyone here, especially the press. I'm merely playing devils advocate and looking at both sides; which is basically what the general public still refuse to do. 



It basically boils down to supply and demand and the bullying tabloid hierarchical management culture of ""You're only as good as your last story"" which led up to the phone hacking scandal. 

So when you say: ""the tabloids only did what they did because it sold more papers."" then yep, that's about the size of it in a nutshell. 

What's also interesting to note is that the actual technique of phone hacking came from a shocked reader who wrote in with a story after finding out how easy to collect their own private cell phone answering machine messages if you hadn't changed your providers default pin. A light bulb went off in some journalists head and instead of running the story they worked out that they could retrieve messages themselves from just about any network using this technique themselves. So they did. 

The rest, as they say, is history.

Okay, sure, but how many people is that? Why aren't they already ruled out by the other measures that seem to exist? And how many people are inconvenienced by (say) internet access problems in comparison to those you catch out?

Again, I don't know the answers, but it isn't clear to me that this is useful.

&gt; I like to see being a Job Seeker as a job itself. You are being paid to perform a duty, i.e looking for work. Forgetting to log in would seem equivalent to saying "" what if I forget to go to work one day and lose my job or a day worth of salary "".

If my job required me to log into an otherwise not useful website every day in between my other work, I'd do it because it was my job, but I'd also feel perfectly entitled to complain at the pointlessness of the action and make attempts to remove the requirement. So yes, you can see it like that, but that isn't actually a justification on its own for having to do the task.

In this case, the analogy would be more akin to me doing all my useful work fine but forgetting to log into the website and being penalised...in which case, sure I didn't do my job, but not in a way that made any difference whatsoever so why does the punishment even exist?

&gt; Now for the concern of internet being offline or there being a power cut. I would be tempted to inquire as to how often that actually happens.

Just as I am tempted to inquire as to what the actual effect of the entire policy is. The answers to both questions should be taken into account when judging it. I expect you're right about the frequency of internet problems being low enough to be irrelevant, but my opinions are also based on thinking the general effect of the policy is probably not notable.

&gt; Really not trying to be rude, but I don't understand why everyone is bashing these measures.

I think mostly because it's widely perceived as loading jobseekers up with pointless tasks that inconvenience those actively looking for work without being remotely useful whilst also not really improving anything. Sure, it's a *minor* inconvenience, but that doesn't stop it being pointless and annoying.

We the general public wish to issue an apology.

We are deeply sorry that our desperate fascination with tittle-tattle and petty gossip has caused an entire industry to emerge in the UK dedicated to feeding our nosy addiction.

We are sorry that every time a newspaper or magazine printed details of someone’s private lives, we rushed out to buy that paper and read about it.

We are sorry that we gave newspapers the impression that we would pour over almost every tiny detail no matter how insignificant.

We are sorry that the newspapers seeing this as an easy way to make money ceased printing actual news and simply became modern day “penny dreadfuls”, albeit costing rather more than a penny.

We are however alarmed that they then decided to break the law to feed our addiction.

We are concerned that the newspapers listened to people’s private messages and tricked us into reading stories printed because of that illegal activity.

We the public wish to say sorry to the celebrities, and so-called celebrities who suffered the financial loss of having their private lives published by the newspaper before they were able to sign an exclusive agreement with Heat Magazine first.

We feel outraged not because it took place, but because we have been embarrassed into realising that we, the public are in part responsible for creating the culture where this sort of behaviour might be considered acceptable by journalists.

Seventh Doctor destroys Skaro, or possibly, something else. Judging by the reaction of that lone Dalek, it's probably Skaro.

Then the Time Lords have an agreement with the Daleks to have the Master executed on Skaro. This obviously involves some past Skaro and past Daleks.

Then the Time War happens, Daleks get wiped out and apparently, Skaro remains intact, as per *Asylum*, during which the Doctor suggests it's a ruin because of the Time War (and the Dalek / Thal war before that).

From that we can assume *Remembrance* takes place in the future of Skaro, but that would imply the Daleks in that should know about the Time War.

Of course, the easiest possible answer is, The Time War happened and Skaro has been un-destroyed or whatever. Timey-Wimey stuff.

In between the press and the law is a regulatory body.  In the past this was the Press Complaints Commission, whose job it was to make sure that if someone did something that was against the law then this got punished (either criminally or otherwise).  The PCC were an independent body who were run by the press themselves - effectively self-regulation.

The PCC failed to do their job because it took far too long for them to do anything about the hacking that was going on by the tabloids and only really did so when politicians became involved.  It's also interesting to note that the PCCs precursor, the Press Council was equally derided (the NUJ withdrew support in 1991).

The suggested approach from Leveson was to reform a PCC, allow the press to decide how it was formed, who ran it, etc, but to underpin that by law.  That way if it was failing to do its job then it could be overthrown and everyone could start again, rather than the current position where the press argued that it was working when it clearly wasn't and it trundled along doing nothing.

He has looked great in almost all his games this year. Done well in the U-21 matches, EL games and also in his stints against arsenal (with 10 men) and Fulham on the weekend. I would like to see him get a bit more game time, and with Dembele in the squad I don't think he will see that with spurs next season. 

I would love to see him loaned to a freshly promoted team like Crystal palace. Hell, I rate him above Thudd, maybe Fulham will take him.

&gt;Townsend

On fire. If Dempsey goes then recall him. If not I think give him another year in a PL team. He has probably earned his way into a better team than QPR granted his performances this year (him against Swansea was awesome).

&gt;Rose

Tough one. I believe I remember reading that he doesn't want to come back to spurs just to warm the bench. I could see BAE being sold for decent coin and Rose recalled. He is still a bit rough around the edges but certainly looks like he has the raw skill to make it in the PL. If I was in charge. I would give him 1 more season on loan, then recall him, sell BAE and use Rose -&gt; Vert/Zeki in rotation for LB.

true,ElDingus,num30,Sandro,"I think based upon his form this year, Townsend should be retained and used for cup competitions, and rotated with Bale and Lennon occasionally to keep them somewhat rested and injury-free (assuming Bale will be around next season).  Rose is a bit more complicated.  He is essentially the left-sided Naughton, but doesn't want to be in the squad position that Naughton seems to be okay with.  He would be absolutely great to have as coverage for BAE, and if we are in the Champions League, he may get more minutes in the league and other competitions.  I could see him being sold to Sunderland honestly, he seems to like it there and is performing for them, and I don't know if he is willing to accept the role at Spurs that he appears to be offered.  Kane depends on what we do in the summer market.  If we pick up a good striker (which we all know we desperately need), then I would hope he gets a loan out to a Premier League club and he sees more success than he did at Norwich.  Carroll also depends for me in my opinion.  As of now, I think he is a bit like Townsend.  If we loaned him out, we would sorely miss him if Dembele isn't able to play.  But at the same time, he isn't getting enough play time that he is progressing as much as he likely would getting regular play time.  I think if we were to sign another CM who would be dependable cover for a year, that would be enough to warrant him going out on loan to get consistent time, even if it is just for half a season.  After that he would hopefully be ready for consistent time in the first squad, rather than an occasionally 20-30 minutes whenever Dembele is not available or injured.

A few questions:

2)	Are you looking at a permanent move to the UK, or are you looking to retire back to France one day?

3)	Do you have an idea of what sort of income you will be getting? Have you found a job already?

4)	Do you have any short to medium term savings goals (such as for a deposit on a house), or are you putting money away for the long term?

For advice on your budget and costs of London, I recommend posting in r/London as well. If you tell them where you will be working, they should be able to help with ideas for where to live, and the costs of living there. 

There is a great post [here](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts) on choosing a bank account in the UK. Personally, I highly recommend First Direct for day-to-day banking because their customer service and online banking are just so good. But if you’re looking for better interest rates, then look at Nationwide and/or Santander. (I also have accounts with both of these, and their online banking is reasonable).

Sure, you can say bad day at the office, but the Fulham match (*especially* the final 30 minutes) was so eerily similar to pretty much every match last spring, that I can't fault someone for saying doom. 

Too much pussyfooting it around the edge of the box, no speed or sharpness in transition. 

What I would do right now if I were AVB, is move Bale back to the left, and let Holtby/Siggy/Dempsey play off Defoe and Ade.

Zerohedge is one of those sites.

No serious publication would label their anonymous submitters as 'Tyler Durden'..
