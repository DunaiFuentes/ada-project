This is in no way comparable. ISA's were created for the specific purpose of allowing tax  free savings. What Amazon are doing is having their income paid into a Luxembourg holding company despite conducting their business entirely in the UK. The tax laws were not intended for this to be an option, they are merely exploiting legal loopholes.

It makes no sense to make such a high stakes bluff. If Europe takes it seriously, then they can't do anything but let the referendum take its course. If they don't, the UK can't do anything.

true,antiliberal,cnty-england,ICXC,"&gt; An interesting idea, so lets extrapolate from it, you are saying that by voting against UKIP, you are taking a stand against what they for and making your voice heard as a protest against them. In which case are you not also taking an equally heated stand against the policies of every other party that you also don't vote for?

I'd say that's about right yes. You vote or campaign for a party and it's policies, you throw weight behind those policies, if enough people do it like what is happening in UKIP's case those policies become news and receive coverage.

&gt; Furthermore, how will UKIP know you deliberately voted against them with the purpose of making them lose, rather than to make another party win?

Why does that matter? According to the article the dozens of people who were there were there for a variety of reasons, yet all Farage saw was 'anti-English' protesters. It doesn't matter to him or any other UKIP candidate whether you vote against them because you don't like their policies or because you reckon your local Labour candidate is a pretty decent bloke. A vote against them is a voice against them, campaigning against their policies or for another party even better.

Perhaps we've been less inclined to give ports their as-high status during the industrial revolution, especially with trains being invented.

In essence people that like UKIP do so because they are one of the few parties that will even acknowledge that immigration, multiculturalism and the EU (topics that have for the past 2 decades been totally 'off-limits') are perhaps not the panaceas they were made out to be. I think a lot of people saw radical change to their neighbourhoods and local demographics under labour, and for the longest time felt they had literally no-voice on the subject as well educated and well travelled politicans tend to simply dismiss anyone that raises concerns about that sort of thing as being biggoted.

Of course there are still an old guard that dismiss any criticism, discussion or analysis of the isses raised by immigration and multicultralism as 'racist'. This is where UKIP have managed to break through by putting some serious names (like Farage) behind what would once have been the preserve of a right wing nationalist party like the BNF or National Front.

The oil price went down again, there is no law saying the suppliers *have* to drop their prices. As long as there is no collusion, it is up to the free market to bring the price down.

Now a rational company might say, we should keep the prices the same until we actually see it hurting our sales. If every company does that, the price never drops. They all maintain market share at much higher margins.

At any point one company could break ranks, and drop their price to try to win more market share, but if they did everyone else would do the same, so they would end up with the same market share but lower margins. But each company can claim to be operating independently, and using a totally rational pricing policy, waiting to see who blinks first.

There was a time when the supermarkets would have dropped their prices, and broken this deadlock. But they are now being more subtle. They don't drop their prices at the pump.

Well, thats kinda the idea - they have 4 years to reform themselves in a way that benefits the British. And I don't actually think it would take all that much, return of a few token powers, a tiny tiny amount of political grovelling to make us look important in the project and acknowledgement that the EU does not equal the Eurozone.

One thing that does worry me, is that after the labour years people seem to be clamouring for referendums on everything from Independence to what type of Coffee their supermarket should stock... and this is actually a pretty untested area of British politics. The AV vote being a good example of something that did not go at all the way quite a few people thought it would. The outcome of the Scottish independence referendum, whilst probably a no vote, is also far from certain.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A country is like a container ship. Where you are now is a result of decisions made around 10 years ago (at any point in time).

Britain is still suffering a tremendous devaluation of its currency that started to rapidly gain momentum when the Office of National Statistics (ONS) finally realised the country was in far more debt than it was aware of previously. Since then we've had finance scandal after finance scandal contributing to an erosion of trust of bankers, erosion of trust of consumers who were only too willing to lie on mortgage applications, erosion of trust of politicians. And quantitative easing like there's no tomorrow!

On top of this the UK had one of the most generous, and poorly administered welfare programs - giving housing, medical, and other benefits to almost anybody that turned up (excluding those highly skilled from outside Europe who have no recourse to public funds for 5 years). Not only was the UK not making much of an effort to count immigration it wasn't enforcing rules against those breaking immigration laws. Change in London is an undisputed fact - with a 40% reduction in white British in the last decade - such rapid change is *astounding*. And to think people were suggesting putting limits on housing benefit would cause ""social cleansing"" when such white flight was a reality!

So here we are now - rallying against Europe and the open borders of Britain. I don't think anybody's had a problem with letting people in with traditional checks and restrictions. But unrestricted migration from Europe and a flagrantly abused student visa system - plus a lot of family-related immigration outside those two avenues - has eroded public confidence in immigration as a whole. Which is sad but not surprising given that locals all over the country have seen their towns transformed and feel like visitors in their own homes.

Will leave Europe solve anything? Not today. It will almost certainly add problems relating to trade and there will be an outraged minority of British who enjoyed the benefits of free movement. But it will restore a small sense of self to the national of the UK. If other countries abandon the EU they might have some restoration of control and pride.

I always thought it fascinating that you could have so many countries so close to each other with so many individual languages and cultures! Europe really is amazing. South America is almost all Spanish speaking (with the exception of Brazil). America is all English. So why not celebrate the diversity of cultures that is Europe. You don't sustain diversity by forcing tidal waves of unchecked immigration from Africa and the Middle East or from poorer areas of Europe - that's a sure fire way of diluting or destroying your culture. And I'm not sure that's really as beneficial as proponents of equality make it out to be.",0,1368742702,null,0,false,0,ca07e3y,t3_1eh2s9,t1_ca07e3y,t3_1eh2s9,null,1431133308,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,wobinidan,null,null,"Since I posted my last comment, I've been watching a bunch of interviews with Nigel Farage.   I consider myself left-wing, but in the interviews I've seen, he does not put a foot wrong.  He doesn't contradict himself at any point and he appears to actually believe what he says, instead of trying to appeal to the masses for votes.

I saw George Galloway on 10 o clock live and he was heavily dismissing the idea that a politician should change his or her policies just to get elected.   Nigel Farage seems to be of the same persuasion.   I think that people are so cynical of politicians and so surprised to see genuine opinions that they naturally flock to people like him.

I'm from the UK and have lived in various EU countries for a decade now.  I'm worried that Britain leaving the EU will harm me as a British citizen.  But he's putting up a lot of good arguments for the UK leaving the EU and I haven't really seen any good arguments against the UK leaving.   The fact that racists like his arguments because ""fucking foreigners blah blah blah"" doesn't do anything to detract from the good arguments he's making.   

Con, Lab, Lib Dem, all need to actually field politicians and viewpoints that people believe now, because they've been floating on empty promises for 20 years at least and people just voted against the party they hated most.   There has to be a change towards politics that people actually want.   And UKIP, whether you hate them or love them, represent a tangible goal.

This guy is unstable. Croatians, and people from the Balkans in general, are really weird footballers. Many have the same degree of talent like anyone from Brazil or Argentina but more often then not they lack discipline. And Lovren is a prime example. He is a great prospect, but this year he really went batshit crazy. And even before he was known to get a red card too often.
In my opinion he is the same type of player as Vedran Ćorluka, who use to play at Spurs. He is loaded with talent, but coming from a relatively poor background, as soon as the cash builds up he lets go off himself.

Few have managed to escape this situation. The best example is Modrić and Mandžukić. Especially Mandžukić. I always knew he had it in him to be among the best, but only after he left Croatia and joined a real professional club did he start to put in the long hours on the training field. That is why he will be in the starting XI next Saturday.

She turned to them again in 1982 for the Falklands war, extensively through the troubles in NI, that prison siege and the Gulf War to name a few.

I think Cameron has done a similar thing... he's had one positive experience of something and got a bit drunk on it. They obviously did a lot of research and thought they could win the AV vote (despite it appearing to have widespread support in the liberal media). He obviously thinks the same is true of the Scottish vote and now the EU... but as I said, if you do enough referendums simple statistics points out that eventually you will lose.

Edit: Not to mention the EU is such a 'toxic brand' in the UK right now, I wonder if anything they can do will encourage a yes vote.

The British and German ideas of small buisness enterprise are not that different on paper.

The EU seems to think that because our politicans are voted for, and are generally pro-European, that they are somehow extended part of their democratic mandate. The election of MEPs amounts to little more than a theatre act to try and add a veneer of legitimacy to the project. Christ, in many respects the EU is less democratic than the Chinese government. It will have to change in time if they are really going to push for such radical integration...

And here we have a brilliant oppourtunity to drive the EU towards becoming a modern, democratic (or at least accountable) organisation that can really capitalise on its political weight on the international stage. (It seems ridiclous to me that the EU encompasses the 450 million richest human beings on the planet, yet often we collectively have little say in international affairs or trade which is dominated by the US and China).

I think a lot of British people are actually quite pro-European at heart, at least in theory.

Walker can take the space Bale leaves when he cuts inside, and we can have two natural left footers to play balls into the center. It's much more balanced than playing 3 CAM like we have been.

At the moment Westminster politics is dominated by *least objectionable* grey-men (Miliband, Clegg and Cameron).

But Nigel Farage is of the Salmond, Churchill, Stalin, Thatcher breed... a distinctive character and a man of conviction (even though you may not agree with him in the slightest). He genuinely believes what he says and it is guided by his ideology (not by surveys or focus groups aimed at maximising appeal to middle ground voters). And that really comes across in the UK I think - partly because against a backdrop of grey men like Cameron, Clegg and Miliband he looks like a 'different sort' of politician.

I've made absolutely no secret of my dislike for Steven Moffat's latest direction for *Doctor Who*, but it's utterly, absolutely ridiculous to claim that Moffat is trying to make *Doctor Who* an American show. How many American shows have jammie dodgers, or Victorian-era governesses? How many American shows even *use* the word ""governess""? Does *Breaking Bad* have the villains busting out ""Jerusalem"", like in ""The Crimson Horror""? Does *The Sopranos* feature a paramilitary organisation working out of the Tower of *London*, like UNIT? 

I believe there are very legitimate complaints that one can have against *Doctor Who*. I also believe that some complaints lack legitimacy, and claiming ""Those nasty Americans are ruining our *Doctor Who*"" does not fall within the purview of the former.

&gt;you can't just make something up

Well *that's* rich.

&gt; around a fifth of those interviewed felt the show had lost its edge.

EDIT: It's interesting to see people's comments to that article. They read how their predecessors have been complaining about *Doctor Who* since 1966, then add that they're not sure about the direction about the show *now*, and that it'd better change post haste.

Furthermore, there are a myriad of unjust laws which police uphold without question simply because it is the law, they are puppets of the ruling classes.

These people have more power than anyone else in society, yet the requirements for becoming a police officer are not more substantial than that of a bin man, literally anyone can become a police officer. It's ridiculous.

I don't want to see that happen to Doctor Who.  However, that being said, I think it shows maybe the Doctor being a little reckless with time.  He changed a fixed point which ultimately screwed things up.  He ends up fixing it, or at least he thinks he does, and now he probably thinks he can do a lot more.  It's kind of that he took an inch, and now he's going to keep going until he takes a mile, which could end up costing him.  He's been playing with fire, and may eventually get burned, and that may result in the unravelling of certain things he's tried to keep intact so carefully for so long.  Also, we still don't really know fully what the result of him resetting time by blowing up the Tardis is.  Personally, I think Clara is a part of the Tardis that ended up being distributed across all of time, like the Tardis was ensuring that someone would always be there to help him, and would explain his attraction to her.  I think part of the frustration people have, and I kind of have too, is that they don't always seem to know exactly what they want to do with Clara or the episode plots, and looking over what Moffat had to say, that may very well be the case.  I'll of course keep watching because, well, I need to know.

One day you'll be a victim of crime and it will be the police that will come to your aid. 

The police exist to serve YOUR community and to maintain law and order. The law is there not to suppress you, but to serve you. If you don't like the laws or feel the police aren't serving you, then you have elected representatives and a police ombudsman who will gladly take your views and help bring about the change you want to see.

If you had a 25 year old in your office who wore the same, you'd think 'hot! biker chick!!! bit racy!!' or similar. I defy you to deny this :)

This is entirely not your fault, it's a psychological fact, and I wish I could remember the bloody name of it (I may look it up in my textbooks over the weekend as I was speaking to a colleague about precisely this just today). Details (from hazy memory):

Perceptions and/or prejudices are built up from many factors:

- What you see around you as you grow up is an influence
- What your parents agree/disagree with/comment on/tut at will influence
- Anything you read in the media will influence
- Peer pressure as a kid makes you conform (as a general rule) and want to fit into groups, and MANY groups are formed off the back of their own uniqueness. For example you'll remember at school there was a spoddy, studious group, there were the funny kids in the middle who weren't ugly but weren't future models, then maybe there were the rich and/or beautiful kids who got invited to the best things. Each of these groups discriminate against other groups (sometimes unknowingly). Can you imagine how much they'd discriminate against a 65 year old dressed up in leather when their own mums shop at M&amp;S or only wear age-appropriate clothes?

So this is how it works. From age learning to understand language until late teens, your ability to make a judgement about such things is quite limited. Yes, you may be an opinionated teenager who wants to tell the whole world that they're wrong all the time, but your upbringing, social breeding and day-to-day interactions dictates that even if you completely disagree with normal opinion out loud, your unconscious (not subconcious, they are different things) remembers that 15 years of brainwashing which says 'this person is not normal.'

You can develop into a rational adult who completely disagrees with judging a person on their appearance, but the ingraining from your childhood is so absolute that you have to RE-TRAIN YOURSELF to start thinking differently. 

Let me give you an example. Guy walks up to you on the street, you happen to be smoking, this guy is unshaven, his shoes are falling apart, he looks a state and smells. What's your instant thought? It's likely to be 'this guy is homeless' or similar. Do you give him a cigarette? Perhaps, if you are generous. Now let's think about the hidden. He's actually a multi-million pound earning artist, who, for whatever reason, ran off to a party without carefully dressing a few days ago, partied for 48 hours and is now on his way home utterly pissed, but has lost his wallet, smells, and looks awful. Let's imagine it's an artist whom you have admired from afar for years but have never seen a picture of. So, if this dude happens to mention he's, I dunno, Banksy - are you going to give him your free cigarette now? Of course you will. But when you thought Banksy was a scruffy homeless person, maybe you would have been disgusted. Maybe. Each to their own. Some would've had sympathy.

The fact is: you've judged someone on their appearance with absolutely no factual evidence to back your judgement up. 

We have to untrain ourselves from this mode of thinking, and the only way to do that is to have an open mind, get older, question things and talk to all kinds of people (if you want to). 

This 65 year old could've been Mary Quant, she could've been Vivienne Westwood, she could've been their partner/best friend/old PA. Or she could've been a rock chick in her youth and decided she'd stay like that for life. Or she could've been prudent and dressed conservatively in her youth and had a revelation that she REALLY likes leather in her 50s. 

Either way, who are you to judge? Does what she wears make her a less respectable person in your opinion? If you grew up around conservative clothing and dress, yes, it would. If you grew up with an artist mum and a guitar playing dad, no, it would not. 

**To summarise, and this is not directed at you but just a general comment: we cannot help but judge a book by its cover, we need to re-train ourselves to stop doing it, and most intelligent, rational adults eventually learn that you can't make a judgement about someone until you've had a decent conversation with them - but it genuinely takes a long time and is through a process of trial and error and sometimes being surprised.**

I'd just have to note some of my picks: Giroud is fantastic at holding up the ball, excellent in aerial battles, finding empty space to run into, and playing others in. Superior to Adebayor (and Walcott as CF) in those qualities.

Jenkins is amazing. Best crosser at Arsenal, has the stamina of a marathon runner. Superior this season to the once demi-god Sagna.

I dropped wilshere because, as of right now, Cazorla and the future of the English national team don't mesh well. And Cazorla is currently better than anyone at the two clubs at the AM position. plus, smile factor.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Only a little bit. It makes a lot of points...

Like the idea that all villains/heroes are shaped by the Doctor or that the villains aren't thoroughly evil. Well what about the weeping angels? They don't fit either category. Their laughter and manipulation through Angel Bob is pretty evil, murdering and time-zapping aside. Same with the Great Intelligence.  So...2 original evil villains.

We could see how many thoroughly evil villains RTD had...

The Jagrafess maybe (though he doesn't really have much of a voice in the show), the Abzorbaloff (written by kids), perhaps the Midnight entity (though we know so little about it). So...sort-of 3.

And of course Daleks, Davros and the Master, all of whom were written to be evil before RTD or Moffat were ever showrunner.

So Moffat 2, Davies 3 for ""totally"" evil villains who aren't shaped by the Doctor, and Davies has been around longer.

As for the Doctor being the centre of universe, I actually agree on this count. It does make the universe seem smaller, and that's just one aspect of the show I'm not that big a fan of. However, saying that Moffat's ""by now tons of people have heard of the Doctor and his fame""  idea is somehow too realistic and thus fanwanky is just silly and a matter of opinion. What does ""too realistic"" even mean? The fact that it apparently results in requiring more suspension of disbelief for the writer of this article is their own problem, not anyone else's. But I didn't exactly like RTD's way of handling the Doctor either. How about we just go back to classic where the Doctor was a random not-famous wanderer in a big universe?

But I really disagree with the article's claim that the Doctor's ""inevitable"" increase in moral ambiguity cheapens the Doctor's heroism or suggests that saving people is a waste of time. That second part is ludicrous and the first isn't true. The first just means that the Doctor isn't some whiter-than-white hero, and you could argue that it makes his deeds more impressive. I prefer the Doctor with moral ambiguity. He's a person and real people are not whiter-than-white heroes.

Next, this article says that Moffat writes ""wafer thin characters"" and 1-D women and brings up a ""twitch sleight-of-hand"". Well they don't bother to explain what that last one is and they don't back up the claims of the first two. The second claim is a little redundant in light of the first and I've argued a lot before about how Moffat's women aren't any less 3-D than his men. I wrote up a list of the main cast, reoccurring cast, and protagonist characters of individual stories and separated them by gender. There are many more women than men listed, and both genders are diverse. Making them all come alive as 3D people is a different matter, which this article doesn't bother to go into. Frankly, the article is just taking cheap shots on the way while making it's main point.

I only agree with one point in this article, the rest is just tosh. This article could've been shortened to one sentence to make their point. Instead it complains on the side about other things in Moffat's run they don't like, even if they aren't accurate.",0,1368757543,null,0,1368758829,0,ca0cb8p,t3_1eh3du,t1_ca0cb8p,t3_1eh3du,null,1431130919,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

While the woman has every right to wear whatever the fuck she wants, I too would be a little WTF about the leather in a professional environment, as I would be with anybody of any age or gender. Expect for outerwear, perhaps. And shoes and bags, of course. I guess it depends on the workplace culture, but I'm not too far off 25 and I think I'd probably sooner die than go for a ""hot biker chick"" look for work. Or a hot anything. 

I'm admittedly a conservative girl, as far as dress goes. And variety is spice of life, right? I think OP feels a similar way, not tutting or disapproving, just vaguely confused about her work wardrobe choices. I mean, as respectful of the rights of others to any choices they deem fit as I am, I do sometimes privately wonder when people make decisions I can't follow the reasoning of. 

I agree that the woman's departure from cultural norms are the main reason why OP and I find her choices odd. I think OP was trying to find out if her outfit would fall under a more widely socially accepted context than the ones she knows about. That's where your argument is the most valid: who says she has to fit into anyone else's idea of appropriate? Though I do feel like work attire is where you have the least wiggle room. 

While I intellectually understand that I have no place judging her I do because I'm human and that's what humans do. It's an unrealistic thing to expect not to be judged based on your appearance; it's counter to how the mind works. Our choices in how we look are a form of communication, designed to elicit a response. I don't have to approve of or understand her outfit even if I fully support her right to wear it. But it's a very private thing that I realize does not matter, does not change who she is as a person, and should not affect the way she is treated.

&gt;I don't understand. Really, I'm just curious. Maybe I think of her as more of a ""free spirit"". I don't know. Honestly, I do not have any bad feelings about the clothes that she wears. I just wanted to know if maybe there was some subculture of fashion in the U.K. that I was unaware of.

I understand where you are coming from but I have to refer you back to my previous comments, this is not being a bad person thing.


&gt;The things you are saying remind me of Malcolm Gladwell's book ""Blink"". He makes the case that we have a built in ability to make correct judgements of peoples character instantly. While I respect his opinion, I strongly disagree with his views. This is the mentality of law enforcement, and the reason every interaction I have with them is negative. I don't believe in judging people by appearance, and I live my life consciously with this in mind. Yes, this type of behavior is natural, but I believe our ability to overcome it (and we all can) is an important part of being a civilized human in the modern world.

You have a really positive mental attitude on this matter and I will not dispute your high level of emotional intelligence, however, the fact that you even started this thread in the first place suggests that you still have a little way to go in terms of how you judge people; as I said, the textbook will help. We ALL do it. Feel free to do a poll on it. I still do it and it disturbs me but because I’ve read my psychology textbook’s blurb, I find it easier to cope with.


&gt;Other than me using the word ""strange"", which may have a different meaning for me, than it does for you, I am lost as to why you think I am judging her.

You have not disclosed your age yet. If you feel okay with it, may you? Thanks.

The show even went as far as deleting the Doctor from the Daleks memory to try and shrink his ""footprint"".  

It's not a ""problem"" with Moffatt if Moffatt is literally still in the process of using it as a plot device we've yet to see wrapped up. 

The author has had a chip on her shoulder about the Doctor using his notoriety to his benefit ever since the Pandorica Opens (where it didn't help him by the way - he was still imprisoned) and hasn't let it go. I bet she loved the Waters of Mars though - again, a pre Moffatt example of the same concept - it's not a Moffatt thing, and if it is, he's making it a complex enough issue to keep it interesting.

true,moostapha,tennant,Tennant,"I think his criticisms are entirely valid. I just don't think that's the whole story. 

The entire time I was reading it, my mind was re-playing Tennant's little speech from Planet of the Dead about normal life being the most important/amazing thing. 

I've also talked to other who fans IRL about the same idea from the opposite side: that one of the draws of doctor who was seeing how normal people react to extraordinary circumstances. I mean...there have been episodes (Blink comes to mind) that barely feature the Doctor at all. And they felt more like Doctor Who *to me* than the vast majority of the episodes that Moffat's lead. 

I think the core of my issues is that Moffat doesn't seem to really *get* Doctor Who. Seeing him in interviews, he's obviously very passionate about it. And he's been very successful. No one can take that away from him. But the things he focuses on just seem wrong. 

DW is not about long buildups to big reveals either. All the Bad Wolf stuff in Series 1 was subtle until the end. The dozens of times Torchwood was mentioned were varyingly subtle. 

I think Moffat is a *great* DW writer. He's written some phenomenal episodes (including Blink). I'd love to see him jump back into that role. I just don't think he's a great show runner for DW. He does great with Sherlock, but then again Sherlock *is* about the main character. 

DW has elements of that focus. Tennant's farewell was obviously focused on him, and the last time he talked to Rose was heartbreaking. But it's the focus of scenes, not the whole show. And it's about his relationships with very well fleshed-out characters. They're one of many little drops of honey that ooze from the sides of your sandwich, not the meat, bread, trimmings, and crust with just a bit of salt making up other characters and mayonaise for plot. 

I feel like his focus is in the wrong place, and I think the author's description does as good as job as any of guessing at why. 

In short, I remember getting a friend into DW last year. When he got to Season 2, I was visibly jealous at him getting to see that for the first time again.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Realistically it would be impossible to renegotiate anything with the EU without the threat of the UK exiting looming over it, I'm sure you can see that. I don't subscribe to this idea that we can ""influence from the inside"" to get what we want - considering what we want will require treaty change that 25/27 countries in the EU have made clear they have no interest in.

Firstly I don't think you need to threaten to leave a table to be able to negotiate at it and secondly you are again simply presuming there is even a mandate to renegotiate that I simply don't think exist yet. 

&gt;As for the referendum, you seem to say you don't want one but recognise that one is needed which is something we can both agree on. I understand why pro-EU people don't want a referendum; I just abhor the stance of a lot of them that they want to deny the rest of the country a say in the matter.

What's funny about this is that we have a perfect example of the processes I'm talking about taking place in Scotland. The Scottish have had a long, steady, debate about independence that has lead to such political change that the head of their government is from a part whose main planks *is* independence. Nothing, at all, like that has taken place in the UK yet. My point is anti EU people are rushing around shouting ""we need to have the debate"" by insisting that we finish it and that is utterly, utterly ridiculous. 

&gt;I mean look at this comment string; why am I being downvoted? Is it because I broke reddiquette? Or is it because pro-EU people just want to silence any opposing voices?

You play the victim a lot don't you? Some people misuse reddits voting system to downvote post whose ideas they disagree with.

Places such as Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow were as important, indeed, at times more important than London.

To a Victorian, London wasn't a major city. Most of the industrial revolution took place in the North, and it was the North that benefited most from innovations in steam power and transport.

However, as their wealth was based on trade, which later dried up, their importance as a percentage of the UK's GDP reduced and that allowed London to emerge as the leading city, but only as a percentage of the UK economy, not in terms of raw impact on GDP.

Don't forget that as recently as the 1970s, London's population was shrinking.

It was primarily the boom in financial services in the 1980s that reversed that trend and finally put London at the centre of the UK's economy.

EDIT:

Reposting something others said elsewhere, seems the whole anti-english thing may have been manufactured:

Seems to be two versions floating about - one with the ""anti-english"" angle, one without. ITV, Express, BBC and Guardian don't report anything that could be construed as ""anti-english"".

In fact, the BBC has a quote from a UKIP spokesman saying he thinks it probably wasn't anti-English, which I think is an honest response. Comparing this to saying ""Go back to Pakistan"" is frankly a bit over the top.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22559526

The Guardian mention the ""Shove the Union Jack up your arse"" comment, and talks about Farage claiming it was anti-English but they dismiss his claim, and say it's not entirely true.

Rhyl itself has some pretty good B&amp;Bs and hotels that can be rented out for long periods, and the cycling from Rhyl is pretty nice and easy up to St Asaph (Llanelwy), I remember doing it often as I went to school there. Also, if the weather is rubbish, there's a lot of public transport between Rhyl and St Asaph.
As for getting a place or houseshare in St Asaph, it can be done as I remember working with an Italian girl who lived with a group of people there for over a year, shall I ask if they still have the room available? (This was in 2008 though, so not sure if they still do this)
But I would suggest Rhyl, St Asaph, Prestatyn and Rhuddlan as places to look as they are all closeby to cycling routes that run to St Asaph and also have public transport/pubs/shops/general stuff to do. Rhyl and Prestatyn have major train stations so you can explore Wales and northern England quite easily from them.

Otherwise, there has always been some sort of North-South divide. Indeed in some cases, it was considered semi-independent, such as with the Council of the North. You could blame the Normans' Harrying of the North which essentially destroyed York which was the second city of England. 

London has always been the most important city in the British Isles. It's closer to mainland Europe than any other city, close to the English Channel and the North Sea (because until the 17th/18th century, trade went almost always eastwards) and has thus been the most prosperous city, hence the lack of change in the structure of, and liberties given to, the City of London. 

What has changed is that the South East has become more suburban, meaning the wealth of London is spread over a larger geographical area than previously, which has exaggerated the difference.

I agree with this - but nobody is going to lend to him at 0% (apart from his parents, friends or misc. family).

That £900 would represent almost 50% of OP's yearly income for a start - and he has debts of large % of his income too. I'm also going to assume OP is young (lives with parents) - so his credit rating will be neutral or bad. Neither will qualify him for the best deals. 

0% deals can be invaluable - we bought my wife's engagement ring on a 2 year 0% deal - I had about 40% saved up but after a year and a half of prep we were ready to get engaged - the 0% deal allowed us to do so well ahead of schedule and put extra cash into the wedding. Paying 29% would have been inconceivable.  The only problem with them, is that they require decent credit ratings.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"EDIT: Sorry Salvaxe, I got confused about which parents you were referring to. Actually my parents were skilled migrants who came from abject poverty to the UK to do a job that British people couldn't or wouldn't do; they stayed long enough to become British.

My girlfriend's parents are skilled workers in their home country. They wanted to come visit to see her graduate university but couldn't because border control was so paranoid that they were coming to steal jobs, even though they have really good jobs back home. The visa process was delayed so much that they missed the graduation. Their reason to visit was gone, so they gave up.

I don't actually support an open door policy for unskilled workers. I'm talking more about skilled immigrants and about how hard it is for truly skilled people to get in and for family to visit. There are a lot of cases of really good skilled workers having their visa application delayed again and again, even though they meet all the points requirements, until they give up and take another job elsewhere.

I have sympathy for the British people who didn't get the opportunity for a good education and are therefore not able to compete in skilled jobs and have to try to compete in unskilled labour instead. The unskilled labour market is too saturated already so it's totally unfair to unskilled Brits.

However, letting in skilled immigrants to work is not altruistic. Immigrants are let in because the employer couldn't find a Brit capable of doing the job.

You should instead be angry at all the skilled British workers who emigrate to others countries seeking higher salaries for the same job, leaving the skilled jobs behind with no one to fill them but skilled immigrants.

If anything the show has become more ""British"" because that appeals to the whole ""anglophilia"" movement.

The UK might not have an institution called ""[gay] marriage,"" and that does result in a few edge cases where someone who isn't ""married"" loses rights (e.g. titles someone's wife/husband gets); but pretending that 90%+ of rights (including the most important ones) aren't equal between gay and straight people is just disingenuous/ignorant.    

The gay marriage bill should finish in the HoC later this month (21 May 2013). Then on to the HoL. The HoL might make legal amendments (as is their job) but I highly doubt they will intentionally block it.

It's important to remember that it is time-locked. The only way I can see how this could work is if it exists in it's own distinct bubble of time, entirely separated from ours. If it existed in our future, then the Gallifreyans could just travel back to now, equally if it existed in our past they could just travel forward and be here now.

You might be wondering what happened before Gallifrey was time-locked, where it was in time then. Well, ""before"" is a tricky concept when we're talking about time travel and time-locks, so instead let's ask where it would have been were it never to have been time locked.

I suspect that due to the Untempered Schism, Gallifrey probably in a kind of a half bubble anyway stuck to the side of our time line which would mean that all of Gallifrey's past, present and future exists more or less in our past, and it all exists in our present, and it all exists in our future.

And, as zap283 points out, the Doctor can't break the cause of events between the two of them living their lives out and being buried where the doctor stands in the 20th century.

Except, he doesn't necessarily have to. 

When Amy reads that River broke her arm, the event is explicit and clear. We know River broke her arm, therefore River must break her arm. But we don't KNOW Amy and Rory were dead and buried there. Say the doctor went back to London, or the 1940's as the OP suggested, picked up Amy and Rory and took them home to the 21st century. All he'd need to do is get a couple of gravestones made and put them there. We don'tknow Amy and Rory died, we just know their names are on a pair of gravestones. I know it's a bit of a stretch, but what you see at a glance and what actually happens can be two entirely different things. What if the names were a coincidence? Two people who happened to have have the same names were buried there, but now Amy and Rory must die just because they happen to share those name? Again, I'm stretching, but there's an obvious flaw in the logic.

This kind of thing is done all the time in sci-fi (especially when it features time travel), and most of the time I'm happy to let it slide. But in this case, it really felt like a cop-out. It was the show's way of getting rid of Amy and Rory so it could move on to the shiny new companion.

In the UK we are slightly better protected legally as civil partnerships go further in the UK than in Ireland in terms of rights, but all of that will be moot within the next year when both countries will likely have gay marriage.

In Ireland we have had certain protections for longer e.g. Ireland brought in equal age of consent, employment equality laws and protection from being discriminated for services much earlier back in the 90s, but the UK has implemented all of this in recent years too.

Just seems to me that this map and list of 'percentages' seems to be based on an extremely specific set of criteria.

Most council blocks would be quite nice buildings, if only the leaking pipe on the outside was fixed instead of left to generate a wall of slime, the shabby concrete often just needs a damn good clean and lick of paint etc.

Tower blocks do have a cultural issue in that the tenants rarely have to take personal care of the communal areas, so have a certain disregard for them, which is why they cost a bit more to maintain.

Imagine you are someone who has lived their whole life knowing you've been born into the wrong body, trying to pretend that you accept your assigned gender, but really you just feel confused and isolated. You try and tell people how you feel but they find you freakish, they don't understand, you carry on hiding who you really are. You meet the love of your life and decide to marry, things seem better for a while but it's always there, niggling away, 'I'm living my life as a lie, this isn't my true gender'. You finally build up the courage to tell your spouse, 'I know this might be hard to understand, but I don't identify with my assigned gender. I'm transgender and I've tried to hide it but I'm tired, I don't want to hide it anymore, I want people to see me and accept me for the gender I really am'. Your spouse is amazing and understands. They still love you and know that your gender doesn't affect your love for them. You are the happiest you have ever been in your whole life. 

You start researching how you can legally change your sex. You find out that you have to legally divorce this amazing, incredible, supportive person before you can even think about a legal sex change. You have to break the bond that you personally found so important and undertake a process which, in it's essence and to every other couple, is a way of saying ""I don't love you anymore"". You feel like you have been kicked in the gut. Your government doesn't believe that you can be a transgender and continue to have a relationship with a person of the same sex. You've been let down and the rights you took as a given are going to be taken away. ""Well, whatever, you can get a civil partnership afterwards"" the government says. No big deal. Apart from breaking the news to your spouse, all the money you are going to be forced to spend on getting a legal divorce and then a civil partnership, and the fact that despite the dynamics of your relationship not changing whatsoever, you have to relinquish what you have become accustomed to for no real reason.

The media has it easy in this: when the opposition suggests something  that costs money, the media and opposing parties just need to shout and scream about how much it will cost. Instant public support because hey - we're all facing cuts, we can't spend any money. 

Where does that end? Will the country freeze up in fear of spending *anything* without being shouted at by someone? 

The UK is not a huge land mass and yet the time it takes to cross it via rail - and the condition of those rail services - are pathetic. Updating the system *would* be useful. The trick is to do it in such a way that maximizes how beneficial it would be. There's no sense in spending billions on a system that doesn't get used or that costs the earth to get on.

As a quick note, In brum and london at least, new street is ridiculously central and euston is pretty central too. manc picadilly seems central but I don't really know manc so idk how useful it actually is. I'll give you that stupid station half-way between derby and nottingham, that's just retarded.

Also, while I agree with you that there will be many towns/villages that won't be served by HS2, if it didn't, it wouldn't be HS2. It'd just be 2. The snow hill- &gt; marylebone line will still be open. The existing new street to euston will still be open. they'll still be running trains.

Also, while it'll probably be pricey, it's worth pointing out that unlike most of these train stations, a plane from london to birmingham will go from two places that are out of the way, and it'll take a lot longer when you factor in check-in and such. I was going from home (10 mins from gatwick) to newcastle, and trains and planes were comparable in time after factoring check-in etc. And that includes crossing london. If that's the case, how can you expect flying london-&gt;brum to ever be competitive?

And as one last note, though I'll admit I know nothing about the pricing points for these trips, I've gotta mention that railways aren't just a profit maker. They're investments. Better public transport drives economic growth. beeching didn't consider this when he shut down the railways in the 60s, and i'm worried that could happen again (on a limited scale of course)

You might as well complain that a season ticket to fly from London to Paris costs thousands of pounds.

Edit: Sorry, I retract that point, you're in Lincolnshire, clearly.

Still, the Humber Bridge (at the edge of Lincolnshire) makes an interesting case-study on the 'won't even be finished for decades' question. Apparently this is the schedule for its construction:

* 1930s - plans drawn up for consideration

* 1955 - plans revised

* 1959 - The Humber Bridge Act passed in parliament, but no funding forthcoming

* 1966 - Hull by-election, funds released as part of the campaign

Yes, the music is dreadful beyond all imagining - that's kind of the point (see this years [Romanian entry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pNEEb6dzi8) for a sneak peek - if you don't piss yourself laughing when it gets to the dubstep breakdown, then you may be beyond redemption).  But over the years, I have genuinely started to look forward to Eurovision more than pretty much any other TV event of the year - it's just so much fun to watch with a few friends and heartily take the piss out of all comers.

There's a view in this country that Eurovision is silly and cheesy and pointless and that we're slightly superior to all other European nations for not taking it seriously - ignoring the fact that no one else in Europe takes it seriously either, they just make a much bigger deal of it because they're not so scared of having a bit of campy fun!  I think the attitude in this country to Eurovision reminds me a bit of my time at Uni - being dragged out to cheese nights by friends and moping in the corner having a horrible time before going back home to listen to Mogwai, alone.

When you look at the hipster part funded by tesco chain of coffee places that have opened lately, with what appears great commercial success, it has to be acknowledged how much of an impact brand has on a business.  They have entered into a very crowded market, and so far, survived.  Yet a layman to the industry would probably consider their advertising/furnishing/branding costs far higher than needed.

Public opinion is often to laugh and mock the cost of a company's new logo/image, yet they are often the very people who are most swayed by it (because of their displayed ignorance for the cost benefits of branding, I would hypothesise that they will fall prey to it with a higher conversion rate than norm).",0,1368801980,null,0,false,0,ca0ls5e,t3_1efyxw,t1_ca0ls5e,t1_ca0jtku,null,1431126386,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If it didn't make up for the un-released funds they were used by the business for something, which may have resulted in growth but ultimately transferred it to some place where it created value.

&gt;a)

But how?  It would be interesting if there were any simple solutions, frankly I think VAT is one of the most effective, maybe we could look at fixing the tariff for that, france for instance is looking at having a special rate of VAT for TVs and Tables etc to help fund art programs.

I dislike the phrase no tax footprint.  They often have a large tax footprint, a huge one, VAT, rates, ni etc.  No CT isn't the same as no tax footprint.

I don't get the philosophy behind CT.  Companies are not people, the only way people profit by companies is thanks to their jobs (taxed) their benefits (taxed) and their divs (taxed).  In theory all it does is raise the price consumers pay (why not just VAT it) which is meant to be non-progressive as it isn't linked to earnings or necessity.  A company is a middle entity.

I suppose it's what you're looking for, how old are you if you don't mind me asking? 

I've lived in Bristol my whole life and i've been all over the place. I've done a few stints working at Aztec for various firms.

What I will say is that traffic is bad in all parts of the city but you`ll start to work out the best routes and the worst times pretty quickly, it isn't that bad. I commute from gloucester road to the MOD which although is shorter is more than manageable. 

I reckon choose the best place to live for you and don't worry about the commute, espescially if you're driving, buses are pretty rubs.

For me living in Bradley Stoke and working at Aztec would do me in, i'm sure loads of people are really happy there but it's just not for me, lots and lots of identical cul de sacs, no pubs, nothing to do, amenities sure but nothing actually to do.  

You'd be better off living somewhere with a bit more about it, I live in Bishopston which I love, i've also lived in Redland, Cotham, Clifton, Hotwells, Montpelier and St Andrews which all have loads of pros and cons.

For me I would say live on the Gloucester Road, it's a straight run to Aztec, yes traffic will suck but once you get home you will be in a good part of town with lots of great pubs, shops and restaurants.

PM me if you need any more info, sorry for the wall of text

You`ll love it ere mate

People say that a lot - but having looked over them they aren't particularly as far as I can see... though I will concede they are clearly a rightwards leaning party and as such attract a lot of people who ARE xenophobic or homophobic and like the party for the wrong reasons. 

They support the status quo on gay marriage... that isn't that suprising since a lot of conservatives do (and not just conservatives, but right wingers generally around the world). Whether that amounts to homophobia is another thing though. If you could afford the same oppourtunities (and legal protections) to gay couples (which UKIP advocate) then that dosent really amount to discrimination... and by extension isn't homophobia. It's just different insitutions of partnership. Personally I (like I suspect most &lt;50s do) don't have any issue with gay marriage what so ever... but while the UKIP policy is a bit ancient, I don't think its really homophobic.

Simiarly, on them being xenophobic that also seems to be stretching what they are slightly. Being anti-immigration does not mean they are necessarily xenophobic. I think even the most redoubt of us can accept these days that having to build a city the size of Newcastle every 3 years to accomodate the number of new arrivals we've had over the last decade is probably not a sustainable or sensible long term plan. There simply aren't the resources to accomodate the number of people that *want* to migrate to the UK. Unfortunately, pointing this out used to be the reserve of the BNP and National Front - and by extension now UKIP are talking about it (all be it from an entirely more reasonable angle) they to are associated with racism and xenophobia... but if you actually look at the policies they aren't intrinsically discriminatory. Infact, their views on acceptable migration are still fairly moderate compared to the Australians or USA.

In many respects their own blend of 'proud to be British' nationalism, traditional values and anti-EU/immigration policy could appeal to at least some Scots.

Having said that, even balancing for the fact England is 10 times more populous than Scotland, migration to England has been 6 times higher than it has to Scotland - so is likely to be more of an issue south of the border. Scotland also tends to recieve more EU funding than England does for a multitude of reasons so for that (and other reaons) the EU tends to be more popular north of the border.

So really I agree, I think UKIP have at best an outside chance of gaining much support in Scotland - but it isn't outside the realms of possibility. It's probably most unlikely because given the current devolved arrangement for Scotland it is difficult for Alex Salmond to put a foot wrong... as he has all the political benefits of being able to spend money without any of the drawbacks of having to raise it himself through taxation (which he can blame on Westminster). Hence why the SNP are such a 'goldenboy' party right now.

Totally valid reasons of not enjoying the Moffatt's seasons.  My biggest issue with Moffatt is that he seems to want ""ownership"" of his parts of Doctor Who - he rarely if ever mentions characters or events from Davies run and gave ""his"" doctor a new tardis and sonic and started with a new companion and invented new monsters with rare nods to Davies run in the process.  I personally prefer Moffatt's series to Davies, but I wish they felt a little more consistent.

As far as your specific concerns though, I guess I never felt that way. I feel like Moffatt diverted the story from ""Doctor focused"" with very companion heavy storylines with Amy and Rory, and brought back his recurring side characters frequently (See A Good Man Goes to War, and the recurring Strax/Jenny/Vastra storylines). Not to mention River.  Yes the Doctor has some ""grand"" large scale events, but those are against large scale enemies, so it's appropriate, and his team worked through them together.

I used to think this to - but having moved to an area of high immigration I now try to convince people that it generally isn't the case that people who are anti-immigration are xenophobic. Though it probably is the case that people who ARE xenophobic are voting UKIP... but for other reasons (that they incorrectly think UKIP agrees with them for the same reasons). 

Like anything in life, it's easy to dismiss other peoples concerns until one day those conerns become your own. I was going to write a big account of some of the issues immigration has raised where I live but to be honest, until you live with it, anything I say is likely to feel very alien and unimportant. But I would say immigration is a MASSIVE issue in England. At the last election it was absolutely the elephant in the room the whole time, and if felt like nobody was allowed to mention it... and that is probably why UKIP are experiencing such a surge at the moment, because for the first time people feel like they have a legitimate outlet for a genuine concern without being instantly written off as rascists.

I AM the taxpayer and I DID risk my own money - I bought shares at the very bottom of the market in both Lloyds Banking Group and RBS as I knew a good opportunity when I saw one.

Both businesses were fundamentally profitable and made paper losses over the last few years due to write downs over sovereign debt and PPI mis-selling.

Unlike most media commentators I've always kept the faith over the banking bailout and have been firmly of the opinion the HM Treasury will earn a nice little pay out when both banks are fully returned to private ownership and it looks like I'm going to be fully vindicated.

Unfortunately a great many people have been unable to tell the different between money spent acquiring shares, HM Treasury's potential *exposure* to so-called toxic assets and actual physical cash that was allegedly ""given"" to the banks.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"Just thought I'd give you an idea on transport, as it sounds like you won't be using a car. Your best bet is probably to use the train if you're commuting. The nearest station to St. Asaph is Rhyl, so you'd have to get a bus from there. I imagine there are buses from Prestatyn / Abergele too, but I've never had the pleasure of using Denbighshire's buses so I couldn't say for sure.

An off-peak return from Wrexham to Rhyl will set you back £17.20. You can get cheaper tickets if you book further in advance, but I imagine that isn't really an option if you're commuting daily. Journey time is a little under an hour.

http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/WRX/RHL/tomorrow/0900/dep/tomorrow/1700/dep

An anytime return (anytime will allow you to board any train you please) from Bangor will set you back £12.60 and journey time is 30 - 40 minutes.

http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/BNG/RHL/tomorrow/0900/dep/tomorrow/1700/dep

An anytime return from Llandudno will cost you £7.90 and will again take 30 - 40 minutes. You may be required to change trains in Llandudno Junction too (which is why I guess a journey from there takes as long as it does from Bangor).

http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/timesandfares/LLD/RHL/tomorrow/0900/dep/tomorrow/1700/dep

An anytime return between Colwyn Bay and Rhyl will cost £6.30 and take 10 - 15 minutes.

If you do end up using the trains and if you're under 25 I'd highly recommend getting a young persons' railcard - they cost £28 for a year but will save you a third of every rail fare so long as you make sure you bring it with you.

At best, it makes people aim towards the sort of short term goals that caused the problems at RBS in the fist place.

true,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,"How To Eradicate Masculinity: A Four Stage Plan

1. Turn traditional values upside down. Insist men are chauvinists, not chivalrous, for holding doors, standing when you enter the room, helping you with heavy baggaget etc. As feminism advances, remember to carve out independent fiefs with public money to ensure the next generation are as vociferous and litigious as their mothers. Even as University enrolment passes 60% female in some places, make sure the imaginary battle goes on and gets even more indignant.

2. Introduce a barrage of cultural items, films, events, tv, news that insist ""It's ok to cry"" and ""men should show their feelings more often"". Have several famously masculine actors in intensely emotional scenes where they bawl their eyes out. Normalise the shedding of tears over peanuts on a whopping scale. 

3. Expand product markets for conditioners, moisturisers, hair ""product"". Get a famous footballer or two to endorse. Ensure men spend at least as much time poncing about checking whether their outfit is coordinated and their hair ""perfect"" as women do.

4. Now most men are unquestionably selfish little tarts their grandfathers would disown at a glance, call the holdout remainder ""hyper masculine"" and treat as a if they had some kind of terrible disease. Cue social studies  to show boys that aren't subjected to ""prizes for everyone"" sports and playground games with no running or shouting are 30 years and a mustache away from Adolf Hitler.  Women and homosexuals now rule the day-to-day cultural agenda, men are now feminised (at least on the surface) and any dissenting views obviously have an undiagnosed mental disorder.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"Moffat has severely compromised her character by riddling her story with continuity errors and poor writing. He also featured her as the lynchpin of the assassination plot in series 6, which collapsed into complete and utter nonsense.

He's also tried to tell a love story while skipping over all the moments when the characters actually get to know each other. That could be considered a bold experiment, but in actual practice it hasn't worked smoothly. (Although the aforementioned continuity errors have probably exacerbated that.)

She also suffers from the fact that Moffat likes to write stories about time travel, but it turns out he's not actually very good at handling timey-wimey stuff. (This was surprising after ""Blink"", ""Girl in the Fireplace"", and ""Silence in the Library"", but it's nonetheless true.)

If you're trying to figure out what went wrong with River Song, I recommend taking a long, hard look at ""Let's Kill Hitler"". It's an OK episode with a lot of nice moments. But it also represents some of the most dramatically squandered opportunities I've ever seen: Failing to establish Mels as a childhood friend of Amy and Rory prior to this episode severely deflates the revelation of her ""true"" identity. On the flip-side, the story of the Doctor turning the psychotic Melody Pond into the wonderful River Song deserved more than a cheap, rushed gimmick.

This, ultimately, was the spine of River Song's character.

I reserved my copy Tuesday; picked it up Wednesday. I only actually got to start it last night, so I'll probably spend tonight finishing it off.

Saturday? I bought a Chicken this evening - I might cook it tomorrow - if not I'll pop it in the freezer and cook it next weekend. It's Doctor Who series finale in the evening, so despite how shockingly crap this ""season"" has been, I'll be watching that after it's broadcast, via iPlayer [I refuse to buy a TV licence].

Sunday? Pretty chilled day - I'll iron my work clothes, and will either start a new book, or catch up on some tv shows.

Chelsea and Everton have, over the season, been even on GA (38), so a draw looks to be a reasonable outcome, but Chelsea have an edge of about .5 goals in the GF category. If the die teeters, than falls in our favor, that .5 goal rounds up and we win. If only it was so simple :-)

Newcastle has conceded 3rd most goals in the league, and Arsenal have scored 3rd most, so Arsenal scoring 2-3 goals is definitely not unlikely. Arsenal are averaging 1 GA per game (2nd best in the league behind City), and Newcastle are at 12th best with 1.2 GF. Of course, keep in mind Demba Ba scored 13 of their 45 goals...but regardless, it isn't altogether unlikely that they score a goal.

Based on all that, I'll say that Arsenal will score between 0 &amp; 4 goals, Newcastle will score 0-2, Chelsea and Everton 0-3. That leaves 2 scenarios that play out correctly in the C/E game (0-0 and 1-1, a 12.5% chance) and 2 in the A/N game (2-1 and 3-2, a 13.3% chance). That yields 1.67% chance overall.

But let's assume that Rory really does die when the gravestone says he died. Even if that's true, the episode still requires that

(2) the Doctor can never talk to people who are destined to died at some point in their future.

This, of course, is also nonsense. Because absolutely everyone the Doctor has ever talked to is destined to die at some point in their future.

It doesn't help that the director screwed up the sequence (having Rory walk backwards to look at a random gravestone he has no reason to look at it instead of just following everyone else into the TARDIS; having an Angel touch him when Amy is looking right at it).

Sadly there's no middle ground between saddling the debts for the rest of your life, and bankruptcy which is an easy option.

You're a total fanny for racking up all that debt, but once you give up on things then it spirals and if you were depressed that's what'll happen.

Once the bankruptcy is over you can start saving, and 6 years after you should be able to have collected the deposit for a house, and you can use the whole thing as a stepping stone to get things sorted.

On the surface it may seem unfair that you get to write all the debt off and the only 'penalty' is no lending facilities for 6 years, but in reality the institutions that lent to you have not lent responsibly.

They are there to collect even a tiny fraction of the original debt and will try every tactic to scare/frighten/annoy you into paying SOMETHING. Just hang up straight away, don't worry about cutting them off mid spiel. They are used to it. Instead, you should get independent advice like you have already started doing via the Citizens Advice.

Make sure to use http://www.nationaldebtline.co.uk/ National Debt line and http://www.stepchange.org/ to get advice.
Both are legit and recommended by the government. Check out the government website on debt - https://www.gov.uk/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/individual-voluntary-arrangements

Of course not.

&gt;One of the smartest people I know is a muslim. Way smarter and more well read than me. She's read the Bible, the Koran, read about hinduism, socialism/other non religous belief systems. And made her choice.

Right, and that's a puzzle, why do intelligent people make irrational choices or hold irrational beliefs. Compartmentalisation is an interesting topic.

&gt;I don't have to agree with it but I can respect it.

I believe in the tooth fairy, do you respect that? Thought not. You might not make fun of it in my presence, but you're not going to respect it. Especially not if my tooth fairy is telling me I should kill people who don't believe in it and subjugate members of my species based on arbitrary differences.

&gt;It really indicates a lack of empathy with other people. You could easily say about me that with a lack of religion in my life growing up means I've been brainwashed into atheism.

Except that atheism is a default position, it's not a belief system it's just the absence of one. It would be like saying someone who was illiterate had been brainwashed into not writing.

&gt;Also, I don't know what belief system you think most muslims have but it's not a terrible nasty one.

That's because most of them are moderates who ignore the morally inconvenient parts of the koran, just as most modern christians are barely christian by comparison with the 14th century. I'm not saying all muslims are nasty, I'm saying that *islam* is nasty and that most muslims ignore those parts, like any good decent human being would do.

I'm not objecting to that. I'm just saying that those parts are there, and they're shitty, and islam is shitty. People ignoring the shitty parts that tell them to subjugate women, take slaves, execute those who won't convert and apostates, that's fine, that's great in fact. Nice not to be killed for not being muslim, I must say. That's why I don't hate muslims, because just like almost any other religious group of people, most of them are normal decent folk.

I can still hate the religion though, and I do.",0,1368816855,null,0,false,0,ca0r2mq,t3_1eij67,t1_ca0r2mq,t1_ca0qtsj,null,1431123820,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Tottenham are close to completing a deal for Barcelona striker David Villa, according to reports in Spain.

Late on Wednesday night, radio station Cadena Ser claimed the move was in the final stages of completion with both parties happy with the negotiations.

Villa has become disillusioned with the lack of first-team action he is getting with the La Liga champions as he plays second fiddle to Lionel Messi.

And Tottenham are desperate for more attacking prowess, with Gareth Bale shouldering much of the burden.

Villa came close to joining Spurs' bitter north London rivals Arsenal in the January transfer window only for the move to fall through.

But Villa has apparently spoken directly to Andre Villas-Boas and an agreement is said to be imminent.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm not sure its really 'core' policy... Given that UKIP are in the luxirous position of being a protest vote they have the liberty of stating anything as policy. Hence the extraordinary stuff about a return of fox hunting, grammar schools and O-levels, scrapping of devolution and just about every other controversial issue that has upset the rightside of the tory party over the past 30 years... it won't actually happen, even if by some astounding miracle they won they next election outright with a majority. Its rather like the LDs promising students they wouldn't raise tuitionf fees... its easy to say stuff when you're a protest vote with an outside chance of being in government.

But bottom line is, despite what they may say they're a protest vote and a single issue party (EU/immigration). They might take a fairly respectable share of the overall vote at the next election (maybe say ~10%), but they won't win enough votes in a regionalised enough way to actually translate those votes into (m)any seats. i.e. the margin by which people in Labour/LD/Cons win seats will be narrowed, but UKIP won't actually walk away with seats... so their bargaining position will be weak if not even non-existent. We won't see a UKIP-Anybody coalition... because UKIP won't be getting seats (unless there are some incredible changes in the political landscape between now and 2015).

So really, their real power as a party is actually now - prior to the next election. And by power what I really mean is an ability to influence conservative (and even labour/LD) policy. I think its fair to say none of this current EU referendum stuff would have been promised if it wasn't for the threat UKIP pose.

Probably the best-case-scenario for UKIP is that they displace the LDs into 4th place at the next general election, and walk away with perhaps ~25 seats (even that many would be mind blowing)... and then have a more serious platform on which to build for the ?2020 general election.",0,1368823058,null,0,1368823247,0,ca0t94k,t3_1eib9z,t1_ca0t94k,t1_ca0ozko,null,1431122792,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The primary problem which everyone can agree upon, I think, is that there simply hasn't been enough Doctor Who on television. Split up seasons are arguably a bad idea, but splitting up one season over *two years* surely wasn't a good thing. There's so much pressure on these remaining Series 7 episodes to perform and be epic blockbusters, they cannot afford to make regular, truely independent episodes anymore. Everything has to build up to the finale, to the 50th anniversary, to the inevitable regeneration. 

I strongly feel that the show needs to go back to 13 episodes in a row. And for my personal tastes, no more complicated half-explained timey wimey nonsense and mysteries wrapped in enigmas. Just.. adventures. Having thirteen episodes means that episode 7 is allowed to suck badly, episodes 3 and 4 be an amazing two-parter with well developed secondary characters, episode 10 be a story focussing on the companion, without any of these feeling like a distraction from the Main Arc.

So.. err.. yeah. I'm not sure Moffat has to leave. I think he should leave at the same time as Smith, though. Give the show to Gatiss or Whithouse (or Gaiman, but that's impossible) after that. Series 8 will be interesting, still.

true,MC_Turkster,cnty-england,England,"&gt;If you said that to any engineer or machinist, I'm pretty sure they'd laugh at you. 

I did an engineering course only 5 years ago and we exclusively used imperial. The metal we ordered was in imperial units, the machines were all in imperial and the instructions all gave imperial measurements so I find that unlikely.

&gt;I totally understand the emotional appeal of Triumph motorcycles and imperial units.

Possibly, but should it be illegal for a shop or business to use imperial if they want to? Why should they be forced to use metric? It’s incredibly frustrating when you ask to buy say, 6ft of something, and they will only tell you how much it is in meters.

&gt;I mean, let's say you're buying carrots, as you do every week for your pet bunnies, and the store offers a 1kg bag at £0.75p and a 3lb bag for £1. Which is cheaper? Can you imagine trying to work that out in your head standing in Tesco with the kids screaming and your car on a parking meter?

The simple solution is that large stores have to use both, considering that a large proportion of the public still only uses imperial (I myself try and only work in imperial as much as possible) it would make far more sense than the ridiculous situation we have now where we sell ‘pint’ sized milk but label it as 333ml or whatever it is.

&gt;I totally understand the nostalgia for imperial units, but it's not practical. It's like saying that armed police should carry longbows, because of the good old days.

It’s incredibly practice, when you ask for someone height they will tell you it in imperial, weight? Imperial again, how far the local shop is? It’s daft to scrape one of our most useful communication tools just because some EU bureaucrats don’t like it.

Yes, you end up ""blacklisted"", which is worth looking into itself. I was however able to get a cash card account. It simply means that you aren't able to get an overdraft, or any credit. This is a good thing, it means you start to live within your means, which is a very valuable life lesson.

The 6 years is a bit of a myth. You are still able to set up direct debits and standing orders with a cash account and this builds up your credit rating if you make sure that you've got the funds to cover them in your account.

There are people in this thread who are getting upset with you and think you should pay back what you owe. I disagree, you've fucked up, you admit that. Get yourself back on your feet, start with essentially a clean slate and don't have the debt praying on your mind.

There's present Amy, running around with The Doctor. And then there's future Amy, who publishes the book The Doctor is reading, written by a future version of River Song.

Future Amy and current Amy are the same person, at different points in their personal timelines.

Future River writes of past events and says something will be broken. Past Amy read this.

As such, past Amy reads about an experience of future Amy and future River. In order to not break her own personal timeline, this event now had to happen. Or there would be a paradox. The same timeline, yet different events. This is not possible.

The same thing happened with Rory. He saw himself die in his sickbed. If the events leading up to this never happen, that would mean it's no longer the same timeline. Rory knowingly creates the paradox. His personal timeline is now broken and such a thing can never be. So the universe fixes itself, which is something the 10th Doctor explained it can do, in the episode ""Turn Left"". After Dona escapes the alternate timeline, The Doctor explains that usually, the universe will work around it, but for Dona an entirely new universe as created.

Now, some people say it doesn't make sense that Rory goes back to check the gravestone. If you re-watch the material, you'll see the part where River and The Doctor are cleaning the TARDIS. Then Amy &amp; Rory come walking from a bit of a distance. They pass that gravestone and as camera's switch to the TARDIS and then back to Rory&amp;Amy, you can clearly see Rory was looking at it, but then turning his head to The Doctor to listen what he has to say. But he was definitely looking at it while walking past it.

So just they're off, he decides to take an actual good look and discovers it's his gravestone. So, it can only be him buried there. Which is basically a message from his future self. His past self now knows this will happen to his future self. And it happens because the Angel zaps him back in time.

Amy then chooses to undergo the same thing hoping to end up with Rory. The paradox they had created earlier prevented the TARDIS from going there directly. Unstable timezone and all that. If they go back for Rory now, even by taking the TARDIS somewhere else and going on foot, getting Rory back to the TARDIS and saving him that way, that once again means the timeline will differ. And the future point of that timeline is located in New York.

If the first paradox didn't trigger an explosion(as The Doctor indicates could have happened), the 2nd one certainly would.

So now that it's happened, Rory is stuck and the Doctor can't go after him, Amy chooses to chance it and let the Angel send her back as well.",0,1368828050,null,0,false,0,ca0uxrx,t3_1eiboo,t1_ca0uxrx,t3_1eiboo,null,1431121999,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It's really not even close in terms of club honors (trophies) between Scholes &amp; Becks and Carra, then Owen. Take a look:

Beckham also had a UEFA Club Player of the Year award and Owen a Ballon d'Or (which is really the only reason Owen is in the mix).

Beckham's numbers are amazing, and Scholes is close behind.

true,manosdelmuerto,river,River,"I have to agree with what you said about the Eleventh. For a 900+ year old time lord he could be very immature, and not in a way I enjoyed. That being said I feel that as the series continues, especially the later part of series 7, I liked him more because he was less childish and more of an eccentric geek, just a person who REALLY like certain things and sometimes got so involved in their love for them that they lost track of the world. It also didn't help that I really did not like Amy as the series continued. 

I would always advise a person start with New Who rather than Classic Who, as I know a lot of people who would find classic who to be too slow paced for their liking (not me personally.) 

It is nice to start with the Ninth Doctor as he and Rose and a wonderful dynamic and he was a wonderful Doctor, clearly traumatized by his recent war but determined to look at the wonder and beauty in the universe. The potential problem with starting with the ninth Doctor is that the episodes of New Who series one are Campy. While I personally love this about them, I have read other redditors complain about how campy it was. 

My personal Technique to get people into who is to start them with some solid episodes from the Tenth Doctor (my person favorite to use is Silence in The Library/Forest of The Dead/ Midnight and just watch all three in a row. As I have said in other threads, I avoid using blink as it does not always work, my mother who was a huge classic who fan decided new who wasn't for her after Watching blink as her first episode. My personal opinion is that the reason most of us love Blink is because it very different from the rest of the episodes.

But I digress, I would either start straight away with the ninth doctor, or switch to him after a few 'teaser episodes'. His series rebooted the show for a reason, he was a damned good Doctor. 

I have been watching through classic who a bit, but have not seen enough to say things on all doctors, but the few I have opinions on are 

The First Doctor- he was every grandfatherly. A wonderful combination of kind and crotchety. Even when he was being a jerk I found him endearing.

The Third Doctor- I like the description others have used, he was the James bond of doctors. He was full of action and even used physical violence once in a while. His name is Doctor, The Doctor.

The Fourth Doctor- I did not like him at first as I thought him to be callous. As I saw more of him I liked him more and more as he had a weird charm about him. I like your description of him being a combination of a pirate and a scientist.

The Ninth Doctor- I really liked him. It was clear that he was suffering some PTSD from the Time War, but he was still looking to find the beauty and the wonder in the universe. Most of the time he was happy and slightly goofy, which contrasted wonderfully with his more serious moments like when he met the Dalek in Dalek.

The Tenth Doctor- My personal favorite. Very witty and foxy. A clever devil who was always willing to start a verbal sparring session. He was a scientist who looked at the world and tried to find the reasons why, but was also willing to accept the beauty. 

The Eleventh Doctor- See above. Too childish at times, but  I have liked him more in the recent episodes. Especially in Nightmare in Silver. ",0,1368830987,null,0,false,0,ca0vv5x,t3_1ejdjt,t1_ca0vv5x,t3_1ejdjt,null,1431121562,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Also maybe Davros is onto something when he calls 10th's companions the 'childeren of time' and compares the 'doctors' children to his own? 

I also remember one episode where the Doctor speaks a bit whistfully of humanitys future and a time when humans encounter some other species..

£39 x 12 = £468    
Adding on the £159 for the phone, that's £627. Take off £440 gives £187 for the year, or about £15.60 per month for 300min, unlmtd texts, 250MB.

Alternatively, buy the phone from that site and spend, say, £12 a month at giffgaff and you get 250min, unlimited texts, unlimited data.

He builds these huge, giant twists that go on at the end of seasons, or on specials. I feel like it diminishes the quality of the episodes. Like... I just think he focuses more on the season as a whole having one shocking twist, instead of excellent episodes with really good stories.

That's why I think I enjoy almost every episode that Moffat writes. He's got amazing talent when it comes to single episodes that he himself writes, but as a showrunner I absolutely *hate* him. With a **passion**. It's that bad.

Granted, I still like the show, but it's gone from me watching re-runs a few times a week, just because I enjoy the show that much, to me being an entire month behind because it's lost its charm to me.

I know this is my opinion, and I completely understand if people all around love the guy. Just my opinion. If most people like it this way, then he should stay. But to me... It's just a different show entirely at this point. Not the charming, cheerful, hopeful Doctor Who that Russel T. Davies ran.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I didn't argue with that, but the human body is built for a stoneage animal. We are supposed to eat more than we need at the moment so that we can survive for longer if we don't have food at that moment, so therefore it's natural for humans to eat more than they need, which then would cause weight gain. Off course this is normaly not healthy for the stoneage human body living in modern society, but we are sentient and can restrict ourselves. Also some food tastes really good. If we didn't have to restrict ourselves to live more healthily, we would eat more. It's simple. Maybe you are at a fast food resturant and had cravings for a big burger but bought a small salad because it's much healthier. A big burger is in this example made up of much more resources than the small salad. If we didn't have to restrict ourselves for our own health, we would be more likely to get the big burger. We would have to make more food if everyone on Adipose ordered the big menu, and that would hurt the planet, and make a even bigger difference in global food distribution. You may argue that we would restrict ourselves in order to help the planet and the starving people, but the Adipose wouldn't like that, would they? In order to keep new Adipose being born they would have to: 


A) Transform entire bodies into Adipose. 


B) Somehow influence people to eat more. 


C) Solve the food problem. This alternative may look good, but we have no idea how advanced the Adipose are. We know they have access to interstellar travel and mass anti-grav beams. But that doesn't mean they have a good solution to this food problem. 


The only symbiotic relationship the Adipose could likely have with humans would be to let fat people lose their fat in exchange for the Adipose getting new family members. The humans may get something small (compared to Adipose tech) in addition to this. But I wouldn't trust the Adipose with my life, and such trade may be against the Shadow Proclamation.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"I'm in the same boat as you OP.  I actually think that sometimes fans abroad can be more devoted, as a rule, since they have to work so much harder to discover, follow, and learn about the club.  Honestly, there were a few times in HS that I got stick for being a football fan and not giving much of a shit about most American sports.  Didn't matter much as it was never from anyone important, but that is an example of what it can be like.

If I had to guess, it's the fact that the club is so tied into the identity of what it is to be scouse.  Football was so important to cities like Liverpool and Manchester because they had a large influx of immigrant populations that tried to assimilate to become ""locals.""  Through a shared passion for football, they could partially do that.  I love that Liverpudlians are scouse, not English, and that they have redefined culture in what is truly a global city.  As a result, Liverpool FC is a global club.  But still, the scousers are the heart of LFC, and they are part of why I fell in love with the club.

I do find it funny that somehow Barca got ""more than a club"" as their motto.

A few theories I've seen relate this well with Clara, and I think this will be answered tomorrow.

Also how did Clara become a Dalek? (""Asylum of the Daleks"")

Why is the Doctor's name so important? (Moffat asked this question all the way back with 10 in ""The Girl in the Fireplace""). There must be a reason why he is being so secretive about it. Whatever reason, it's going to be big after all this buildup. 

Why does the TARDIS not like Clara? Moffat has repeatedly made this apparent and there must be a reason why.

There are many others, but I think those are the important ones and will most likely be answered tomorrow in a way that ties a lot of the open questions about the show together. There are many possible answers, and the one that Moffat chooses will be brilliant.

A victory in the group pays €200,000 and a draw €100,000. 

Also, each group winner earns €400,000 and each runner-up €200,000. Reaching the knock-out stage triggers additional bonuses: €200,000 for the round of 32, €350,000 for the round of 16, €450,000 for the quarter-finals and €1 million for the semi-finals. The losing finalists receive €2.5 million and the champions get €5 million""


For comparison, the Champions league:  ""A win in the group is awarded €1 million and a draw is worth €500,000. In addition, UEFA pays teams reaching the first knockout round €3.5 million, each quarter-finalist €3.9 million, €4.9 million for each semi-finalist, €6.5 million for the runners-up and €10.5 million for the winners"" with the €8.6 base for participating in group stage.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"I live in south central London and I haven't really heard of 'sharia zones'. I am aware that in some areas of the country with Muslim populations if a person breaches Islamic law but not UK law then, provided the accused and the victim both agree then the rules of sharia law can be used to sort out the disagreement. If UK law is broken UK law will obviously operate and be superior or if either party does not agree then no such 'trial' can go ahead and any coercion used may be a breach of UK law. It's equivalent to a contractual negotiation. There's no crime/wrong and so the law has no reason to get involved. If people want to submit to it then fine, they agree among themselves what should happen. If sharia law is broken no English court will hear the case. Even so I've never seen one or heard of one in real life only a mention in the newspaper years ago. AFAIK they are very very rare and only a thing amongst close-knit family groups that are very pious. 

I am aware though that Anjem Choudrey and his scummy, genetically deficient friends will have people in different cities put up stickers and posters saying 'Sharia zone'. They have no legal effect at all and exist only to annoy and intimidate. It's like Choudrey saying 'I'm going to become Prime Minister today', declaring himself so; it has about the same meaning and effect (i.e none). That was mainly in Luton and some other places though not particularly London. Everyone in the UK knows Choudrey is a benefit scrounging lunatic with no concept of reality and we all ignore him but I have a feeling the people in /r/worldnews didn't get the memo and have been taking him seriously. That's my theory anyway.

One of the supermarket guys is doing a masters at London University (Queen Mary I think). The guys at the kebab shop has got to be one of the nicest guy I've met in a long time. I've had too little change several time and he's let me off every time. I must owe him like 3 or 4 quid in change but he's never asked for it back. I don't know what 'revert' means. I'm guessing it means convert or something. I've never had anyone even mention their religion to me even the guy at the kebab shop who I talk to a fair bit. I only know because his friend once came in and said 'As-salamu alaykum' which means 'peace be with you'. Standard greeting among Muslim people. 

There's a mosque round the corner from me, or at least it's a small shitty house with Arabic writing on the front where people congregate every now and again so I'm assuming it is. Never had any trouble and I can't really imagine what trouble I might get, most of the Muslim men that go there are like 60 and are about as rowdy as a Eucharist. The people who are rowdy are the drunk, half dressed chubby white girls who stumble out of the singular night club in the area drunk as fuck at 3 in the morning and yell so loud the whole neighbourhood wakes up.

That being said, there really isn't any specific order to Classic Who.  Classic Who is grouped in serials, composed of two to twelve twenty minute episodes.  Each serial serves as a standalone, with a few exceptions (the Key to Time arc, the Black Guardian trilogy and Trial of a Time Lord.)  Wikipedia has a long list of Classic Who episodes in chronological order-just pick one of them that looks interesting and put it on!

As for where you can find them, a lot of Classic Who episodes are uploaded onto dailymotion by the users matrixarchive and tardismedia.  The quality ranges from 'really good' to 'filmed from a VHS copy' but at least they're there.  Aside from that, if you're an American, you can access some Classic Who on Netflix.  Finally, you can always buy the DVDs.  You can order Classic Who DVDs from Amazon, or you can browse around your local film store/nerd specialty shop to see if they have any there.

Finishing seems to be Ade and Jermain's weak suit this year, and Villa's capable of some great strikes and would adapt well to the more creative midfield we've put together. (I know he's associated w/ Tiki-Taka Barca-ball but he was successful in different systems too). Dunno what number he'd pick, but a Spurs kit with DAVID VILLA on the back would also do wonders for the brand outside of the UK (here in the USA even my little cousins whose parents dont let them watch much TV know him).

But if we have to pay more than 10million pounds then I'm a little hesitant. 31 is past the age when most players peter out, and he'll still command big wages since he's got superstar brand name status. The more guys we have not on the wage structure, the harder it is to keep paying the young guns less. He's had some pretty severe injuries in the last few years. And yeah, he's played out of position but he's been less of a factor in the more competitive games for Barca from what I've seen this year.

So rationally speaking, he might be very overvalued, but if Levy can do his thing and knock his price down to around 10milion, he might be a very productive new weapon for 2 seasons or so. And fun in a ""YOLO sorta way.""

So, due to their cooperative attitude relative to Madrid players, I don't see the same happening if the Special One returns.

That idea was what was cool. How it played out has nothing short of disappointing.

Also, I was expecting to see River revert her character from a smug know-it-all to someone less confident learning about the universe. Just like how the Doctor learned to open the Tardis with the snap of his fingers, he should grow as River reverts.

One thing that I think some of the people in that thread don't get, though, is that for many -- in fact most -- Americans there *is* no hometown team. In the UK there's pretty much a team everywhere, so I can see looking down on people from outside the city cheering for a city's club: why don't you just support your own club? But of course that logic doesn't hold in the US. 

Personally, I live about a 7 hour drive from the nearest MLS team. So is that my ""hometown club""? In UK terms, that's like somebody from Glasgow saying Spurs or Arsenal is their hometown club. Up here, there is no hometown club, so of fucking course I support a team that isn't from where I'm from, because where I'm from there is no pro team. Shit, there's not even a fucking *adult rec league* up here, let alone a pro or semi-pro club.

Edit:

Okay, there's not much and some of it's dubiously sourced.  Enoch Powell allegedly claimed that the CIA were involved in some way with Mountbatten's and Neave's murders.  However, the source for this (a Guardian article from 9th Jan 1984) isn't available online, so there's only Lobster magazine (which is conspiracy central).

[&lt;&lt;'The Mountbatten murder was a high-level 'job' not unconnected with the nuclear strategy of the United States"" (Guardian 9th January 1984), the belief being that US policy is directed towards ensuring that Ireland can be used for strategic defence purposes within NATO. Powell presented no evidence, but drew attention to the subsequent Anglo-Irish summit meeting in October 1979, at which he claims a secret agreement was reached which governed subsequent policy, the objective being that the Irish Republic abandon its military neutrality and join NATO.&gt;&gt;](http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/lobster/lobster04.pdf)

In the Flannery trial, [he and his co-defendants were acquitted because the jury accepted it was possible he believed he was working for the CIA when using IRA money to buy guns](http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0114/anor1.html/%28page%29/3).",0,1368840352,null,0,1368847633,0,ca0yfyz,t3_1ein84,t1_ca0yfyz,t1_ca0uu79,null,1431120276,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Also, Sky aren't going to pursue you if you leave the country.  The worst thing that would happen if you stop paying the bill is that they would suspend and eventually cancel the services.  They would start sending letters in your name to the address telling you about the debt.

While this would be one option for stopping payment of the contract, it could cause problems for whoever moves into the property after you when they try to take over the telephone line.  Sky would refuse to provide the services again until the outstanding debt is paid off.  I don't think this would be a problem if the next tenants went with somebody else, but I'm not sure.  Sky may refuse to allow another company to take over the line if it is still under contract from them, which may leave the new tenants stranded for broadband.  If the next tenants do have problems due to your debt to Sky blocking the line, then I doubt the landlord would be very happy with you and try to pursue you to get you to pay Sky, but again, I doubt there would be very much he could actually do.

You could always do the responsible thing and pay for the remainder of the contract you agreed to take out in the first place.  You must have known in advance how long you'd be spending in the UK.  Why enter into a contract if you know you're going to be leaving the country before the contract finishes?

These differences were highlighted the other day, when many fans were suggesting that we retire 23 and 8 when Carra and Gerrard go.

I also don't exactly like her personality at times, though I obviously find her cute and there are plenty of times where I think she is alright on the show... She gives off that ""one of the guys."" vibe, where she seems as though she is trying to be like the doctor... it REALLY REALLY bothers me... ""Look look! I can be quirky too!!!!"" 

I also noticed, only starting in 7b that the show has that British TV feeling again, like the first couple seasons had. It catches me off guard every single time I see it. It was actually almost the reason I didn't watch the show, I couldn't stand the way the show was shot.

But more than anything, It's just a little boring I think, mainly Clara, and seeing as how we are trying to build up to something about her, it makes it all a bit boring. I feel like everything has been filler so far, everything.. I really don't like that.

Edit: After reading a couple more comments, I just wanted to say that I agree with The Doctor not having a real dilemma. He should have something that is eating at him, but it should do more than what we have here with him and Clara. We see these bits of him going a little over the top, like he is driven mad by not understanding what's going on, but we don't really feel that. It doesn't have that same internal struggle that we are so used to seeing, it's eating at him because he doesn't know, but it ends there, there is hardly any moral or emotional connection there..

I would probably have to sit down with a few people who have been watching to show to really hash out my feelings, but this is the best I can put into words at the moment.

personally, i began supporting LFC because they were owned by Hicks. As a Rangers fan, i knew what kind of horrible life that was, so i commiserated and became a fan (though i think Hicks screwed the reds over far more than he did the Rangers)

all in all though, we're all great fans i think, we love the club because it means something to us and we live and die with its successes. but being an actual scouser is probably a different state of mind that i'll never understand. not that it makes me or y'all scousers better or worse fans, just fans with different experiences.

You complain because you care. ""real fans."" if you will, can feel when something is off, and just because say, you can just ignore changes in the show that make it feel wrong to other people, doesn't mean people are being extreme.

There are obviously people who go nutty, but not many.

I personally have felt like something has been off since 7b started. My gut reaction is that it's boring and I don't know why. Every episode feels like filler, and the big picture, Clara, is extremely weak as a real dilemma for the doctor. 

I really don't think it's fair to always call people complaining about their favorite shows ""bitching."" It always seems like when a community finds something wrong in their show that they are looked at as fiends or something, as if they can't find something wrong with the show and express it without it being bitching or over the top.

Just look at the storyline and development of River Song.

We know Jenny can regenerate like a time-lord. 
We know Jenny is basically a time-lord.

Clara does ""Stuff"" that only a time-lord can (Read the language of gallifrey).
Theres also the rumours going around about Clara being present and ""saving"" every doctor in existence in the 50th Anniversary.

The only downside to this theory is that the scanner said she was ""Human"" but they can get around that by having her turning human. (Per Tennant and his Fob Watch/Master and his Fob Watch)

TBH, im just really curious how its going to go.
All the rumours going around is interesting, CAL/Jenny/Granddaughter etc etc.

Edit: Also, i was just watching Warrior (Completely off the subject of Doctor Who) but then something popped up in my mind from something i remember watching ages ago. In ""The Doctors Daughter"", the one quote i remember is made by Donna who says ""She's just a girl"".
Then, i thought, that same exact quote was made in ""Hide"" (I think it was hide) and when asked what she was, the Psychic also said ""Shes just a girl"".
I realise im grasping at straws but im up at 5:30Am for something and im realising ive got another 14 hours till i find out has me just making up so many theories. ¬¬

true,thepancakebreakfast,lfc68,,"2005 Champions League Final made me both do a complete 180 on my opinion of the game and become a Liverpool fan. The passion is the same everywhere and is a common thread through all sports that I enjoy but it is definitely most apparent in my love of LFC and Auburn. The only denomination of sports that is in the same universe of intensity and has the similar level of tight knit community as the football is American college football (specifically the SEC). This certainly allows for a better understanding of what it would be like to be a LFC supporter from Merseyside since I went to Auburn and went to American football games there and drunkenly experienced both heartbreak and sheer joy. As I said I would consider SEC football to be about as close as an American could get to the experience of the Premier League on this side of the Atlantic. The only thing missing is numbers. LFC supporters or even Americans interested in football are definitely quite scarce. It makes us enjoy discussing the game with supporters of all different clubs (usually Chelski, Arsenal, or United) simply because it allows us to converse in the language that we love, that we unfortunately are rarely privileged to use.

true,asdfghjklemons,EN,england,"Add into this all money earned through extra ticket sales, extra merchandise sold, matchday income etc.

Let's say we sell a ticket on average for £50. Bridge has a 41,837 capacity. We'll round overall ticket sales down to 40,000 for the maths. This will bring us in £2,000,000 in ticket revenue per match.

We played 7 home games this season in Europe, so just from all those games, we're looking at an income of £14,000,000. Just from ticket sales. Obviously I've not included any stats for season tickets etc, but I would assume matchday income will have a rough estimate of how much of the income is from season tickets in the books. 

Hell, then let's say 15,000 spectators buy a burger and beer at half-time, costing them £5. That's £75,000 per game. £525,000 in the whole of the European run. 

So just from playing in Europe, before we've even received money from UEFA, we've made approx £14,500,000. From 7 games. 

As a heads up, this is all estimates and maths, I've not included any expenditure so obviously this isn't a net total.

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"I agree about the split seasons.  With split seasons there's much more pressure on each episode to fit into that half's ""theme.""  No room for variation, and little room for two-parters(which I feel are very important; they allow us a sense of continuity without forcing the entire season to revolve around them).  Like you said, bad episodes are amplified, and weirdo episodes which might otherwise be a charming side-story(Rings of Akhetan, for example) simply become frustrating.

I don't entirely agree about story-arcs, though.  I've really enjoyed seasons 5 and 6 and how so many episodes worked into the season-wide plot.   The RTD era was great as well, with the way most episodes were independent but with a small Easter Egg pointing towards the finale and season's ""bad guy.""(the key was the fact they were hidden; meaning we weren't tapping our toes in season 4 waiting for an episode to expound more on missing bees or planets)   Both formats work, imo, when done well. 

The problem with season 7(especially 7b) is that it seems really confused about what it wants to be.   On one hand, it was decided to feature entirely independent adventures with absolutely no two-parters and little development upon the main arc throughout the entire season.   On the other hand, it's also introduced a few HUGE plot points(Clara, Great Intelligence, the Doctor's name...) and made them an integral part of the show while also doing nothing with them.

In order to make the adventures independent, though, there's been very little development of the whole Clara question.  The Great Intelligence has also just vanished from the scene.   As a result, pretty much every episode of season 7b has felt like filler.  They get into a rushed(even by Doctor Who standards) adventure, and for about 5 minutes at the end or beginning the Doctor wonders about Clara.  It reminds me of how in Dragonball Z you'd have one episode the pushed the plot along for every two that were nothing but fighting.

It's neither RTD's weaving together of hidden background elements into a season-wide arc, nor Moffat's previous ""so insanely complex it actually kinda works"" story arc.   It's just the story arc...kinda sitting there...doing stuff...taking up about 5 minutes of each episode with no real development....

And now we're going to learn who Clara is, SOMETHING about the Doctor's name, and how the hell the Great Intelligence fits into all this in one episode.   Not even a two parter.   All because it's just sort of been sitting there.   It's a mess of storytelling, even if I still enjoy the individual episodes.

It was damaged and looked a little raggedy but my assumption is that it used some timey wimey regeneration power to make itself look a little cleaner. 

The Doctor Donna started to tell The Doctor how to fix the Chameleon Circuit but she then started to overload.

Other Time Lords (and Idris, possessed by the TARDIS) had mentioned that it was extremely old.

That's disgusting on two accounts, one assuming that they believe that Hillsborough deserved to happen because of Heysel or two that they believe that they have to garner attention from a tradegy. I don't get it at all. As long as I've supported the club I've known of both disasters. I may not have fully comprehended them but they are both parts of the club unfortunately. People campaign about Hillsborough because the police tried to cover up the deaths of 96 fans. The outrage is because they value their careers more than the lives of the people they serve. They abused a position of power to cover up their mistake which cost 96 people their lives (and ruined far more). Heysel isn't a pretty chapter in our history. Football games weren't friendly and things went too far. I don't believe anyone intended to kill anyone else that night but what happened is due to some Liverpool fans. It wasn't murder, but it was manslaughter. People were punished but in this case it is difficult to find out who were the offenders. 

Hillsborough needed the campaigning for the truth to come out. Heysel had no such cover up. Heysel, as tragic as it is, has not suffered the disrespect of those that died at Hillsborough. They did not have their names dragged through the mud to suit those in a position of power.

Compared to the nice little things like Troughton's recorder and the infamous jelly babies that can be placed subtly into the scene without feeling like there's been some huge effort to fit them in, or the way that Tennant's catchphrases more naturally evolved from lines written into an episode that turned out to work particularly well and were therefore repeated (""Allons-y"", I'm looking at you), it just feels (to me anyway) like there's been some desperate drive to give Smith a whole load of quirks and catchphrases that don't gel as easily with the scenes as previous Doctors', which is why I think they're more noticeable. ""Geronimo"", for example, you could tell from the beginning someone had gone 'I want the 11th Doctor to have a catchphrase and I want it to be geronimo!' but I never thought it sounded as natural as 'allons-y' and 'would you like a jelly baby?'; I didn't like that it was there just to be a catchphrase with no further reasoning or development behind it.

This is getting long, sorry. Of course I'm not saying all Smith's quirks have been like that - I actually felt like the whole fez thing has fitted quite nicely with the story, though I have to agree with firex726 that - for me anyway - the whole ""I [verb] a [x] now. [x]s are cool."" repetition feels a bit old. Again, it's the created-to-be-a-catchphrase thing that gets on my nerves. I don't know, that's probably a much more subjective thing than I'm trying to present it as...

In terms of Timey-Wimey, as others have said - yes it was a Tennant thing, but it's Smith's era where it's really become a recurrent joke and spread to other phrases, which is I think what firex726 was getting at.

Yes, there is that instinct...but when food is plentiful, it goes away.  We have also adapted and evolved.

They talk a bit about this kind of thing in a documentary by the BBC with a sort of rude name--[Why are thin people not fat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeeFrcvt3KA).  It's actually kind of amazing the way everyone's bodies react differently.  But the point here is, these thin people they were doing their study on didn't even put on that much weight, and then they lost it soon after the study, why?  Because they were pre-programmed to be their usual weight and, more than anything, your body wants homeostasis.  These people were eating far more than they were capable of eating, and many of them literally couldn't handle it.

If we were able to eat *anything we wanted*, in *any amount*, forever, then yes, we might eat more at the beginning.  But that wouldn't last for long.

If the BBC wanted to get rid of Moffat, they would have, it's as simple as that. They are not under pressure by shareholders or executives like people would assume, they answer only to themselves.

If the future of the show was up in the air given the build up and attention the BBC are giving the 50th anniversary, do you think Moffat and Smith would have confirmed that they are doing series 8 at the end of the year?

Let's consider this for one moment. Doctor Who right now is an internationally acclaimed show, it rakes it in heck of a lot of money for the BBC and it creates stars. People are even desperate to appear on the show, Dame Diana Rigg and her daughter appeared on screen for the first time together recently on this very show. John Hurt and Richard E. Grant, two internationally recognised actors, have clambered over themselves to get roles on the show. Does that sound like a show that is having problems?

What writers have been dumped at the last minute? If he had an issue with other writers, why would he bring in the legendary Neil Gaiman to write 2 episodes? Would he have brought in the awesome Neil Cross?! What an absurd thing.

When a doctor regenerates mid-season, it hurts them more. Hell, to this day people say that ""Troughton never quite looked like he was grown enough into the first doctor's outfit""(anglophenia) and the twin dilemma, a perfectly fine story(i mean, I'd give it at least a 6 or 7 of 10) is remembered as a terrible story(and the 6th doctor never recovered despite having a few really good stories like ""vengeance on varos"").

I think shouting _can_ be violence, when it's deliberately calculated to put someone in fear of physical damage i.e. threatening - ""Give me your fucking wallet or I'm going to stab you"" is a clear assault in my book, it also turns theft into robbery.  Indeed, even a bump and steal pickpocket can be convicted of robbery because the law is sadly often an ass.  So, I'd say genuinely threatening words and behaviour, are violent.  Shouting someone down and calling them scum for their views is not violent - it may be rude, even intimidating, but it's not violent.  It may make people of less than average firmness fearful, it may even be possible to convict shouters if you can find a jury of such Milquetoast people, but still, none of that makes it violent.
