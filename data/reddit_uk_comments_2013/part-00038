And besides the fact that /r/doctorwho does not allow posting of illegal downloads, Big Finish is a small company who loses over half of their profits to people illegally downloading. I pay for everything I get from them. I may have started by just getting them off the net, but I bought each one back. I know that they're expensive and that not everybody has the money, but it's not like you have to buy their entire run. Just a few stories. Like Dark Eyes.

It's not so bad. 35 USD for the whole season for digital download. It could be worse. The 4th season of the EDAs is 80 USD. (Luckily I got it at 40 USD because there's a special sale going on atm; so actually this is also your chance to get the first four seasons at reduced prices).

Over time these families no longer had to fight to be nobles but simply needed to be born into a life of privilege. The young men of the class came to be seen as effete upper class twits like Bertie Wooster. So the names also became associated with effete twits.

There's always been some muddle in the Arthurian legends, Arthur of course is an old English name, which became a peasant common name after the Norman Conquest. Lancelot is a French name but he's French in the legends too so that makes sense.

As for Percival his name changes depending on the audience that was being written for. In welsh legends he is Peredur, a welshman with a welsh name.

It's much more important to have a tactical system that suits your players, and to play with organization, focus and solidarity. This requires a certain culture and continuity that does not seem to exist at Chelsea FC. We seem to be signing the right type of players but this orchestra has had no proper director since Carlo. I'm not advocating we sack Rafa now but damnit Roman this summer may be your last chance to pick wisely before we do a Liverpool. I'm not for or against any specific individual but rather a critical change in how the club approaches the institution of manager. Top teams fade for different reasons but I personally believe that is the missing piece of our puzzle. I encourage everyone to read the [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1cticos#Perceived_failure) article about the failures of Real Madrid's Galacticos, it seems like the most appropriate, recent and familiar example.

Finally, one last peeve is how Roman manages to escape criticism time and again from those who matter most, the fans. If the media are to be believed he is the one who directly hired Rafa, fired RDM/AVB/Carlo/Jose, chased Pep for ever, etc. I know he is the daddy of our success (so spare me the details), but he also must take responsibility for many of our problems.

Edit: I'm just writing out some thoughts in the context of the article posted. Of course I will stay positive and continue to back the club. =) ",0,1361862419,null,0,1361862964,0,c8lurwg,t3_198fvz,t1_c8lurwg,t1_c8ltvfy,null,1431413692,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

And the closest thing Martha ever said about Rose was ""Oh, she was blond was she?"" when the Doctor was talking about it with Jack in the series 3 finale. Otherwise, everything else she said was just ""bummer he doesn't like me the way I like him"".

Drama queen is a gross exaggeration. Again, the Doctor is the one who did all those other things that were extremely emotional and dramatic.

&gt;That's the problem, she wasn't particularly interested in consoling him.

Um, what? It's not Martha's job to console the Doctor and make him feel better. And she was always interested in talking to him about himself. She had to force him to tell her about Gallifrey. She sat down a chair at the end of Gridlock and put her foot down. And she didn't stray from talking about Rose. When the Doctor mentioned Rose she never changed the subject. And she never said anything nasty about Rose. She'd wait until the Doctor was out of earshot and go, ""man, if only he felt the same about me"".

Which is a lot nicer than what the Doctor did: he kept mentioning Rose right in front of her when he was supposed to be showing her the universe, never mind romance.

Furthermore, Martha never pushed the Doctor. Sure, she wished he loved her. But she never said it to his face because he was still in love with Rose and because, like you said, the Doctor told Martha he wasn't interested. Martha respected that and never put the Doctor into an awkward obligatory situation.

If it had been prophecised that you were going to die, you'd be pretty emotional too.

That was an isolated incident for which he paid the price. That was the second last serial of his regeneration and not even relevant.

&gt; falls in love with Reinette despite seemingly being in a relationship with Rose

When did he fall in love with Reinette? She kissed him and professed her fleeting love for him, and he certainly liked her but you can't expect me to believe that he fell in love with her. And at which point was he ever in a relationship with Rose? Besides, she brought Mickey along.

&gt; He throws a fit at the End of Time.

Because he loses so much, and this scenario was a kick in the pants. Somebody he cared about ended up being the accidental reason for his end.

&gt; Bawls his eyes out more times in the series than Martha does. He has good reasons for doing all these things and he gets a pass for it.

Exactly.

He took her to one planet, in a different time and city.
___
&gt; the closest thing Martha ever said about Rose was ""Oh, she was blond was she?""

Here's an excerpt from Gridlock:

&gt; **MARTHA**

&gt; When you say ""last time"", was that you and Rose?

&gt; **THE DOCTOR**

&gt; Um – yeah.  Yeah, it was, yeah.

&gt; **MARTHA**

&gt; You're taking me to the same planets that you took her?

&gt; **THE DOCTOR**

&gt; What's wrong with that?

&gt; **MARTHA** (this gets to her)

&gt; Nothing. Just – ever heard the word ""rebound""?

___

&gt; Nobody likes a drama queen

This is a figure of speech not meant to be taken literally. My point here is still valid.
___
&gt; the Doctor is the one who did all those other things that were extremely emotional and dramatic

In front of Martha? When was that? The Doctor was never a drama queen.
___
&gt; she was always interested in talking to him about himself. She had to force him to tell her about Gallifrey.

The Face of Boe had just mentioned that He was the last of his kind right in front of Martha. She was nosey and pushy.
___
&gt; When the Doctor mentioned Rose she never changed the subject.

She never usually had the chance, The Doctor would move on pretty quickly here.
___
&gt; It's not Martha's job to console the Doctor and make him feel better.

No, it's not. But if she's interested in him romantically, it's not a bad idea to maybe help him through his loss in any way she can without making him uncomfortable.
___
&gt; And she never said anything nasty about Rose.

I never said she said anything nasty about her.
___
&gt; She'd wait until the Doctor was out of earshot

See point 2.
___
&gt; Which is a lot nicer than what the Doctor did: he kept mentioning Rose right in front of her when he was supposed to be showing her the universe, never mind romance.

He continued to throw hints at Martha that he wasn't interested, but she continued to comment on her own jealousy.
___
&gt; Furthermore, Martha never pushed the Doctor.

See point 5.
___
&gt; She never said [that she loved him] to his face because he was still in love with Rose and because he told Martha he wasn't interested. Martha respected that and never put the Doctor into an awkward obligatory situation. She just dealt with her problems alone.

Man Utd have been a top team for almost 20 years, and a lot of that is due to Fergie buying/cultivating a young team at the start that lasted a long time. When you have stability you make it easier to find success. The problem with Spurs in the same time period is that we've had too little stability. Every time you change a player you've got to hope that the new one is better and that he gels quickly.

Our big problem at the moment is up front. Defoe isn't good enough and Adebayor is just an embarrassment. We need a proven striker, preferably one from another PL team.

The problem I have is some weeks it looks all joga bonito and other weeks it looks like pushing a boulder up a hill.

You could see a plan in action yes teams figured it out but it gave us at least some direction. Under RDM (yes him) and Rafa it still looks a bit, all just put the players on the park and hope a goal comes from it.

I also ask this, do they have coaches for specific areas in football.

I largely agree with the sentiments in the article: anyone who comes in has to deal with the above, just like Rafa is (and failing - something which the writer didn't point out).

true,sdpaton14,num23,,"Wow. Okay. I think holtbys short stint in this football team has shown the creative ways that we have missed van der vaart so much. I disagree that VDV was just a great finisher. He has sublime vision, and passing ability to match it with the best in the world. He is not the fastest or the fittest, and I will grant you that he did seem to go missing a little from time to time, but we had modric pulling the strings so it was never a really bad loss if he did go AWOL for half a game here and there. This season, without modric's creative ability (dembele as a replacement is excellent, and probably superior to modric in a number of other areas, that are equally if not more important to avb's formation), spurs lack of VDV type player has been extremely frustrating. Dempsey has highlighted that he is not that guy, but could be great if used properly off the bench, as you suggested. Siggy, I hope, will be that guy in the future, but hasn't had a long run of starts to get really well settled in the XI. Holtby came in, and within 15 minutes of his first start, showed tottenham what it has missed the rest of this season. He is still a work in progress. And hopefully nowhere near his sky high potential. The one thing that seems to have impressed tottenham fans is holtby's work rate. It seems second to none, from a player playing a position often labelled the ""lazy forward/midfielder"". He is constantly working back, and constantly hassling defenders and deep midfielders, enough to capture the hearts of north London. One thing that always surprised me about VDV was his statistical work rate. I'm a fat lazy slob, so I won't look up the stats, but feel free too, if you wish. VDV very often placed in the top 3/4 players on the pitch - game to game - for distance travelled, the sort of work rate that Holtby has mimicked recently. It was something that seemed to go very unnoticed for VDV, and something that I really only started to notice at euro 2012 (where he was the only player in a team of world class players to perform). VDV never stopped jogging. Never walked between set pieces, or when he was way off the ball. He jogged everywhere, constantly moving, forcing defenders etc to constantly watch him, and his positioning. Maybe because of this you think he was poorly positioned, IMHO, Redknapp was inept not as a manager, but as a coach in correctly defining/teaching VDVs position, a mistake that would not be made by AVB. I know I'm ranting, hardcore, so ill stop the VDV love, I will admit I fucking love the man, so maybe I'm out of line with this ridiculous post, but I have tried to be fair in argument.

That was absolutely devastating to local businesses and many town centers ended up ghost towns. Even though my town was a seaside resort in East Yorkshire, because many of the visitors were from areas with coal mines in, when they shut the amount of money coming into the town during summer nosedived. Even though the nearest coal pit was over 60 miles away the effect was devastating. The seasonal work people relied on dried up, businesses closed. Even in the mid 2000's the area was still suffering the effects so much it qualified for EU economic assistance.

You say it sounded like it was a horrible industry but those who worked within it loved it.

We're angry in the north because all the industries which provided very high levels of employment and very good wages disappeared and nothing replaced them with government seemingly not giving a shit because we're 250 miles or more away from London. Those areas have gone from being quite affluent to being poverty stricken with high levels of unemployment and minimum wage jobs. In Newcastle where most people were miners, steel workers, ship builders and engineers on good money, the biggest employer a few years ago was the public sector with &gt;50% of the workforce working in the public sector most in low paid jobs. 

Want to know what it'd be like? Imagine what would happen with everyone working in The City suddenly ending up on the dole and staying there for half a decade. How long before shops closed? How hard would it be to find work? How would the income from the work they could find, which would be minimum wage, compare to what they were getting?",0,1361877787,null,0,1361878437,0,c8lwo07,t3_196ohg,t1_c8lwo07,t3_196ohg,null,1431414587,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"I think it's a very strange way to deal with the problem. Really, we want to legislate and regulate banks so they aren't taking excessive risks.

If a bank is legitimately earning money at no cost to the state and no risk to the consumer then there's no reason to limit their ability to pay their employees in relation to how much they're bringing in. If employee x consistently brings in £3m/year and his bonus is capped at £200k, you're going to find some way to compensate him or fear him leaving for somebody else who will. Caps would simply be making compensation more complex and harder to track.

Conversely if the bank is still ""too big to fail"" with poor risk management, their employees will still make risky decisions based on that distorted risk/reward situation. Likewise, if they're under taxed relative to other industries their profits will still be too large. Finally, if we decide the wealthy are earning too much, that should be fixed with tax rates that affect everyone.

Capping bonuses would do little to remedy any of this - there's an argument that bankers take risks for personal gain, but it's just as much an actively instilled corporate culture. Further, at present those risks make economic sense for the bank because states will subsidise them if they go horribly wrong.

Stupid bonuses are a symptom, not a cause. It's possibly a temporary solution for state supported banks, but then you just risk losing their top employees.

In addition a number of the public (if they are genuinely interested in this) need to understand the difference between Part A and Part B services. The NHS of which falls under the Part B category. 
Because health services are termed Part B, the regulations that they must adhere to are of a lesser stringency. 
Furthermore there are financial thresholds which must be crossed before competitive tendering takes place (~£139k).

And Martha shouldn't be bummed out that the Doctor doesn't like her? She doesn't let it get in her way.

Then you cite a bunch of reasons why the Doctor had good reason to be emotional. Except that I never said he didn't have a good reason. I was pointing out a double standard: Martha and the Doctor both have good reasons for having emotional moments but Martha doesn't get cut slack.

&gt;Since when is a whinge ever worth anything?

Ouch. Basically it seems like you either a) don't think Martha's feelings were as important as the Doctor's or b) don't think her problems are big enough for her to say a few things about it during her run. Clearly you just have no sympathy for Martha. So there's not really anything to disagree on. It was always a matter of opinion anyways.

edit:

&gt;but you can't expect me to believe that he fell in love with her. And at which point was he ever in a relationship with Rose? Besides, she brought Mickey along.

Woah, are we even watching the same show? I'm just going to back away slowly now. You don't think the thing Rose had with 9 carried over into 10's era? She pretty much strung Mickey along all that time while she was clearly more in love with the Doctor. You could tell because she didn't even want Mickey to come along.

&gt;She kissed him and professed her fleeting love for him

Her fleeting love since her childhood? I totally think the Doctor fell in love with her. Did you see his face when he realized he was too late to see her again? Mickey saw it, because he had Rose show him more of the TARDIS, just so they could leave 10 alone. If the Doctor didn't love Reinette, what was with his silent putting-away of the letter she had written him. Why did he wait to open it in the TARDIS when he could've just opened it there and then? He didn't open it there and then because he was heart broken.

true,forabreathitarry,null,null,"This isn't an easy problem to tackle to be honest. I don't really know if I agree with Viazu's point about the more noticeable members of the UK dota community. I think he's saying something negative about 'Danny and Rime' and unfortunately I have no idea who Rime is. Danny on the other hand is almost certainly 'Danny Woodhouse' or 'Ignite12345' as I knew him in CoD4. He was a notorious cheater and general idiot and no one with an IQ above 45 found him to be less than creepy. He may have changed since then, but not to a point where he should be representing a *relatively* significant organisation (for UKdota at least). He has always drastically inflated his own skill and potential and consistently made an ass of himself. Vanq tells me that they're in contact with a new team though so maybe he's out of that role.

But that's what happens, the most vocal and confident members of a community will rise to view quicker than others. I don't think it really hurts the scene though, every scene has assholes. The problem with the UK community at the moment is that it's simply *TOO SMALL*. This subreddit demonstrates that perfectly, it's absolutely tiny. 3-400 subscribers? That's such a tiny number of people considering the total number of UK players. And where else are people meant to go to interact with the community? I haven't seen anywhere that serves as an adequate platform for discussion and meeting new players etc.

So, what can we do to encourage growth? Lots of little things. A weekly tournament would be good, does that exist? If so where do I locate information about it? The 1on1 tournament that is currently going on is good and Rabbit is doing a good job of keeping information about it clearly visible to everyone. But there's obviously not many people watching it (correct me if I'm wrong). So, get people involved. Make teams. Encourage friends to engage in some friendly competitive games. The weekly tournament will help with this no end even if it's just for bragging rights and decent competitive practice. Make sure it's clearly advertised and tell every UK player you know about it. Cash prizes are easy to do as well, just consider asking every participating team to donate £5-10. Even with as few as 8-16 teams that's still a bit of incentive.

If all this is already being done please do call me on it, but my experience with the UK dota scene is that it starts out feeling a little tough to penetrate. And then you suddenly realise that the reason you can't find anything is that there's hardly anything there. The LAN in Kettering was in a reasonably accessible location and it was eminently affordable...but like 6 teams showed up and while they probably had a super time, it's indicative of a community that is really lacking in active gamers.

So I suppose the checklist is thus:

* Organise a weekly UKdota tournament with perhaps a minor cash prize to incentivise. Make sure you organise them for a night of the week that people are likely to be able to play. Mid-week is generally a little risky but can be bearable. Friday/Saturday should be avoided at all costs. Sunday is probably your best bet, BO1 all the way through I would recommend but there should be a vote of some kind on that one. BO3 all the way through would likely take too long.

* Encourage every UK player you know to sort themselves out a team and participate.

* Encourage every UK player you know to start using forums. Either this subreddit or the UKdota website that I think I located once upon a time. You need to start generating discussion and hype about different things. Be it tournaments, players, particular games. Check out the NAdota.com forums and you'll see a vibrant community. A vibrant community covered in shit but still an active one in which people get to know each other.

As an industry, it's extremely easy in banking to determine how much income an individual has earned for the company in a given year. It's also an extremely volatile industry. Consequently, there are number of advantages to bonuses:-

* It gives employees a direct incentive to perform their best
* It allows you to downgrade their pay in a bad year without a lot of red tape and legal restrictions - this is important because banking can vary so much year on year, particularly for smaller banks or departments
* As above, banking is pretty volatile - so it would be very bad to have high fixed costs: you'd get a big profit one year and a big loss the next. Through bonuses, some of that volatility is passed on to employees instead of shareholders.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I would imagine that there is little chance that City would part with Dzeko, and if they were willing his price would be out of our range, remember City paid something like £26.5m for him and i would guess they would still want north of £24m for him at the moment. Then you have to figure his wages would be above our wage structure and i don't see City subsidizing a second striker's wages for us.

Carroll would at least be affordable, the FSG seems resigned to taking a loss on him and he doesn't seem to fit Rodgers system so they are likely looking to move him but like it or not Liverpool views themselves as a team that will contend for CL so selling a striker that would strengthen a perceived rival could be a tough sell.

I would like to think we would be in looking at someone like Wilfried Bony who has been fantastic this season over in the Eredivisie, is a big physical presence in the box, has a solid shot on him and sounds like he would be in the price range we would be willing to afford (£9-£12m).

I would also think we will hear Abaumeyang, Aspas, Benteke, Hooper and (why god why) Damiao again. Abaumeyang would be a fantastic signing but apparently Levy has pissed him off and he holds it against the entire organization now.  I would really rather not get Gary Hooper as i don't think he adds anything to our current attack, Aspas would be a great signing but i have seen both Swansea and Chelsea in rumors for him so i wonder what his affordability actually is same goes for Benteke,  and as for Damiao...can we please move on from him.

I actually think we will see another couple names pop into the mix that showed up in the last window, neither one got a great deal of attention but both sound like Levy signings,  Ádám Szalai and Éder.

Ádám Szalai is a big bastard who fights in the box and has been hitting in goals for Mainz at about 1 every 1.6 - 1.8 games this season. He would be cheap (I have seen him rumored in the £4-£6 range) and affordable.  Not my first choice (more like my 8th choice) by any stretch of the imagination but has a Levy move written all over him.

Éder is a big Portuguese striker playing for Braga. He played for AVB when they were at Académica and has for a couple seasons been one of the guys that Portugal has been hoping would rise up and take over for Hélder Postiga (though personally i think Nelson Olivera is likely to be that player). Hitting at about 1 goal every 2 games he is also likely to be on the affordable (£4m -£9m) side and is usually spoken about as a guy with loads of potential that can be coached up.

Many people like to talk about ""vocal minorities"" or ""every group has fanatics in it"", but they never stop to think that the ""stupid"" messages these people carry out are not often their original thought. 

So, how did the message get from individual A to individual B in the subset that is the vocal minority? Who carried that message? Why was the chain from A to B not cut off because some people said: ""That's fucking stupid?"" Remember that social pressure or being part of the group is very important in some circles, and that we must conclude that vocal minority is often just the tip of the iceberg. 

The ideas or motives behind some messages shouted out that we attribute to a select few people need support in the social circle of those select few people for them to be able to receive that message, and to confidently broadcast it.

1) Formation of 4-1-3-2 will work better with Torres/Hazard acting as a deep lying forward. Mata/Oscar/Marin/Ramires/Moses/Bertrand/Lampard can handle the 3 spot in midfield. Mikel/Luiz can share responsibility for CDM position. Ofcourse, Ba or torres will have to do double time acting as main striker, while we wait for lukaku to come back. This will actually work best for our play style of a holding striker. 

2) Rafa knows clearly why he is here. Should he really care then? he knows he won't get any fan to like him, nor will he ever get extension. So, if he secretly thinks that he should just get it over with, I won't feel bad. Sacking him right now, will be a problem, so see it happening as soon as summer break starts. 

3)No comments. He does not deserve a place at chelsea, nor will he actually bother to care about. Best course of action is to stick with him till May, and relieving him of his duties right after the last match.

'Special allowances' depend on special behaviour from other road users, most drivers have enough problems coping with one set of rules, if you expect them to anticipate your actions when you ride according to another set, you are courageously optimistic.

A lot of cyclists do ride 'by thier own rules' and are therefore less predictable to other road users. 

Yes a cyclist is more likly to be injured in a collision, the trick is to not have collisions. Many drivers manage this, quite a lot of cyclists do as well. 

I have held a driving license for 33 years and have never had a collision at speed. I have shunted into stationary objects at sub walking speeds twice.

I have been riding a bike for longer and never been in collision with a motor vehicle, 

I have once hit a pedestrian, I came off much worse than him, it was entirley predictable and I should of been more alert and riding slower.  He was J walking, but thats what peds do, expect it, cope with it.

If you want a business to perform in a certain way, you should make that behaviour profitable. Capping bonuses will just cause businesses to find new ways to preserve the status quo.

As for why it's motivating - yes, in an ideal world being overweight would be enough to make you lose it.

Meanwhile, everybody who is renting is getting sick of paying their landlords mortgage whilst trying to save their deposit at rock bottom interest rates (say 0% + an account fee - after all, the bank now has to take on risk just for holding your money).

But some of what you say is absolutely spot on. 1, 3 and 4 ? dead right, no argument, possibly with the exception of modification, as there is the possibility of severe damage with a screw up. I'm open to arguments on that one, though. I suspect that 5 might be a touch impractical, as it would imply that you would have to hold large properties as well as first time ones. Easy to modify though. My worry is that it may work against your intent to decouple the housing market from being seen as a sensible place to invest cash, driving up prices by artificially restricting supply, and by imposing a long care and maintenance period before sale to more buyers is possible. 6 is pretty much linked to 5 in this.

7 is an interesting one. See, we pay higher VAT on materials for home improvements than on new homes, if I have my facts right, which makes ongoing maintenance of housing stock disproportionately expensive. Rather than encouraging new build, I believe we should reverse this and encourage maintenance and renovation. Barring the law of unintended consequences, this would hopefully work to counter urban decay, make for more pleasant communities (maybe), through improved publicly viewable areas, make it easier for folks to stay in their homes when cash is tight, make it less likely for housing stock to remain derelict, and make it easier for first time buyers to get on the ladder with something tatty to renovate. Probably not all of those, the law of unintended consequences is a bitch. 

Lastly, 2. Private landlords are one of the groups that we love to demonise currently. In my mind, this is a touch unconstructive. Certainly some are lousy, and it is all too easy to take advantage of a renter when you have the whip hand. But they do provide a service, one that is necessary, and actually we have a historically low proportion of homes in rental, albeit not at the high points we have reached recently. But equally there are landlords who are decent- mine is one, who tends to buy older, tattier properties and renovate them, which is of benefit to the area. As to preventing amateur landlords, everyone has to start somewhere, and I simply don't think that raising the barriers to entry to a business that can have a benefit to the social fabric is a good way to go. Rather, lets make sure the business is a benefit to society - and your other points definitely work towards that.

His finishing has just been so bad, and that's kind of the whole point of a striker, and that's what this team really lacks at the moment. And there have been times where he's disappeared or has seemed worthless or disinterested. But I also think he's had a lot of games where I've noticed him all over the pitch tracking back and pressuring on defense and stuff that I don't see him get credit for.

Same sort of thing with Dempsey...he's not the most skilled, but he has been working quite hard and really can get himself into the right place at the right time for some garbage put-in, and that shit is valuable. 

Same sort of things with Defoe, he can be a great finisher if he's got the space but he goes on cold streaks and he's not very good with the rest of his game.

I think none of the guys we've got playing striker/quasi-striker are what the team really needs. We're trying to fit a square, triangle, and star shaped peg into a round hole, but every single team in the world has that sort of situation.

You won't die without them and internet access can always be found for free. 

&gt;  Also, while your breakdown of that £17k adds up quite nicely, you overlook the fact that children need clothes and shoes. These can certainly be obtained cheaply but very rarely for free. You also fail to budget for things like travel to and from work/school. And what happens to that nice neat budget of yours when your fridge packs in without warning?

A family of four which I quoted for would have more than £17k total income. Even if the parents were unemployed they'd get most of the rent and council tax paid, get £7600 in child tax credits and child benefit and another £5200 or so in JSA so a total of probably around £20k at the least. 

A family living on £17k with no help with council tax or rent is probably only going to be 3 people at most so the costings go down.

That isn't the cash cow you think it is - see below.

&gt;  If you own your house you don't have to pay rent. Mortgage payments eventually stop, but rent doesn't. And in many cases mortgage payments are lower than rent.

By the time I've paid the mortgage I'll be 65. If I were renting, by the time I was 65 and retired, I'd get the rent paid for me through housing benefit so I'd be no better or worse off. Mortgage payments may be lower than rent but the home owner has to foot all the repair bills. This year I had a leaking flat roof and the cost of fixing that came out of my own pocket. If I were renting it is the landlords problem.

&gt;  You can sit on non-residential land until you eventually get planning permission to build houses on it, then rake in your fortune.

You wouldn't believe how many people have thought the same only to find it never happened.

Socialists don't want your property, they want only the property they themselves bring into existence, the product of their labour. If you made it you get to keep it, if I did, I do. If your partner or kids or friends or a bunch of strangers you call employees helped you make it, then they also have a right to it.

It should be noted that I thought that every part of that trial was bullshit, from being charged in the first place, to the obscenely long sentences handed down by a judge who must have taken leave of his senses. However, it is a useful example in this case.

In 1980 a 1.3L petrol car did 30MPG. In 2012 a 1.3L petrol car does 50+MPG. 

It cost me £900 in 2010 to light and heat a small 2 bed mid terrace house that used a 1984 Baxi Bermuda gas boiler and had 3 radiators. I moved to a 3 bedroom house twice the size with an A rated condensing boiler, 7 radiators, a towel rail and energy saving bulbs throughout and it cost me £900 in 2011. 

Council tax in my area has been frozen for nearly 3 years. My car insurance has remained roughly the same for half a decade even though the value of my car has risen and its been a newer car.

What annoys me is that they only seem to do so when we're talking about the wages of their rich friends.

That being said: those who call for banker's bonuses to be capped, consider this simple little bit of maths.

 - A banker earns £200,000 in a year; with a potential £200,000 bonus.
 - Bonuses are treated as income, the same as monthly salary.
 - The marginal tax rate on a £200k salary is 45% I.T + 1% employees national insurance.
 - In addition the employer pays 13.8% national insurance.
 - If the bank pays the banker a bonus of 200k; the government receives (`200000*0.46 + 200000*0.138` =)  £119,600
 - All employee pay is treated as a company expense and reduces profit.
 - Corporation tax is levied at 22% on profit.
 - If the bank does not pay the banker a bonus, that money will be taxed as profit, so the government would receive (`200000*0.22`=) £44,000 (that's 63% less for the government, and hence a higher tax bill for the rest of us).

If your goal is to punish rich people, then you should cap bankers bonuses, and be aware that you are paying through the nose to perform that punishment.  If your goal is to increase tax revenues from those rich people as much as possible, then you should scream for more bonuses to be paid.

true,W_LothianAnswer,eng-somerset,Somerset,"10 years is long term for most people. I understand that the soil is gradually being depleted and that the expansion into the rainforests is extremely unsustainable, this is why it is necessary to encourage responsible and sustainable farming techniques in order to preserve the soil sturcture we already have. EU funded schemes such as set-aside land aim to do exactly this.

Regarding potatoes; I meant this simply as an example of crop rotation in the UK. Root crops are often not grown in the same field twice without a break crop such as wheat or barley. I understand that Legumes such as peas and beans are better for the soil but they do not grow well in some areas.

I was indeed thinking of reducing the use of pesticides when I mentioned GM. But eventually, GM technology could be used to reduce the damage done to the soil by agriculture though the use of the Nitrogen fixing bacteria. Yes it is going to be a long way off but it is being researched and is surely worth a try.

Distribution is indeed the main problem right now, but with a rapidly growing population and increased demand for meat products from an emerging middle class, arguing that food production should be scaled down could be risky.

I think that my main point is; don't blame farmers for all the problems. In the UK, most farmers are extremely consious of the environment, and do indeed care about it.

6 teams turned up, why?
We'd just had a LAN the month before, Infs were in pieces after losing two players and the other respectable teams can't afford to shell out money for an event like that. 

Does everyone forget we've just come out of a recession and student debt is at an all time high?

We're currently aiming to have two tournaments per month, one fun, one serious and on the alternating month one fun, one amateur.

We aim for quality over quantity.

Comparing us with NADota is a bit ridiculous as it encompasses two countries, one of which has half of the United Kingdoms total population.

There's lot to do and we're working on stuff.

Regarding Danny D, you can give him whatever excuses you like - I am perfectly willing to countenance the idea that he suffers from some sort of mental disorder. But he is also the person that I know was a consistent cheater in a game that I used to love, who provided cheats to other players; one of whom was removed from iseries for cheating in a LAN semi-final which he had reached by cheating his ass off throughout the tournament. That shit isn't cool.

In my mind, he and the rest of his rat friends from that game were scum and likely continue to be. I could be wrong, he could have grown up a lot or changed or just been roped in with a bad crowd in that game and is actually just a decent bloke with a few issues. Whatever, I'm not his friend and have never sought after information about him. But I don't have a lot of sympathy.

He can always come off the bench and use his speed against tired legs.

Recently, we seem to be much less reliant on width and pace.  With Bale wandering around we really aren't spreading teams, and defenses have been playing to minimize our space to run.  Due to this, I think Gylfi should play in Lennon's place.

true,Brodiaq,null,null,"Agreed on pretty much everything. 

Parker did seem a little over eager at times, definitely a little too ambitious with some of his dribbles and runs forward, but I can forgive that since for stretches of time our players weren't doing too hot moving the ball between them and he was just trying to make something happen, even if it ended up being a little bit on the wasteful side at times. 

In general we did a pretty good job defensively, I thought AVB's personnel decisions were spot on, we didn't give them too much in the air in our box and Caulker could have easily of had a hat-trick. Super Jan looked decent going forward and was eager. But there were times where the defense got a little sloppy and West Ham's second goal was just a massive lapse in concentration. 

Holtby didn't look particularly good or bad, but I think that'll change soon enough. He tried to play a lot of one touch give and go's and you could tell the rest of our players weren't quite ready for it. Hopefully that gels together shortly. When Siggy came on he revitalized the attack with some of his shots and energy. 

If Siggy and Holtby both develop similarly it'll be interesting to see how AVB decides to utilize them. Between those two and Dempsey(who should be back in a week or two) we have three players who all play similar roles differently and can be exciting to see how we can engineer our line-up once they all get better established. Not to mention they all can play out left, out right, in the center, and we know Dempsey and Siggy and lead the line in a pinch, so we might end up with a ridiculously fluid attack. But that is in the future and not really related to this game, just very excited with the possibilities. 

I'm pretty upset with Adebayor. He started poor but got better. He held up the ball well and had some very decent passes. He seemed lazy early on but you could tell he got into it more as the match went on. My problem is we should be expecting more after his performances last year and the money we dropped for him. 3 goals is not enough for a striker of his ability, he has had way too many good chances squandered by poor finishing. If he is gonna lead the line we need him to finish some of these chances. He does everything so well, except for the finishing. Still a positive influence for us for sure, just frustrating to watch at times. 

Worryingly we never really looked to be dominating the match til the end where we were all over them, but before that I thought we seemed a little disjointed. It seems worse than it was considering their keeper saved just about everything and made something like 6 amazing saves. This game could have easily been a 5 goal win even with our attack not being the well oiled machine we all want. Though that seems like all our games recently, us kinda just pulling the win out at the last moment from some Bale brilliance. Hopefully we start dominating games the way we know we can. 

The NLD is gonna be a big game and I can't wait to see our boys give them hell.

The problem here is its easy to point the blame, much more difficult to retract it. If someone if falsely identified, the damage has already been done.

Whilst I'm not defending the actions of the two individuals - they have served their time, become adults, and deemed by the system to be fit to re-enter society, that decision should be respected. If they were not safe to be turned loose, they would still be in prison.

There is a lot of hatred towards them, and maybe its justified, but i ask you to think of your own childhood - was there an occasion where you would have done things differently had you known better?

I believe this case was a failing of parenting as much as anything else, and so as adults, are these two in a position to see their wrongdoing?

I'm saying that that's not true, it's just unfortunate phrasing. She asks 'Haven't you run before?"" in reference to this particular half marathon, as in, ""Haven't you run [this half marathon] before?"". Mo knows this is what she means and answers the question in that fashion.

The other piece of evidence is 'why would she assume he was a plucky amateur who had never run before?' - it's very possible that no one told her she was interviewing an Olympian, and so she just thought she was interviewing the winner of a local half marathon - that's what the interview sounded like.

However, yes, he's looked a little off-pace for the past few games, though it still having his best season so far.  Perhaps he is just a bit tired at the moment, having played pretty much every game?  Perhaps this is just a slight lull in form?

However, there are two other factors that have coincided with his drop in form:  

Firstly, Bale has been playing more freely over the past two months or so.  When Bale hugs the left touchline this creates space for Lennon as defences are either more stretched or they cheat to the left to try to shut Bale out.

Secondly, Lennon and Defoe have always linked up well and the loss of the latter has also affected the type of space Lennon has.  When defences are playing a striker like Adebayor, who is more static and doesn't play so much on the shoulder of the last defender, defences can play tighter and steal space, again.  

Of course, even when not freely attacking, I personally think Lennon is one of the best wingers in the game for tracking back and helping out his full-back.  Always an asset!",0,1361917810,null,0,false,0,c8m7vpi,t3_199o6y,t1_c8m7vpi,t3_199o6y,null,1431419978,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Given that this is a right afforded to every legitimate citizen of EU member states, there's a massive pool of potential employees that employers can hire from.

You could possibly look to find a job with a large company that has offices in the UK, and look for a transfer. 

Honestly, though? If you haven't got some kind of highly sought after skill or profession, you're really not likely to find one.

Also, there's new immigration rules regarding minimum income for people wishing to live here.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Those are some interesting thoughts - I think anything would have to be considered very carefully to make sure it didn't have the reverse effect. For example, even tightening up rental conditions could have the adverse effect of suddenly crippling the supply of rental properties (as amateur landlords bail out and sell up).

What digs me, is that if you've paid off your mortgage there is nothing to stop you raising substantial capital against your house - any using it to buy up 2-3 rental homes. Not only does that deprive a youngster from buying a house - but it also makes them indentured to the landlord as if they want a roof, they have no choice but to rent. Then with relatively little day-to-day effort, those tenants pay down the mortgage AND give the landlord a monthly stipend to live off.

An idea i'm interested in is a sort of 'companies house' of landlords. Perhaps to be a landlord you would need to be a registered Ltd. buisness. Any bad practice and you could be banned from renting - in much the same way you can be banned from being a company director, or struck off as a nurse or doctor. It would flat out be against the law to rent property over 3 months duration, in any fashion, without being registered.

It would also open up the system to taxation, for example rental properties would have to pay a special tax - rather like corporation tax, since after all they are supposedly operating as a profit making buisness.

Obviously this has to be carefully balanced, so as to prevent landlords just passing on costs to tenants. Essentially what I'm saying is I think landlords profit margins are too high - so either rent needs to come down or tax needs to eat into that profit and then redistribute it back through schemes targetted at first time buyers.

An interesting alternative is a rental price cap, perhaps based on the area and number of rooms in a rental property. I hear this works well elsewhere in Europe. Of course it might be harder to pull off in the UK where the size and quality of housing vary vastly even door to door on the same street.

I certainly like the long term idea of not just renovating post-war estates but physically tearing them down. Unfortunately they were built rapidly with little real consideration to planning, to re-house people made homeless by the war or returning from overseas. Of course materials/machinerys was limited so the construction methods were poor - and a lot fo the people doing the work were unskilled workers given jobs after being discharged. Where I live (in the South East) I'm told the local public health authority have identified post-war housing as the worst quality housing in the area. The 1850s - 1920s properties are fine, because they were large townhouses constructed with care and good materials, and have been kept in a good state of repair.

I'm not sure about the north but the majority of the southern cities I live near like Southampton, Porsmouth, Fareham, Gosport, Slough, Brighton, Hastings have some truly unforgivable post-war estates where residents have a terrible quality of life. Tearing them down and rebuilding proper modern accomodation - maybe in the 3 story model would be a godsend.",0,1361919239,null,0,1361919868,0,c8m8e7j,t3_194le1,t1_c8m8e7j,t1_c8lyeg7,null,1431420227,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Mirallas and Pienaar both played really well, which was encouraging as I don't think either of them have been near their best lately. Coleman looked solid defensively, so I'm glad he's progressing in that part of his game. Grandma Neville in midfield added nothing yet again, and I don't know how we conceded such a straightforward goal from a set piece. Fine, the guy's huge, but at least try and mark him - he's still just a League One player (and not even a starter for his team, at that).

I'm officially worried about Jelavic now. For a while now, we've at least been able to say he's been contributing to the team across the pitch, but I thought he was all-around poor tonight. I can understand a player falling out of goalscoring form but Jelly can't even control the ball any more, and watching him fail to get anything on Osman's goal was genuinely quite depressing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"If Rose returned there would officially be no justice in the universe. In this hypothetical reality where *Rose Tyler* -- the girl who neither waited, nor grew, nor died, or even had to go without -- somehow suddenly reappeared with that bright indulgent smile of hers, a smile typically worn by spoiled children, I would lose my mind (in the bad way.) 

The ONLY loss Rose has ever experienced was being trapped in an alternate universe, unable to reach the doctor as she lives out her days with her best friend and family -- including a father she lost as a child. And how does she handle this cruel but inevitable Icarus (flying to close to the Sun and getting burned) moment? With dignity like Martha? With Resolution like Amy? With bravery like River Song? NO, of course not. She bawls like a baby, despite knowing her ""true love"" will live on and so will she. And if THAT wasn't bad enough, her one ""I sort of feel bad for her."" moment is constantly being marred by the writers making this supposedly ""impenetrable barrier"" a revolving door of previous companions. Hell, they break the universe so often now they might as well just build a highway to Rose's universe. 

 ON TOP OF THAT, she nearly gets the Doctor killed and how is she rewarded? With her very own human version! But was that enough? NO. Of course not. Sure she'll make out with the guy, but then there goes the REAL Doctor and the Tardis and she takes off running -- IN FRONT OF THE HUMAN DOCTOR SHE JUST KISSED!! 

*deep breath* Sometimes the only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that Human Doctor broke up with Rose, because after spending some normal time together he realized how flaky and unreliable she is. Or at the very least he decided he deserved better then to act as a replacement for some silly girls ""dream man."" Maybe he invents a way to bridge the gap between his universe and The Doctors universe and is just waiting for the barriers between to crack again so he can come back and escape her once and for all. THAT'S the dramatic ending Rose Tyler deserves -- the woman who sent Donna to her death without so much as a tear.

true,str0yr,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; I was pointing out a double standard: Martha and the Doctor both have good reasons for having emotional moments

Martha doesn't have a single good reason, that's my point. I understand what you're trying to explain, but it just doesn't fit. She has one selfish and jealous reason. She's being shown the entirety of space and time as a thank-you for helping him on his adventures. That's a once in a lifetime opportunity, yet you seem to feel that her infatuation is so much more important. The Doctor was fair and rational. Martha was childish and immature. She initially used The Doctor's offer to see things such as 16th century England to try and get close to him after she told him that ""she wasn't interested"" in response to him making it clear he wasn't. She took advantage of his kindness. Admittedly she improved as time went on but that doesn't excuse anything.

&gt; Clearly you just have no sympathy for Martha.

There's no point sympathising her, because she became a time traveller. That more than makes up for her not getting her own way.

&gt; You don't think the thing Rose had with 9 carried over into 10's era? She pretty much strung Mickey along all that time while she was clearly more in love with the Doctor.

So flirting means they're in a relationship? Sure, Rose was very taken by The Doctor, and we can see that she took a shine to him very quickly but on no account does that mean they're in a relationship. I sincerely hope you don't hold those views personally.

&gt; Her fleeting love since her childhood? I totally think the Doctor fell in love with her.

Okay, you're right. It wasn't a fleeting love, but at no point did he ever say that he was in love with her though, that's just your own opinion. Opinions are great, but they don't have a lot to them when weighed against fact. Sure, he was attracted to her, and sad that he never got to say goodbye to somebody who understood him so well (thanks to the psychic connection they shared for a few minutes), but that doesn't mean that he loved her. Your final paragraph demonstrates a false cause logical fallacy. Using Mickey's suggestion to Rose that he show her the rest of the TARDIS to make a point makes no sense. Mickey can't read minds. And as for the letter, she was expressing how much she wished she could have seen him again before she passed away. He never got to fulfil his offer to take her on his travels and feels a great sadness from this, but that doesn't equal love. He didn't open it straight away, as it was sealed with a stamp. The point of these seals is to show that the letter is official, private and confidential. You cannot say for sure what The Doctor felt as it was never confirmed, all you can really do is show that he cared about her.

Ten never said it Rose either. He never actually kissed Rose either. (Cassandra kissed the Doctor and Metacrisis10 kissed Rose). Is saying ""I love you"" or kissing someone a criteria requirement for being in a relationship? I don't think so. They clearly had something going on between each other.

Have a think for a moment and re-evaluate that sentence, because I don't think you really meant that. In the first 5 minutes of Utopia, she displays a definitive jealousy of Rose.

&gt; MARTHA:
Is that what happens, though? Seriously? Do you just get bored with us one day and disappear?

&gt; JACK:
Not if you’re blonde.

&gt; MARTHA:
(sarcastic) Oh, she was blonde? Oh what a surprise!

Now of course, the same applies here. We can never know for sure what Martha felt, but she was quite vocal about her feelings as compared to The Doctor and his emotional baggage, so we have a lot more reliable information to work with. This is a more reasonable assumption than what you've made.

&gt; But she's never harbored ill will towards Rose.

Again, as I told you in my previous comment, I never said that she did. Quit making shit up.

&gt; Woah, I don't even know how you construed that from the dialogue but ok.

Let me break it down a little more for you, so that you fully understand. The Face of Boe had just mentioned that The Doctor was the last of his kind in front of Martha. She couldn't leave well enough alone on this point that The Doctor is aching over and forces him to tell her the whole story. She's nosey and pushy.

The implications that fear and faith are similar are fascinating...but wait, there's more! - These implications are made really ambiguous by the end, how the Doctor saves Amy by getting her to relinquish her faith in him, thusly proving her faith in him correct! (Which still makes my brain hurt sometimes).

Overall, I just love how nuanced the themes are, I thought this episode was very clever. And on a side note, as a resident of the US, I like that this episode had the daring to tackle religious faith head-on, but also made sure to include other kinds as well. (Nothing slipped through the cracks.) This may or may not be so forward-thinking for a British show, but most show in the US wouldn't touch something religion-related with a ten-foot pole.

true,energyi,null,null,"This is not an attack on anyone in particular, just the general attitude towards Adebayor amongst Tottenham fans at the moment and this seems like a good opportunity to talk about it. I hate to criticise our own fans (à la the scum) but I really feel this is important.

People hate the guy but most of the fans who slag him off don't have a rational reason to do so. You ask them why they don't like him and it's always the same old shit, as if they know him personally (mostly gooner twats). It's almost understandable when the opposition slags him off but it's inexcusable for Spurs fans to slag him off for personal reasons when none of us actually know him.

Fair enough he may not be on the same form he was last season, and it seems he hasn't quite worked as hard, but to make him out to be a bad person? It's pathetic. He really doesn't deserve his reputation. Plus he's never been known for his work rate, it's his natural ability to link up play that his reputation has been built on. So if that fails him he's not at all used to changing his style to some Tevez or Rooney type player who runs around constantly. 

Furthermore, what good does it do to attack him? It doesn't help him or the team at all. So even if all the Adebayor haters are right what the hell is the point? I say cheer him on twice as much when he gets the ball and give him a reason to love the fans. That will surely help his form, confidence and desire to help the team. The whole ""1 season wonder"" tag doesn't help him either. It's the same as how people criticise Jenas whilst forgetting the effort and contribution he made to the team at times. He's not a brilliant player. So what? Maybe we're just so spoiled lately with amazing players like Bale, VDV, Modric, Dembele, Vertonghen and Lloris that we loose sight of what makes us really love a player.

 I think that he is a player who does not justify his past wages/transfer costs but that is Manchester City's fault. It's like Andy Carrol, not a bad player but nowhere near worth what some idiot decided to pay for him so it puts huge expectations, well beyond the player ability, on him.

Either back Adebayor up or shut the hell up about him, it doesn't help anyone but our rivals to attack him like this. Constructive criticism and venting anger - fair enough. But making him out to be some sort of  monster who only gives a shit about himself is just ignorant and self destructive for the team.

Plus imagine the joy it gives the Scum when they see us attacking him.

There is a great deal of hatred for Thatcher in the North, and in Ireland. She essentially maliciously destroyed the North, by attacking its industry, its economy and its infrastructure. Her government's handling of the Northern Irish situation certainly did nothing to diffuse The Troubles. Her support for interment is unforgivable.

She also seemed to agree with plans which 'proposed introducing education vouchers, ending the state funding of higher education, freezing welfare benefits and an insurance-based health service'. Yes, the two-faced, bouffanted old bat was planning to dismantle the NHS and free education, after her famous 1982 declaration that the NHS was safe in the hands of the Tories. Obviously, not the first politician to lie, but as lies go, that's a pretty hefty one.

And yet, this woman is held up as a bastion of greatness. We are told how marvellous she was, and how we should have statues of her and how politicians and women today should look up to her. 

As a general rule, we see her as a malicious, cold-hearted bitch who was willing to oppress, to starve and to kill just because she wanted her own fucking way. I could never wish harm on anyone, but my god, I'm glad that woman's lost it so she can't spew vitriol and bile on the people any more.

Looking [here](http://www.avchart.com/users/quotes/default.asp), you can see that Ade could have personally chartered a flight for his entire team from SA to Togo for less than a week's wages. If he really gave a shit he would have met his President *and* been back for training, with time to spare.

&gt;When Ivory Coast went out of the tournament, the president of the federation sent them a plane to get back. With Togo, it’s not the same.

Moaning that your federation can't afford to put on extra transport for you is no excuse. It's his job to make sure he fulfills his commitments, not theirs.

He is a lazy, greedy wanker, and I think the only way to extract good performances from him at this point would be to make a goal bonus amount to at least half of his salary.

I'm sorry for the rant, but Ade's attitude is absolutely atrocious, and I don't agree that this article shows him in a good light at all. I was cautiously optimistic about his future with us last season, but he's showing his true colours again now.",0,1361938431,null,0,false,0,c8mesyg,t3_19ajui,t1_c8mesyg,t1_c8ma0t6,null,1431423241,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

true,Angry-Australian,lfc50,,"The Champions **League** (it's only called Cup in FIFA because they haven't secured the rights for that and Europa League) is a tournament set up every season by UEFA (Union of European Football Associations). UEFA runs a few European competitions which include the Champions League, Europa League and Super Cup. The Europa League is like a second division Champions League but it's often viewed as a ""mini European tournament"" (in a derogatory way) by the major teams as it's nowhere near as prestigous and doesn't feature as many 'big' teams. The Super Cup is a one off match between the winners of both competitions. There's also the Intercontinental Cup which is a one off match between the winners of the Champions League and equivalent competiton for the South Americas (CONMEBOL). That should answer your MLS question. 

Each league in Europe is basically ranked on their relative strengths to each other and given a number of spots depending on how high that coefficient is. England, Spain and Germany are ranked the highest and so they each get 4 spots for teams in their league, Italy, France and Portugal get 3, and so on. From there, more spots are allocated to the Europa League (3 in all of the mentioned countries cases).

In England, the 4 spots are given to the four highest placed clubs from the previous seasons Premier League. The top 3 clubs get automatic qualification into the group stages and the 4th club gets put into qualifying rounds for the group stages. The spots for Europa League are allocated to the winner of the Capital One Cup and FA Cup and 5th place in EPL.

The Champions League is by far the most important competition of all I've listed and winning it is more desirable than winning the league for a lot of teams/fans. It brings in huge revenue from TV and prize money, prestige for winning or advancing to latter stages, star player attraction, and all that. People only care about the Europa League if they reach the semis or final for big clubs, and while advancing in it may be big for smaller clubs the major travel and fixture congestion can be very unwelcome on the often smaller squads of mid or lower league teams. Thus, neither the 'big' or 'small' teams particularly want to be in the Europa League. Plus, the prize money is insignificant even if you reach the final (we're talking amounts that would only pay a few weeks of Gerrard's salary) and the TV money is neglible too as TV stations don't bother with matches that don't feature big teams to draw viewers.

So yes, the only time Liverpool can play Barcelona is in any of these 3. Moreso for Champions League or Super cup, I don't even know the last time Barcelona played in the Europa League.

- A accuses B of x, both go to court.

- B is found to be not guilty, case is closed despite massive damage having been done to B's reputation, in many cases resulting in the loss of friends, close emotional ties (family, fiancées) work, and resulting in ostracisation, mental and emotional health issues and a marred record which will be flagged to any potential future employers, regardless of their innocence

- If B alleges false claims on A's part A is _possibly_ investigated in a second case in which their abuse of the system is under scrutiny. Depending on the outcome, they are possibly penalised, and if so it's in so small a way that there's very little disincentive to others seeking to abuse the system and ruin lives, or to those looking to lodge a genuine case but fearful of being imprisoned - just because B is found to be not guilty doesn't immediately and automatically mean that A is found to have been lying.

Well hell no. I think every match is winnable. It's not impossible to go unbeaten from here on out. But it will be incredibly hard. Unlike the rest of the teams, we have a strong squad who is now free to train harder and rest easier, unlike Chelsea or Arsenal, who are cup tied.

As we win, we have to hope Chelsea fuck up, for Everton to continue fucking up, and for Arsenal to fuck up more often. With Sturridge and Suarez, we can score goals without luck and ""magic"". I mean, we keep destroying teams with 3+ goals FFS. We don't lose to the big guys, we always win at least 1 point.

This is how it goes. If we are to beat Chelsea and Arsenal, they have to drop 10 points somehow. Which means they have to lose and draw their way up to 10 points dropped. This is assuming from here on out, that we don't drop any more points than them. For example, Chelsea would have to lose 2 and draw 2, while we win all 4. Arsenal would have to lose 2 and draw 1, while we win 3 ahead.

Arsenal has been as inconsistent as us. However, they draw more than they lose. Let's hope they fuck up and lose at least 2 games and draw 1 more than we do. WBA and Everton are prone to screwing up, so we shouldn't have much trouble advancing comfortably considering the easy road ahead.

If we can find a way to shut down Chelsea's midfield and slow down Tottenham's attack, we can come away with draws or even a win. I'm placing a win over Chelsea.",0,1361944989,null,0,1361945235,0,c8mgn0g,t3_19b3iz,t1_c8mgn0g,t3_19b3iz,null,1431424163,22,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,22

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"The different tournaments have already been explainined, but I'll try to add a bit more on the league.

The Premier League (or English Premier League, or Barclays (sponser) Premier League:

So, this is the highest league in English football. That means there's only a relegation system, meaning, after every season, the three teams at the bottom of the table will have to go into the Championship, while 3 teams from the Championship league will come up to the Premier League. In the PL you get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. GA on the table stands for Goals Against (number of goals conceded), GF stands for Goals For (number of goals scored) and GD stands for Goal Difference (GF-GA). The team that comes in first in the PL wins it while also being able to qualify for the Champions League. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed team can also join the 1st placed team in qualifying for the Champions League, which is the most prestigious club competition, as the best of each country's league will face each other. The 5th placed team will qualify for the Europa League (which is what we are in now), which is a lot less prestigious than the Champions League but it's still a European competition, so I guess it's pretty good.

In terms of the PL at the moment, Liverpool have rivalry with two teams - Manchester United and Everton. Manchester United tends to be the more heated of the two, due to club history and Man Utd only recently overtaking our number of English League 1 titles. Our rivalry with Everton is known as the Merseyside Derby, since we're both clubs based in the same area.

Cambridge is a fantastic city, filled with interesting historical stuff like old libraries, halls, churches and the like. I`m sure you`ll have a great time.

Either trains (expensive but quicker) or coaches (cheap but slower) are probably your best bet for getting around. There are train stations more or less everywhere, but beware of travelling at peak times as it's more expensive. Companies like National Express and Megabus operate frequent coaches between most cities.

Cambridge is probably the UK's second most bike-friendly city, behind Oxford. There are cycle lanes around the city but a lot of people ignore them during the busyier periods. Cycling in the UK is mostly safe, and drivers in general are acommodating. Just beware of bendy buses!

You are allowed to take bikes on some (most) trains, especially in rural areas. Its a good idea to check. I suggest taking the train to Cardiff one weekend and cycling out into the Welsh valleys. As for gettig to Ireland, I suggest the ferry or flying Ryanair or Easyjet (cheap budget airlines).

If you give people a comedy option, or an option that doesn't require any active thought or involvement, then before you know it the nation's policy is being dictated by idiots.

I appreciate that a lot of people feel like no-one in government really speaks for them, and it can be frustrating that there is no way for them to make their voices heard.

Agreed, there *are* enough rules as it is, but the focus is on assessing the situation. Constantly.

They do, and sometimes they can cause accidents. This is not what's I'm promoting - riding unpredictably is an entirely-different kettle of chips.

That is the trick - just like speed doesn't kill, it's when you suddenly and unexpectedly stop that the problem starts.

I suppose that's one of the paradoxes of driving; on motorways, everyone's moving at the same speed so there are less accidents.

Interesting that you've never had an accident. I've been a cyclist for over 10 years and it only took 6 months of cycling in London for a motorist on his phone to pull-out right in front of me. Had I not brought my rear wheel around I would've gone over the car and there have been many incidents since. I'm actually a very calm and predictable cyclist and I follow road behaviour perfectly (particularly signals and lanes - good for drivers to know your intentions!)

I know that one, scuffed a pedestrian once. He was holding his bag in front of his chest (no idea why) and was looking the wrong way when he stepped-out. Nothing I could've done - luckily he hadn't taken a second step or we'd have both gone down. (I'd say behaving unpredictably is what *people* do, expect it, cope with it. My driving instructor used to ride a Kawasaki and nothing teaches you good observation and predictable behaviour like an instructor who used to ride one of those beasts)

That situation is precisely one in which it may be safer to simply run the red. I completely agree with ""don't do it"" but drivers do it anyway. You can't move to the middle of the lane to block the driver or he'll try to pull-off past you and that's even worse. As for ""don't allow them to do it to you"", no, you're right, don't.

Children can start education from the age of 3-4 within a nursery. This can be referred to as 'early years' education. 

Children then enter primary school (primary education) at the age of 4 and continue in this school until the age of 11. They sit their first exams within the final two years known as SATs. These are used to help place them in suitable level classes when they enter secondary education.

Children enter seconday school (seconday education) from the age of 11 through to the age of 18. I believe they have recently changed it that from 2015 education is compulsory up to the age of 18, where as before it was 16. Students complete their GCSE's (there is word here of changing this exam board, I am unsure what stage this is at) at the age of 16 and move into college or sixth form for two years typically.

At the age of 18 students may enter tertiary education if they so choose to. A student may enter a college, university of polytechnic and complete a range of courses. After completing a degree a student may also choose to follow this by taking a master degree and then a PhD (I may be a little off here as I did not go this route). Degrees differ in length depending on the subject, the typical one taking three years to complete.

And whilst I couldn't have given you the number of feet in a mile off the top of my head, I *could* have given you the number of yards, so I could have quickly calculated the number of feet, if pressed – some facts stick in your head and some don't. 

That said, I do agree that our approach to adopting metric systems has been ridiculous. It's left me still thinking primarily in imperial units for most things – feet and inches for height, stones, pounds and ounces for weight, miles and yards for distance, and pints and gallons for volumes – while thinking in metric for others. This in spite of having worked extensively with metric systems in my various jobs.

The assumption made is that a credible WMD threat can only arise from an entity big enough to be threatened by a deterrent. In plainer English: if you've got enough resources to build a Nuke you can use against us, you're big enough to care that we'll point ours at you in response.

This is a simplification of the real threat picture, and it doesn't cover all credible threats, especially given how easy it is to make nerve gas, and how we and our allies are dangerously cheapening the definition of ""WMD"" to include anything bigger than a shotgun (thus forcing us to posture that we'll disproportionately Go Nuclear), but it's the role the Strategic Deterrent is designed to fit. 

The threat you hypothesis isn't tackled by Strategic Deterrence, w e have other systems in place for ""smaller"" threats, which is where for examples entities like MI6, GCHQ and the whole intelligence area comes into play (""catch 'em before they do it"") . Again, this works on the model that nuclear proliferation can be prevented or at least detected which is an assumption that *has* held for the last 60 years - no non-rational / sub-state entities have ever made a credible nuclear threat.

Strategic Deterrence is like Chess - you're not defending against any individual move (""Terrorists Nuke London""), you're playing a bigger game (""We will retaliate against North Korea if we find it was a NK nuke used against London, thus we encourage them to keep good control over their arsenal and not let it fall into terrorist hands in the first place""). The point of the Deterrent is that it forces and encourages states to keep their cards on the table where everyone can see them, which encourages clarity of thought in moments of crisis. 

Simply by *existing* and being *credible*, our strategic deterrent is useful and valuable. If we use it, we eliminate that use and value and it's in *that* sense that it has failed, even as it succeeds in turning our enemies homeland into a wasteland...

*edit* **tl;dr** You're making an argument that a Nuclear Deterrent can't prevent *all* threats, and I agree with that. But we disagree that this makes having a Nuclear Deterrent *at all* useless. I argue that it's presence is valuable on a wider scale, thus making it a valuable *component* of our overall defence capability.",0,1361966221,null,0,1361966463,0,c8mjkk1,t3_19bhx1,t1_c8mjkk1,t1_c8mjdf4,null,1431425573,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

No. The BBC serves the people; it is not prescriptive. Now, whether or not you think metres are more widely understood today than feet is a different matter (I would agree with you). But it is true that our 'standard system' is a mishmash (Miles and pints etc). If you want us to become more metric, petition the government, not the BBC. It only reflects what already exists.

&gt; To me it's a matter of integrity

What? As the reply to your complaint points out, a measurement given in Imperial is not wrong - it is still factually correct.

OTOH using imperial in a science show (Bang goes the theory) is pretty sloppy. But at least the weather reports are in Celsius nowadays - I only very occasionally hear a verbal 'That's XX in Fahrenheit' from the presenter. It's a gradual transition, but we're getting there!

true,bobnudd,null,null,"I know Cambridge very well so here are my two cents.

1. Cycling is a great way to get around, but when you first arrive take time to wander around on foot and see where all the cycle lanes are, and the one way streets in town (e.g Sidney Street / Trinity Street). It can get very confusing, as those who have lived in the city a while know where to cycle, and the new cyclists aren't used to all the lanes and roads and often end up going through red lights and cycling on the pavement - mainly because I guess they feel safer. If in doubt, just get off your bike and walk. It is safer for everybody. You can pick up a cycle map [here](http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/59205CC4-E5C0-42A0-9FC4-6E9F18EF8530/0/Cambridge_WEB.pdf) and [CamCycle](http://www.camcycle.org.uk/) has loads of useful information. It is very easy to cycle in the countryside around the area, and there are loads of apps that can help plan a journey. If you have an expensive bike, get a very good lock. Cycle theft is high in Cambridge. There are plently of places to park your bike (some say not enough), but the main thing is to make sure it is very secure.

2. Rail travel. Get yourself a [Railcard](http://www.railcard.co.uk/), either if it is a young persons or Network Railcard. You can get to London on the train in 45mins, and with the railcard you will save 1/3 on your fare - it will pay for itself in no time. Travelling further? [Split your ticket](http://www.splityourticket.co.uk/) Sometimes you can split a long journey into many shorter journeys, thus saving money. You can take your bike on a train, but if it is really busy you may have to wait for the next train if cycle area is full. There are lots of commuters from many different places. Try travelling off peak. You can buy tickets online and pick them up at the station at a machine. Buying in advance can often save money.

Misc things about Cambridge:

1. Like coffee? go to [Hot Numbers](http://hotnumberscoffee.co.uk/). They roast on site and they share a building with an Art Gallery. 

2. Like beer? go to The Blue, The Devonshire, The Mill, The Radegund.. oh wait, just pick up a [Good Beer Guide](http://www.camra.org.uk/gbg) (essential if you plan to travel around the country and want a decent pint) or nose about the Cambridge CAMRA [website](http://www.cambridge-camra.org.uk/) Really like beer?

As far as I know, this country uses the english language.

Most peoples answer doesn't sit well with me. To me it's a matter of integrity, the BBC should uphold the current standard and report only in english. There will always be listeners who can't/won't adapt but everyone else was brought up with english and deserves to be presented with words that they understand.

When the BBC reports that some thing was ""gotsan"" I have no intuitive idea about what they are talking about. But in reality that ""gotsan"" was obviously a swear word the first place. Might as well say ""cunt"" and it's probably just as accurate, or ""cuntface"" if ""gotsan"" was accurate.

I don't want to bash welsh, but I think the BBC should set an example.

The body is believed to be that of missing 31 year old Karen Simpson who had not been seen since the weekend.

Karen’s family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

A post mortem examination will be carried out to establish the cause of death but at this stage there are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances.

We would like to thank all the community for their overwhelming support and assistance during the searches for Karen.

Correct. This is necessary because the UK doesn't have any indigenous space launch capability, which is usually a prerequisite for building ICBMs.

&gt; The warhead design is just a copy of American ones.

No, the UK has always had its own nuclear munitions technology and warhead specifications.

&gt; Anyway, presumably what expertise we do have can be maintained through the civilian nuclear power generation industry and non-nuclear submarines.

Not nuclear munitions expertise. And nuclear power plants for use in submarines are an entirely different kettle of fish to civilian plants; they have different operating regimes, design requirements, and fuel specifications, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. As I understand it, the UK is actually slightly ahead of the US in terms of submarine power plant technology (the new nuclear-powered patrol submarines have some pretty bleeding-edge systems IIRC).

Secret missile silos don't work. I work in satellite remote sensing, and I can assure you that locating and mapping missile silos is *trivial* with even 1980s ground-penetrating radar. Nowadays, there is no such thing as a secret missile silo.

Bombs dropped from planes also don't work, because we don't have a suitable aircraft (specifically, the UK would need an ultra-stealthy aircraft that can carry very heavy payloads to anywhere on the entire planet without refueling).

Lord knows whenever I have to self report at the doctors I do some mental gymnastics to try and work out what an 'average' week might entail.

It shouldn't surprise many people that there is an excessive drinking problem in the country, any town or city centre is populated primarily by establishments where drinking to excess is their raison d'etre.  I know it's perfectly possible to go to a pub and have just a drink or two, but I don't doubt there'd be a whole lot of pubs going out of business if that advice was taken up by the country overnight.

With your bike, remember we use the other side of the road . It takes a good while to get used to that, so be careful ! Because you will forget yourself a few times, everyone who moves here does. 

Bike theft is a big problem, get yourself a really sturdy chain and always chain your bike. 

Trains are ok but plan your journeys well in advance, a ticket from Leicester to Kings Cross will cost you around £18 a week in advance but around £60 on the day. National Express and Megabus are pretty good and cheaper alternatives but aren't as flexible and take much longer. 

Visit as many castles as you can, they are flipping amazing. Get an English Heritage membership, it's £36 for students and it means free entry to most heritage sites. 

Visit mainland Europe if you can.

**Always** remember to check your mirrors often.

Nuclear deterrents do not work against non-state actors on a suicide mission and it does not even work against mad heads-off states. For example chairman mao once wanted to encourage a nuclear holocaust because he believed their were so many Chinese that they alone would survive.  

I do believe that with a proper nuclear regime in place, a nuclear authority, it would be possible to clamp down and significantly reduce the risk of rogue elements getting hold of nuclear weapons, whilst also reducing the number of nuclear weapons that legitimate states have. my third point was not meant to be about UK nuclear weapons or material going missing, i was talking general and you make a good point about Russia. 

We agree about how much the world can change, my point about being deserted by our allies was that it was unlikely however. At no time in are recent history have we ever been without one powerful ally.

true,pieeatingbastard,cnty-england,Both Southern fairy and Northern monkey,"There is nothing intrinsically wrong with acting as a landlord, first of all. It provides a service that is essential, in that many people simply do not have the wherewithal to buy a house, the ability to predict they will live in an area long term, among other things. In fact, having a healthy rental sector is of economic value, as it allows greater labour mobility-ie the ability to move area to find work without unnecessary financial impediment. 
For a landlord to invest their financial capital in rental properties is not cost or risk free, don't forget. If they are unable to find tenants, the tenant is unable to pay, does damage, or the market rate goes down, they lose money, the same as in any other business. A lot of the ire they have attracted is simply due to the fact that currently the market works in their favour. 2 years ago, landlords were losing their properties because the fallout from the previous housing bubble was working against them. They also have what is called an opportunity cost - the loss, by tying their capital up in one thing, of the ability to do anything else with that capital. Property rental, by its nature uses a lot of capital.

Landlords are already regulated by the landlord and tenant act, which gives both landlord and tenants rights and responsibilities with regard to maintenance, payment, and access to the property among others. With regard to registering as a limited company, this is both cheap-maybe £15 according to google and of little meaning - in fact a half decent accountant will use it to help you avoid tax in a business of this kind. And make no mistake, your landlord will already be paying taxes on his earnings. It is simply illegal not to do so.

I would suggest that you look a little more into the planning of post war estates -  there is valid argument about whether they were planned well, but they most certainly were planned! In fact, a lot of thought and social theory went into their planning. The fault was that maintenance was deferred, and we have a flaw in architectural practice right up till today that architects will often not revisit their projects to learn from how they work in practice, or to update them in the light of their use in the real world. The vastly higher cost, environmental and financial, of rebuilding from scratch rather than renovating, with the dislocation that it will inevitably incur, could abnd should be avoided where possible. Unless -are you arguing for it as a covertly subsidised job creation scheme? These tend to work badly, as they channel funds to the company involved - see our incessant insistence on buying overpriced weapons systems from domestic manufacturers rather than off the shelf equipment. And our domestic construction companies have their own ethical problems - they are in the frame for at least some of the problems in our housing market as they do not like building (less profitable) starter homes, and have not been building on land that they do own - try searching for ""land bank"" if you want to know more.

You may have a point with regards to rent controls, possibly. Particularly in London where rents are ludicrous by northern standards, and house prices are still rising. From my point of view this is clearly a bubble, and likely to have a large and painful impact when it bursts, but the problem is that causing this bubble to deflate gently without further harming the rest of the country will be difficult politically and fiscally. The estates you mention, however, suffer from poor maintenance and design of public realm areas, poor transport access as they were designed for a bright new future where every family had a car, often a tendency to dump problem families together in sink estates that simple demolition and reconstruction does not come close to addressing. 

Some of the theory and history surrounding housing is fascinating, but please don't fall for an uncritical reading of what the media is giving us currently. We are fed theories without even internal consistency at times, with carefully picked supporting facts. But it is important to remember that every journalist whose reporting centres on housing and construction has a fundamental bias, in that if the market collapses then the money to pay their wages will get tighter. And so, if only subconsciously, there is always an interest in keeping the market pumped up.

true,kash_if,null,null,"Okay first let me educate you historically as to why UK and other countries allows refugees to begin with. It is because UK signed a UN convention at the end of the of the World War II to protect European refugees. Later geographical and time limits were removed so refugees from other countries could also seek asylum. As of 2011 there are 147 countries that have signed this convention and refugees/asylum seekers can head to ANY of these countries (partially negates your point about ""why UK""). In the general principle of international law, treaties in force are binding upon the parties to it and must be performed in good faith. Countries that have ratified the Refugee Convention are obliged to protect refugees that are on their territory, in accordance with its terms. So UK and other countries are obligated to allow refugees.

&gt; Why the U.K? Why not Germany, Sweden, France, Norway, Canada or Australia for example?

Of course they go to all these countries you mentioned and to others (15% of global asylum seekers head to UK Vs 14.4% for Germany and 14.1% USA)  What made you think they exclusively head to the UK?

&gt; The majority of asylum seekers are poor and a large percentage of them move through Europe to get to the U.K. 

Language could be playing a role here. If they are familiar with English they would naturally try to go to a place where they can speak the language. Also, [reports suggest](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/14/chance-choice-britain-refugees-council-report) that a lot of refugees,

* ""have little, if any choice, over which country they claim asylum in with most only learning they were heading to Britain after they left their home country"". 

* ""Most were also helped to leave by an external party or agent who made the key decisions about their destination. The research shows that fewer than one-third specifically wanted to come to Britain.""

&gt; As to your second point, future is irrelevant, asylum is meant to be a temporary refuge not a back-door immigration route.

Asylum is temporary on paper. But the problem with countries like Afghanistan and Iran is that it is more of less permanent. 

Also keep in mind that giving asylum is not just a humanitarian act. It is for a large part political too. It has implications on international politics. A lot of political dissidants are given asylum for the same reason.

true,thisisappropriate,null,null,"Most of the UK follows a two tier system, where there are primary and secondary schools, some areas use a three tier system, the only area I believe still uses this is in Kent (the Isle of Wight - where I grew up in the three tier system - are just changing to the primary/secondary system).

In the September preceding most children's 5th birthday they start proper schooling (before this, some are enrolled in nursery/day-care (usually very young) and pre-school, which is usually from when they're late 3 or 4). The first year is Reception (equivalent of kindergarden), then after that year numbers start - Year one is the year of their 6th birthday, and so on. In the three tier system, primary school is until the end of Year 4, middle school is until the end of Year 8 and high school is until the end of compulsory education (end of year 11). In the two tier system (most of the UK) you stay in primary school until the end of Year 7 (the year you turn twelve) then you go to secondary school where you stay until you finish year 11 (the year you 16).

Exams

There are SATS tests in years 2, 6 and 9, which in the three tier system were used to assess the schools more than the students (because it's when you're about half way through the school that you're being tested at), not sure about in the two tier system. [\(Wiki link\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Curriculum_assessment)

GCSE exams

These are still in compulsory education - they are generally taken across years 10 and 11, as they involve the equivalent of teaching time for each subject over 2 years. There are multiple exam boards, and individual schools decide on the courses to offer; maths, English and a science are usually made compulsory (and most employers look for a pass in maths and English at GCSE level). Ten exams are generally taken within the two years. As soon as you finish the exams in summer of year 11, you are done with compulsory education. Most people are 16 at this point. (Grades are in letters, A*-F, A* is the best and anything C or above is a pass)

Post compulsory education

From 16 to 18 a lot of people take A-Levels (these are taken in 6th Form Colleges or High Schools) or in some cases apprenticeships/college courses. Usually in year 12 you take 4 AS-Levels (first year of A-Level) and after that for year 13 you drop one (usually) so you finish 3 A-Levels. Technically anything at E or above is a pass. These are used basically to get into University.

Around January before finishing A-Levels (year 13), anyone planning to go to uni the next year has to get their UCAS form in, which includes a personal statement (a page of writing about yourself and why a uni would want you), filling in 5 choices of University's and courses, and a recommendation from your college. (University open days go on during weekends for a lot of the year.) You still go through this if you're planning to take a gap year, where you defer the place offered to you for a year, for travel or just to work for a year so you can afford to live away from home for 3 years.

University courses are usually a single Honors degree, occasionally joint honors (Ie, Maths and Business Studies), and are in modules across semesters or trimesters for (often) 3 years or 4 years (most three year courses are Bachelors, four years are Masters), Veterinary/Doctors/Some other profession courses are much longer, up to around 7 years with learning and placements. Modules are sometimes optional, but you'll be expected to take a certain number of credits per semester, like dropping a module that's optional for your course to take a language module that's equal credits (here at ARU, it's 15 credits for most modules, with 4 per semester, other uni's use different systems).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm not sure I'd really agree, clearly views on this will differ but a few thoughts;

* A friend of mine rented a house that became badly damp in the recent rain. The only thing she could do was complain to the council who were obliged to investigate - they then ask the landlord to make repairs and if that doesnt work they can take the landlord to court to force them to make repairs. However, the whole process takes 6-12 months... so is pointless as the problem would be fixed AFTER most contracts end. All this time, the tenant is forced to pay rent... otherwise the landlord can secure a rapid eviction in court. So the court are ready and waiting to protect the financial rights of the landlord, but not the physical health of the tenant.
* This kind of legal mentality harks back to a day when people lived as little more than indentured servants on the land of wealthy artistocrats. The tenant is, through disparities in the law, still legally inferior to the landowner. Because traditionally, landowners were wealthy aristocrats who mattered and tenants were lowly peasents who didn't.
* Where my parents live, the council decided to impose parking restrictions on the street. About 70% of the street rent and 30% own. A small vocal minority of owner-occupiers voted for parking restrictions, but the majority (largely renters) voted against. The council decided it was only fair to acknowledge the views of the landowners. So despite living on the same street... paying approximately the same in rent or mortgages to live there... tenants were, in the eyes of the council, second class residents whose opinions could be discarded. (Just to point out, to those from the continent, in the UK you do not usually own any part of the street - the local council administers it)
* My own rental property also recently developed damp. We contacted the council who came and inspected... they advised us that the although the problem was severe, it was due to an exterior issue that pre-existed our signing of the contract. So our landlord was not legally obliged to repair it unless it became a serious threat to health (e.g. if the roof were at risk of caving in). So what are tenants supposed to do? get a f'ing survery on a property before renting?


It seems to me there urgently needs to be a new ""Rental Act"" to enforce national registration of landlords, and the ability to legally prevent someone letting a house if they have been convicted of poor practise in the past. Additionally, tenants should be able to legally withold rent if there are ongoing disputes about repairs (obviously with reasonable controls in place). Tenants should also be allowed to terminate their contract with immiediate notice if the house becomes unsuitable. Landlords should also be obliged to maintain a house at a ""suitable standard"" (carefully defined in law) so that pre-existing issues that are not immiediately apparent (such as poor roof tiling) have to be addressed when they become a problem... even if they don't endanger health. 

As a seperate issue, and one where I appreciate I may be nieve and bitter, is that I suspect landlords ought to pay more tax. It isn't so much that they make pretty good margins but rather that they do it with very little effort. Indeed it's quite practical to let out several properties and still maintain a fulltime job.",0,1361978114,null,0,1361978897,0,c8mlppe,t3_194le1,t1_c8mlppe,t1_c8mkzcx,null,1431426576,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's very metropolitan with a strong Austrian/French/Western influence on architecture and styles. If I had to compare it to anywhere, I'd say Milan or Athens is probably most like it, minarets aside.

In the south west, towards Izmir people are staunchly secular and are pretty chilled out about most things. They're usually a little bit more devout than people in some parts of Istanbul but tend to keep it at home. Some people might not drink but are more bothered about people wearing headscarves than bikinis.

On the south coast things get a little stricter as you go further east but it's not very noticeable until you get really far east, especially if you're in touristy areas.

I don't know much about the Karadeniz region of northern Turkey, or about Hatay so it wouldn't be fair of me to comment.

In central Turkey you have Konya which is religious but fairly Sufi and chilled out, further east central you have Ankara which in it's views is more religious than Istanbul but in many areas staunchly secular because of the history with Ataturk (without him it'd still be a small town).

East of Ankara things get pretty overtly religious pretty quickly. Some of the best archaeological sites are in places like Urfa or Van where it can sometimes be difficult to get alcohol and you wouldn't necessarily want to get too close to someone you're not married to in the street. Further down to the south-east you reach the Kurdish parts of Turkey, which seems to vary in attitudes depending on where in that region you are.

The reason for all of these variations is that under the Ottoman Empire many of these places housed distinct ethnic and political groups that were suppressed by Ataturk's need for Turkish unity and the replacement of support for your tribe with Turkish nationalism. While this was less of a problem for the people of Istanbul, it was always going to be a problem for the Turks, the Armenian Turks (who had typically lived in the north east before the Genocide) and the people of Hatay (some of whom saw themselves as Syrian).

A lot of the variations actually go back thousands of years before Islam through mesopotamian history. If you go to the Archaeology Museum in Istanbul you can actually see cuniform tablets recording day to day activities, some of which wouldn't look out of place in the same area today.

That's why I don't buy the argument that religion is the driver of behaviour for these people. It may influence a culture, and a culture may adapt itself to it, but just as we celebrate Christmas on the same day as the festival of Saturn, and we celebrate Halloween, a former pagan festival I wouldn't be surprised if the religion has to fit in locally to the existing culture and customs.",0,1361980202,null,0,false,0,c8mmaun,t3_1993rx,t1_c8mmaun,t1_c8mkjwn,null,1431426864,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There are other examples where the UK also officially uses imperial units rather than metric.

So I think a better way of phrasing the original point would be ""The UK has adopted metric on paper in some circumstances where the government of the day thinks it suits it.""

As to your point, you keep trying to equate racism and sexism to the use of imperial measurements and I don't believe that makes sense at all. One is about social aspects of how we treat one another, the other is simply about how we refer to things such as length, height and volume. They're not equatable and you cannot make a meaningful analogy between them.

The BBC uses a system that allows the most number of people to understand it. If you want the BBC to use kilometres rather than miles, for example, then you need the country to stop using miles.

A better example, and perhaps this is where you were trying to go with the racist/sexist thing, is with regards to language. As time passes some words lose respectability and become words that are frowned upon. In those circumstances I believe the BBC, along with the rest of the media, have followed the public rather than led them.
