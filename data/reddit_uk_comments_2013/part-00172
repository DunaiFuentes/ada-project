Secondly, when you extract methane there is always an element of leakage, where the gas escapes directly into the atmosphere.

- I think it was a mix of the two. His first couple were down to luck, and Krul, who had a few good saves. The Nasri assist was  just him trying to hard. I think Nasri actually could have finished himself, but wanted to help big Ed put a point on the board. Awfully nice of him, but I'd have rather seen him convert. 

- The linesman felt bad for Newcastle.

- If that wasn't clear before, it's now eminently so, and I wouldn't be surprised to see one last dip into the market for a defender. Either an older player, or a young up and comer who won't expect to start every game. 

- Fernandinho was scary. He covered so much ground and was so crucial to starting many of our movements.

We know Smith dies in the Christmas Episode, but what if Capaldi shows up in the 50th at the end, and kills Smith unexplicably? Then, the Christmas episode shows the actual ""death"" of Matt Smith as he regenerates. But that wouldn't be the focus. It would then focus on John Hurt+Clara (and maybe Rose and Tennant) hunting down and killing Capaldi's doctor while the other doctor is regenerating. The episode would end with John Hurt having only one choice in outsmarting the doctor: killing himself and regenerating. This reverses everything that the new series has created: Rose, Tennant, Donna, Ecclestone etc. And sets the show back to 0 again. That's what I'd expect from a 50th anniversary. A twist that could literally annihilate doctor who into Universe A and Universe B

You also have to be quite headstrong and not crumble to pressure - only emerge when it's safe and not because the driver behind you is pressuring you, same with keeping to the speed limit. So whilst excess confidence might betray a lack of genuine skill, a lack of confidence is probably more dangerous.

true,cstross,null,null,"Main issue with cycling is that Edinburgh is built on an extinct volcano -- many parts of it are steep and hilly. Added to which, many of our streets are cobbled rather than paved roads.

Edinburgh's not as cold as you seem to think -- the temperature seldom falls below freezing except at night in the depths of winter, and buildings are generally well-insulated and heated.

The no-go areas are on the outskirts of the city; the centre is densely built, walkable, and generally relatively safe (although the night life on a Friday or Saturday can be a bit raucous at times).

Clothing: the general rule is to layer up. Jeans are fine. Tee shirts and maybe a fleece or hoodie for colder weather are useful, and you'll probably want a waterproof top or umbrella. In winter, gloves and a woolly hat help. You should also look to have some water-resistant shoes (sandals are only really okay in summer).

Snow: about one year in three we get snow on the ground for a few days during the winter months. 2011 was remarkable for the city getting snowed in to a depth of 20cm or so for an entire month -- that's the heaviest it's been in living memory. Edinburgh has a weird local microclimate that keeps it from freezing badly -- if you want to see real snow, you'll need to go about 30km out of town!

**UPDATE** I forgot to mention earlier -- Edinburgh is a *long* way north (the only city in the USA that's north of it is Anchorage, Alaska).

I think that's your logic, I've done enough science to know the dangers of taking the macroscopic and applying it blindly to the small scale. Below are three recipes, one takes 10 mins, one takes 20, one takes 45.

My easy recipe requires 100g pasta per person, olive oil, chilli flakes and a garlic clove per person. Cook pasta as per instructions (linguine is best), meanwhile, fry the sliced garlic in oil with the chilli flakes, then, when the pasta is cooked, mix it in the hot oil/garlic/chilli mix, add salt and enjoy. Also great with prawns if you're feeling flush.

Chilli con carne - dry fry 500g beef mince with a chopped onion until the onion is soft and the beef is brown (10 minutes). Add 1 sliced red pepper and 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 tsp each of cumin, hot chilli powder, paprika, oregano and fry a couple of minutes more, then add can chopped tomatoes, can drained kidney beans, 2 tbsp tomato puree, 150 red wine or beef stock. Bring to boil, turn down heat and simmer 30 minutes (10 in pressure cooker). Serves 4 and freezes great.

Coconut prawn curry - 2 tbsp medium curry paste, 1 tbsp water, sliced onion and sliced yellow pepper in large wok/non stick frying pan, cook on low heat for 4-5 mins, stirrig until onion is soft.

Put 100g basmati rice on. Add 1 tbsp mango chutney, 3 tomatoes quartered, 200ml (half can) coconut milk (can also use coconut powder with water - I do this as it is cheaper and lasts longer), cook 4 mins. Mix 2 tsp corn flour with 1 tbsp water to make a paste and add. Stir 30 seconds as sauce thickens.

Stir in 200g cooked peeled king prawns and 100g spinach and cook 3 minutes until spinach soft and prawns hot. At this point the rice should be done, so serve both, feeds 2 people.

He says our whole team is reliant on one man -- Suarez. That's utter rubbish. Since he was banned, we've maintained our unbeaten streak in the league, and won 7 out of 8 in preseason including the Newcastle game. Most of those came without Suarez as well. Does he not remember Bale's contribution to Spurs? IIRC, by the time we played Spurs in March, we'd had 10 different scorers in the league since the start of 2013, compared to Spurs' three. I know they've strengthened since then and brought in Soldado, but I'd argue Spurs will remain much more reliant on Soldado than we will on Suarez this season, especially if Bale does leave.

He states that if Soldado goes down they can ""always turn to Defoe - a proven poacher"". Yes, with an abysmal goalscoring record last season. On the other hand, if Suarez gets injured, or banned, we'll just do what we've done without him anyway, turn to Sturridge (or Aspas, or Coutinho..).

I'm not ignoring Spurs' other signings either, like Paulinho or Chadli. They've done some brilliant business and I **do** think they'll be very strong this year. But I don't think they're so far ahead of us that it's unfathomable for a player of Willian's calibre to sign for us over them. Man for man, our squads are very even now. Their players may be physically stronger than ours. They may look as though they could take any of our players in a fight, but they have their style of player and we have ours. Willian would fit well in both, but the notion that Spurs are an obvious choice over us is complete and utter bollocks.

You're trying to paint me as exercising a fallacy, when that isn't the case. I call bullshit on that and in return accuse you of straw-manning.

&gt;Heat and gossip rags are far far more degrading and damaging than page 3 could ever hope to be. ""here is xyz who still hasn't lost her weight, despite it being a month since her baby!!!!"".

In terms of net circulation and prominence, and combined with the notion that The Sun is actually news, they probably aren't. But that's a different topic.

But FYI I work in the media and have access to a media database and can check audited circulation figures.

Heat's is: 241,055. As an example of a gossip mag, Chat!'s is: 327,661. The others are broadly similar.

And the Sun? Well, that's: 2,281,301

Which makes it several orders of magnitude greater in reach and corresponding influence than either. 

&gt;Oh but wait, criticising gossip magazines means that some of her supporters would have to give up something they liked and you couldn't paint a misandrist picture of any critics leering overweight builders.

*'Overweight builders'?*

I don't think I, or Caroline Lucas actually said that. And I think you've missed the point about why I *did* mention 'builders' in the first place.

But anyway, careful, as your straw man is showing again. And just because Lucas is presenting the argument against Page Three, that does not exclude either her or me from being against the comparison you're presenting too. 

The more problematic issue is because of The Sun's political influence. At least Heat and Chat and Take A Break and their like don't use tits as marketing to then convey messages demonising immigrants, people on benefits or the disabled. 

Which is what the *real* point is here. It's using women's bodies as a commodity to sell some pretty despicable messages.

Then rubbish like Wife Swap started to appear. Next thing you know it was Celebrity wifeswap with Edwina Curry and some misogynist that did the races on Channel 4.

Not true, in the UK the only chemicals that have been oked for use are water, HCl, acrylamide (used in water treatment as a flocculant)  and a biocide (also used in water treatment), all non-toxic and non-carcinogenic. 

&gt;Also, incase any-one brings it up, yes, I realise that at the Balcombe site they are drilling for only oil at this time and they have no 'license to frack' but surely you can't believe there's no plans to frack in the future, do you?

I'm sure there are, but that requires a whole new set of permits and for Cuadrilla to apply for a new set of permits. 

Edit:I agree with your first point, I really hope that we lead the charge with nuclear power but I fear these so called environmentalists groups and popular opinion will not allow that, I believe nuclear power is the only technology that will halt the catastrophic climate change that human beings are going to cause.

I don't know why you assume that? Is there a use for violence against a violent organisation? Can other means be employed to disarm one's enemies? I don't have an answer.

Think of it this way. Imagine that I have a time machine. One day I find a plate of cookies on my table. I eat the cookies. Underneath the plate is a note saying that I am the one who made the cookies. (This note is telling the truth.) However, from my point of view, I haven't done any baking. If at this point I do nothing, and continue about my life normally, the cookies will have never existed, because no one made them, thus creating a paradox and a very empty stomach. 

However, if I use my time machine to go back to an hour before I first found the cookies, and bake the cookies and leave them on the table with the note, then my past self will find them, eat them, and all will be well. 
This is an equivalent situation to Rose and Bad Wolf.

TL;DR: Current-Rose needed to make sure that past-Rose would go to Satellite 5 by scattering the words 'Bad Wolf' through her life, because the clues that led past-Rose there wouldn't have been there if current-Rose hadn't left them.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;Fair enough, but why is killing for sport worse though? 

Because, despite claims of 'pest control' which are pretty much bullshit when it comes to most hunts, killing for food is at least slightly mitigating.

&gt;For example there's a great deal of munjac stalking that goes on around my area. A good hunter with the correct rifle will kill the animal instantly. Surely that's no more cruel than raising an animal for food, intensively farmed or otherwise.

Managing deer populations is actually less cruel than letting them starve when they've exhausted the local food supply, and they also ring-bark young trees and kill them when there are too many in one area. Usually the venison is eaten too, and deer stalking *may* be seen as sport, sure, but more often it's done by professionals who just see it as a job and it's done with care. 

Even after foxhunting were banned and factory farming stopped, there would probably be a need for wildlife management, which would inevitably include culling, and having some understanding of that, I wouldn't oppose it in the same way.

Sorry, but the destruction of journalistic information by the government in order to protect it's image is practically unprecedented. This article in the least is justified.

They don't have a plan but they act always to limit freedom and equality, it's built into industrial civilisation, it's built into capitalism.

It really annoys me how politicians frankly make stuff up to appeal to the general population instead of stating the facts that unconventional gas extraction is more expensive but is safe and will improve the general economic outlook of the country.

I'm not making a straw man, I am flat out accusing the MP of a blinkered approach that ignores where the real damage is being done in order to pander to voters who hold opinions with more than a hint of misandry.

Diana was driven to her death by paparazzi, Jordan tells women that having plastic surgery and appearing in a sex tape is a ticket to stardom. 'Brangelina' was more of a 'commodity' than any Page 3 girl ever has or ever will be. Gossip magazines make girls think the best thing in life is to get married to a rich footballer and that famous women exist only to be goggled at and judged.

I understand what you're saying and why they're a bad thing. However, it's not the actual nudity that's the issue, as I'd never want porn banned, it's its use as essentially marketing for a political agenda. A party political agenda at that, usually.

I think one of the weaknesses with our otherwise amazing midfield is that they are smaller in size. When it comes to quickness and ball-handling it is amazing as we have seen with its results, but when it comes to de-possesing and defending the likes of Yaya Toure it comes as a bit of a troublesome task. This year with Essien and Van Ginkel I think we'll definitely be more complete in the midfield to handle the likes of Yaya Toure, but it's going to be a close one this year. I personally think our team has what it takes to be competitive against ManCity and win, but I really would leave it almost at 51-49 odds in favor of them just due to their amazing depth in talent (not to say we aren't just as good, but God damn a striking core of Dzeko, Aguero, Negredo, and Jovetic is quite enviable).

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"I actually spent like an hour doing maths using the below sources, but its late and im starting to confuse myself. There are also a metric fuckton of unknown and unforeseeable variables which effectively make any attempt to calculate the two options ridiculous. 

So anyway my conclusion was that it doesnt actually matter, IF you have the common sense to immediately put into a pension the same amount of money you were pouring into mortgage overpayments, then its basically works out the same amount of pension in the end. However i suspect very few people would actually do that, and that its easier psychologically to put away a smaller regular amount over a longer period of time and pretty much forget it exists. It also saves you from the 'oh fuck im 50 and i have no retirement funds' rush over 15 years or so which might be pretty sucky to the quality of life you've gotten used to at that point. 

There's also the line of argument that not everyone wants or can afford to own a house in the current uk market. Putting the savings (renting is cheaper monthly speaking than a mortage/repairs/buildings insurance etc) that you make from not having a mortgage into it actually results in a pretty decent pension at retirement age - interestingly enough, on some calculations it results in a pension large enough at 65 that you could take the current 25% lump sum allowed from the fund on retirement and buy a house with it (258k lump plus £1980 a month income) when you retire. If you wanted to.

I got accepted to a Russell group university to do a course that came with a bursary and managed to land myself a part time local government job as well.

I'm not a rich person so I'm very careful with money. My local council repeatedly assured me that I qualified for four weeks of housing and council tax benefits thanks to the job irrespective of my degree, I thought that was wrong so asked three times to ensure that I was not being misled. 

A month into my degree I get an eviction notice from my housing association as the rent has not been paid, I just managed to cover that when the local council then decided that I needed to repay an overpayment to council tax and housing benefit from mid-August, four weeks before I started work and my degree. This I could not pay and I couldn't cope (due to scumbag family as well) so I had to drop out to cover the bills.

Now for years I have done everything by Email or letter but for this i did it in person so they have no record. I had the funds to cover things but had paid up bills after I had covered what my rent/council tax should have been so when they decided to be shit human beings I couldn't cover the costs.

Now a year on I simply have no interest in doing anything I’m happy to now get evicted and live rough as I reject a society that accepts such low standards.

First, this kid is awesome. Best kid in the world. Not a doubt in my mind.

Second, see first.

Third, that the parentals are so proud of their daughter's abilities that they chose to share with the world, sorry, but kind of awesome. 

Fourth, we've always taught her to be self sufficient, independent, and creative. No one helped, suggested, or even recommended that she take part or even go about any such creative endeavor. This was her's, from the beginning, uninterrupted. Good on you, Kid.

Fifth, your statement suggests that we are nothing more than people who let their kid watch TV simply based on her creative expression. It's exactly statements like this that we teach her why making assumptions about people, passing judgement, or categorizing people leads to inequity. Teaching my child to continue the process of quick, uninformed, unqualified judgement is to the detriment of society. I choose not to add to that problem, but wish to improve. 

Finally, if you passed over point one and two, read again. The kid is awesome. And that she can enjoy something, even as simple as a TV show, with her parents at minimum should suggest that we share common interests with our daughter and have the ability to make a connection that most parents fail to make. Perhaps, you should ask before posting next time, that there may be a possibility of other ideals, activities, philosophies, etc. we share with our daughter as well. But maybe your parents didn't watch TV with you.

true,alcalde,null,null,"&gt;You are deliberately underplaying the significance of what's been happening,

Nothing's been happening. Literally nothing. Life is exactly the same as before Snowden spilled his guts. What do you think has been happening? Mass arrests? Beatings? 

&gt; no one else is talking about grumpy cops or speeding tickets.

That's all that's going on here; routine enforcement. People get questioned at airports every day even if they're not partners of Glen Greenwald. 

&gt;People say it's becoming like 1984, not that we're already there. STASI level 
&gt;problems are exactly what we want to avoid. Read 1984 and the other books for 
&gt;yourself for a better idea, you know, educate yourself.

You mean endoctrinate myself in conspiracy-think? Been there, done that, got over it. 1984 is  a work of fiction, by the way, not a history book. My education comes from meeting and talking with real people who lived through real repressive regimes.

&gt;Simply saying 'well it's not that bad right now' is fucking retarded. It's getting 
&gt;there, 

No. No it's not. That's completely a figment of Reddit's imagination. Every time some gets a traffic ticket, or a cop picks their nose Reddit starts screaming ""Fascism!"" There's an entire subreddit dedicated to documenting the insanity, called /r/panichistory. Every year Reddit says the end of democracy is at hand; it's like Christians who forecast the Apocalypse year after year. 

&gt;getting worse and worse as time goes by. 

How so? 

&gt;How naive can you be? 

I'm not naive; I'm old enough to have some perspective and also knowledgeable enough about how conspiracy culture taints one's worldview. Every single insignificant fact gets plucked out as evidence of your theory; every fact that goes against it is planted by corporations/the media/the government. You begin to feel special because you, and possibly you alone, understand what's +really+ going on. Eventually you realize you don't and there's no big pattern that explains everything. It's like seeing animal shapes in the clouds. I was just reading a book that collected all the threads, interviewed all the people who supposedly knew things, that *proved* that the pilot who was shot down during the opening of the first Iraq War had survived, was captured, abandoned by the government, and held for years until he was killed before the second war. Of course, the book was written before we finally found his body a few years ago in the desert not far from where his plane went down. Sadly, there are people who dismiss this inconvenient fact out of hand and continue to cling to the conspiracy (how you dismiss an actual body with DNA and everything is beyond me, except these people are trained to reject anything a voice of authority tells them, and embrace anyone, no matter how unqualified, who tells them that everything everyone else believes is wrong). But the point is it's easy to selectively pick out third-hand testimony and insignificant details and see what we want to see in them. When we gain perspective, however, we realize that this doesn't amount to actual evidence.

&gt;Do you think we should wait until we lose more freedoms to complain?

I think you should wait until there's a problem before screaming that there's a problem, yes. It's like someone yelling ""Ouch!"" before you've yanked the band-aid off. 

&gt;And I am certainly not surprised that this happened, which is probably the worst 
&gt;of it. 

Why would one be surprised? This is what's +supposed+ to happen. When someone's ferried stolen secrets in the past, why wouldn't they be searched for stolen property at an airport?

&gt;You assume the people involved in this stuff are guilty of crimes and in the wrong, 
&gt;based on what information? 

I don't assume; I know. From the Guardian's own article on it: 

&gt;He was on his way back from Berlin, where he was ferrying materials between 
&gt;Greenwald and Laura Poitras, the US film-maker who has also been working on 
&gt;stories related to the NSA files released by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

Not everything requires Wikileaks to find out. Also, we know Greenwald's written the Snowden articles and we also know The Guardian paid for Miranda's flight (as did the authorities, most likely). 

&gt;What you've been told to think and spew out by some one else? 

And here comes the belief that there are two kinds of people: those who see things your way and those who are to blind or stupid to see things your way. It's this thread that has spewing - the same conspiracy nonsense, fascism, 1984 references, etc. There's precious little balance or reason on this subject on Reddit nowadays and what appears gets downvoted. 

&gt;Whose lives are in danger? 

Intelligence assets, soldiers in Afghanistan - as Manning himself admitted and has apologized for, and all citizens in the free world because terrorist groups have been enlightened as to how surveillance against them works. 

&gt;Who has been convicted of rape?

Assange jumped bail and is hiding in an embassy to avoid extradition. As Obama told the world if Snowden thinks he's done the right thing let him come home and face a jury of his peers, let Assange do the same thing. Ellsburg didn't defect to Russia after the Pentagon Papers nor did Deep Throat.

I used to think like a lot of the posters here, and then my mindset was worthy of concern. This stuff can become addictive and  all-consuming if you're not careful. Manning's are probably going to serve at least 20 years in jail because he let Assange's rhetoric get to him. 

&gt;Do nothing. All is in order. 

Sometimes it is. 

&gt;Police states only happen to other people, not here in Britain.

When there's no sign of any police state - nothing to worry about. 

&gt;These things take time, and its well on the way. 

And only a handful of kids on Reddit have seen through the plot? Here's the trick that helped me gain perspective: always ask yourself, ""Is this the most likely explanation... or the least likely explanation?"" When you realize it's the least likely explanation, you realize how high the bar needs to be for evidence, and that you haven't met it, and then you start to have clearer thinking about things (works for religious beliefs, ideological beliefs, conspiracy beliefs, etc.).

&gt;Perhaps we should just accept it? They're acting democratically and in our 
&gt;interest right?

Following laws passed democratically be democratically elected representatives and upheld by a constitutional court and specifically designed to protect the country from danger so... yes. Most emphatically yes. Ironically, it's people who dismiss the validity of laws passed by duly elected representatives because they conflict with their own beliefs/desires that are the initial catalyst for a more authoritarian state. I've seen this on Reddit too - lots of posters are ""blah, blah, unconstitutional, blah, blah"" and when presented with a ruling that shows law X is constitutional the next words they write are ""I don't care what any court says"", making them the actual threat to constitutional law.

&gt;We've no right to complain since, you know, North Korea exists.

Oh, you have a right to complain. The complaints aren't justified, of course, and by crying wolf people won't listen if there ever was a real problem. And since I've already been told that China isn't a dictatorship and Iran isn't really seeking nuclear weapons by Reddit, I'm sure some part of Reddit really doesn't believe that North Korea as portrayed in the media really exists - that it's a false image portrayed by Monstanto/the Koch brothers/George Soros/the Pope to create a false enemy for the sheeple ala 1984 and justify eternal war, etc., etc.

&gt;The only reason you're even able to have this talk about freedoms is because 
&gt;people have always fought and defended rights we have. 

Which has nothing to do with a bunch of people on Reddit whining like Chicken Little that the sky is falling... and comparing themselves to people who really have fought for rights.

&gt;When we see them come under attack, which is clearly what is happening here, 

It's not ""clear"", and no one's made a case for it. That's the hair-pullingly frustrating thing - everyone on Reddit keeps saying ""It's clear..."" this and ""it's clear...."" that, yet they've failed to present any evidence that anything's happening at all (including any illegal domestic surveillance). 

&gt;its our duty to raise awareness and do something. Even of that is simply 
&gt;expressing a discontent.

You can express all the dissent you want. But rabble-rousing impressionable young minds and possibly destroying their lives in the process (e.g. Manning, Snowden) is morally irresponsible and dangerous. It's no different than the American right-wing political commentators who go on air or write books proclaiming that their political enemies are ""destroying the country"" and then frustrated, depressed people take them seriously and go try to kill them (e.g. the Unitarian church shooting). People are being irresponsibly whipped up to frenzy levels on Reddit. 

&gt;If you think detaining journalists is ok, you're either misinformed or deliberately 
&gt;being contrary.

It's the law. The law makes it ok. And there's a difference between ""journalist"" and ""traitor"". If a journalist is stealing state secrets, yes you detain them, same as if they're screwing children or building a bomb in their basement. Journalists have no get of jail free card. Are you saying Miranda, who has served per Greenwald's admission as a courier of stolen documents in the past, should be allowed to waltz in and of airports? Even though the law specifically says he doesn't have that right and the things he's doing are illegal? What other laws do you believe people should be able to get away with if they live with a journalist?

&gt;News is what other people don't want published. Everything else is PR.

Sigh. And that's how cults convince people to ignore reality. Cults tell them that their family, friends, etc. are possesed by the devil/actually shape-shifting aliens/etc. and that they must be avoided. You must listen only to their supreme leader who has all the truth. They then isolate the victim from people who might bring balance or common sense to them. Dismissing all official reality in favor of your conspiratorial worldview serves the same purpose. Beware any belief/ideology that becomes non-refutable.

But there are a number of factors against us in the transfer window. The biggest factor appears to be the lack of Champions League. And the fact that gaining a Champions League spot this season won't be easy.

So, do we risk overpaying a bit before the window closes? Maybe for Willian or whatever so-called ""marquee"" player that is on our radar? Or would that just be a slippery slope into clubs attempting to get us to overspend?

I go back and forth on this issue.

As far as The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances and Midnight, I'm not sure. They are great episodes although I'm not sure why.

true,alcalde,null,null,"&gt;Yes, but it is an absolutely rubbish law which acts to remove our rights under the 
&gt;guise of protecting us from terrorism.

There's a fundamental difference between a law you don't like (and that's certainly a topic for discussion) and things happening +outside+ the law. This topic is being discussed as if it were some completely illegal happening, and this backtracking only occurs when it's pointed out that nothing illegal actually happened. A police state is not one in which laws passed by democratically elected representatives are followed to the letter. 


    sketchy person

&gt;What was so sketchy about him? The fact he was non-white, or the fact he was 
&gt;the partner of a prominent journalist involved in the NSA/GCHQ? 

1. He is associated with someone in receipt of stolen documents.
2. Per that journalist's own admission, they served as a courier for stolen documents in the past.
3. Their ticket was paid for by the newspaper that published the stolen documents.

4. They *actually were* ferrying documents this time, per The Guardian's own story. To quote:

&gt;He was on his way back from Berlin, where he was ferrying materials between 
&gt;Greenwald and Laura Poitras, the US film-maker who has also been working on 
&gt;stories related to the NSA files released by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

Sketchy-ness verified. 

&gt;I'm leaning towards thinking the latter, especially seeing that all his tech goods 
&gt;were confiscated after an interview in Berlin with someone about these 
&gt;revelations, where he'd have a lot of information on his laptop about it.

Exactly: the possibility that he was transporting stolen documents, which certainly seems possible given the admission in The Guardian article.


&gt;So just because it isn't as bad as East Germany during the Cold War we should 
&gt;let it slide? 

It isn't just not ""as bad""; it has no relation whatsoever in any way, shape or form. That argument would make sense if I were comparing the former East Germany to North Korea. However, the comparison of the UK to ... well, any authoritarian state is just laughable. Everything that happened here happened under a law put in place by democratically elected representatives and the police let the fellow go when the law said that had to - in other words, we saw the rule of law, not the rule of police or rule of force win out. That's the exact opposite of anything resembling a police state. If anything, it's a reason to waive the Union Jack and sing the praises of democracy. :-) 

&gt;He was offered a lawyer and a cup of water, but he refused both because he did 
&gt;not trust the authorities. 

One: that's hardly the act of an imposing police state. Two: refused water because he didn't trust authorities? Do you see the level of paranoia and the conspiratorial mindset that infects these people and quite possibly taints their writing? It's the same kind of silliness as we see here on Reddit. When's the last time UK police were found guilty of drugging someone in an airport?

&gt;This is the sort of attitude that allows us to slide towards less rights and 
&gt;totalitarianism. 

There's no slippery slope here; not even a sliding pond. Simply put: nothing of any consequence happened. Every law was followed, no one was harmed, the police had reasons to question this man, and life goes on. Democracy has not fallen, and the rule of law prevailing is a victory, not a defeat, for democracy.

&gt;We shouldn't ignore it just because other places in the world have been worse.

We should ignore the wild-eyed interpretations of what happened and any comparison between the IK and a police state.

&gt;   Is the detainment of the partner of a journalist involved in uncovering government secrets the same as a police officer not 
&gt;smiling at someone. No. 

Indeed not. The latter is actually worse because it may not be justified. ;-) 

&gt;Again, this is the sort of attitude that allows us to slide towards less rights.

What right? The right to steal documents? What right are you concerned about losing here?

&gt;And what does that have to do with terrorism? 

Telling terrorists how they're being spied on has everything to do with terrorism.

&gt;There is no law against speaking to people trying to avoid extradition for rape. 

And no one was arrested for doing so, were they? There is a law against being in possession of stolen property, and Assange, Greenwald and Snowden have all been so at some time. 

&gt; The government have no right to question people about that. 

They had a right to question people attempting to re-enter the country, and they did. Please don't say ""they have no right"" when Parliament quite clearly gave them that right. 

&gt;It also has nothing to do with terrorism, so why should David Miranda be detained under the Terrorism Act? 

If he's ferrying stolen goods, you detain him under any law you possibly can. That's standard operating procedure. 

&gt;It is obvious that the government were just using it as an excuse to try and scare journalists who try to question what they are 
&gt;doing, or uncover government secrets. 

They were trying to see if this man was ferrying stolen documents, and he was indeed in possession of documents of some sort. In other words: good call by the police. And yes, the government does have a duty to prevent people from uncovering government secrets, whether they're foreign spies or domestic journalists. There's a reason certain things are classified as secrets.

&gt;Detaining relatives of journalists who speak out against the government and confiscating their good is exactly what you would 
&gt;expect Eastern Germany, or any other police state to do.

He wasn't detained because someone ""spoke out"". He was detained because he appeared to be - and apparently was - on a courier mission. We don't know yet if what he had on him were stolen or state secrets.

&gt;'If you don't want to get in trouble with the government, believe all their spiel and don't ask questions'? 

No, if you know you can be questioned at the border, and don't want to be questioned, don't go flying in and out of the country. Especially don't go on document runs for a journalist who's publishing stolen state secrets. If I were to complete a series of flights to Afghanistan, Chechnia, Pakistan and then bought a final one-way ticket to the United States, it doesn't take a genius to expect I'm going to be questioned about my activities before being allowed entrance. And yes, that's perfectly legal and I should expect it. 

&gt;I'd like to stress again that neither David Miranda or Glenn Greenwald have done anything illegal, 

You'd be wrong. Greenwald has trafficked in stolen state secrets and endangered the security of his home country. 

&gt;just given challenged to the government and legally revealed secrets about it. 

""Legally revealed secrets"" - first the police following the law allowing them to question people somehow still means they had no right, and now Greenwald has some sort of magic law that allowed him to reveal classified secrets? What's the name of this law, especially given that Snowden is on the run and charged with three felony counts in the United States? How does that work? 

&gt;This is not justification to be questioned by the police and have goods confiscated. 

I'm really glad you're not border guard. ""Gee, here comes a guy who's run stolen documents before and he's traveling from a meeting with someone who's been in contact with the thief and the paper that published the documents paid for his ticket. Guess there's nothing to see here. Next!"" The UK's nuclear launch codes would be gone before your first shift was over. :-(

&gt;This is not what you expect in a country with free press.

Free press does not allow you to steal things or traffic in stolen things. The press does this despite the risk of prosecution, not because they're immune to it.

    Greenwald and his compatriots routinely break the law

&gt;Source? 

I have to cite a source for stealing or trafficking in stolen property being against the law? 

&gt;I couldn't care less is Snowdon broke a draconian law within the US, 

And here we go AGAIN. Yet another Redditor declaring that they don't care what the law is and have no problems with laws being broken that they personally do not like. The irony is completely lost that this is the same kind of authoritarian ""above the law"" attitude that they're trying to project onto the police, elected leaders and everyone else. 

Second, I don't think ""Please don't hack our servers and steal classified material you're not cleared to have access to"" is a draconian law that oppresses the people. Honestly, this argument is starting to get rather silly. 

&gt;all I care about is whether Greenwald or Miranda broke any laws which would suggest they should be detained under the 
&gt;Terrorism Act. I

No one needed to break any laws to be detained. The law gave the police the authority to do so, and they exercised it, including giving him access to a lawyer which he declined. They also released him when the law said they must. 



    betraying their country

&gt;So revealing that the government routinely spy on their own and other countries is 'betraying their country'? 

First... YES!!!!!! Second - there's no evidence of civilians being spied on for no reason, which is just a Reddit invention. Sifting through metadata or archiving data so that it's still available if a warrant is obtained later on is not the same as spying on citizens. Third - who doesn't know that every country on earth spies on other countries, including their allies? All this did was tip off bad guys to ways they can be spied on and encouraged them to find harder means to intercept. This opens up the country to harm and makes protecting lives that much harder. That is a betrayal. Oh, and bringing a laptop full of state secrets to the Russians that may  contain a complete outline of how the NSA and U.S. intelligence operations work? HUGE BETRAYAL OF COUNTRY. If Snowden believed he was so right he should have stayed in the U.S. like he originally claimed he would and faced a jury of his peers and plead ""just cause"" (the necessity to break the law to prevent a greater crime from taking place). Instead, he ran away, which says something about how confident he was in his position. 

&gt;Betraying the country to who? 

1) Al Qaeda, 2) the Russians, 3) Possibly the Chinese. They didn't let him go for nothing. 

&gt;What a load of jingoistic rubbish. 

Three felony indictments say otherwise, although there's been no formal charge of treason yet (probably to make it more difficult for him to claim political asylum). 

&gt;For the third time, this is the sort of rhetoric that leads towards totalitarianism.

Yes- suggesting people shouldn't steal or break the law will lead to totalitarianism. Sigh.....

&gt; 'Don't question what the government are doing, that's betraying the country and being unpatriotic!'.

Yes, because that's what Snowden did - he questioned things. It's not like he lied his way into a job working with classified data, hacked a server, copied classified material onto laptops, then gave it all to journalists, possibly the Chinese and the Russians or anything. 

&gt;    putting other people's lives in danger

&gt;Who's lives in danger?

Short answer is everyone in the free world. 

&gt; Who's lives did Greenwald and Miranda put in danger? 

See above. At least Manning admitted at trial that he now realizes the lives he put at risk through his actions (including leaking data on how U.S. troops diffuse IEDs). 

&gt;As I've said, when was it illegal to talk to someone who has (been perceived to) break the law?

The fellow was questioned, not arrested, so illegality doesn't come into play. But yes, if the police know person A is a drug importer and person B is a drug seller and they observe me drive from person A's house to person B's house, they certainly have reasonable suspicion to detain and question me. 

&gt;And what's wrong with that?

The tail end of the first season is fantastic, though, and you'll get more out of the show if you stick with it from Series 1.

If you REALLY struggle with the early episodes, skip ahead to Series 5 (2010, starts with 'The Eleventh Hour'). Production values are much higher, and the cheese value is considerably lower. Plus it's a natural starting point - new Doctor, new companions, new head writer and production staff.

Like I said though, you'll get more out of the later seasons if you stick with it from Series 1.

There is really no reason to try and start all the way back with 1963's Season 1 unless you're already legitimately hooked on the show. It's much slower paced, a LOT longer (26 seasons!), lower production values/budget, and 106 episodes from seasons 1-6 are lost due to the BBC wiping and reusing tapes in the 1970s.

I find your remarks that fans of Tennant are ""retarded"" and ""Tweens"" relatively offensive.  Not only because using the word retard to describe anybody is disgusting; but given that David Tennant is an excellent actor and gave an outstanding portrayal of The Doctor I think it is perfectly acceptable for fans to have him as their favourite.  

Whilst I understand and accept that ""old guard"" fans may find the transition into new who a relatively difficult concept (to the majority of fans I don't genuinely believe this, I am countering Heartnotes argument, so playing devils advocate); people have to move with the times.  There was a backlash when Davison took over, he is now considered great.  If you cannot accept Tennant as a great Doctor (whether you liked him or not) you should at least have the courtesy to accept that a lot of other people do and not be so offensive to people who you should be embracing into the Doctor Who family.  

Finally; before you think this is a ""retarded"" ""tween"" having a rant because they don't want Smith to leave and are concerned that the new doctor is old...Peter Capaldi is one of my favourite actors and I am very excited about him being the next doctor.

One thing I may add, if you read through the 2nd Sino-Japanese War article you posted, Churchill essentially wrote off the Chinese.

During the Pacific campaign the US and Japanese navies went head on with each other--the full force of the IJN went against a large portion, but not all, of the US Navy, comprising the majority of Allied forces in the Pacific (there was also considerable US Navy presence in the Atlantic.) 

Commonwealth naval forces played a moderate role, numbering only only [4 battleships, 12 carriers, 11 cruisers, dozens of smaller warships, 31 submarines.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pacific_Fleet)  Conversely, the United States Pacific Fleet consisted of [24 Battleships, 97 Carriers, 78 Cruisers, 725 Destroyers, 188 submarines](http://www.ww2pacific.com/shipcount.html)--the main effort.  Let's also keep in mind that much of the supplies/equipment the commonwealth used was provided by the Americans (TBM Avengers, Corsairs, Hellcats).  Hell, the Russians didn't even open a front in Hokkaido like they promised.

So, in essence, the US was the primary contributor to the Pacific Allied effort.

""Vector graphics"" are different from conventional images (such as .png's and .jpeg's) in that they use mathematical equations in order to map out shapes, rather than use a set number of pixels; essentially vectors are infinitely scalable, while .png's tend to get fuzzy when stretched out. Programs used to create vector graphics like Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape don't rely on the same tools and techniques as other digital media such as Photoshop or Paint Tool Sai. Whereas the latter are optimized to replicate traditional artwork, ie paintings or drawings, the former are typically used to create simple graphics. 

Minimalism is an art style that focuses on using as little as possible while still being recognizable. Since vector graphics require a large amount of skill to create ""traditional"" looking art, most vector artists use minimalism to their advantage.

true,BigHaircutPrime,null,null,"I whole-heartedly agree with you on this one. The solution to the mystery of Clara was so... simple. I had two theories that I'm sure would have made for MUCH more interesting stories:

1. Clara is the heart of the TARDIS: We've seen ""sexy"" before, but where does she come from? This theory, along with my second one, was heavily reliant on ""close reading"", as in looking closely at the themes and metaphoric language and imagery of each episode. Throughout the course of Clara's run, there's the reoccuring theme of the relationship between technology and humanity, and furthermore, identity (Oswin trapped inside the Dalek, Clara being downloaded through the wifi, the android from Journey, and the fact that the main baddy is The Great Intelligence). As well, we know that the TARDIS behaved oddly around her, so I figured that it was a reaction to two Clara's in the same space.

2. Clara is CAL. Once again, this is reliant on ""close reading"". I thought that Clara being turned into a Dalek and being downloaded into the wifi was foreshadowing her being the library supercomputer. The reason I loved this theory is because I was hoping Clara was introduced to save River Song, and that was the direction I was hoping we'd be going in. It's still a possibility that one of Clara's copies becomes CAL, but maybe we'll never know.

Also, I wish that the main Clara would have died or remained trapped. Because of the new older Doctor that will be introduced, it would be awesome to get a young companion, perhaps even a child. There would also be the possibility of a Clara child clone going off on adventures with the Doctor.

This type of opponent is the minority though. The issue should be addressed with depth, not replacement.

So basically overeducated for the position he holds. This guy tries to translate day to day events at the club into Shakespearian melodrama and its beyond fucking ridiculous. 

He really needs to stop attempting to write the definitive statement on everything before its even happened. One minute he's criticizing the club about the Reina situation and the next he waxes lyrical about Mignolet.

Now he's talking about Toure like everyone's brains exploded inside their heads watching the match. I mean, chill the fuck out Kristian Walsh. Skrtel was/is an all-action defensive wall. Carragher could only be described as such. Was Carragher an offensive player? Fuck no. The thing you can say about Toure is he came out amped and it showed. He jumped off the pitch. He worked hard. He hustled. But it was hardly some fucking revelation. This guy is so full of his own shit. In order to feed his desire to spin metaphors he makes an average day at the park out to be the be-all-end-all statement about everything that runs through his brain.

Sturridge doesn't grab games by the collar? Frankly speaking I remember a few performances last season where he did just that. Where it was his surprising dribbling, passing, and finishing ability that won us games. 

To say he doesn't pull Gerrard's is fucking silly. Gerrard only pulled Gerrard's every few games. Even at the top his game, it wasn't as if every game was one he took by the scruff of the neck. He's a legend and the best player I've ever seen. But he didn't boss every game. 

If you want to see Sturridge isn't world class, go ahead. No one would disagree at this point. But this article is trash. Sturridge is a solid striker who still is relatively inexperienced. To try to write the book on him now is just fucking stupid. Let's get him through a full season as a first choice striker for a club and then maybe we can start to say who and what he is and isn't.

So sick of this writer. I'd really love if we could stop posting his stuff. It makes my stomach churn. His eloquence far outshines his sense.

Seriously can someone tell me what the fuck he's on about, about Toure? Toure was great but on the lips of everyone?

EDIT:

""Toure’s style was met with a sort of suspicion originally, like discovering debris from a meteor shower in the back garden, but it did not take long for that to dissipate.""

WTF?! WTF! Give me a fucking break man. This shit does not belong in EVERY column you write. I am all for writers being eloquent when it calls for it.

true,fourth_floor,null,null,"&gt; Why not sign an attacking, in-the-air ball winning CB to pair with Agger? 

Like Kolo Toure? Toure has some of the best aerial duel stats in the Premier League and has always been a standout hard centerback who wins contests both on and off the ground. He is also one of the fittest and strongest players in the league. 

Wenger said when Toure signed and was running the tests that he has a level of fitness, strength and flexibility that he has never seen before. 

To add to those Toure has a career average of making more interceptions than tackles, which is the mark of a very good centerback. He also has solid passing stats and credentials in the area of being able to squeeze out of high pressure situations by maintaining his cool.

Agger not being as good in the air is ok as Toure is there to cover, but in those cases you really need a good defensive midfielder or central midfielder who can assist in aerial defense and we don't have anybody there. 

Papadopolous worries me because it was only this last season that he got his aerial duels back into 80%+ which is where it should be for a good centerback. Prior to that he was in the high 50's low 60's for 3 seasons. He also makes nearly 5 tackles per game and only  2 interceptions, on average. which suggests his positioning is weak.

We need an experienced centerback who is as close to a clone as Toure as possible, and possibly a further additional alternative centerback who can replicate what Agger brings to the team.

They're all fairly reliable, and if you're in London coverage won't be a problem. People have said that Vodafone tend to have 'deeper' coverage though, as in their network penetrates buildings better than others, which is good in London. I don't know if that's actually true or not though.

Customer service is generally quite shit so there's not much you can do about that.

Apart from that, all you need to compare is prices and work out what suits you. If you give me an idea of what budget you're talking, what kind of phone you want etc. i'll help you find one.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;A little over two months ago I was contacted by a very senior government official claiming to represent the views of the prime minister. There followed two meetings in which he demanded the return or destruction of all the material we were working on. The tone was steely, if cordial, but there was an implicit threat that others within government and Whitehall favoured a far more draconian approach.

&gt;The mood toughened just over a month ago, when I received a phone call from the centre of government telling me: ""You've had your fun. Now we want the stuff back."" There followed further meetings with shadowy Whitehall figures. The demand was the same: hand the Snowden material back or destroy it. I explained that we could not research and report on this subject if we complied with this request. The man from Whitehall looked mystified. ""You've had your debate. There's no need to write any more.""

&gt;During one of these meetings I asked directly whether the government would move to close down the Guardian's reporting through a legal route – by going to court to force the surrender of the material on which we were working. The official confirmed that, in the absence of handover or destruction, this was indeed the government's intention. Prior restraint, near impossible in the US, was now explicitly and imminently on the table in the UK. But my experience over WikiLeaks – the thumb drive and the first amendment – had already prepared me for this moment. I explained to the man from Whitehall about the nature of international collaborations and the way in which, these days, media organisations could take advantage of the most permissive legal environments. Bluntly, we did not have to do our reporting from London. Already most of the NSA stories were being reported and edited out of New York. And had it occurred to him that Greenwald lived in Brazil?

&gt;The man was unmoved. And so one of the more bizarre moments in the Guardian's long history occurred – with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents. ""We can call off the black helicopters,"" joked one as we swept up the remains of a MacBook Pro.

&gt;Whitehall was satisfied, but it felt like a peculiarly pointless piece of symbolism that understood nothing about the digital age. We will continue to do patient, painstaking reporting on the Snowden documents, we just won't do it in London. The seizure of Miranda's laptop, phones, hard drives and camera will similarly have no effect on Greenwald's work.

&gt;Maybe it's because there's a clearer majority in that city but each group has pretty strong representation? Compared to Belfast, Derry is more cohesive, perhaps?

I think that's kind of true. The city's Fountain estate still seems a little besieged at times, as a little Protestant estate surrounded on all sides. But in truth, the community there seem to have worked hard to keep their own sense of self whilst accepting the situation.

Derry's still far from perfect. There are still security barriers all over the place, and still incidents regularly. But I reckon the key bit is Dullahan4's point...
&gt;A lot of the people in Belfast taking part in the recent riots have probably either never been in the other community's areas or even intermingled with them, which only causes problems. It's a lot more common in Derry for the communities to mix, because of its size, and because all the good places to go out are in one sort of general area.

I now do community work in Belfast, and IMHO that's exactly right. I grew up a Prod with an Irish mammy in a mainly Catholic village in south Londonderry, went to a mixed school and had mates from both 'sides'.

true,ChelseaHistory,null,null,"I wrote in another post that Tottenham were the Everton of the south. The obvious comparison is with Liverpool – the appeals to the past, the nostalgia for better times, the belief that success is just around the corner. However the difference is that Liverpool were, up until very recently, the most successful English side. Their harking back to a better time was actually legitimate. Tottenham’s incredible superiority complex results from harking back to their colossal two league titles (the most recent of which was over fifty years ago) and their last FA Cup win (a mere 22 years ago). Even comparing them to Everton is incredibly generous – Tottenham were a good cup team in the 1960s and 1980s whose fans’ delusions of grandeur were allowed to spiral out of control.

Their current fans are in an extraordinary flux. Their youngest fans to have witnessed the club win a major trophy (i.e. League, FA Cup, European Cup) will have to be at least 27-28 to have any conscious memory of it, yet they still act as if they are one of the colossuses of English football.

What better representation of the current Chelsea-Tottenham rivalry is there than this? Whilst we have re-appointed the best manager in the world, Jose Mourinho, they have appointed our cast-off, the ersatz-Mourinho. Yet they still think they're bigger than us. Laughable.

Conclusion: Why do Chelsea hate Tottenham?

1967; 1975; the delusions of grandeur; the chips on the shoulder; the inability to recognise that the 1980s ended and time moved on; the reluctance to admit that Chelsea are a bigger club than they are; the reluctance to admit that big clubs’ sole aims stretch to more than finishing fourth.",0,1376990439,null,0,false,0,cbrgl22,t3_1kq2t6,t1_cbrgl22,t3_1kq2t6,null,1429766289,25,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,25

true,threesquares,null,null,"Don't ever, ever rent with Grant Management in Edinburgh. They will rip you off something shocking, and do it to generations of students. Really. Just Google them, and don't go anywhere near them. 

Edinburgh flats are beautiful, they really are, but they do tend to be single glazed so they can get COLD in the winter. Check to see whether you're on a pay as you go gas meter or get monthly bills. Pay as you go tends to be much more expensive. 

Find out how many people you'll be living with and what they're doing. A flat full of students doesn't pay council tax. If you're a professional this won't be the case, unless you're living on your own in which case you get a discount.

You can get great flats right in the very centre of the city. The Old Town (Marchmont, South Bridge, the Meadows) will probably get you the best deals as they're very popular student areas. Leith is lovely and quite up and coming, but a little more out of the way of the centre. The 22 bus runs up and down to it every ten minutes. The New Town costs more, but I could rent there as a student and live in a divine flat for two years, so it is worth looking at. 

Gumtree.co.uk is actually a really good resource for finding spare rooms in Edinburgh and I had a lot of success with it when I lived there, so do have a look. You'll probably have to pay a months rent as a deposit and then another month upfront, so you'll probably need somewhere around £700 to get yourself started. 

Edinburgh is one of the most beautiful places in the world to live (though I might be a bit biased...) and you'll have a blast.

chelsea have the option of going with moses on the right if they want to worry about manU as he offers the directness and power that may unsetttle the new villa left back. 
mata centrally should hopefully offer the villa defense problems.
on the left maybe give schurlle a start as the villa central defenders could be playing deep and that lets him cut in to uncongested areas. 

the central midfield i would like mikel and essien to start but would be happy with essien and ramires too. 

in terms of striker, it doesnt matter. lukaku is big and strong but okore is also a unit.

We all use fossil fuels and its releated industries that are slowly destroying the planet. We all in the west at least enjoy the benefits of the systematic rape of the third world, the plundering of its resources and the subjugation of its people. The list goes on. 

We do these things not because any of us are evil bastards, but because life is hard and people have to get on with it. We live in a self-destructive system. All of us are in the belly of the beast, and whilst we are all dependent on it to survive, the beast is slowly bleeding to death. I think this is why so many people have an almost visceral reaction to anything that would disrupt the system. Fracking is _clearly_ not the best thing for the planet. It actively harms it in every conceivable way. But the possibility of what might happen if we don't do it or anything else to solve the energy crisis is fucking terrifying for many. Not many people are radical, especially not in this country.

I think the situation causes a lot of guilt. I think people react to the guilt of this mostly with denial. It manifests itself most usually as the typical right-wing ""well everyone else is to blame"" response. _The poor, weak and vulnerable in the world are responsible for their own plight; why should we do anything to help them?_ Other people go off the deep end and become convinced the world is the way it is because of lizard people.",0,1376993241,null,0,1376993462,0,cbrgy5q,t3_1koana,t1_cbrgy5q,t1_cbr5yvu,null,1429766119,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk for the HMIE reports (although they are sooooo out of date now)

My advice is to visit the nurseries and ask the following questions. Go for the one you feel most comfortable with. Lastly do this as early as possible the good ones have waiting lists.

Things to look for when choosing a day nursery:

    Are the children calm, safe and happy?
    How many staff are qualified and to what level?
    Are the staff listening to children and answering them carefully?

Not whilst they don't acknowledge their own failings!  It is the cry of get your own house in order first.  Tax, Zero Hour Contracts, etc.

Also why the hell are you defending it?!  The ONS says there are more than 2M enterprises paying tax in 2012, that lost tax works out at £14k each on average (assuming a simple distribution), now IIRC those figures include tiny businesses that claim mileage for a car fraudulently etc.

The point is it is perfectly legal to dodge the way GMG did.  But you don't encourage a protest against Vodafone without getting your house in order first.  Not least when you get a tax refund next year because you declare a loss!

That behaviour is completely inexcusable.

&gt;The Guardian is of course not without flaw and I find some pieces in it irritating but their is a clear distinction between it &amp; the Mail the gulf is vast.

Is it? Is Littlejohn worse than Penny?  Both spout utter drivel in comment.

Has the Daily Mail told people which way to vote in the last election?  I don't care if it is printed in Comment, one does not invoke a brand in such language and allow if.  Someone can't print in comment ""company x supports y"" if it isn't true without discovering the *joys* of UK libel laws.  This is a massive score against the Guardian.

In one of the above posts, I found 3 articles on Egypt, from the DM, Economist, Guardian.  The Economist was vastly better than the others.  The DM and Guardian weren't much different.

For every DM article about some horribly ugly single mum who is cheating something or other, there is a Guardian one which is equally low on content and just as emotive (ok, it might not be a one to one line up).

I don't know I would think of it as insidious exactly but, yes.

 
&gt;We are all complicit in the way the world works. We all use fossil fuels and its releated industries that are slowly destroying the planet. We all in the west at least enjoy the benefits of the systematic rape of the third world, the plundering of its resources and the subjugation of its people. The list goes on.

Well, sort of. Yes we are all part of the machine. But most of us are indoctrinated to see the world from a certain perspective. How much responsibility can you attribute to anyone? It's the system man! 

The plebs' minds are fucked by media and the education system and the minds of the Etonian fucks are mush too. They have no idea. 

&gt;We do these things not because any of us are evil bastards, but because life is hard and people have to get on with it. We live in a self-destructive system. 

It's the system man! 

You get this, you know more. What can be done? 


&gt;I think the situation causes a lot of guilt. I think people react to the guilt of this mostly with denial...

Yeah, agree with you there. I think there are lizard people in the sense there is an elite club that looks out for their own interests which largely involve destroying the planet but they are all just wrapped up in the machine, the matrix, whatever we should call it. 

The ""Illuminati"" type of narrative or Dave's lizards are comforting to people who know something isn't right and it attributes agency to a conscious force that has a plan. It seems equivalent, in my eyes, to a  Satan, where you have an identifiable foe who is responsible for the problems we see around us. What lies underneath the interest in Icke's type of story is at least a perception that the story accepted by the majority isn't right. 

For that, Icke trumps Newsnight because the Beeb pretends that things are more or less in the right place.

Like someone mentioned above ""Supposedly 100% of Cumbria's cameras are functional where as Lancashire is at 12%."". I only know of one camera in my area that actually works but i don't really want to put that to the test.

I mostly just look out for mobile speed cameras in the back roads around here. They are the worst.

**Side note**:
I have just noticed you commented saying the camera was facing you! I shouldn't worry about it too much, i don't think they will even bother trying to identify you! Unless you repeatedly do it.

true,PancakeDoomsday,lfc12,,"I don't know. I mean, yeah he's not worth that much but his club overpaid to begin with. And it's not like they're being forced to sell (like a transfer request) as much as they're forcing themselves to sell with recently shitty financial management.

Sometimes you have to overpay, flex some muscles. No one wants a repeat of the Downing/Carroll/Henderson bids (not to mention anything Hodgson fucking pulled out of his ass, though I think we're miles from that saga finally), but how many of those players were going to go directly to Arsenal or Spurs or whomever else we were trying to catch in 4th at that time? I really don't recall. Nor did we look to be as promising then as we do now. With a few marquee signings, consistency, and a bit of luck 4th isn't impossible this season.

I've only seen a few of Willian's performances, but I recall a few Champions Leagues games, in particular one of the Chelsea matches which is where I had first heard of him, and i remember thinking, ""okay, so which club is he going to next?"" I was thinking a Chelsea or Milan or the likes. Never thought we'd be in a position to sign him.

Now that we are, I think if €35m is grossly overpaying for him then we're in for a tough few transfer windows. Coutinho+Sturridge was incredible, and if we can continue to make deals like that we'll be greatly improving. Thing is, CL-aiming clubs can and will spend like CL-revenue clubs (aside from Arsenal, obviously) and I'm sure most CL clubs' won't shoot themselves in both fucking feet and proceed to stick said bloody feet in their mouths like G&amp;H had been doing for awhile, nor will too many clubs spend what we did during the Comolli years on who we spent it on. Willian now is better than Downing, Carroll, and Henderson were then and is probably better than they all are now as well. 

How can FSG make-up for agregious spending a few seasons back? The manager's a great start, the signings since have been great, the public letter was classy and the on-going Suarez saga has been masterfully handled (so far). But don't be afraid to gamble when the odds appear to be so tantalizingly in our favor. Spend big again and win this time.

The idea that Brussels imposes laws on the UK without our parliament's agreement is a patent falsehood fed to you by the Conservatives, UKIP and the right-wing press. There's a [very good website](http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/blog/index_en.htm) run by the EU's press office which specifically debunks bullshit like this. 

Secondly, there are many, many arguments about fishing laws / zones / restrictions, but most of them agree that the North Sea and northern Atlantic are drastically overfished and - without coordination between countries - we'll be accelerating an ecological catastrophe. 

The membership fee is harder to quantify. It comes down to a personal opinion on whether the diplomatic benefits outweigh the financial ones. 

Propping up less developed members: well, some might argue that the UK, which benefited for so many years from colonial exploitation, has something of a duty of care to help societies in direr financial straits. But the EU membership budget is far outweighed by our general international development aid budget, which current stands at nearly £8bn annually. I assume you're one of those people that would happily scrap all aid to foreign countries, in which case there's nothing worse I can wish for you than to be the person you so clearly are. 

Ah, ""more democratic"". The classic warcry of right-wing middle England. It's more democratic to privatise the energy companies, for example, and have them operate the cartel they're currently running. It's more democratic to privatise healthcare because it will give the consumer more choice. It's more democratic to privatise public transport, with the result that rail increases alone have outstripped inflation for the last decade.

And then one day the best thing ever happened to me. I was there at a rolling road waiting to get my awesome shitbox Austin Maestro tuned whilst a rally car was being finished. As the rally car was driven off the rolling road the owner asked if I would like a ride as he was going to take it for a quick blast to test it. No need to ask twice.

We set off up this hill on tarmac with the rear end squirming from side to side in the first three gears then a sharp right without slowing down through a gate onto a dirt track. We got faster as we went down this track and when we got to a 90 degree right he didn't even slow down but flicked the wheel and the car did what it was told.

The fact UK bond yields barely budged during the entire post election uncertainty, and remained in fact among the lowest risk in the world is not indicative of a panic over the credit worthiness of the UK.

Gilts are laid on out on incredibly long term basis, with very stable rates, and rooted in a number of very clear, very substantial components of the british economy. They are totally unlike the debt financing systems of countries like Greece, and Italy, where large amounts of money needed to be found rapidly as debt matured, and investors were asked to take much shorter term bets. 

There is NO problem whatsoever with minority governments and markets. Other nations use them as a matter of course. They are perfectly competent at embarking upon austerity measures, and the markets are perfectly aware of that.

Moreover, in terms of austerity measures, the vast majority of things this government has done in terms of cuts could have been done as a minority government, with a confidence and supply arrangement. Departmental budgets do not need to pass as acts of parliament.

There is a fetish in the UK political culture that minority governments are insanely unstable, and completely incapable of government, and that the markets can't handle them. Its totally untrue.  

The media in the UK got caught up in a post election nonsense of ""OH MY GOD, this is CRAZY, the INSTABILITY, we HAVE NO GOVERNMENT"" No one else in any European democracy thought this.

I have a good friend who is a Spurs fan, and he admits that CFC is much the superior, far above Spurs. He also doesn't have a chip on his shoulder, or delusions of grandeur. 

By holding onto these negative stereotypes, are we actually just paving the way for years of ignorance, when actually, new fans are being born every day, and they only experience the footballing world that we create. If we keep saying we hate Spurs, then young Chelsea fans of today will grow up hating Spurs. And vice versa. Personally, i'd rather follow a league that frowns upon hatred.

It is all well and good to say the laws should be weaker because of situations like this but that presents a huge problem when distinguishing between much more serious leaks and this.

Not to mention that the vast majority of the time the law is more severe because those who will be caught by it will be those who took extra responsibilities and legal restraints in order to get into the position that results in intelligence leaks.

And you can go to jail for failing to provide a key that they can prove you have or know. That is a solution to a very real problem caused by modern technology. A door can be broken down. A safe can be cracked. An encrypted drive can't be cracked. The police can only require someone to provide the key where the harddrive itself was collected by otherwise legal means. 

It prevents the police having to get the permission to collect the physical drive or encrypted data and then having to go back and get further permission to unencrypted it. If they have the legal authority to collect the harddrive itself they also implicitly have the authority to read the data on it.

Now, the Telegraph has nothing about it on the front page, the closest post two blogs, the one you posted and one slating the Guardian for overplaying the issue. The Daily Mail also has the story, but it is much further down and under more show-biz stories (like a bigger thumbnail for something about Coronation Street).

true,Clbull,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"Remember how those protests died down heavily after a day and the protestors whimpered away in defeat and sulked to themselves the moment the tuition fee trebling was passed through Parliament?
The problem with the Student Protests of 2011 were that they were not a widespread and continuous movement, but were rather defined by an isolated incident in London - widely reported by major news networks - where [the bottom floor of Millbank Tower was smashed up.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ooOPYsA2Mk) Now imagine if the student protests were of a much larger scale, were more widespread than just London and continued in a similar or even growing strength after the first day, let alone after tuition fees were actually trebled.

I'm not condoning widespread riots. What I am saying was that not even students are very good political activists these days. The Student Protest was an embarassing joke-of-a-movement and even made Occupy Wall Street look promising. There was a clear purpose but people didn't protest enough. If you think the government is going to listen merely to a bunch of 17 - 18 year olds taking a single day off to walk around with placards... think again.

Completely different issue and circumstances but did you see the Catholic community of Northern Ireland keep quiet about the Widgery Tribunal after it was published and basically exonerated the British Army for killing 14 civilians? No. If anything the situation intensified to the point where large parts of Northern Ireland were heavily segregated and became no-go areas during the 70s and 80s. The whitewash was (understandably, seeing as unarmed civilians were murdered on that day) such a big issue that one of the IRA's key demands as part of the Good Friday peace agreement was an independent inquiry. That condition, which Tony Blair agreed with, would produce the Saville Report.

Our government didn't agree to this inquiry because of one isolated protest but rather due to a long period of political unrest from the Catholic community that culminated in decades of sectarian violence between Republican and Loyalist paramilitary groups. 

Or let's look to a different part of the world. Egypt and Tunisia ousted their leaders not through one isolated protest but through a widespread and continuous movement.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"Interesting to see an article from another point of view, but the writer completely fails to realise that he was held for *9 hours* under an *anti-terrorism* act.

Before the anti-terrorism act came in, we already had plenty of laws to allow someone suspected of smuggling contraband/drugs/data to be stopped and searched at entry to/exit from the country. But these laws had to have some sort of ""probable cause"" and couldn't hold someone for that long without charge.

The anti-terrorism act basically allows authorities to ""arrest"" a person for 9 hours with no probable cause or evidence to show any link to terrorism. This is supposed to be used to stop an imminent threat of attack, when it would take too long to get a court order or something.

Clearly, there was no danger of imminent attack by this individual. So the only reason to detain him using the anti-terrorism act is to inconvenience him for as long as possible without the need for any probable cause, evidence or court order. It is 100% straight-up abuse of the act.

The author completely ignores this distinction. In fact, the author is going for a bit of character assassination, suggesting that this man totally deserved to be detained for 9 hours. He's also trying to paint the Guardian as expecting to be exempt from these rules and by doing so completely missing the point.

The anti-terror act should never have been allowed in the first place. It has been abused countless times already on individuals who have no choice but to let it slide. In a way, the police have done a really stupid thing by using it on such a high profile individual, such that it is now becoming a public embarrassment, calling attention to just how ripe for abuse this act is.",0,1377004577,null,0,1377004864,0,cbrix1d,t3_1kq676,t1_cbrix1d,t3_1kq676,null,1429765202,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,SEMW,null,null,"&gt; This is why we need a written constitution. The Americans are slightly crazy people, but at least their freedom of speech and press is pretty well protected.

Don't see that the second sentence implies the first.

Protection of freedom of speech in the US is stronger than in the UK, because the wording of our provision is [more heavily qualified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Right), the US wording is more absolute. On the other hand, some other rights are stronger in the UK than the US (e.g. the [right to education](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/II/chapter/2), the [ban on the death penalty](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/3), or the [right to home &amp; family life](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/7) that Theresa May hates so much). If you're concluding that the single, written-constitution US model is better than the UK model because protection of X is stronger in the US, why not equally well conclude that it's worse because protection of Y is stronger in the UK? Answer: it's neither, the two issues are orthogonal.

True, it'd be difficult to get agreement to amend the ECHR to give stronger free speech protections - but then, it's also difficult to amend the US constitution to add rights it's deficient in.

(The only way in which the US model is absolutely stronger is that the effect of the courts striking down a provision as incompatible is immediate (the law no longer has force), wheras in the UK a s.4 DoI needs to wait for the SSHD or parliament to fulfil their obligation to amend (which, to be fair, they have been reasonably good about doing). Though an s.3 compatible reading, which is often all that's necessary, is effective immediately).",0,1377006210,null,0,1377007028,0,cbrjc8p,t3_1kq28m,t1_cbrjc8p,t1_cbrha45,null,1429765004,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Willian played in a Shakhtar side that I believe presented one of the most fluid 4-2-3-1's in Europe last year, Willian was the jewel of the crown.

They set up much like I imagine Liverpool want to set up or Chelsea did last season (Willian - Countinho - Suarez or Oscar - Mata - Hazard). The idea is that you have 3 guys who operate behind the striker and are fed the ball from the guys behind (e.g. Lampard, Gerrard) or it is knocked back by a striker that can involve the midfield. These three then look to do the bulk of the offensive work chiming together to add width, creativity, possession and goals.

Shakhtar rocked Willian (Anzhi) - Fernandino (City) - Mkhitaryan (Dortmund). I am not the only one how noticed how strong these guys were, as you can see big clubs came in for all 3. Play style wise they had great communication and were able to swap positions fluidly to unsettle defenders, from there they took advantage of the space and/or overlaps created to build into attacking plays. It was pretty damn good, they really took it to serious sides like Chelsea and Juve in the CL and from memory Willian was MOTM in a game where Shakhtar thrashed Chelsea. 

Willian is a player that is comfortable operating anywhere in the attacking area. He will create space via his movement and look to convert it into chances. I would actually say that is his big asset, he moves around well and is able to connect/convert midfield possession into attack by creating space/opportunities for others. What he does can't really be captured in youtube videos, picture a guy who is as dangerous without the ball as he is with it. Playing on the left he picks the right time to sprint over to the right and work with the RFB/RW to get in behind the defence. He is quick enough to hold the width on the left and if the ball comes into him whip in a dangerous cross or draw a few man and pass. The kicker? He is as two footed as they come and can do the exact same on the right. Hell he is even quick enough between the ears to operate as a 10.

I really rate Willian and after bashing the Ukranian league and seriously impressing in the CL I am willing to bet his skill will transfer to the premier league. There is a reason Anzhi dropped £30m+ on him 6 months ago and a reason Spurs/Liverpool have bid £30m+ now. If I had to compare him to a current EPL player I would say he is like Hazard but doesn't shoot/score as much. He would be a certain starter in spurs 11 and I think it is fair to say he is an extreme upgrade on the likes of Lennon, Townsend and Chadli.

&gt; (a)involves serious violence against a person,

&gt; (b)involves serious damage to property,

&gt; (d)creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or

To compound the problem, the player goes to the club that sits between us and our 4th place target, an extra £40m plus in Champions League revenue. The net gain for Spurs here is something we can't overcome with a single signing, heck - with the window they have had it is going to take us years to overcome their advantage.

Absolute insanity.

edit: and lets be frank here, we missed out because we didn't have the money available. no club in their right mind is going to bid up to that point and then let spurs have it, not after already missing out on so many targets and not with so much fan expectation and certainly not to strengthen your direct rival. £25m transfer buget + £4.5m net from transfers means we could only go to £30m. That also explains the stupid 50% sell on clause - we simply didn't have the cash so we padded out our offer with bullshit. It is Dempsey redux, except this player is a world beater and makes a heck of a lot of difference.

My second view on this would be wait one season and bring back loaned players once again. I wouldn't mind second place and maybe an FA Cup for this season. We have a very young squad and it's expected that they might not reach the same standards as a well experienced ManCity team. This is how I would see it: 


Chalobah will return as an extra option for DM/CB and. Plus, Mourinho has said he expects Chalobah to return by next season after his loan (most likely to a EPL team). Then there is Romeu who can return if he does great at Valencia.We could also give McEachran a chance to fill out the CM spot and I'm sure next year Van Aanholt will finally return to Chelsea because of Cole aging.


But despite some returning loanees I would still like one world class striker before the transfer window ends. Possibly Rooney but his price tag and wage puts me off. I wouldn't mind Eto'o for 2 years but the Anzhi coach seems to be trying to keep Eto'o. And if Lewandowski comes, he will take Lukaku's spot as the starting striker for the next 6+ years, which I don't want because Lukaku has a really high ceiling and is perfect for the squad.

Westminster put up petty bureaucratic and funding blocks on the Welsh Assembly for the duration. Eventually public works projects got derailed and while Wales eventually got all the money the overhead of having Westminster act like a bunch of children for 12 months meant it was essentially wasted.

I am absolutely chuffed by the romantic idea of building a squad of youngsters who gel together over the years, become almost like a family and then ruthlessly steam-roll over their competition, because they can play with their eyes closed, that's how familiar with each other they are. 

But... I just don't think that's possible in this league and at this time. One assumes that we will be able to keep on recruiting promising young talents. But even Man City now have a world class academy. There simply isn't competition just for established players, but also for youngsters. 

If we can discover unpolished gems, why can't City? And if they can't, why can't they just buy our scouts or Academy talent? Kind of like we did to other clubs. 

A modern competitive club is a bit like a modern full back or lone forward - they need to do it all to be able to be consistently at the top. A full back needs to be defensively astute but also provide in the final third. A forward needs to score, but also hold up play, win the ball back and create. 

A modern club needs a top academy and top coaches from the lowest levels up. But it also needs worldwide marketability to attract money. It needs trophies to attract the markets as well as players. And it needs money. Money to make sure its academy is the best, its staff the most proficient and that, should it need a specific player to strengthen, it can pay for said player. 

If we just become an academy side without trophies, the players will move on. We will lose the markets. No one in Asia or Africa is going to support a side that occasionally reaches the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. Not for long, at least. And the money we make by selling players? We will be happy if it'll be enough to make sure other clubs don't steal our targets and our staff. 

No, I fear this is a crucial time for Liverpool. We need top 4 competitiveness now. Already we are losing Suarez if we don't reach top 4 this season. I still think we can survive if we get it the season after. What we cannot do is count on that player loyalty and good vibrations will get us to the top five years from now.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"&gt;However, the two defensive-midfield pivot positions concern me.  


&gt;Typically one needs to be an anchor who protects the defense, provides cover and retains possession (Carrick, Javi Martinez, Busquets...).

These are common misconceptions. 

Our major issue last year was being caught on a counter (overload the wings against Cole or whatever right backs we have; case and point: Man United at home, Shaktar home and away, Juventus and West Brom away are prime examples) and giving up space in front of the defence because those in attack did not take enough responsibility to put in a defensive shift. 

We scored a lot in the beginning of last season but were overcommitted, due to the height of players on the pitch, coincidentally this is when Torres scored a numerous amount of goals for us. Rafa came in, the amount of goals dried up a bit, but our ""wingers"" and number ten came back to put bodies in front of the ball, which stopped a lot more goals coming our way as they couldn't bypass our lone two midfielders on the counter. 

In the midfield we are absolutely fine, we would not play a system that doesn't conform to the players we have, unlike AVB playing a high line against Arsenal twice and Liverpool.

Current players:
* Van Ginkel
* Lampard
* Mikel
* Ramires
* Essien
* Oscar (at a stretch when needed)

Lampard played unbelievably last game in what you call the pivot, but what I call a more box-to-box figure. Ramires played the same style. These two are complete work horses; providing defensive capabilities (Lampard does have these in abundance) and support on the edge of the box. 
Watch how when Lampard moves up the pitch, how one of our attackers will drop back to provide cover. This didn't happen last season and a cleared ball was not contested in many instances. 

Oscar had been given more room to move longitudinally and longitudinally in the number ten role. 

Hazard and De Bruyne were constantly up the pitch providing Cover

Mourinho knows what he is doing and so do the back room staff. 

We are a bit thin on the Centre back position, possibly being short by one player, but bear in mind that looking at our squad, in defense we effectively have sufficient cover for all positions

* Essien can play anywhere along the back line counting as interim cover in case of injury or suspension. 
* Ivan (if needed), Terry, Cahill and Luiz
* Bertrand and Cole for left back
* Ivan and Dave (Azpilicueta) for right back 

At most I think one more centreback would be useful but remember, we have a squad of 25 maximum with requirements on the registration of players. If we do not meet the minimum requirements for any of them, we have to give up a space in the squad per infraction.

He looked a world beater because not much else was going on in our squad. Benteke, Michu, and Lukaku had similar seasons and Suarez actually had a better season. That's just in the league. 

Bale is not even close to Messi or Ronaldo. Not even remotely close. Bale more or less is a powerful and accurate left foot and good foot speed. Wherein Bale will beat someone in a foot race and then put in a great cross, Messi will weave between 3 players with the ball tethered to his foot and then take out an entire defense with a perfect weighted pass. The level of sophistication in the games of Ronaldo and Messi far surpasses our Bale currently, and that's why I think Bale wants to leave. He sees how much Ronaldo has come on in the last 3 seasons and wants that for himself.

He doesn't have the vision or even really the trickery that either of those two have. He doesn't do particularly well in a congested midfield, and he doesn't have a right foot for much other than standing on. He's exceptional at what he does, but he has a very definite ceiling unless he opens up his game a lot. 50m is really good business for Bale, to be honest, if you're talking market valuation relative to other big signings. In no way does he offer more to a team than Ibra or Cavani, and I would straight swap Bale for Cavani in one minute. Hell, if he were a few years younger, I would take Ribery.

Just because Real Madrid is willing to pay stupid money for him doesn't mean he's actually worth it. I would honestly not be surprised if he went to Madrid and struggled.

I also can't help but think that some of the new signings were intrigued by the club because of Bale. Paulinho had that quote while we were in the process of signing him that he was assured Bale would stay, or something along those lines. With Levy being the business man that he is I find it hard to believe that he didn't dangle Bale in front of some players to get them to choose Spurs over other clubs and I can't help but feel that some of those players are going to feel a bit disappointed. Not that it's something that they wouldn't get over eventually but it could have some effects on the pitch.

I am more concerned with the psychological effect it is going to have on the squad as a whole. It is obvious CL is our goal this year, we have splashed down the money to make it happen, but I am much more concerned with some of the players becoming disheartened by the fact that we let our one superstar go and them starting to think that maybe the club is not sincere in its goals.

I think we have proven that we are willing to make a run for CL financially but I feel that selling Bale could make us look more like a feeder team rather than a team that is making a run for bigger things.

I remember the last time Tesco got involved with digital downloads: they rebranded a service from MusicNet around 2006 to sell DRM-encumbered music tracks.

It didn't really work.

My wife bought about a dozen tracks and then couldn't work out how to put them on a CD for her car, so asked me to do it.

About half of the tracks couldn't be converted (decrypted for conversion to CD-Audio format) by Windows Media Player; I downloaded one of the broken tracks again and the conversion worked (no idea what the problem was).

When I tried a repeat download of some of the other broken files, the second download still didn't work. I tried to download one of the tracks a third time, and discovered that the DRM only allowed two downloads of each track, so I'd already hit the limit.

There was also a hard limit on how many times I could copy each track to a CD (three? four?) which meant I wasn't willing to keep trying to burn these things to CD when the process kept failing.

So we'd paid for all this music (admittedly only about a tenner, but...) and half of them were usable, the others were not fit for purpose.

Tried to get a refund, but heard nothing from them. Never got anything back. No refund, no apology. No technical support worth anything.

Some might say that having paid for the tracks, I was perfectly entitled to torrent the damn things because it would be easier and it would actually work. I couldn't possibly comment on that. I will simply add that I did get her the music she wanted, and it wasn't from Tesco.

Since that experience, I only buy music in non-DRM formats: MP3 or CD.

Also, I can't see us falling away any time soon as firstly we have a young squad which will keep improving and secondly there always domestic cup competitions up for grabs which have European implications and show that you're capable of winning silverware.

As a less desirable club at the moment, surely we are going to have to pay more to attract top talent,  so FSG are in a position where they will have to overspend at one point or another if they want to compete at the highest level.

 In terms of quality, it would be 'overpaying', but talent is thin at the moment, and if you're spending big it makes the club more appealing to players as you're showing a commitment to strengthening the squad. Tottenham have brought in all those players despite not having Champions League football. 

It worries me FSG never seem interested in a bidding war.  The transfer window, like weekly football, is a competition, and you have to be willing to actually compete.  Sure you don't want to overpay for a player, but if every other club is overpaying for players then that's just what you have to do.  I hope I'm wrong, but these points do warrant legitimate concern.

Benteke, Michu (played most of last season as a striker), Lukaku and Suarez are all strikers. How are you now comparing what Bale does as a winger with them when you say they had similar seasons? In the amount of goals they scored? And Messi, he plays upfront too - but Messi is out of this world, there isn't anyone like him playing right now and he's *arguably* the best player to have ever graced a football. 

What Bale did last season was nothing short of spectacular. Since his CL debut 2010-2011 he's done nothing but improve and won us quite a few games almost out of nothing - West Ham at home obviously stands out, his 2 goals at Lyon including the winner, or the final goal against sunderland in our last game at the 90th minute. The list goes on.

In all honesty, I think the only person one could accurately compare Bale to is another winger, Ronaldo. Is he as good as cristiano? No. But remember Ronaldo is 5 years older than Bale and at Bale's current state, there's no telling where his ceiling is. And Ronaldo does have his ups and downs too, where was he against Real Betis this weekend? Saying that those who compare Bale to the likes of Messi and Ronaldo don't watch them play week in week out is a bit disingenuous too. There's a reason he won Player of the Year 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 and was voted into the UEFA team of the year 2011 in our first outing in the CL. There's also a reason why Real Madrid are spending crazy money on him too.

Every reason to sell Bale is a head reason. By that, I mean it has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with passion, nothing to do with what it was like seeing him pick up the ball at West Ham, minutes from time, and stun Jussi Jaskalainen from 30 yards. It has nothing to do with how exciting his new free kick technique is, nothing to do with the story of how he was given freedom by Harry and then scored a 5 minute hat trick at the San Siro, against the reigning European champions. It has nothing to do with WHY I SUPPORT TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR.

If I supported a football team for head reasons, I would support Man United or Chelsea or Man City (gooners still lose out because I like to see a club winning trophies). If my decision to allocate a portion of my happiness to whether a club did well or not was a rational one, I wouldn't choose one of the most unpredictable clubs in the Premier League.

But I do.

Watching Bale play in the Premier League last season made me proud to be a Spurs fan in a way I have never felt before. It is something that excites and delights me, something that puts lightning in my veins every time I pull up YouTube to watch a compilation of his goals.

Screw 93 million and screw Real Madrid, Man United, Man City, Barcelona, Chelski and the gooners too (just because). There are some special things that money can Never buy OR replace.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; There's a fundamental difference between a law you don't like (and that's certainly a topic for discussion) and things happening +outside+ the law. This topic is being discussed as if it were some completely illegal happening, and this backtracking only occurs when it's pointed out that nothing illegal actually happened. A police state is not one in which laws passed by democratically elected representatives are followed to the letter.

True, but that is one of the main points. It may have been legal, but the fact that this law is in place in the first place is utterly atrocious, especially when used in this way. 

&gt;1. He is associated with someone in receipt of stolen documents.
2. Per that journalist's own admission, they served as a courier for stolen documents in the past.
3. Their ticket was paid for by the newspaper that published the stolen documents.
4. They *actually were* ferrying documents this time, per The Guardian's own story.

Yes, but that has nothing to do with terrorism, but he was questioned under the Terrorism Act. This further brings into question this Act in the first place.

&gt;It isn't just not ""as bad""; it has no relation whatsoever in any way, shape or form. That argument would make sense if I were comparing the former East Germany to North Korea. However, the comparison of the UK to ... well, any authoritarian state is just laughable. Everything that happened here happened under a law put in place by democratically elected representatives and the police let the fellow go when the law said that had to - in other words, we saw the rule of law, not the rule of police or rule of force win out. That's the exact opposite of anything resembling a police state. If anything, it's a reason to waive the Union Jack and sing the praises of democracy. :-)

As I've said in other posts, this is the sort of attitude that let's us side towards totalitarianism. Yes, we might not be as bad as East Germany, or North Korea, but that does not somehow legitimize anything the government have done surrounding this issue, be it the detainment, or smashing up computers in the Guardians office, or the whole GCHQ thing in the first place. You might say it is laughable to compare, but you can't seriously say it's OK for the government to try and cover up these stories by intimidation and misuse of laws. 

Also, I don't see how this is a reason to sing the praises of the UK. 'Yay! We aren't as bad as North Korea of East Germany!'. We still had a man detained for 9 hours by a law unrelated to what he was questioned about in order to intimidate journalists into not writing stories that question what the government do.
&gt;One: that's hardly the act of an imposing police state. Two: refused water because he didn't trust authorities? Do you see the level of paranoia and the conspiratorial mindset that infects these people and quite possibly taints their writing? It's the same kind of silliness as we see here on Reddit. When's the last time UK police were found guilty of drugging someone in an airport?

Under the Terrorism Act, the police are still allowed to question someone without a lawyer/while the person is waiting for a lawyer, and being silent can be used against them. I'll agree the water thing is silly, but I don't think it should be used to dodge the issue at hand. 

&gt;There's no slippery slope here; not even a sliding pond. Simply put: nothing of any consequence happened. Every law was followed, no one was harmed, the police had reasons to question this man, and life goes on. Democracy has not fallen, and the rule of law prevailing is a victory, not a defeat, for democracy.

Nothing of consequence has happened? Well, apart from journalists being intimidated by their families being detained under terrorism charges, or the Guardians office having hard drives smashed up, or Miranda having his good taken by the authorities. Yes, the laws have been followed, but you have to question the reason behind these laws, especially when there is the vaguest link to terrorism, and Miranda was not questioned about terrorism at all. 

&gt;And here we go AGAIN. Yet another Redditor declaring that they don't care what the law is and have no problems with laws being broken that they personally do not like. The irony is completely lost that this is the same kind of authoritarian ""above the law"" attitude that they're trying to project onto the police, elected leaders and everyone else. 

So you're saying it is OK for the American government to spy on all their citizens, as well as citizens in other countries of the world, or for the UK government to do that same without those citizens knowing? Yes, they might be democratically elected, but when they are passing laws in secret for the benefit of keeping themselves in power and trying to quash stuff against them, you have to question how democratic the whole process is.

&gt; First... YES!!!!!! Second - there's no evidence of civilians being spied on for no reason, which is just a Reddit invention. Sifting through metadata or archiving data so that it's still available if a warrant is obtained later on is not the same as spying on citizens. 

The issue isn't that the governments *have* been doing this, the issue is that under these laws, they legally *can*. They have the ability to legally spy on, let's say, political opponents, scrape up anything that could hinder them in their campaigns (say, find gay porn on their computer, or them being a member of 'The Communism Forum'), then blackmail them with it.

&gt;Third - who doesn't know that every country on earth spies on other countries, including their allies?

That doesn't it OK. Plus, it's one thing for governments to spy on other governments, but another for a government to spy upon it's own citizens in order to try and do damage control on stories against them. This is especially pertinent to the story about the government smashing up the Guardian hard drives. 

&gt; All this did was tip off bad guys to ways they can be spied on and encouraged them to find harder means to intercept. This opens up the country to harm and makes protecting lives that much harder. That is a betrayal. Oh, and bringing a laptop full of state secrets to the Russians that may contain a complete outline of how the NSA and U.S. intelligence operations work? HUGE BETRAYAL OF COUNTRY. If Snowden believed he was so right he should have stayed in the U.S. like he originally claimed he would and faced a jury of his peers and plead ""just cause"" (the necessity to break the law to prevent a greater crime from taking place). Instead, he ran away, which says something about how confident he was in his position. 

Who are 'the bad guys'? Yes, we can start saying that terrorist organisations or foreign countries are 'the bad guys', but we've seen that the government will use this power to keep these stories hidden from the public, or at least reduce their influence. If, as you say, all the governments spy on each other, they would surely already know about all of this stuff anyway.

&gt;This opens up the country to harm and makes protecting lives that much harder.

Where do we draw the line though. If there was a camera in every living room, it would be much easier for the government to protect lives. There are also other ways to protect people than spying on the entire country and detaining journalists at airports under terrorism laws. 

&gt;1) Al Qaeda, 2) the Russians, 3) Possibly the Chinese. They didn't let him go for nothing. 

Then you could argue that anything against the government could be 'betraying them to other countries'. Is a strike betraying the government, as it loses them money and puts them at more of a disadvantage to other countries. Is revealing a major politician had an affair betraying the government, as it reduces that parties and politicians public image? The government could practically spin anything to 'betraying the country', exactly as they have done here, and it is dangerous just to go along with that attitude. 

&gt;Yes- suggesting people shouldn't steal or break the law will lead to totalitarianism. Sigh.....

If Miranda had broken the law, why didn't they arrest him for those crimes? They detained him under the Terrorism Act for nine hours, and gave him no charges. They didn't detain him for breaking the law, they detained him for putting the government in an awkward situation. 

&gt;Short answer is everyone in the free world.

You say 'free world', and then you condemn the release of this information as it might benefit foreign powers. We might be more 'free' than China, or Russia, or North Korea, but we can't use that as a reason to be fine with these laws and the attitude the government are having over this matter. 

&gt;See above. At least Manning admitted at trial that he now realizes the lives he put at risk through his actions (including leaking data on how U.S. troops diffuse IEDs). 

I'm not talking about Manning. I'm talking about Miranda and Greenwald. It wasn't published in the Guardian how the US diffuse IEDs. It was published how they, and the UK, spied upon their citizens.

&gt;The fellow was questioned, not arrested, so illegality doesn't come into play. But yes, if the police know person A is a drug importer and person B is a drug seller and they observe me drive from person A's house to person B's house, they certainly have reasonable suspicion to detain and question me. 

Yes, he was only questioned. But it was for 9 hours, under the Terrorism Act, when he had not committed an act of terrorism (you can link it, but it is an extremely tenuous link, as I pointed out earlier). We aren't talking about drug importers and drug sellers, we're talking about a journalist who went to talk to an American in Berlin, neither of whom had broken any laws. Are you equating releasing information about governments spying on their citizens is as bad as drug dealing?

The nature of gilts and other UK borrowing, as well as it having an independent monetary policy over which it had full control made the situation not only utterly different from Greece and Spain, and Italy, but even from places like France. 

 Moreover the idea that minority governments cannot govern is foundationless. The most successful government in Scottish history has been the 2007-2011 minority SNP government. It governed well, it governed effectively, and it governed a lot, and it made itself extremely popular. Most parliamentary democracies deal with minority governments all the time.

The LDs saw the taste of getting to fill government office, and head departments, and potentially get some form of PR and Lords Reform and they threw away a large number of the principles they had been running on for the past decade, and catered only to the economic libertarian wing of the party.

The idea that there was a crisis which absolutely required a unified, majority government, was really without basis. It was media hysteria, which benefited the parties in question a great deal to nurture.

So 

&gt;I genuinely believe they went with the CONs somewhat because they knew it was the only way to save the economy. 

If they did think this, then they are monumental idiots. Because it was patently untrue to anyone in the position they were in. Not saying its unfair if the public believed it, as it was a nuanced problem, communicated badly by the press. But people in their position should known better than to believe their own propaganda.

&gt;No doubt CONs need to work on civil liberties, but they're the only UK party social and civil libertarians can actually work with.

Even if that is true, they don't *need* to work with anyone. They keep the government in through a confidence and supply arrangement, and force them to justify, or compromise when they wish to do something controversial.

The government can still do its departmental cuts, and change policies. It can still carry out many of its austerity measures. What it can't do is enact massive sweeping reforms for which it has no mandate, without having to find some sort of agreement. As it is collective responsibility has bound the LDs into supporting rafts of measures for which neither they, nor their supporters had any appetite.

In terms of civil liberties, Both major parties are now authoritarian, and there is nothing the LDs can do from inside government to prevent that, as long as they agree to be bound by collective responsibility, and don't set civil liberties measures as redlines in any coaltion agreement. Which they effectively failed to do. They can however prevent such further repressive measures by holding the balance of power in a coalition.

Inherently a great deal of this will come down to opinion.

Edit, for an example, In the 2007-2011 Scottish Parliament, the Greens did amazing things with only a tiny number of seats. They got sign off on a huge number of policies the SNP wanted to enact, and became beloved of lobbyists, who saw they held the balance of power. It magnified their influence many, many times, allowing them to really have impact and make positive changes.

Had they traded that independence for seats around the cabinet table, they would have been able to given themselves some high salaries, and personal power. But they would have completely traded away that abilitiy to really sway the whole of government, and been folded into collective responsibility.

(Edit, some reformatting for clarity, apologies if you have started responding)

Finally, a lot of that really hinges on the extent to which the coalition *has* saved the economy, or even come close to being successful in the goals it set for itself.

I think the opposite is true. The Lib Dems enabled the Conservatives free reign to enact counterproductive policies, whilst buttressing them with economic, social, and legal reforms that have ratcheted up the increase in inequality to levels we haven't seen in decades.

Its not really a pay off to point to lifting the lowest income bracket out of tax slightly, when that same income bracket has suffered more than any other under coalition policies in absolute terms, bar the very wealthiest. They have produced a laundry list of reforms that have gutted the rights of the least powerful, from legal aid removal, to labour rights, to consumer protection, to schools access, and disability rights.",0,1377012618,null,0,1377014202,0,cbrlenv,t3_1knvvn,t1_cbrlenv,t1_cbrl0x7,null,1429764039,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,pastpresentfuror,null,null,"Indeed, but Bale often played as a false 10. He spent a large portion of the games hovering around the box. Yes, he was a winger, but he was a winger at a club where one of the strikers was injured for large parts of the season and the other couldn't score for 8 out of the 10 months in the season. I'm not saying it wasn't spectacular, but there were other equally spectacular players in Europe. Did you see how Mueller single handedly won several CL games last year playing behind the striker (and sometimes on the wings)? Or how El-Shaarawy had several goal of the season candidates? Or Balotelli's strike rate at Milan? Bale is one of 7 or 8 excellent young European attacking players.

Like I said before, Ronaldo has always been more productive than Bale. Ronaldo scored over 40 goals when he was 23 at Man U (a full ten more than Bale in the league in the same number of games). They just aren't close in talent or product.

As for the reason they are spending crazy money on him, a lot of it has to do with politics. Madrid NEED a marquee signing to compete with Barca landing Neymar. They see Barca's capitulation in the CL and the fact that they are potentially waning in performance as an opportunity for them to leapfrog them as the world's best team. Think about it, Madrid has largely deflated the media hype about Neymar to absolutely nothing (despite an amazing performance at Confed Cup) by talking about Bale. Madrid is on the top of every headline in every sports publication and has been for the last 2 or 3 months. All of that is worth a good portion of that large fee to them. Instead of spending 40 million to put a bunch of billboards everywhere, they are spending that as a premium on Bale to smash the world record and look like the world's biggest team.

We have absolutely no way to know how he will perform with our new squad this year. I mean I am sure he will perform great with any squad but ""£93m great"", I have my doubts. The second he slips up on the pitch that £93m will be cut in at least a third if not half. What if he gets injured this year? What if he simply isn't relied on as much as last year cause of the new talent and he isn't as prolific? These things factor heavily into his ridiculous price tag.

As a club we just do not seem ready to support a superstar at this point yet. Despite the fact that he has handled this as a gentleman, I truly think he is out for cash just as much as he is out for the game (can you blame him?). This is a man who patented the little hearts he makes with his fingers when he scores a goal. His ambitions are beyond what we could provide right now, plain and simple. Ship him off to Spain and get the £93m while he is still worth that kind of cash. There is no need to coddle superstars at this point because we simply can't compete with the bigger clubs that do this on a regular basis.

Of course. For various reasons I don't hate West Ham, United, Millwall or Liverpool. It's just the way my relationships with other people have influenced me.

&gt;I have a good friend who is a Spurs fan

For me, it is *because* I have Spurs fans as friends and have grown up around them that I hate them. It's the same with Arsenal, although that's dissipated over time because they're a shadow of what they once were. 

The problem is that I think we're using 'hate' in two different contexts. I'm talking in a strictly football context. Do I actually hate Gareth Bale? No. Do I genuinely hate Spurs fans? No - and without wanting the invoke the traditional racist's defence - a lot of my friends are Spurs fans.

My point is that I can effectively put my ""football feelings"" into one box and my ""opinions on everything else"" into another one. I'm not talking about actual, real hatred. I'm talking about hatred within the context of football - which pretty much, in my case at least, amounts to not wanting to lose to Spurs because I know that I'll get a shit ton of abuse sent my way. The inverse obviously applies and I'm sure that they feel the same.

Would I have it any other way? Absolutely not. There is nothing like getting one over on your rivals, being able to wind your friends up.

&gt;It's a sport, at the end of the day.

Yes it is a sport. A sport that invokes incredible passion and depth of feeling.

&gt;Regarding the original post about 1967 and 1975 and this.. and that.. 

With this sentence I think you completely missed the point of the post. I'm not telling people to hate Tottenham because we lost to them in 67 and 75, people are free to make up their minds either way, as you have done with Tottenham, as I have done with the teams I mentioned above. However my personal opinion doesn't detract from my understanding of the reasons why people hate those teams. I get why Chelsea fans hate West Ham, I don't particularly. I get why Chelsea fans hate Liverpool, I don't particularly.

The point of this post was to explain why so many Chelsea fans hold the depth of feeling that they do. It wasn't a call to arms to demand an uprising against Spurs.

&gt;By the same token, should I not go for a drink with my friend Michael because he's German?

Terribly sorry, but an incredibly facile point. Again, this isn't me telling you to hate Tottenham. I was explaining why people do.

ManU are self-sustaining as are Arsenal and Spurs.  Looking at Chelsea and City as the rule rather than exception that they are is very much backwards thinking in my opinion.

The primary issue is that league position is statistically tied to wage bill, wage bill is tied to revenue, and our revenue is nearly £50M less than Arsenal and just a bit more than Spurs.  People that somehow expect us to be competing for a title when we have half the revenue of United are probably being a tad misguided.  The artificial inflation of Chelsea of City into positions they otherwise wouldn't have likely been in has certainly made the chances of this even less as it pushes us out of very lucrative CL spots, but this is out of Liverpool's control.  Could we perhaps be up there again with an Abramovic-like clone owner?  Yes.  But last I checked there was no queue of billionaires lined up outside of Anfield looking to buy the club and, as you said, something like an additional one-time £50M investment isn't likely to make much of a difference in league position, certainly not over the long term.

Things will only get worse (or better depending on how you look at it) if/when the Premier League loses the 4th CL spot which could well happen.

That caution was well-placed when Spurs arrived with a better offer to both Anzhi and the player. Liverpool refused to go above their initial valuation and Willian is White Hart Lane bound as a result.

Then again if it costs £50 to get rid of the matress and they get £200 in rent instead of £0, it's pretty simple.

Also, it's not clear from your post but if you are moving here for say 6 months and then planning to return, a lot of landlords will want all of this money upfront even if you are in employment. If you are moving here permanently my advice would be to save for a deposit and get a mortgage.

Our main rival for 4th is improving at a huge rate.  Even losing Bale they're going to come out of the summer a substantially better squad than they were last season.  Meanwhile we've made some small improvements but ultimately lost ground to Spurs.  Who knows what the fuck is going on with Arsenal at this point, but Spurs are a real problem.

We are not making the moves we need to make this summer to really act on our ambition for 4th place this season.  We've missed the big players we went in for and don't seem to be doing much about it.  This is bad when you see Spurs signing 5-6 fantastic players that are direct improvements on the first team compared to our signing subs and depth players.

If we're going to say we are targeting 4th then the actions should match the words.  It feels a bit empty right now.  If we somehow manage to still get Willian I'll be astonished and over the moon about it.  Maybe he wasn't one of our initial targets (Mkhitaryan, Costa) but we clearly missed those and obviously need to find others ASAP.

I'm sorry to sound all depressing and pessimistic but this is a problem.  We need to either keep our mouths shut about achieving 4th place this season or go damn hard to make sure we get the players we need to compete for it.  Watching Micky and now probably also Willian slip by is really frustrating (especially when it seems like we had a full week headstart on Willian and couldn't close things out before Spurs come swooping in and button it up in like 2 days... yes they were interested before but this summer it looks like we were in for him first and alone for a while before they renewed their approach).

I just can't do it.  I can't be happy with this transfer window when I have to sit here and watch the way Spurs are strengthening while we have remained mostly the same.  It's really fun to watch Arsenal hit the ""oh shit"" button for sure, and to make fun of Moyes slinging retarded bids around at all the midfielders he must know he'll never get, but I want better for us!

£50m just invested by their owner this season. Arsenal and United have each had *huge* equity investments in them at some point. It is ok to cruise once you made it to the top but you can't get there by 'self sustaining'

I'm not expecting a title, i'm expecting to not be outspent and outinvested by a Spurs team with €50m p.a less revenue than us! especially not when so much is at stake

the 'artificial inflation' you see at city and chelsea (although chelsea haven't received an equity investment in years) is exactly what Arsenal, United and other clubs all went through at some point in their own past as well. You think United got to where they are powered by their own revenue? 

but set aside owner investment for a moment, we aren't even spending what our own revenues generate. 

&gt; something like an additional one-time £50M investment isn't likely to make much of a difference in league position, certainly not over the long term.

I really hope we sell Bale. There, I said it. It's an unpopular opinion, but one I've held for several months. 

Many are arguing that we're a better squad with him, but I disagree. I think we're a worse squad. Worse because whenever we're in a pinch, everyone just looks to Bale to create the super chances. Everyone remember his 4-5 super strikes to end matches. But no one remembers how he would go anonymous in a fair amount of matches last season. if we're totally relying on one player to break a deadlock, I think we're at a disadvantage. What if Bale is having an off match? There's a good chance we will lose. What if Bale is injured and out for a while? Lack of confidence and lack of scoring outlet could mean we lose. I don't want the players looking to Bale at the end to pull out a win, I think it's better for the players to be able to pick out any one of Chadli, Willian, Lamela, Gylfi, Holtby or Soldado to open up a play and slot in that game-winning goal. 

I think we'll be a much more complete, reliable team without Bale. I think he may be a liability, as all of our players look to feed him the ball when the opposing defense is tight and the match is getting tough. Veteran backs in the CL won't struggle as much to mark him out of the game as the backs did in the West Ham and Southampton matches.

true,JohnMulroy,flair5,,"I also love the optimism and you are essentially right, my only problem is we finished fourth last season, thanks to bales 20+ goals. So if we let him go i just dont see where all the goals will come from. Yes Soldado could get 20+, but the reason he was able to score the goals he scored at Valencia was because of his superb teammates. If you watch soldados goals, they are almost all tap-ins. Yes he has scored some nice goals, but i dont see that individual ability to change the course of a game. So lets then say that we get a good season out of our attackers and Soldado ends up scoring 20+ goals thanks to his teammates, I still dont see an improvement! Its the same output! There are also the different ways that Bale impacted the games, simply put, in some matches, if he wasnt there spurs wouldnt have done it. What im saying here is that Bale was able to change the course of a game even when the team wasnt performing well, but because i do not beleive soldado will have that same ability, when we do play like shite, he wont be able to change the course of the game to the extent bale will be able to. So to conclude my rant i feel that with our current squad (with bale), plus one more CB for around 8mil, we could be very strong in the league. There's definitely some holes in my argument. Feel free to reply so we can see all angles of this. Lets figure out the best way.

TLDR: We wont improve without bale because of HOW he changed games

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"People seem to be arguing from the viewpoint that there must be an ideal solution.

There isn't one.

Nuclear is the least worst option available to us now. 

There are some questions over climate change - but there's no wiggle room at all on the carbon cycle. If we released stored carbon then we know what the effects will be. 

We need to find energy sources that do not cause this to happen.

I'd be happy if we were planting trees and burning them for fuel (this is even better than carbon neutral (and better than any solar or wind)).

Nuclear isn't a perfect solution, but it's considerably more attractive than burning fossil fuels, especially if they come from the Middle East. 

100,000 isn't that long geologically. We can absolutely determine areas where there's no tectonic activity and no earthquake, volcano etc risk. On top of that it's only going to be, what, decades? until we have a space elevator, and once we have one of those we can put all of our nuclear waste on a moon somewhere. 

There is a bright, wonderful future ahead of the human race. It depends on finding the right technology and applying it. 

We need masses of energy, and fossil fuels are not the answer, and sadly we've not made enough progress with renewables, so the only option is nuclear.  The best engineering nation in the world should have been creating better, safer, more efficient and less wasteful nuclear reactors. Instead dark green fools have prevented it and we've been left with little choice but to burn oil.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Let's look at the bigger picture here, because saying it this way doesn't really show what Spurs have done with summer and the Willian/Bale/Suarez thing isn't isolated/unrelated/in a vacuum to everything else.  In fact selling Bale is most likely directly related to Spurs activity this summer.  We'll assume 2 things: the most recent rumor on Bale is true (because as insane as it is, somehow it seems like a thing that could happen) and that Willian is a Spurs player.

Spurs out: Bale, Parker, Caulker, Huddlestone, Dempsey, Livermore (loan)

Spurs in: Capoue, Paulinho, Willian, Coentrao, Soldado, Chadli

Bale and maybe Dempsey are the only regular starters that go out, while SIX direct improvements to the first 11 come in (of which a few of them turn weak positions into very strong ones).  That's a huge leap in quality and it gives them outstanding depth.  Their midfield is incredible now with good attacking players and a striker who is good for 20+ goals with the kind of supply he'll be getting.  Spurs have been really smart this window.  

Before I go too far away from the point though: I think they've been resigned to losing Bale for quite some time and they've done their spending/replacing before actually letting go of him so that they don't get raped on prices.  While their owner certainly could front the cash to buy the players without selling Bale, I don't think he's given them £85mil to spend this summer straight up.  I would definitely rather sell Bale and buy all 6 of those players than keep Bale.  I'd also rather sell Suarez and buy all 6 of those players.

If they don't give you details of the tenancy deposit scheme your deposit is held in within 30 days of giving it to them, you can take them to court for compensation. If you're trying to get a deposit back and you don't have these details, then you should take them to court. It won't cost much.

Our committee has done a fabulous job so far in my opinion. Depth was a huge problem last year and we've filled many of those needs, meanwhile we took realistic shots at valuable first team players. When we missed out I did not feel it was the fault of Ayre, FSG, or the committee, but rather our lack of European football.

Compare it to last year's fiasco and I think every Liverpool supporter will be more pleased with how we've gone about it this year. We had a plan, we struck early, and we targeted players that actually fit our system. We fell short on several, but we were in the conversation and came *very* close. When you put yourself in a player's shoes, you can see how it's hard to pick Liverpool over the CL runner-up or a club offering truckloads of Bale money.

We're not just fine, we're more than fine. Rodgers is the real deal, and I think these players are going to come through. They've got a lot of heart, and everyone's comfortable on the ball.

For this you get youth games, interviews, press conferences, daily news, shows, classic matches, highlights and re-aired matches. It is available on your phone, laptop etcetera. City do not do this for free, it is not a comparison.

2) If you don't want to pay the £5 then there are many free streams of 24/7 Chelsea TV streams available. All it takes is a little bit of effort to click a stream at the time of the interview and watch it all live.

3) Even if you miss the stream, the conference is still available mostly on youtube on another channel after a while and Chelsea TV barely claim copyright claims on them. If you saw a comparison of DMCA by CTV and MUTV it would shock you.

4) Chelsea still put up better content on their youtube channel than most clubs. Stop looking at City because there is always one exceptional example in every field, compare it to Arsenal and other clubs and Chelsea's YT channel is still providing you a tonne more than they get. 

5) The biggest argument against piracy is that ""if you gave me a good enough service to pay for I'd pay it"" and Chelsea TV is good enough. It is barely £5 and for that you can watch missed press conferences of any game. If you check my posting history it is full of piracy but even I pay for Chelsea TV because when someone provides you a good enough service you have to show appreciation in return or you will end up getting Arsenal's youtube channel. 

More importantly they were streaming the press conference live in the first place for free so if you missed it, it is your fault.

I fully believe in the phrase ""Offense sells tickets, Defense wins Championships"". We should go all out to achieve a massive CB to really bolster our defense. Toby, Papa, Sakho or perhaps Bruno Martins Indi? 

As far as central attacking options go, I'd reckon we could get Honda.  He's an experienced CAM and I think we could get him cheaply. He's currently being shopped by Milan but I know a guy with lots of knowledge of AC Milan who agree's they won't sign him because they're trying to save money but he could be very wrong all the same. Another CAM I fancy abit is Nico Gaitan from Benfica. I only began watching after Newcastle vs Benfica in the Europa league and think he's a very exciting player that could play in our system. He's also very highly rated by Benfica however. There is Eriksen also, he may become abit desperate towards the end of the market with a contract running out and nobody else being interested in him (Despite some rumours of spurs).

On the LW? There are no more experienced wingers on the market, it's gone dry. There is Lamela? We could try pull him away from Roma but again I think Spurs will get him before us. As for Left Wing I think we should Pursue Atsu. He's young but I'd honestly prefer a reliable player with experience. Let it be known we could also work with Assaidi. I don't know what we're doing with him as he's rarely in the squad by the looks of things but he is always an option. Then we were being linked with Ben Arfa? Who plays RW as far as I know, but he could also play LW maybe? If we got him cheaply I'd agree with it. On a good day he can be the best winger in the premier league. He's terrible inconsistent though, he can get lazy, has a poor attitude and he's injury prone.

A press conference **recording** is a **premium feature** (even though they still leave press conference recordings on youtube for big games). A press conference recording is not a ""simple feature"". You do realize 20 media sources, blogs, TV channels and even tabloids are in that room who all have the rights to use the quotes, videos and recordings from that press conference. That is why there are 20 mics in front of the manager. They all take that footage, quotes and recordings and provide their own snippets for a fees to their viewers as well. A sky sports subscriber will get Jose's articles from the press conference and during the news they will then air some selected video quotes. That is how these things work, there is a problem with who has the rights and the more exclusive rights you provide to the media the more revenue your club can claim, the more airtime it gets and the more popular it becomes.

I completely understand the point you are trying to make but I have experience with how the Youtube Adsense deal works and why they are trying to keep at least some features premium only, it would result as a loss for them and would run Chelsea TV into the ground if the basics were all provided for free in full. You have to keep something away from the consumer to tempt them, it is basic marketing.

Out of all the Premiership clubs Chelsea TV is no where near the bottom in terms of youtube presence. You have to be kidding yourself if you think that. Sure they aren't the best but they are still in the top 5 or 6 easily. If you are telling me about clubs who go ""above and beyond"" then also look at clubs like Arsenal and United who have such global fan bases and give fuck all compared to Chelsea TV. Chelsea TV YT compared to them are also ""going above and beyond to please their fan base"". 

Yes they aren't the best but they are far from the worse and they are above average. You can either get 2 pints or get Chelsea TV for a month, that should tell you something.

Win the league? I'm sorry but what planet are you on? You can't go from literally not winning anything for decades, to suddenly winning the Premier League.

Don't be swayed by the recent managerial changes at United, City and Chelsea. Those clubs are on rock steady ground right now and their new managers are likely to be hugely successful. 

Also, never ever rule out Arsenal. It's a very easy thing to do right now, but they're a far bigger club than Spurs will ever be. Why? Because they finish in the top four, year after year after year.

This kind of attitude breeds ignorance (and often comes hand-in-hand with violence), and is a plague on football. I really hope the number of fans who embody this *genuine hatred* reduces year upon year, particularly at the bridge, but in the footballing world as a whole.

Labour aren't in power and a global economic collapse occurred in 2007/8 caused by global financialised capitalism - if you need a bit of evidence our Labour Party weren't in power in all the other countries of the world where the same collapse happened and similar results have occurred, resulting in similar responses - austerity has fucked things up pretty much universally elsewhere.

Last year down the left we played a number of inexperienced and softer players. Enrique needed to be a bull and make up for that, and that often meant overextending himself. I don't see Cissokho improving upon Enrique to be completely honest. Although I do think as an option and as an experienced defender in the cups he'll be hugely helpful.

You can't really fault Enrique for crosses as sometimes you need to send them and we have no one capable of getting on the end of them. 

For me it comes down to defense and Enrique is better there. In my mind, the way we play pushing our full backs forward, the defensive ability is way more important than anything else. 

That may seem counterintuitive. Obviously you need the fullback to have offensive ability going forward. But more important, considering our rather slow midfield cover, is the fullbacks ability to reassert themselves in their defensive positions. Very few fullbacks do that as effectively as Enrique.

I don't think many people are arguing Cissokho should start over him, but I think we have to mark down his arrival purely as ""established backup able to not drop off too much quality when we're stretched by cup runs"".

I don't know if that'll be worth the 5 million or so when we get Robinson back next year.",0,1377025251,null,0,false,0,cbrqmma,t3_1kquuv,t1_cbrqmma,t3_1kquuv,null,1429761542,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt; ""I think it is absolutely right that that is the case – that the police decide who they should stop or not and whether they should arrest somebody or not. That's their operational independence. I am pleased we live in a country where there is that separation.""

Oh May, so ""operational independence"" of the police, or the enforcement of the law, is fine but ""operational independence"" of the judges, the ones who interpret the law is not? Does she honestly think people will forget what she said just over 1 year ago?

[Theresa May gets cross-party backing in Article 8 row][1] (19 June 2012) (BBC)
[1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18511727

&gt; Several leading barristers have questioned the need for new guidance, saying the meaning of Article 8 is already clear and judges understand it, but Home Secretary Theresa May says the judiciary itself has asked for parliament to make its views known.

&gt; Home Office sources say the government was not obliged to seek parliamentary approval for the changes it is proposing to the immigration rules.

&gt; But Mrs May said the government wanted ""to give a clear message to courts about how parliament believes Article 8 should be interpreted... the stronger the voice from parliament, the better the message will be.""

&gt; Following over four hours of debate, MPs unanimously accepted the government motion.

&gt; The home secretary said that if courts do not heed the message the government would ""look at other measures"".

[Theresa May in contempt of court over immigration case][2] (21 June 2012) (Visa Bureau)
[2]: http://www.visabureau.com/uk/news/21-06-2012/theresa-may-in-contempt-of-court-over-immigration-case.

&gt; The Home Secretary Theresa May has been held in contempt of court over the prolonged imprisonment of a foreign criminal, making her only the second home secretary ever to be charged with contempt of court.

&gt; While the Home Office argued that Lamari's 'remarkable history of absconding and serious offending' offered reasonable cause to detain him, **solicitors who brought the case against Mrs May believe her strong rhetoric against judges preventing the deportation of foreign criminals encouraged immigration staff to ignore the release order.**

&gt; ""It is regrettable that the Secretary of State's officials decided to refuse their own undertaking,"" said a spokesperson for Duncan Lewis who brought the case. ""**We note from their own evidence that this decision was taken after 'senior [UK Border Agency] personnel were consulted.** 

&gt; ""We firmly support the decision of the judge. Undertakings are a vital part of the machinery of litigation and save all parties and the Court from the need to exhaustively litigate every last issue. We believe that the finding that the refusal to honour the undertaking was Contempt of Court was in part designed to ensure that there is no future repetition of this conduct on their part.

&gt; **“We also consider it likely that the Home Secretary's intemperate comments about the Human Rights Act and the perceived failings of the judiciary gave rise to a culture within UKBA in which her officials failed to abide by the rule of law. The instant case is only one, albeit the most serious, example of this behaviour on their part. We consider that they are likely to take their lead from the minister and be influenced by her stance in these matters.”**

[Theresa May criticises judges for 'ignoring' deportation law][3] (17 February 2013) (BBC)
[3]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21489072

&gt; The home secretary, in her newspaper article, blamed judges who had ""got it into their heads that the ECHR Article Eight 'right to family life' could not be curbed"".

&gt; ""Unfortunately, some judges evidently do not regard a debate in Parliament on new immigration rules, followed by the unanimous adoption of those rules, as evidence that Parliament actually wants to see those new rules implemented,"" she wrote.

&gt; She noted that one judge had justified his decision on the basis that the new guidance had been subject only to ""a weak form of Parliamentary scrutiny"".

&gt; Mrs May went on: ""It is essential to democracy that the elected representatives of the people make the laws that govern this country - and not the judges.

&gt; ""Yet some judges seem to believe that they can ignore Parliament's wishes if they think that the procedures for parliamentary scrutiny have been 'weak'. That appears actually to mean that they can ignore Parliament when they think it came to the wrong conclusion.""

So, there's these five lads who did this pub crawl when they finished school, then left the town and didn't return. One of them, Simon Pegg, becomes a massive drug addict, decides that was where it all went wrong, and persuades the others to re-try the crawl; there's just no arguing with him. So far, so good. Everything seems a bit different though, and nobody seems to really remember them. After a couple of pubs, he has a fight with this teenager, and blue shit gets everywhere. They're fucking *robots* or something. No wonder nobody recognises them! Then Simon Pegg's mates start getting replaced by robot replicas, aka blanks, at the same pubs they dropped out of the original crawl. This is called foreshadowing, see also: *Shaun of the Dead* - ""Next time I see him, he's dead"" and *Hot Fuzz* - ""Have you ever been in a high speed chase?"", et al. Hijinks occur, we discover Nick Frost and Simon Pegg fell out over a car crash when Frost drove Pegg to the hospital after an overdose drunk, and our heroes eventually make it to the final pub on the crawl, The World's End. When Simon Pegg pulls his pint, it activates a secret platform. Turns out, on the night of the original crawl, some alien thing landed with the intention of improving humanity by replacing those who don't conform. It tries to persuade Simon Pegg that this is a good thing, but Simon Pegg's having none of it; humans are supposed to be chaotic, it's kind of our thing. The alien thing tries to tempt him with robot replicas of his mates the night of the original crawl, and even a younger version of himself, offering him the chance to relive his misspent youth. Simon Pegg destroys his robot young self because there's only one Gary King. The alien decides there's just no arguing with him and leaves. The blanks go blank, and the town is destroyed by an unnecessarily large fireball. Turns out we're hearing Nick Frost tell the story in the subsequent post-apocalyptic world. The blanks came around and remembered their human lives a few days after the alien abandoned them. The others are all living sort of happy lives, but Nick Frost says he doesn't know what happened to Simon Pegg. However, we see him with the young blank versions of his mates going to an anti-blanks pub, ordering five pints of water, inferring he is now clean living, and presumably beating seven shades of shit out of the anti-blank patrons.

[Theresa May in contempt of court over immigration case][2] (21 June 2012) (Visa Bureau)
[2]: http://www.visabureau.com/uk/news/21-06-2012/theresa-may-in-contempt-of-court-over-immigration-case.

&gt; The Home Secretary Theresa May has been held in contempt of court over the prolonged imprisonment of a foreign criminal, making her only the second home secretary ever to be charged with contempt of court.

&gt; Judge Barry Cotter, QC, accused Mrs May of 'unacceptable and regrettable behaviour' after ignoring a legal agreement to release Algerian national Aziz Lamari when it became clear that there was no reasonable likelihood of deportation.

&gt; [Judge Cotter] said there has been the 'most regrettable and unacceptable behaviour' on the part of the Home Secretary and held her in contempt of court, which could have resulted in a fine and even imprisonment if Lamari hadn't been released. 

&gt; After the deportation attempts failed, a court hearing in May instructed the Home Office to release Lamari no later than 8, June 2012. However, Lamari remained in detention until 14, June when he was eventually released. 

&gt; Judge Cotter ruled that Lamari was entitled to damages as he should not have remained in detention past 23, May.

&gt; A spokesperson for the Judicial Office confirmed Mrs May was held in contempt for failing to abide by the judge's ruling but said Mrs May avoided further punishment due to Lamari's eventual release and the severity of the charge itself.

&gt; ""His Honour Judge Cotter QC found the defendant guilty of contempt for failing to release Aziz Lamari having undertaken to do so,"" said the spokesperson. 

&gt; A spokesperson for the UKBA accepted that Lamari should have been released from detention when deportation became unlikely and confirmed that a review of the case would be carried out.

&gt; ""Aziz Lamari is a failed asylum seeker who had served custodial sentences for serious offences. He was held in immigration detention awaiting removal to Algeria and we accept that he was not released on the date set by the court, which resulted in yesterday's judgement,"" said the spokesperson.

&gt; ""We are reviewing how this happened urgently.” 

Would love to see this review indeed...

This was also (briefly) reported in another article I have already linked elsewhere here...  
[Theresa May gets cross-party backing in Article 8 row][1] (19 June 2012) (BBC)
[1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18511727

&gt; [...] Mrs May said the government wanted ""to give a clear message to courts about how parliament believes Article 8 should be interpreted... the stronger the voice from parliament, the better the message will be.""

&gt; In a separate development, the home secretary was found in contempt of court after her department failed to release an Algerian asylum seeker, Aziz Lamari, on a date set by the High Court.

[Contempt of court][3] (Wikipedia)
[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court

&gt; Contempt of court is a court order which in the context of a court trial or hearing, declares a person or organization to have disobeyed or been disrespectful of the court's authority. Often referred to simply as ""contempt,"" such as a person ""held in contempt,"" **it is the judge's strongest power to impose sanctions for acts which disrupt the court's normal process.**

&gt; A finding of contempt of court may result from a failure to obey a lawful order of a court, showing disrespect for the judge, disruption of the proceedings through poor behaviour, or publication of material deemed likely to jeopardize a fair trial.

true,goodhumansbad,tardis,TARDIS,"Great comments, and very well-put. I've heard this opinion expressed by others in different ways, and it strikes me as possibly being the result of not having watched the original series (forgive me if I'm wrong about that). One of the most challenging things about watching Doctor Who has always been the fact that with every new regeneration came a totally new doctor, often opposite in many ways to his predecessor. I've always felt the differences in writing reflected the differences in personality of each Doctor. I haven't always liked each Doctor equally (the Colin Baker years were particularly bootastic for me, despite appreciating his acting), but it's an interesting exercise in adapting your expectations and learning to appreciate what the new and contrasting styles say about the story as a whole. The hard thing for new viewers, or reboot-only viewers, is that the Eccleston-Tennant transition happened after only one season and so people weren't necessarily as attached to Eccleston as they were to Tenant when HE left. 

I think the tone of the Matt Smith stories have reflected the increasing urgency as the overarching plot became more &amp; more critical. I've personally really enjoyed the contrast between the extremely sinister background plot (crack in the wall et al) and the fast/dramatic/mad individual stories. It's like watching the hero dance on a glass floor that's about to shatter, dropping them into a seething void below. If I were to guess at Moffat's motivations behind the frantic, often manic pace of each story, I would say it was specifically to balance out the ominous, dark and slower-moving 'big picture' he was designing. The only episode I can think of from Matt Smith's tenure that I found genuinely BADLY written, and not just 'not my favourite', was The Bells of Saint John - it felt totally devoid of real plot. All this being said, however, and much as I'll miss Matt Smith, I'm actually not averse to a regeneration taking place. I think it's time and I'm really hoping that the new Doctor will take the show in a new direction, perhaps one less manic and goofy. As I've said - I don't object to the goofy years, but it can't go on forever.

Title: Capacity Trade and Credit: Emerging Architectures for Commerce and Money

**1.5 Emerging and innovative proposals **

**1.5.1 Alternative Currencies**

Alternative currencies are increasingly discussed in both business and academia. Some, hardly exhaustive, examples help to set the scene. Facebook credits and BitCoins are attempts to create common tenders for virtual communities. Facebook is tied to its social network while BitCoins are intended to be used across communities. Linden dollars (Second Life) have an exchange rate with sovereign currency. Ven (Hub Culture) is attempting to move a community currency into the physical world as well, with physical trading ‘pavilions’. The Ven is listed on Thomson Reuters’ trading screens. 

There are common tender initiatives not tied to capacity exchanges or online communities, such as the WOCU®, a currency basket derivative of 16 sovereign currencies weighted by the GDP of the top 20 nations. WOCU® are used, though not widely, in some commodity transactions. To date, there is no global common tender. Proponents of global common tender often claim that it would not only underpin multilateral reciprocal trade but also provide a unit with less exchange rate volatility against goods and services.

It is really really simple. The Bale transfer is about influence, it's about politics, it's about a lot more than the worth of his footballing abilities. You answer your own question when you say ""they will get more money back than they put in the equation."" By saying that, you readily admit that it's about more than his footballing skills to Madrid, which makes my statement about his market valuation correct. Just because he is worth that much to Madrid, doesn't mean that the going rate for Gareth Bale is 93m.

RM need a forward. A number 9 to fill in when Benzema is injured or tired. Morata is still way unproven and they sold Higuain. Bale operates best when given space to run into. For that, they have Jese, Di Maria, Isco (not his preferred but he's still great at it), and Ronaldo. They don't need his skill set in any real footballing sense. They need this story to eclipse Neymar's and they need this record signing to excite the fanbase. If anything the whole Perez/Marca propaganda campaign has done more damage to Madrid fans than anything else, because if/when they get Gareth and find out he's approximately half the player Ronaldo is after touting him as the 3rd best player in the world (a title very assuredly Cavani, Falcao, or Ibra's), they are going to be let down.

The original point is simply that there are a good number of extraordinarily talented players that are going for a hell of a lot less than Bale is, and that we should snap their hands off for that much. He is a big loss, but I would still honestly put the likes of Ginola, Gascoigne, and Klinnsman as bigger Tottenham talents in recent memory, and Lamela alone really isn't that much of a step down. He's inarguably better than Bale was when he was 21 (Bale scored 3 goals the season he was 20-21, Lamela had 15), and in my opinion, has a higher celing.",0,1377027879,null,0,false,0,cbrrqjg,t3_1kq7ul,t1_cbrrqjg,t1_cbrndz8,null,1429760953,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Yes. And? The public voted it down (mainly because they didn't understand either system enough) but your going to hold that against the Lib Dems? Nick Clegg is a failure unless he can coerce or mislead the public to do what he wants? You sound very undemocratic - the Lib Dems wanted a referendum which they got. They then **hoped and argued for** AV hoping the public would listen. Whatever the public said was **out of their hands** thus it was no failure on their part. 

&gt;The Tories could easily have done

Sorry what? The same party that wants [workers to work for nothing](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/tories-workfare-may-turn-out-to-be-a-work-farce-1365261.html) in return for assistance is also going to allow those same people it showed so much disdain for to pay no tax? No, the fact is it was a Lib Dem policy not a Tory one and it was adopted because of the coalition agreement. 

&gt;Which doesn't protect the freedom to have a fair trial...

It was never supposed to. A free trial is extensively protected under English law and has been since 1963 and is further protected under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The others are also protected under English law - you have a right not to have your private information misued and you also have a right to privacy under Art. 8 ECHR. With the free press you have a right to free expression under Art. 10 ECHR and the courts have shown that there is a public interest defence for newspapers who publish confidential or controversial things of which [Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd (1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v_Times_Newspapers_Ltd) is just one example. 

This act was meant to repeal some of the restrictions of liberties that Labour brought in in the 90s and 2000s and it did just that. It focused on the DNA database, CCTV, anti-terrorism powers like those abused by police on Sunday against David Miranda and Freedom of Information. It's not meant to be a constitution of all right that exist but it was introduced by the Lib Dems, written by the Lib Dems and pushed by the Lib Dems. 

I can imagine the Tories doing anything because they have no actual values. Same with Labour. I thought they were pro-EU but suddenly I see that they are voting against to cut the EU budget not because that's the best policy but to try and put the Tories under pressure and make them look silly. Neither party has any real values other than politics. What really matter is what you actually do and the Lib Dems have actually done some positive things under very squeezed circumstances.

I find this odd, because back in the RTD era, I loved Moffat's episodes.  They always ranked highest in my book.  I also love Sherlock and Jekyll.  But ever since he took over, everything but the special effects have suffered.  

My opinion on his never mentioning his previous life is that after his last Tennant adventure, there was nothing for him to go back to.  Rose was gone, Martha and Mickey had carved out their own lives and weren't on great terms with him, and he couldn't even speak to Donna.  Near the end of Tennant's run, you just got the sense that he was in constant emotional turmoil, and that all the hits he'd taken had really taken their toll (best seen in The Water of Mars).  So, I basically think that as a character, he is trying to leave that all behind.  

I agree though.  There are things I like about the Moffat era (River and Rory as people, the concept of The Silence, HOLY SHIT THE VAN GOGH EPISODE), but as a whole, it *is* a different show, and in my opinion, not as good.

Edit: And I also agree with the other redditors about Matt.

Efforts are being made, absolutely, but in terms if discrimination international soccer is starting in a sewer and has a long way to go.

Were it about being unfair to Russia over Qatar then we would be seeing a difference in how their World Cup hosting plans were being addressed. As it is they are being treated the same ie largely ignored for the time being.

true,cabalamat,null,null,"&gt; The public voted it down (mainly because they didn't understand either system enough) but your going to hold that against the Lib Dems?

Of course not. What I hold against Clegg is he didn't negotiate very well. He should have used as his starting point the idea of parity of esteem between lib dem voters and tory voters.

So a Lib Dem vote should count for as much asd a Tory vote. If Cameron won't agree to that, then he is showing his contempt for the millions of people who voted Lib Dem as clearly as if he got his cock out and publicly urinated over them. I bet of the people woh voted LD in 2010, 99% think that a LD vote should count for as much as a Tory vote. If the Tories said no change without a referendum, Clegg should have countered by saying ""OK all your controversial policies will be subject to a referendum too"". At the very least, Clegg should have got a cast iron guarantee of PR for either the Lords or E&amp;W local government. If Cameron didn't agree, Clegg should have said no parity of esteem, no deal -- if you disrespect LD voters, we walk.

It goes without saying that Clegg shouldn't have reneged on his personal pledge to tuition fees.

Basically Clegg gave away too much and got too little. He's in office but not in power.

&gt; It was never supposed to. A free trial is extensively protected under English law

Nope. The Tories introduced closed material procedures -- secret trials where people won't know the evidence against them -- in the Justice and Security Act 2013. A ""protection of freedoms"" act that doesn't protect such fundamental freedoms as a fair trial is not worth the paper it is written on.

&gt;  you also have a right to privacy under Art. 8 ECHR

No I don't. Article 8 may say I do, but GCHQ/NSA nevertheless read all my emails. It's an empty right -- words on paper than mean nothing.

&gt;  With the free press you have a right to free expression under Art. 10 ECHR and the courts have shown that there is a public interest defence for newspapers who publish confidential or controversial things

Then why is the government trying to coerce the Guardian into not reporting Snowden?

&gt; This act was meant to repeal some of the restrictions of liberties that Labour brought in in the 90s and 2000s and it did just that. It focused on the DNA database, CCTV, anti-terrorism powers like those abused by police on Sunday against David Miranda

It quite clearly was not successful in preventing the abuse of police powers against David Miranda! It didn't protect his freedoms, did it?

&gt; I can imagine the Tories doing anything because they have no actual values.

Then why go into coalition with them? When you sup with the devil you need a long spoon. Clegg has been very naive.

&gt; I thought they were pro-EU but suddenly I see that they are voting against to cut the EU budget not because that's the best policy but to try and put the Tories under pressure and make them look silly.

Politics can be very childish at times.

&gt; but they are the only party other than the Greens I see with any actual value driven policy

Last year that got us Coutinho and Sturridge instead of Siggurdsson (or however its spelled) and Dempsey.

Frankly speaking, I'll play the waiting game for a bit while the players gel together. 

Tottenham, at this point in time, are adding basically the same level of players. Which means they aren't adding guys who will really elevate them. They're adding guys who basically make sure they stay about where they are. Sure, they cost more than they used to, but they are not world class players. We're all shitting ourselves while they sign people but frankly it has more to do with ""intent"" than what the final product will result in.

The last time we showed ""intent"" we wasted 70 fucking million pounds. If we had a player we could sell for 80 million pounds and played in London with a manager who won a European cup I might wonder where we're going wrong.

But we have none of those things. It's harder to do it the way we're trying. But how long have we, REALLY, been trying to do it this way? Since last summer. The previous summer we bought Downing, Hendo, and Adam for twice each players respective worth. 

Everyone should realize what a club says a player is worth is not the same as what he is going to be worth to his next club. Willian for the reported 35 would be 10 million over his likely worth. FSG were essentially okay overpaying by 5 million. Not 10. I'm okay with that decision. 

Lamela for 30 is probably about 5 to 10 million more than he's proven he's worth.

Fans and columnists need to take a look at WHO these players are that are signing. Are they players that are going to elevate Spurs to guaranteed CL? No. Spurs, if anyone hasn't noticed, have brought in a lot of players in the last two years who really don't fit a consistent approach. They won 1-0 over Crystal Palace on a penalty this past week.

Bank B offers two £50k a year jobs for two employees who work 30~35 hours a week depending on how busy they are.  Lets say they work a 5 day, 9 to 5 with an hour lunch and sometimes an hour a day on reddit or goofing off with their colleagues when things are slow.

(Often 2 days between shipping and arrival at my home in the US).

If you're looking for the cheapest option, and not too concerned about the shirts being legit or not, though, you could always consider buying a knockoff from China via [a Taobao agent](http://taobaofieldguide.com/taobao-guides/taobao-agents). It takes a little research and it's a lot slower, but you can get like 4 or 5 shirts for the price of one on the club's official site. They're knockoffs but pretty indistinguishable from the real thing in my experience. They are sized for Asians, though, so if you're especially tall or at all fat, you may have trouble finding a size that fits and returning them would be a *bitch*. Still, that's likely the cheapest way to go about things; you could buy Agger, Gerrard, and Coutinho shirts for less than one would cost you on the club site.

(That said, I do think it's better to support the club when you can afford it, and those shirts are probably better quality in the long term).

This also ends the crisis in terms of cover for the defence, seeing as he can play anywhere along the back four, not just centre half.

I am also under the presumption that he will go straight into the squad, but I don't see why not.

AVB has bought so many fucking players these last few windows but none serve any consistent vision.

Holtby is set to be on the bench. Dembele is set to be on the bench. Capoue as well.

Tottenham cannot afford these players wages season to season. This is a period of transition and throwing money around seeing what sticks because they've sold a few players (or will) for profit.

Do I think Tottenham is competition for 4th? Obviously, but I don't think they're guarantees. Most people are reacting the way they are because Tottenham are showing ""intent"". But intent can be misplaced, we know all too well. 

I think Willian will basically a bust. Lamela will be a solid customer but not a game changer. I'm perfectly fine with them losing Bale and bringing these players in. It will not make 4th unreachable.

It's not comparing Spurs signings with our own that's the source of this fear, it's that Willian was 3rd miss (and a late miss at that). To add insult to injury, look where this recent miss has gone...a direct competitor of ours based on our goals/aspirations.

When we openly bid £20M+ for a player, we're obviously stating that we're in the market to add strength to our starting eleven. ESPECIALLY if BR is behind us saying that he plans to 'add goals' to our side this window.

What have Spurs seemingly done? They've added goals to their side and we're hard pressed to say the same unless you count our 'squad' signings as the goals BR promised.

I'm not saying that we should continue to sob, but we've got cause for concern here and our eyes are on the transfer committee to bring in that quality signing that galvanizes our ambitions; a stronger league finish (possibly 4th) and maybe even some domestic silverware.

The question is, to whom does it matter to? 

Because obviously we'd both agree, ""you've tabled a ~ £30M bid, what's £5M more?""

It's the fact that FSG refuses to inject any significant sum of money that the club doesn't have in liquid cash. Spurs lost money last year if I do recall correctly, I also think they have a significant amount of debt if I do recall (I'm not positive). 

But to owners/operators of our club, I don't see us buying a player unless we're selling a player. They [Spurs] are going to have spent well in excess of Bale's transfer fee. We haven't sold Suarez (yet) so I don't see us winning a bidding war.

true,pastpresentfuror,null,null,"Fair point. I would counter that athleticism does not make someone worth 93m. If it did, Luton Shelton (ran a 100m in 10 seconds) would be the world's most expensive forward. Bale does not have the touch Ronaldo does, nor the vision, nor the versatility, nor the ambidexterity. His link up play is above average and he is prone to wastefulness and errors. He had a ton of great takes last year, but a lot of that was due to the sheer amount of the ball he got. He is excellent with left footed accuracy (both in crossing and in shooting) and a tireless runner. Muller, for what it's worth, has better off the ball movement, better link up play, and is very truly two footed. The idea that his attacking contributions are tap-ins is ridiculous considering he had nearly 20 assists last season. He spends most of his time on the ball around the perimeter of the box finding other people.

The exact reason Chelsea was 5th place was because they prioritized the Champions League over league position, and frankly, AVB lost the dressing room, so they massively underperformed week in week out. The reason Bayern, Barca, et al weren't 5th place is because they had the strength and depth to compete on multiple fronts, so I don't think this is a strength of the English league.

It's not an image of ordinariness but of the new elite of David Cameron's Britain who dress, relax and smile with an unostentatious confidence that's actually born of huge financial security.

Good grief... this writer is a fool.  If they had *bad teeth* it would be better?  Gawd...someone peed in his tea, didn't they?

Two years from now, having Ibe and Sterling on the wing(s) fully developed (if treated right) looks like a free signing of a marquee player. 

It is hard to say where we are truly lacking on the field except in the case of youth. We might need a quality CB, although I think Kolo is fine for this season with Skrtel fine as cover. LB is weak unless Ally works out. Forward/Wing is touch and go with youth, but there is competition. Cover for Lucas isn't ideal, but Allen has shown to be a decent stop gap. I just feel like the past 4-5 years we have brought in big money players and they don't meet expectations. Time for a new approach.

Well, yes, this I do agree with but that doesn't make him less of a decent person or his party less worthy of support. It was a mistake in party politics. 

&gt; If Cameron won't agree to that

I don't think he does or at least he'll argue that the only way to get parity as you say is to have one vote per person knowing full well that that leads to inequalities. He won't weaken his own position even if it's the fairer thing to do. Neither, it's important to point out, will Labour. Again, neither party has any values. 

&gt;doesn't protect such fundamental freedoms as a fair trial

If they had called it the 'CCTV Guidelines and DNA Database Removal Act' would you still have that opinion? It's a grandiose name for some quite specific freedoms and you shouldn't expect it to cover a fair trial as it never intended to. The secret trials I agree are abhorrent but the party itself [voted against it](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21732790), the leadership did not. In fact I think the party at large has been quite staunch in remaining true to the principles they represent. That not a lack of principle in the party but a lack of principle in the leadership which is a temporary problem. Clegg will go before 2015 and if not then he will lose the party a lot of votes.

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;Owners of a club should not spend a dime of their own money to bring players into the club.

If I'm reading you comment correctly, you seem to be implying that all clubs should have a near zero net transfer cost. Basically, that transfers should fund transfers. This should not be the case. Clubs, especially those of Liverpool's global size, should have net positive transfer costs, where that money comes from sponsorship and commercial deals.

The problem is that we've got a £20m (a year? or over 4 years?) kit deal, a sponsorship deal with Standard Charter that was supposed to be one of the biggest in football two or three years ago (£20m over 3 or 4 years again?), various other sponsorship deals, retained the Calsberg deal as a club sponsor, and cut a few million from the wage bill per year. Further we're supposed to have a manageable debt of around £30m. The club should have roughly £20-30m for each year's worth of transfers. £10-20m per window. Where is that money? We spent ~£20m at January. Does that mean we've spent our year's worth of money already? Or does that come out of last year's pot? Or is there another ~£10m lying around, plus possible smallish cash injections/loans from the owners for a player, that'd be paid back asap?

Yes, they have conducted some great business this window, but if Bale leaves, they are back to where they were last season. He directly contributed towards 67% of their goals last season (it was posted on /r/soccer months ago, it's too late to go searching for the exact source). Soldado is good, and so is Willian, but they would do very well to have the impact that Bale did last year. Also worth noting is that many Spurs players have a tendency to seek transfers once bigger clubs come knocking, which keeps disrupting their flow and forces them to change things around.

Ultimately, I think our squad is well equipped to compete with Spurs and Arsenal this season. We are strong across the park with something quite special up front.

true,ciaran036,null,null,"If you get some decent weather, I would recommend a trip up around the north coast, visiting the Giants Causeway, Carrick-a-rede rope bridge, Dunluce Castle, Bushmills Distillery and Portrush. You won't be able to see all these things in one day, but you can pick and choose, or spread the trip over a couple of days. 

There's a train that goes to Coleraine, and from there you can get the Causeway Rambler bus (which operates over the Summer until the 29th September) which goes along the Causeway coast route, which has stops at all the tourist attractions. 

At the bus or train station, if you ask for an iLink card, you can pay for unlimited travel on all the buses and trains in Northern Ireland. It's very cost-effective (I think it's around £16 for a single day of unlimited travel on all of Translink's services - the publicly owned transport company). 

There's a charge for most of the tourist attractions, but it's not too expensive (£8.50 to visit the Giants Causeway visitor centre, or free if you just want to see the Giants Causeway, about £5 or so for Dunluce Castle, about £6.50 to cross the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, about £10 to get a tour of the Bushmills Distillery). 

I'd also recommend travelling to Derry/Londonderry, Dublin and Galway. Just be aware that the bus and rail services are operated by different companies in the south of Ireland (the Irish Republic) and that the currency is Euros in the Republic of Ireland, whilst the currency is British Pounds Sterling in the North of Ireland (Northern Ireland). 

In Belfast itself, where are you living? If you are living around the main student area around Queen's University, you might want to visit the Ulster Museum (it's free) and Botanic Gardens. The iconic lanyon building at Queen's University is also worth a little exploring, if you like that sort of thing. 

There's also the big Titanic Belfast visitor centre, which is a huge ""visitor experience"" which tells the story of the Titanic, from its construction right through to its sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic. There's even a 'shipyard ride' which attempts to show what it was like to be working on the construction of the ship. Tickets are around £10 for that. 

A bus tour would be worth doing, so you can properly see all parts of Belfast and everything it has to offer. If you lucky, you might see bus tour vouchers online for cheap, otherwise you can just pay the usual prices. 

As for nightclubs and bars, there are plenty of nice places around the university in South Belfast. The Cathedral Quarter area of the city is also a newly popular spot for a night on the tiles ... more of an 'upmarket' sort of crowd I think, but still a lot of students and young people go there (in their 20's).

Further, we *have* to over spend to get players of the quality required to instantly and noticeably improve the first 11. There was a part of The Game (I think) podcast from last week discussing Arsenal's transfer policy and the refusal of Wenger to ""over"" pay. In order to get into/maintain a top 4 place, teams have to over pay: partly because they're not an attractive an option (whether it's no CL football, not London, whatever), and partly to give players a reason to come here. That is, one has to over pay both in transfer fee and wages. Man City did it, then switched to paying better prices and wages, United have done it with the odd player and wages (Rooney, RvP), Chelsea did it. We are in a position where we have to do that, especially when such opportunities as Willian arrive, where the over payment is small compared to the overall fee, and the wages actually fit more or less into the wage structure anyway.

The difference between the over spending in this case is that it is not a large, programmatic overspend as in City and Chelsea's original cases, but a special case which would actually be quite affordable in the long term, so more similar to Man U's case of over spending on RvP.

Further, [each place in the league table](http://www.tsmplug.com/richlist/premier-league-tv-money-deals-2014-15/) is worth £0.8m. Would Willian increase our chances of moving just 1 more position in the table? how about two? If you think so, then that ""over spend"" of £5m, with a raise of two places, would lead to an increase in £1.6m; if he actually helped us get into the top 4, that'd be an extra £2.3m from the PL, + ~£20m should we qualify for the CL. And suddenly he's repaid himself. And that's just from one season of improvement. He'd only need to help us finish 2 places higher (5th) than last season for 3 years before repaying that ""over spend""; or for him to pay back his wages, etc.

I think this final point is being missed: the financial benefit from finishing higher will far out weigh the extra £5m or so. I'm sure they, the club, are taking these things into consideration. I'm just not convinced they're coming out to the correct conclusion. (Though obviously though have more information, etc. etc.)

&gt; Also name one single major earthquake or other fracking side effect in the last decade, its like those stories in Yorkshire where they started fracking and there was a tiny earthquake, everyone got all upset that it was fracking 

Watch Gasland please.

&gt; why people have waited till now to protest against it, especially in light of all the evidence supporting it and the only anecdotal evidence against it.

Most likely, awareness. It's not like the mainstream media cover this sort of thing *until* people start to speak out and protest against it. Reliance on more fossil fuels is a terrible idea. Do you really think Cuadrilla have our best interests at heart?

&gt; , the civil wars going on in North Africa is important

Uh, what? Obviously, I guess we should all go and sort that out then?

&gt;  keeping people's homes lit and heated is important

Then invest in renewable energy - subsidise solar panels and energy efficient - that won't run out soon anyway.

&gt;  if these people really wanted to stop fracking they'd stop committing criminal acts (completely unacceptable under the circumstances) 

And what should they be doing, when legal options have failed them?

&gt; either go live carbon free without using power provided for them by fracking 

The starbucks toilet argument. Stay classy.

&gt;  or they'd gunnel their energy into actually getting an alternative energy source of the ground enough

These individuals do not have the resources to do this. The idea is to pressure the government into listening and raising public awareness so they are more likely to succeed. Barely anyone was talking about fracking before this, so they've succeeded in making it a national issue. 

&gt; However this is all missing my original point, Caroline Lucas committed a criminal act

She committed an act of civil disobedience. Yes it was probably criminal technically, but she's trying to prevent people selling off our environment from under us, which in my opinion is worth it.

My main problem is that the character of the Doctor has got too big.

Tennant would always quietly leave once he had saved the day. But Smith's Doctor gives the Pandorica speech, he is always talking himself up (this if Moffat's fault). The closest it came to this in the RTD era was when Tennant explains who is in Silence in the Library..... ""look me up"". Of course this episode was written by Moffat as well.

It has become a different show and the Doctor has lost some of his original essence but it still seems to rate its socks off. I too preferred for RTD era, but hopefully things will improve now that Peter Capaldi is the new face of it. They will need to create a new persona for him so lets hope that the Doctor is not writ so large.

What Clegg's like as a person isn't the issue. I'm pretty certain he doesn't spend his spare time torturing kittens while cackling maniacally.

&gt; or his party less worthy of support

If he's a bad negotiator, how can I trust him to negotiate Lib Dem policies in future?

&gt; I don't think he does or at least he'll argue that the only way to get parity as you say is to have one vote per person

Fine -- one vote per person in an STV or regional list election.

&gt; He won't weaken his own position even if it's the fairer thing to do. 

I agree this would be the likely Tory response. The Lib Dems should have negotiated with labour more seriously at the same time; this would have given them more negotiating power with the Tories. I think Cameron really really wanted to be Prime Minister and would have sold his granny to do so, so it wouldn't have been enormously unexpected for him to give something on PR -- even if not for the Commons.

&gt; Neither, it's important to point out, will Labour.

Well, Labour have agreed to PR in the past, e.g. with the Scottish, Welsh and London assemblies and Scottish local government.

&gt; If they had called it the 'CCTV Guidelines and DNA Database Removal Act' would you still have that opinion?

Maybe they should have called it the Pretending To Care About Civil Liberties Even Though We Don't Act :-)

&gt; The secret trials I agree are abhorrent but the party itself voted against it, the leadership did not.

Maybe the leadership needs changing.

&gt; Clegg will go before 2015

I hope so

&gt; and if not then he will lose the party a lot of votes. 

I will be very unlikely to vote Lib Dem in 2015 if Clegg is leader.

Ms. Poitras, in turn, gave Mr. Miranda different documents to pass to Mr. Greenwald. Those documents, which were stored on encrypted thumb drives, were confiscated by airport security, Mr. Greenwald said. All of the documents came from the trove of materials provided to the two journalists by Mr. Snowden. The British authorities seized all of his electronic media — including video games, DVDs and data storage devices — and did not return them, Mr. Greenwald said.

I realise that's an oversimplification and there is an overall social benefit to having graduates, but I don't think it's wrong in principle that the service should he paid for by the fortunate half of the population who benefit from it.

David Mitchell himself is a case in point - his parents were well off and he went to a prestigious private school before university. However, I'm not convinced that it's fair for the tax payer to foot the bill for the good time he had at university when others in far more need are denied comparable funding.

On that logic a graduate tax makes sense, but then you have issues of those who did better when starting from a similar position subsidising those who wasted their time or partied too hard.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"No way. You'll see exactly how wrong you are as this season goes on. Paulinho is a huge talent. Willian is world class. Capoue is outstanding. Soldado is basically guaranteed 20+ goals a season and getting starts for one of, if not the best national side in the world.  Spurs have made 6 signings of which all of the players are top quality or world class players. They have directly improved their first team in a huhe way despite losing their best player. We have marginally improved the first team with Mignolet and Toure while adding one great depth player in Aspas and a young player for the future in Alberto. Spurs were better than us last season and they've made all the right moves this summer to widen the gap. We are falling further behind them. 

It isn't about not overspending on Willian specifically. Its about having to watch transfer after transfer for top players that would make a direct impact on our first 11 slip past us. In the case of both Willian and Mkhitaryan it really felt like we were the girst one in for both of them. We failed to seal the deal quickly and other clubs entered the fray that we cant compete with.  Maybe it went down differently on reality and i guess theres no way to really know, but thats how it looks and feels based on the way things have been reported.  Its especially bitter when the club that beats us to the player is our direct rival for 4th place. We are losing ground to them this summer, not making progress. For the stated goal of 4th place to happen we need to make at least a couple of big signs to have a good chance at it. We were always the underdog for 4th this season but after the summer Spurs have had we are a seriously outside shot if we don't do something before the window closes.

If it doesn't fit then ban me, and I can bemoan about being censored then... ;-) 

Edit: spelling.

true,glglglglgl,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The demand was the same: hand the Snowden material back or destroy it. I explained that we could not research and report on this subject if we complied with this request. The man from Whitehall looked mystified. ""You've had your debate. There's no need to write any more."" During one of these meetings I asked directly whether the government would move to close down the Guardian's reporting through a legal route – by going to court to force the surrender of the material on which we were working. The official confirmed that, in the absence of handover or destruction, this was indeed the government's intention.

While there may not be an explicit request to stop reporting, it's certainly extremely fucking heavily implied - assuming that everything in Rusbridger's piece is correct.
