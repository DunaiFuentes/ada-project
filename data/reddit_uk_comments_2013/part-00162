It's a pretty established idea that people turn to extremist parties in times of strife. They are also more accepting of totalitarianism if it promises a way out of that strife. It's hard to understate just how bad of a state German was in at the time and it seem very unlikely that Hilter and the Nazies would have ever gained nearly as much traction if we'd had more of a mind to stabilize the country after the war instead of punishing it. There's still room in terms of exploiting the loss of national pride but ultimately the less desperate you are the less you will accept extremist premises or grabs for power and even if the Nazis had gained a voice it just seems unlikely they'd have been able to seize control in the way they did or that it would have been so widely accepted even if they had. 

On top of that even if things had turned out the way they did it just seems like it would have moved up the timetable rather than meant a more powerful country because Germany largely ended up at the peak production anyway. I mean we actually just let them rebuild their industry and army despite the fact we could have stepped in to stop them. It would no doubt have meant a war and there was no will for that and a rebuilt, economically stable German was better for everyone.

&gt;Think what £40M could buy you right now. 

For me, this is the biggest reason to *not* sell to Arsenal.  Not only would we be sending a top 5 striker to a direct CL rival, we would probably not be able to come even close to replacing him.  It is possible that he could be replaced, but deals like Coutinho and Sturridge do not happen every window.  It's just bad business to strengthen direct competitors and weaken yourself.

I also think that a fit and in-form LS by himself is not enough.  Coutinho has been a revelation and Sturridge helped ease the burden on Suarez, who is not a great finisher.

That being said, I'd sell him for £40 million to a non-EPL side, if that's what he wants.

Understand I'm not /u/squigs - but it is kind of hard to swallow that if the roles were reversed in this and a couple of Muslims were attacked by a gang for what *they* were wearing - you can bet anything you like a full racial investigation would kick off. The hypocrisy stings. 

I live in a very ethnically diverse part of Birmingham and so far haven't had any trouble - and I'd like to keep it that way - but I'd also like to be able to wear shorts or maybe even walk topless to the local park to enjoy the sunny weather without fear of bombardment by the locals.

No idea.

Ask and you shall receive.

Yes, of course lol.

&gt; I tend to avoid farmed salmon in the US as much of it comes from the Pacific Coast, and salmon farming is hurting populations of wild salmon. Are Scottish farmed salmon raised in a similarly harmful way?

&gt;Do you have any recommendations for wilderness backpacking either in the UK (I hear Dartmoor and Snowdonia are really nice, and it seems like there are loads of places in Scotland) or on the continent but easily accessible from the UK? I'm an experienced backpacker and I know my limits, so I (hopefully) won't be one of those tourists who jaunts off to the hills, gets lost, and costs the emergency service thousands in search and rescue fees.

Look at a map, find England, look left they speak a strange language other than English but they're harmless sheep shaggers, quite loveable really. New forest is ok but not really for backpacking and if you're going backpacking you're a tourist so embrace it.

&gt; Any general tips?

Guildford is generally nicer, busier and has more to do than Woking, but house/flat prices tend to be higher though. Woking is fine to live in,  it's got everything you would need, would avoid areas like sythwood, most of goldsworth park, maybury and barnsbury.

1 bed in Woking somewhere between 675-800 or more, new build furnished flats in the town centre mostly go for upwards of 900 no more than 1000. Guildford say 750-875 for 1 bed. Use Rightmove.co.uk it updates more regularly than others like zoopla.

Should also point out letting agents fees vary greatly, for 1 person to take a flat can be from £200 admin, referencing etc up to £600. Shop around, I'd suggest not using foxtons or townends (in Woking, Manners also) if he wants to save money - they are all very expensive.

my point was, obviously, that tradition is not reason enough to do anything at all, or indeed, to keep doing something. There are\should be many other valid reasons.

I am not sure how enjoying change and new ideas equates to either a lack of imagination or being stuck in anyone's ways. That said, I only like Heinz ketchup.

I was simply pointing out that starting anything ""I'm not being sexist but..."" is generally the start of saying something sexist. To date, he has not given any good reason as to why the doctor shouldn't be a woman, short of, essentially, ""because I don't want it"". Which is no reason at all.

As far as comics go, your Martian Manhunter analogy fits your argument best. Miles Morales and Doc Ock, Spidermen they may be, but they are different people entirely to Peter Parker. I am not saying change doesn't happen, I am simply saying that if Peter Parker in a current time line was white in one comic and then black in another that was sharing the same universe at the same time\same event, that would be considered rightfully confusing. The Manhunter, being a shape-shifter as it is, probably requires more image stability than most, I would imagine. Or perhaps his readers are used to exactly the opposite?

Things can and do change. costumes change (looking at you kitty pride) artists have different depictions. Beast came out as gay for a while, though that was a joke. Its not about consistency over the entire history of the comics, otherwise characters wouldn't grow (which is perhaps another point). Its about story consistency. More than most, the doctor has the ability to radically alter so much about him, it seems almost silly to not make use of that in a larger way. Ageing him 25-30 years is a great idea, and I literally cannot wait to see Capaldi in the tardis. But why not take it further? Think of the stories! how much fun could it be! Few other (if in fact any) TV shows have that opportunity written into the very fabric of their bible it just seems ludicrous that it presents either an issue to the fanbase or that the showrunners haven't done it yet.

A interesting aside to this would be Spawn. black guy. hell spawn. white guy. They made that work, although admittedly his human appearance was rare, as far as I can remember.

Our different legal system and rights meant that the proprietor of an establishment could include/exclude any individual they want.  If they didn't want a smoking section they didn't have to have one.  Same for pubs, clubs, shopping precincts and such.

Hmm maybe something I noticed when I was doing volunteer work (afterschool clubs and the like) some girls like to pretend to be older than they are.  They pretend to be sexually mature.  They might even *ask for it*.  The difference is they are normally fairly transparent to anyone who's an adult, that they are not a mature adult, that they do not really *want it* even if they are *asking for it*.

Now the difference is when you've got a 12 year old girl who is acting that way, you don't take advantage of them.  Ultimately you don't normally give children what they are asking for, but what they need.  The one pattern I noticed from the mentoring work I did at uni, the girls who behave in an provocative manner, they want the unconditional love that sadly they are not getting at home.  It is very sad really.

It is silly to deny that some children don't attempt to act older and *ask for it*.

I think we have a great squad this season and it seems that we have some good options through most positions. Would be nice to have another striker though. Some one that can come off the bench and do something. Maybe Eliot Lee will have his chance.

Everyone have put in great points and i would only be reiterating what they have said. I have held a season ticket for 20 years. Hopefully we will have a good season. Providing Carroll is firing, there should be no doubt a top 10 finish is within reach this season. 

Also i really hope Joe Cole gets a regular start this season. He has unreal talent, all be it some say he is getting on, i think where he has not had consistency in his playing it has knocked him a bit. If he is on form he will change a game, by getting goals and delivering in that final third of the pitch. As we have already seen in two or three games last season.

That is good enough for you and me, but as the evidence from Torres, Alonso, Mascherano, Suarez etc suggests, it isn't enough for top players. The reality is we are not competing in the same league as a few years ago. Attracting and keeping players of such quality is almost impossible after being out of the CL for so long.

&gt; I for one believe we're heading back to the top!

I do too! But it will take time and in the mean time we are going to find it difficult to keep and attract star players. So the impetus must lie on building a team which adds up to more than the sum of its parts. You can keep pulling names out of the air like Martinez and Yilmaz, but unless you are prepared to pay stupid money, they won't join us.

Only needs 48 hours for Fort Stanley to be fully re-garrisoned by air to Falkland War levels. That's literally how it was designed.

* The contract is solid, don't need to sell

* His claim 'BR/Liverpools word to let him go should stand' is hypocritical after his declaring he would [stay with LFC despite missing Champions League](http://imgur.com/M2SEaCz) in January. So he's going back on 'his word' too in that case.

* If there was ever a season to say that Arsenal aren't that much of a better club than us, it's this season coming. They're in need of fresh players and we'e looking really good coming in. And our club are making obvious buys which illustrate our concern with coming in the top4. 

* Luis Suarez is really under the spot light, making a 'sideways' move in the same league is really not going to help that. And under the circumstances - could potentially get worse after cutting his bond with the LFC supporters. 


* We have aspa and courtinho who are both very creative and are shaping some exciting football in the top 3rd that I would have thought Suarez would love. He has a manager who's openly admitted he's shaped a whole team round him, and he has. 


* Suarez is quick to point out his CL aspirations, but he must want to win. To do that he needs a top tier club which if liverpool can't provide, the likes of a Spanish team might. Moving to Arsenal is a 'short term fix' but doesn't seem to be the best bet in the long run. It makes rational sense to stay at LFC - entertain our chance at top 4 and continue to impress top tier Spanish sides and hope he gets CL football in those two ways.


* The fact that this is a bit irrational, and could double the media pressure on him (by moving to arsenal), isn't a as 'forward move' as it could be all leads to a bad outcome for him. I think he's been blinded by some 'goal' or incentive to move and despite things leaning to him leaving he could possibly be talked around and could easily settle back into an exciting creative attack in a promising season with Liverpool, if they want him.

If we could afford to land him i think he would be a fantastic signing for us he can play out on the wing or in the middle of the pitch, is very creative, very good on the ball, good pace, solid shot...would be a terrific fit in a 4-3-3 set up out on the left with Bale (if we can hold onto him) on the right. I a 4-2-3-1 would be good either behind the striker or out on the wing.  Seems AVB was high on him before.

Question is price in my mind, i don't know that we can afford him but would be a great add for us.",0,1375872877,null,0,false,0,cbip0yw,t3_1jviho,t1_cbip0yw,t3_1jviho,null,1429915847,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

Condoning doesn't mean flat out saying ""this is acceptable behaviour"", it can just be creating an environment where people think this sort of thing is okay or can somehow be mitigated.

In this day and age as a club we need to be performing excellent at all levels and that includes clenching other clubs balls for as much money as they can give in deals.  ",0,1375873646,null,0,false,0,cbip4sk,t3_1juaim,t1_cbip4sk,t1_cbiozuu,null,1429915797,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Do i think anything less of the club? Absolutely not.

We have been hugely successful,  even in the not too distant past. We can be successful again. 

The revenue streams are there to be exploited.  The stadium will soon be expanded. The worldwide fanbase is still one of the largest in the world.  80-90 thousand fans turned out at our pre-season games. 

Under good stewardship the club can be one of Europe's elite again. It will take some time though.

That is why everyone is enjoying putting the boot into us now, majority of english media included.

It is hard to lose your best players when they can't wait to play in the CL. It is understandable though.

The first step for us is to finish top 5-6 and really close the points gap on 4th place. Then we can keep our best players as long as we can show improvement.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"I have shown my ignorance. I had no idea that these kinds of contracts existed.

I know part-time employment has always been common, where the employer calls when they need someone and the employee can accept/reject that particular offer depending on whether they can make it or not. This seems fair to both sides, since neither side is guaranteed a job or an employee. The employer and employee are therefore encouraged to either give decent notice before each job, or organise a more regular work schedule.

But this is different, because you have to stick with the one company, hoping for work and you can't find other jobs in the meantime (since it's very difficult to find a permanent position, you can only hope for other part-time jobs to fill the gaps). I assume that if they call for you, and you say you can't make it, then they just fire you immediately and you can never work for them again. This seems far too one sided to me.

Since you've been on the receiving end of the stick, what's your view? Do you think it's fair that you can't have more than one zero-hour contract going at the same time? What is the company's logic behind not allowing their employees to have more than one part-time job at a time, so long as when they are needed at the company, they come?

Now that the Doctor is a grown up again, let's not have any more of that Twilight-level nonsense.

Edit: I've got to take issue with another point. The idea that nobody notices when women on TV are objectified is blatantly false. Then there are shows like Smallville, Arrow and films like Twilight where male objectification is almost in the actor's contracts. If you believe this doesn't happen, go watch The Wolverine.

There's a whole generation of interchangeable male actors whose appearance with their shirt off is more important to their audiences than their acting ability. I'm not just talking about faceless nobodies, but top stars. Thankfully, we have British born antidotes to that, good looking men who can act. Matt Smith is one such antidote, but even he lost his shirt very early on. 

Amy and Clara might wear short skirts occasionally, but that's because girls wear short skirts sometimes - go outside, go on the Tube, go anywhere where young women might be. 1,000 year old Time Lords wear tweed and bow ties.

You can also get strikes for poor behaviour, being late, wearing the wrong clothes etc. Being ill doesn't go down well either.

The agency's reasoning is so that you are always available for work with them, if you are not always available then what good are you to them? The parent company tells them how many staff they might need for the day, the agency contact phones up a bunch of people and expects them to turn up in a couple of hours. If you can't always make it they'll find someone who can. Oh yes and they can sack you for not answering the phone in the morning too, that's a big no-no. So you have to get up early, sit by the phone and wait for a call that may or may not come.. And because there's no set routine you have to be on call.

As an aside if you are on a Pay Between Assignments contract and are currently between assignments if you don't phone up every morning and announce you are available for work the agency don't have to pay you for that week, protection my arse.

You state that the law wasn't needed because our laws let people chose if people smoke or not. I stated that the point of the law was not to give people a choice. You then attack those reasons (which is a fair and valid thing to do) but no where do you explain how the law, and the reasons it was brought it, were being served by the law as it was before.

It also means that if you save money with the bank they won't be giving you much in interest payments (it's better to spend all your available money at the moment as the interest you get on your savings is less than inflation - the cost of goods is going up faster than your savings, so your savings are worth less in real terms).

By linking the base rate to unemployment, the BoE are basically saying that the rate that people buy money should be proportional to the number of people earning money, not the size of the economy (they could have linked to GDP) or the cost of things (they could have linked it to inflation) or Government spending or the price of houses.

Unfortunately we don't think that unemployment will reach 7.0% until some time in 2016, so if you are getting a mortgage now, get a two year variable rate one and then in two years time you can get a five year fixed rate one at a higher proportional cost (but lower in the long run) - don't listen to me on this though, talk to an independent financial advisor.",0,1375876820,null,0,false,0,cbipmxw,t3_1jvhlq,t1_cbipmxw,t1_cbioyp5,null,1429915565,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I am glad we agree on them not wanting it.

It is the *not asking* part where I disagree.  If it was just verbal communication, it is often un-ambigious, I have been 'offered' bjs to drugs to gauge my reaction.  I won't name the place but it was one of the more challenged schools in the area the funding we had was for.  I come in to a room, divide up the kids into groups of 4, I've done this class many times by now, so I'm kind of on autopilot.  I didn't spot little miss who wanted to be the centre of attention.  5 minutes later and everyone is doing their own little activities she is grouping me.  In front of three of her friends, she was alternating eye contact between me and them.  I was 18 at the time, and well certain blood circulation changes are involuntary, even when grabbed through jeans.  As stupid as this sounds the first thing I thought was I'm going to have so much paperwork to do, then my mind came back and I ended up telling her that charmed as I was, I only dated brunettes.  After talking with the school staff later, it became clear that she had a troubled home, she lacked a proper father figure and her mothers lover had recently been jailed for GHB.  One member of staff suspected he had physically beaten the child too.

My point is, that if you have someone who is un-hinged, they will not see it as a child who is *struggling to express themselves correctly*.  They will see it as someone who is *asking for it*.  Take the exact same action, put it in the union bar after last orders between adults and I'd have taken it as a sign maybe god does exist.

Many teenage girls learn quickly that they can create reactions out of the younger male teaching staff.  This can benefit them by disrupting the authority that the teacher has over them.

It is stupid too suggest that these actions don't happen.  They do.  In one particular 'college' something like this would happen every visit (they used to also lock away mobile phones and wallets for staff...).

The problem is that even if someone who is young says they want to make all kinds of love to you, and that they are already sexually promiscuous as an adult, you should have their interests rather than your own lust in your mind.

What I am trying to say, is if you break it down in to ""they where never asking for it"" someone else who isn't particularly enlightened on teen psychology will simply think ""erm no, she said something really explicit"".  It is a case of ""that isn't what they meant."".

This is also important for sentencing, as ultimately there is a difference between someone who does something with consent (even if they can't give it legally) to someone who does not.  There is also a difference when someone has taken someone who has suffered abuse or if they were in a position of authority.

&gt;if you're act the stage where you're seriously considering acting on your paedophilic urges, you have a responsibility to yourself and others to act and seek help

Exactly!  How do we get people to do that? We don't demonise them, we try to educate them.  In this case the concern is that the prosecution mentioned that the girl was promiscuous and willing.

And when things do not go his way? He completely snaps and throws a tantrum. 

What you describe above fits in very well with a sociopathic personality - you often can't tell where they're coming from, as their prime aim appears to be to use you for their ends. 

Still, I can't decide - a child or a sociopath? Or perhaps a little bit of both? 

Perhaps a bit of a quiet enforced 'time-out' in the corner of the room would provide an answer.

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"First of all, some of the information you might miss as an outsider:

* While the media and games often favour calling us the Swans, our nickname is the **Jacks**. The name allegedly comes from a dog names Jack over a century ago who saved the lives of many people who fell into the dock waters by dragging them to safety. There is a monument to the dog on the seafront, opposite the city's main hospital.

* Our history has consisted mainly of either extreme mediocrity in the lower divisions, or extreme spells of improvement or decline. We're hardly the kind of team to sit in the second tier!

* We're both very patriotic, but also against certain Welsh institutions. Our fanbase (and club) have previously had some issues with the FAW (with accusations of bias due to the board having Cardiff City season ticket holders on it), and with the Welsh media, seeing our successes often glossed over to focus on the capital city team. It got to the point where we left FAW jurisdiction to become a proper English FA team a couple of years ago (as previously it was the FAW who decided our bans and appeals, which didn't go well), and we often prefer to follow our club on 'British' media rather than Welsh. Perhaps it's paranoia, but considering the club have also commented on it there may be something to it. This is reflected in a number of Union Jack flags around the ground. That being said, there are still many Welsh flags on show as well in celebration of our culture and history.

And onto my evaluation of our club right now:

In my opinion, we currently have the best squad we've ever had in the century-long history of the club. While in the early 80s we made a bit of a title push briefly, now we have a fantastic first XI, but also greater strength in depth that ever before.

While we are no strangers to European competition, before we always qualified through Welsh cup competitions, which was possible for us to do from the 4th English tier. This is our first time in Europe which we can really feel we have fully earned (even if, ironically we did it by beating a 4th English tier side!), and I'd say we're not sure how our quality will compare to continental opposition. I'm quietly optimistic.

9th was a fantastic finish for us last season. Perhaps with the extra European games this year matching that won't happen, but as long as we steer well clear of the relegation scrap I'll be happy. Our new signings look fantastic, Bony being the most publicised, but in my opinion Shelvey looking the most impressive so far. He had a hard time of it at Liverpool but he's looked absolutely natural in our starting lineup.

We play a very fluid style of football, with wingbacks who go forward often, wingers who are comfortable coming into the middle, and a striker who can track back. We pass *less* now than we did under Brendan Rodgers, and Shelvey looks like we'll be bringing the diagonal ball more into our play, while Bony, combined with Michu, makes it more viable for us to cross the ball into the box, something that we've always struggled with in the past. Expect from us to get the ball up the pitch quickly on the counter, but without lumping it to our centre-forward. We are pretty solid defensively, and our defenders (and goalkeeper) are comfortable on the ball, so we are rarely flustered at the back. We've made big changes this summer, so I'd consider ourselves a bit of an unknown quality.

But the social element is only the biggest external incentive. Within the show itself you're open to an extraordinary amount of fun and interesting dynamics.

true,TheMania,null,null,"To understand why banks aren't ""loaning it out"" you need to first understand how the BoE increases rates above 0% in the first place.

When the BoE wants high rates, say 5%, it lets banks loan out to anyone that can afford above that rate of interest offering 5% on (short term) bonds as an alternative investment vehicle for banks. The BoE alters the supply of bonds such that they go for the desired rate and that becomes the floor interest rate in the economy.

Effectively, banks loan out to everyone they can and buy bonds with whatever they can't loan out, with the BoE ensuring there's always just the right quantity of bonds to reach its desired floor rate.

Now today, that floor rate is 0%. Thing is, here bonds serve little purpose. Banks are loaning out all they can, as they always do, and they then have a choice between bonds that are returning near 0% interest and cash that is returning exactly 0% interest. Additionally, QE ensures that there isn't even enough bonds for all banks to hold what they can't loan out as bonds.. so some don't. Some are left holding cash instead.

Not that this matters, whether banks are holding ~0% bonds or 0% cash is pretty much irrelevant to inflation and demand in the economy. QE is just not an inflationary maneuver, it just changes the ratio of one virtually zero interest bearing asset to another, cash.",0,1375883331,null,0,false,0,cbir4rz,t3_1jvhlq,t1_cbir4rz,t1_cbiqr10,null,1429914864,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

It is a shitty situation but that's the one we're in, and I'd argue that nuclear is less bad for the environment than coal or gas because the greatest current threat to it is climate change due to CO2 emissions.

Though we will still need some fossil fuel plants because you can vary their output very quickly if there's a spike in demand, especially with gas. You can't easily do that with nuclear, or at all with current renewables.

Also, saying ""Less energy"" is a bit of a simplification, even if we cut demand by half and everyone accepted occasional powercuts, we still need to provide energy to some places on a constant basis. Imagine the stress of working in a hospital or as an air traffic controller when the power could go out if there's no sun/wind/tide at one particular moment. We couldn't even import energy from Europe (outsourcing our emissions, but that's a whole other topic) because we've only got a piddly little 2GW connection to France.

I think the fan's expectation is to come between 8th-12th, and to have a decent cup run, unlike last year when we were knocked out in the 3rd round due to van Persie's offside goal.

Our best player is Winston Reid. He won player of the season with the fans, and won player's player of the season with an unanimous vote. The fans love Mark Noble because he symbolises what the club is about. East-end boy, came through the academy, playing in the first team. The fans took to Andy Carroll the moment he signed on loan last year. Personally, I didn't think he was that great, like many people on /r/soccer do, but now I love him. He's great.

The club gets a lot of stick because of the system that Allardyce uses, but I think the criticism is unfair. We can play exciting football, and we have done. For example, when we beat Chelsea 3-1 or West Brom 3-1.

The club seem to be convinced they are right and, considering that even he admits they are right (see how he is not saying that they're in breach of contract - merely that BR lied to him during a chat), I think the club do have a case against him bringing LFC into disrepute. 

Like with Cristiano Ronaldo before him, he seems to have adopted a victim mentality. As I wrote in my original post, perhaps it is time for the club to remind him that he is their employee and ought to behave as such. After all, he is hardly Harriet Tubman. 

Of course, if every hint about this is completely wrong and he is indeed right and wins his case, he is still in breach of club discipline. Either way, the club's actions now will not have a bearing on any arbitration committee. 

As for him playing or not playing for Liverpool... there is RvP and there is Tevez. It can go either way. Unlike RvP, LFC are under absolutely no pressure to sell. 

If you want my honest opinion, I think he will stay, unless Madrid really want him and come with a competitive bid. If we are in a top 4 position come January, he will quieten down, apologise and profess his love for the club.

[Barkston](https://plus.google.com/107453014974889558069/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en)  is the nearest Youth Hostel with rooms at around £35.

Hspitality packages are good but to really enjoy the Atmosphere you need to be in the crowd and a £1000 is a lot to spend. Looking at various sites, you can get tickets for under a £100.

Get [True Blue membership from £25](http://www.chelseafc.com/membership-article/article/2755048/title/membership) then you get access to priority tickets like these. The [£61 ticket]( http://www.viagogo.co.uk/chelseafc/Sports-Tickets/Football/Barclays-Premier-League/Chelsea-FC-Tickets/E-552147) in the Matthew Harding stand would give you a great experience.



There are other places to grab tickets but it will get sold out early, the Christmas fixtures are always popular esp against a big club like Liverpool.

http://www.1st4footballtickets.com/english-premiership-chelsea-vs-liverpool-tickets/london-14079.html

Be careful when buying on line as [some ticket agencies get both good &amp; bad reviews]( http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews230283.html)

Do your research before parting with any cash and you should be fine.

I hope that helps and I hope you enjoy seeing the mighty Blues take 3 points off the Red Shite! ;)

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"Ok, let me give background for my numbers:

Right now (on this sub) it is generally considered that Arsenal, Tottenham, and Liverpool are fighting for 4th.  You have to go off that assumption (otherwise we aren't rivals of Arsenal for a spot).  I give Tottenham (after their buys) 35% chance to make it, Arsenal (with their ""additional"" buys you are talking about) a 35% chance to make it, and Liverpool with a smaller chance at 30%.  It it makes you feel better, we can make it 40%, 35% and 25%.

For UEFA numbers:
""http://www.uefa.com/uefa/management/finance/news/newsid=1845591.html""
""Each of the 32 sides involved in the group stage will collect a base fee of €8.6m. Performance bonuses will also see €1m paid for a win and €500,000 for a draw in the group phase.

The teams competing in the round of 16 can also expect to pick up €3.5m each, the quarter-finalists €3.9m and the semi-finalists €4.9m. The UEFA Champions League winners will receive €10.5m and the runners-up €6.5m.""

I will further assume if we make champions league, we make it out of the group phase.  We'll say that requires a record of 3-2-1.  At CURRENT exchange rates, that's £13.7M.  That is also 4 additional home games and based on the latest financial reports:
(http://www.theliverpoolword.com/2013/04/liverpool-f-c-s-recent-accounts-reading-beyond-the-numbers/), our AVERAGE match day income is £1.88M (Euro cup would probably be higher, but we'll go with that as our base).  That means ONE season of CL is £21.22M if all we do is make it to knockout stages.  Not to mention the addtional exposure and the fact that with champions league we can actually attract players.  So in summary, my estimate was a little low and ONE YEAR of CL covers his entire salary for the next 3 years.

You tell me who we can get (without CL football) regardless of having £40M to spend (that would allow us to compete with an Arsenal team that has an additional 30+ goal scorer)?  Arsenal with Suarez goes from battling for fourth at slightly above our level to competing for the league title and us having no chance of catching them.

If we sell him to Arsenal then there is NO WAY that our position improves.

He's a cunt for sure, but he's an incredible player the like of which you can't replace and there's no hope of bringing in similar quality without the Champion's League.  Signing 2-3 other players to strengthen other areas won't be good enough either because none of them will be game changing, odds defying players like Suarez is.

How can you say that? You think that every time a Black Doctor will show up in our past history or on another planet, his Blackness will have to be explained? When the Doctor shows up what does he do? He takes over the situation and saves the day. There have been plenty of episodes where people are like, ""Who the hell are you?! I'm not listening to this!"" And he does the whole, ""I'm the Doctor. And if you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say!"" And people either fall in line, or become Cybermen! That's how it goes!

Black people and other Brown folk have an AWESOME history and were also present in many continents around the world, not just Africa. There's a lot more to history than just slavery and the Civil Rights Movement.

Past history, yes.  Other planets, no.


&gt; When the Doctor shows up what does he do? He takes over the situation and saves the day. There have been plenty of episodes where people are like, ""Who the hell are you?! I'm not listening to this!"" And he does the whole, ""I'm the Doctor. And if you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say!"" And people either fall in line, or become Cybermen! That's how it goes!

But then you'd get accusations of ""colorblindness"" and you'd be masking the racism of the time period if people suddenly listen to a black person.

&gt; Black people and other Brown folk have an AWESOME history and were also present in many continents around the world, not just Africa. There's a lot more to history than just slavery and the Civil Rights Movement.

I'm well aware, but you can't just pass over that stuff.  I've mentioned if you ignore it, then people will complain that the show is colorbrind, and if you keep bringing it up, mainstream viewers will stop watching because the show would be tedious.

It has nothing to do with ""suspension of disbelief.""  It's because Doctor Who is a time travel show and there would be no way to bring up social issues in a way that would please both the people that pay serious attention to them and the mainstream audience that watches the show.

true,asiakfiatek,tardis,TARDIS,"I get it. ""Doctor Who"" is an iconic show in Great Britain. To have a black actor playing the main character would be a certain statement of the equality in the country. The same principle as with Obama being elected president - ""see we have a black president now, there is no rasism in the US"". ""See, one of our most iconic fictional characters is being portrayed by a black actor - there is no racism in GB"". Before anyone twists my words: I don't think that playing a character on a tv-show is the same as being a president. And I don't think that Obama was elected BECAUSE he is black. I'm only talking about the similarities in the perception.

Am I against a black actor playing the Doctor in future? - absolutely not, if a good, well suited to the role actor comes along, I would have no problem with that. While I didn't really believe the rumors of Idris Elba being considered for the role, I was quite tickled by the idea. I could see him being quite an imposing, charismatic Doctor. 

I don't think that the producers should give the role to anyone solely because they are black. But likewise, black actors shouldn't be overlooked in the casting process.

This should also help us in the Europa league because it has allowed for good squad rotation without a drop in quality.
  
I typically see us starting in a 4-2-3-1, progressing to a 4-1-2-3 offensively and a 4-4-1-1 defensively. Shelvey is a player I think is going to surprise a fair few Liverpool fans this season as he's slotted very well into our formation and dictates a lot of play. Bony is also a signing we needed after selling Graham to Sunderland, this will free up Michu and allow more runs from deep, which is the type of position that led to many of his goals last year. Bony also has a great arial presence, so it will be nice to see Dyer and Routledge staying wide to ping crosses in. I can only see us improving on last year as long as we rotate well due to the extra games.

In recent history, we have had some fantastic people at the club. Our board and chairman are all fans, who've watched the Swans since they were kids. Someone who has also been vital in our regeneration, of sorts, would be Roberto Martinez. As a player he helped us avoid relegation from the football league, and as a manager he helped mould the style of football we play today. Since him each manager has helped our club progress - Sousa helped us tighten up defensively, and then Rodgers brought in the signings that helped score goals.

Cardiff and Swansea have a strong rivalry, so that game will be interesting this year. I've worn a Swans shirt in Greece and been told by a Cardiff fan that I was a fucking piece of shit. I was 12 years old and was just walking past him. I'll leave it at that. 

If you approached me at the Vetch after watching us beat Hull on the last day of the season to avoid relegation, and then told us that in 10 years we would finish in the top half of the premier league, win a cup (beating the likes of Chelsea and Liverpool on the way) and play in the Europa league... well...

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"Way to selectively quote and ignore my entire first paragraph clarifying the qualifying percentages.  My FINANCIAL numbers are solid.  The % chance to make champions league I clarified at the beginning was based on assumptions that are made EVERY DAY in this sub.  I also, in my first post, agreed it was a bit of a gamble and ADMITTED that I would be willing to accept the risk because the reward is worth it (once again, IMO).

So, if we ASSUME there are 3 teams fighting for 4th, everything even, each team has a 33.3% chance to make champions league(*gasp* math!).  I consider both Tottenham and Arsenal to already be higher quality than us, even with Suarez and I clarified that was why OUR odds were lower than Arsenal.  I also clarified that Man City, Chelsea, and ManU were/are considered locks for top 3 as things currently stand.  I will also clarifiy now that giving Arsenal, who finished 4TH WITHOUT A PREMIERE LEAGUE QUALITY STRIKER, a player who can score 30 goals in a season, IMO pushes them into that group of ""locks"" for the top 3 spots.  That means there are 4 teams at the top of the league that are FAR deeper with talent and quality than anyone else.  Liverpool would go from that (assumed!) 40/35/25 split to suddenly being a 60/40 underdog for even 5th!   (i.e, we would be screwed.)

I have NO issues with selling Suarez outside of the premiere league, but I refuse to sell him to someone (who once again) we are considering a direct rival for fourth.  If you make the assumption that arsenal is already far better than us and that selling Suarez to them makes no difference, you are getting rid of the major premise and reason for not selling him and basically admitting defeat for not just next year, but the next 3.  In that case, I agree with you.  Sell him to whoever and start from scratch.  I simply refuse to believe that Liverpool is soooooo terrible that we aren't able to compete anymore.

Since you disagree with me, do you believe we aren't in the running for 4th place at all?

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"Personally, I am under the impression (or rather have a theory) that a decision or deal has been made behind the scenes at spurs to get CL football at all costs. The club has been treading water for about three years and is one thrust away from bringing in a bonus £30m a season just from CL money alone. Granted spurs have spent a cool £50m already and seem keen to invest again this window I have to think that something has changed, this window is excessively uncharacteristic.

Levy/AVB met with club owner Joe Lewis post season, initial reports suggested it was to try get some money to fund a CL attempt. I didn't believe this, but after the cash thrown around already, I am beginning to think something may have gone down.

Of course, it could be Levy going out on a limb. But bringing in Baldini and then trusting him completely to blow £50m is just so not-Levy. I can't believe that he decided to change his tune overnight without some assurances from a backer, the guy is a smart businessman first and a spurs fan second.

To Bale, It doesn't take a genius to work out that all of this spending is likely for naught if Bale disappears. The net shift of the club will be 0. Now, you could say that Levy/AVB knew from the start that Bale was going and this spending is just one big 'Bale replacement',but by all trustworthy reports they are intent on keeping him around. 

I think spurs will fight tooth and nail to keep Bale around, unless Madrid bid very seriously £100m+ (and soon), then it will be more beneficial to spurs to hold onto the player and focus on the season ahead. If that money does come in, I think there will be at least one other player coming in the other direction (Morata and/or Coentrao) and about £50m will be reinvested into the squad.

You could make the argument for Bayern, but they have Mandzukic, Muller, and Gotze to play as striker and next season will have Lewandowski. 

I think Muriel is a great option for you guys because I think he has the creativity to take over for Suarez and loads of potential. He would certainly be a great signing and I hope you guys do sign him so I can see him in the PL.

45 million is a lot of money. I would imagine Muriel would sell for maybe 25 million and that leaves 20 million left over. If you ask me, you should sign Alderweireld and Eriksen from Ajax which I think I read is a 20 million pound package. Alderweireld is a great player and I'd imagine him and Agger would do wonders. Papa is a good option, but he was just injured and I think he would cost more. Also, I see no reason why Eriksen wouldn't at least try out Liverpool and see how far you can progress in the table after two years. He is very promising and would definitely improve your team.

If it is possible to get those three players for 45 million, you could have a real shot at Top 5 if Tottenham loses Bale and can only find a mediocre replacement. Your attack would be loaded and so would the midfield. 

Yes I'm an Arsenal fan and the reason I'm here is to find a thread just like this to see who you guys have in mind to replace Suarez/use the Suarez money on. I actually feel bad that this is happening to you, but the best way to deal with it is cut your losses and make the team even better. You can be just as good as Tottenham if they lose Bale and your players play as well as they are capable of.

You're right, everyone will ignore the undergrad once you've got a masters. The same as everyone will ignore your A-Levels once you've got a degree.

The biggest mistake I still see students making (I graduate 3 years ago, still do some mentoring) is students get way too worked up and stressed about choices that ultimately don't matter. You seem to have your head screwed on here as to what the implications are, but also seem worked up.

For those ""better"" universities. Have you been to visit them? Did you like them? Did you get a chance to talk to the lecturers and (almost more important than anything else) was the town/city the kind of place you'd like to live.

If you've not visited and don't know a thing then be wary. There would be nothing worse than bailing on a ""better"" course because you couldn't hack the lifestyle of the place. It does happen, while at uni I knew 2 people on my course who left part way through just to start all over at a new university. They did better at the new place because they preferred the location.

Also can you right now tell the difference in course content between the universities. It's fine if you can't. But if you can, focus on the university that piques your interest the most. Again, you don't want to be leaving a university half way through because one focuses on medical application of psychology where you'd prefer to focus on psychological research (or whatever).

Sorry, I seem to have waffled a little (my typing is getting too fast I can say way more than I thought I'd written). It's hard to give a concrete yes or no. But stick with your gut when it comes to picking a uni. Go with the one you think ""feels"" right. If it feels fine and has Russell group then great.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"I'd rather have him rot on the bench that playing against us in England.

Suarez is repeating his actions at Groningen. Even if he doesn't have a case, it's all just to apply pressure. ""I can stir up enough of a fuss to get out of any contract, I've done it before."" This is on a much bigger stage though, and I think LFC have the stones to say ""screw you"" and give him the Tevez treatment.

This just gets uglier and uglier. I suspect Rodgers and FSG would rather bench him and see if his value comes back up in January, or better yet, we wait until he comes to his senses because he's a competitor who can't live without being on the field. Either way, I really can't see him being at the club a year from now. At the same time, FSG will *never* sell to Arsenal, hence Luis' desperate actions this week.

My prediction: *unless* Madrid makes an offer, Suarez will not be sold. Once his suspension is over, if Suarez threatens to go on strike, we fine him and bench him. I'm holding out that Suarez is too interested in his career stats, his place on the national team, and his appeal to his dream club Real that he will play. And personally, I'd take a Suarez playing at 80% effort over most players in the league. He's still phenomenal. But at this point, I won't put anything past him. Nothing is too low. He's playing the transfer game like he plays on the field: any action is acceptable as long as I get the result I want.

He's brought so much shame to this club. Can you imagine how strong we'd be if Suarez had Henderson's personality? We're *this* close to taking over the league and returning to dominance. All we needed was for Suarez to be a normal fucking human being. But he isn't, so here we are.

To everyone that wants him out the door right now to his only suitor, don't complain when we can't sign anyone and the league becomes a ""big four"" game again, with Liverpool on the outside looking in for another five years. Right now, it's a ""big three"" league with Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham trying to get in the door and immediately lock it behind them so no one else can come in. Arsenal will accomplish this immediately if we sell them Suarez (for 15m less than what he's worth, by the way. What an insult. Fuck you gunners, and if any of you are here I count your downvotes as upvotes. I'll drink your tears when you get nothing this window.)

Maybe it's worth it to make a statement and say the club is more important, no matter how much it kills our season. Maybe it's better to languish mid-table and retain some dignity than it is to be bullied by a striker that you've stood by as he dragged your club through the mud. We've given him everything and he's happy to bite the hand that feeds without a second thought. He's selfish and short sighted. We were the *only* ones to stand by him through everything he's done (not counting the plastic Arsenal fans pulling a 180 this transfer window because they are spineless, inconsistent sheeple. Have some fucking self-respect.)

Just be aware that if Suarez walks out the door, our top four hopes this year walk out with him.

As for Moffat writing female characters, Sally Sparrow, Madame de Pompadour, Amy Pond (don't care what you say), and really I don't think River was that bad. A lot of the problem people seem to have with Moffat is that he doesn't use women being manly to empower them and keeps most of them somewhat true to traditional gender roles without making them weak. Most of his female characters are pretty actively doing something. And while some of them need to be saved, everyone needs to be saved sometimes and Amy or Rory or the Doctor have all had to save each other at different times.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"Ok, point taken.  Since you asked, I went to betting-directory.com.

For a top 4 finish (not 4th, but closest I could find):
Arsenal:  Ranges from 4/7 to 8/13
Tottenham:  7/4 to 2/1
Liverpool:  9/4 to 13/8 (with a few giving 2/1).

Based on those numbers, Arsenal is the odds on favorite to make top 4 from our 3 teams.  However, I question whether the betting lines are moving based on all the recent Suarez to Arsenal activity.

That being said, the implied probablity of an event based on those numbers mean Arsenal is the favorite at 63% chance of making 4th.  Tottenham is sitting at 36% chance, and Liverpool is bringing up the rear with 30%.  So, while my numbers were not accurate as far as I based them out of 100% and that's not how betting works, our implied percentage is still roughly 30% which (to be honest, I'm kinda proud of! :) ) is exactly what my first off the top of my head odds were.

So, the debate comes down to: Is a 30% chance at making top 4 worth the risk of a 24M investment over 3 years...  *shrug*  I think that Liverpool and FSG can afford it, you don't seem to think so.

Sure, even with the money we can buy quality replacements (Costa, Muriel), but Suarez going to Arsenal will just widen the gap between Europa spots and CL spots - it'll go back to the big four like the good ole' days, just without us. Outside of us, Arsenal is the team most fitting to Suarez' style of play in the PL. How could we promise CL football to players when our top goalscorer has just joined a rival? 

And we don't want a shot at top 5 - we want top 4. It might not be achievable this year, but next season, I think we'd be in with a good chance. Now that Suarez has shown his true colours, that plan has just taken two steps back - unless of course we buy quality replacements. 

Also, I'm sure if Suarez goes to Arsenal, Levy will *have* to sell Bale and spend because of two things: a) Arsenal are now a better squad, and b) He knows Liverpool are weaker.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; What has changed is that large numbers of ordinary, full time jobs have moved over to zero hours. That has absolutely no benefit to the employees, it just robs them of their basic employment rights - holidays, sick pay etc.

Do we have some numbers actually showing that?  By that I mean that the jobs have moved.  Because that isn't what the CIPD data showed.  In fact the survey that this horrifically bad op-piece is based on concluded that less than a quarter (24%!) of people on zero-hour contracts, wanted more hours.

What is important is that they aren't used as a mechanism for employers to dodge the requirements for sick pay and other important rights.

&gt;The employers are evading their responsibilities by pretending these are not permanent roles, when if fact they obviously are.

Got any numbers for that?  The CIPD survey (which sparked this outburst, because the official ONS figures are much lower) have the majority of workers considering themselves part-time.  A sizeable 38% said they worked more than 30 hours a week.  Ultimately it is a change in this figure we is required to back up the assertions.

The issue is that 14% (which if we're basing this on 1M is a hell of a lot of people) feel their employer doesn't provide them with enough hours for an adequate quality of life.  However 18% say this doesn't happen often, and over half report that it doesn't ever at all.

Another point was the lack of transparency and democracy many exhibited, and the tendency to bureaucratise with full time, well-paid and estranged leaderships and hierarchies which didn't work alongside the others and experience the same conditions and pay.

First off though, you are saying that the science behind the EPA study was flawed. Why do you think this? What in particular do you think they did wrong, and what data do you have to back this up?

Secondly, I'd suggest you look into some meta studies if you think that it's all a con. See:

In particular, pay attention to the conclusion of this paper:

Also this smaller meta analysis of other papers:

Chirches seems like he could slot immediately into the rotation, which at the moment is wildly important to us. Ilori is more a developmental case but i think would still give us a respectable (not world beater calibre but workman like of a young player learning his role) shift if need be.

The important part of both these guys is that they both seem very versatile (Chirches looks like he can slide up into a DM role as well as out to a wing and Ilori looks like he can cover a wing) which means we could leverage them in numerous ways over the span of the season and we would be giving ourselves more long term versatility down the line.

I think Jan is set at CB for years to come but we don't know how Kaboul will recover and Dawson traditionally has injury issues and is getting a bit older.

basstunedtored did a decent job of trying to put some context into his suitability;
http://basstunedtored.com/2013/07/25/is-suarez-suitable-for-arsenal/

While i think Suarez would do a job in any team, clearly, it isn't as clear cut as to whether Suarez would actually suit Arsenals style. He may well bag a fair few again, but giving the ball away as often as he does would expose Arsenals back 4 more often, which one would suspect would lead to more pressure and more conceded.

Regardless, if Arsenal is his destination (which I don't get to be fair, yes they may be in the Champions League, and that's not guaranteed right now, but they ain't exactly competitive in it. I would think that if Suarez wanted to be in the CL it would be to have a chance of winning it?), i guess there is nothing much we can do about that, other than as has been said, move on. Preferably quickly. In an ideal world, i couldn't look much further than the names already suggested... Muriel, Eriksen and Papadopolous. That's 3 positions throughout the squad (defence, midfield &amp; attack), and all 3 would almost certainly slot straight into the first team squad.

If we could get those 3, i'd be more than happy to fuck Suarez off. Even to Arsenal.",0,1375891134,null,0,false,0,cbitvjt,t3_1jvw1k,t1_cbitvjt,t1_cbitf0z,null,1429913569,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

You guys can maybe win a Europa League or domestic cup while waiting and keep the players happy. It's only a matter of time before United falls from their reign of dominance now that SAF is gone. 

Even if Tottenham spends the money, Arsenal will still be better if a DM is brought in and they will be on the same level as you guys.

What are you talking about?

&gt;If the train cost to much money drive or fly. That's free market economics.

Yes it is, so what? I am supposed to be impressed by this? Am I supposed to think this is a good thing? No country in the world has a completely free market economy for good reason, it would be a nightmare. Governments need to get involved to protect the rights of workers and consumers, to provide services that benefit society as whole and not just shareholders and to stop companies destroying society and the planet as they would without regulation or green taxes.

&gt;You complain the cheap mode of transportation is under taxed? Would you prefer it be more expensive? Seriously what fuck is wrong with you head?

Climate change has the potential to cause mass suffering death if we don’t do something to stop it. What do you think is going to happen when our coastal cities flood and changes to the climate mean we can’t grow enough food to feed ourselves. If you think that being able to get a cheap flight to Ibiza, or following free market idealogoly and ignoring the impact of flying on climate change is more important, I have to ask what the fuck is wrong with your head?

&gt;The train don't need the subsidy. The government keeps it's claws in train because it wants to control aspects of the industry.

What an idiotic thing to say, the train companies lobby for these subsidies, it’s not that the evil the government is not forcing them on them.

&gt;Jesus Christ you don't even understand how businesses work.

Think for one second how much it would cost for companies to start building new tracks alongside existing ones, just for the hope that they could compete with existing train companies and make a profit. No business would be that stupid, I can't believe you are *that* stupid to think that's a good business plan.

&gt;We could stop over taxing fuel then everyone can drive. Fuck the trains.

Yeah, never mind the smog, climate change, complete choas on the roads. fuck everyone I guess.

&gt;As for negative externalities you fail to realize most green things at the end of the day are not green. For example recycling the carbon foot print of trucks driving it all around and the plants to process it is much worse then the environmental cost of putting it in the bin. Big picture there in no green thing that is actually helping.

&gt;I was going to buy a bio ethanol car once. I looked up the environmental logistics of it all. Turns out Brazil is chopping down the rain forest to grow the corn and farmers are turning food crop into corn only for fuel leading to food shortages and a significant hike in the cost of food due to lack of supply. It would be greener for me to drive around in a fucking airplane.

Nice story, but your one example does not mean that any attempt to be green will ultimate fail. If that were true then why bother about anything, mankind would be extinct in a few generations anyway. You right-wingers always try to deny climate change exists or can be tackled, because it proves that the free market can't solve all of our problems, because it requires us to put long time survival ahead of short term profits.",0,1375891588,null,0,1375892968,0,cbiu1xf,t3_1jqkpj,t1_cbiu1xf,t1_cbhzqli,null,1429913487,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The Olympics is supposed to be about people from all over the world completing against one another with politics and grievences pushed aside. In past games we've had Americans wrestle Iranians, South Koreans swim against North Koreans, Communist and Capitalist states on the brink of nuking one another come together to play games of netball, and a great many more examples.

I don't think we should (or do) look back on the Olympics of the 1930s as a mistake like Stephen suggests- it showed we could put differences aside and compete against eachother in a civilized environment. Stephen acts like the 1930s Olympics were some kind of vindication of Hitlers policies by other western leaders when it definitely was not. Yes, we are all are sad the Jews were gassed but I think you'd have to have been dropped on your head pretty hard as a child to think the Olympics played a major factor in things.

Also we had this exact same debate with the Chinese Olympics and, looking back, would it have been better if we had boycotted that?

If anything, this shows that she has a desire to work more hours. Chances are that she is already a good worker, which is why she wants to take on more work. What possible benefit does the manager or company gain from punishing her from finding another concurrent job?

It's just illogical to me. The only reason to limit part time workers is as some sort of power trip, there's no proper reason I can think of!",0,1375894522,null,0,false,0,cbiv876,t3_1jvgct,t1_cbiv876,t1_cbiurxl,null,1429912939,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,nickfehlinger,eccleston,Eccleston,"The doctor's personality always changes. It would be racist if they made him a black Doctor who's personality was a stereotype, but as long as the new personality fits within the existing tone of the show no it's not racist to have a black Doctor. I'm very confused by this part of the question. The other part, concerning why it's important is also a little bit baffling, but let's see what we can do with it. ""Why is it important to have a black Doctor?"" Well, because there never has been. The fact is that as much as we'd like to think we live in a post-racial world, we just simply don't. Racism exists everywhere and is extremely prevalent on television. The fact that there has never been a black Doctor is evidence of that. You are trying to say that the actor should be chosen based on who is best for the role, and I agree with you. But I have a hard time believing that in what is now 12 incarnations of the Doctor, that person has never been anything other than a white male. Now in earlier incarnations, basically anything before the new series, you can pretty much without question attribute this to racism, ""it was a different time"" etc, etc, blah blah bullshit. But now, it our ""post-racial society"", the doctor is 4 times still a white male. That doesn't fit the population. At some point the best actor to walk through the door was black but he just ""didn't quite fit the character"" which is code for, ""The doctor has always been a white male, people don't like change"" which is racist.

Would the world be a better place? I would argue that the world as a whole doesn't give a shit who the next Doctor is, most of them probably haven't even heard of the show. But it would open up black youth who do watch the show to a new role model, it would introduce through the media coverage a much larger audience to the show and it would be taking a leadership role in breaking down racial barriers of sci fi as a whole, and sci fi is notoriously pale. Would the world be a better place? The world will go on as it always has.

There are places with completely free market economics. You call them tax havens.

If people want to free market to be green it would be green. People don't really want that though. 

You have to lobby if the other side is lobbying. Do you understand how lobbying works? Please look that up also. There is absolutely nothing wrong with lobbying.

By your questionable logic the train tracks should not even have been built in the first place.

If people cared about the environment they would buy cleaner cars. They don't do that because they don't fucking care.

Every single green intuitive costs more to environment then it gains. Why bother making it worse? IDK so idiots like you will vote for it?

No us right-wingers like to do this that are logical and sensible. I don't see why we can't use glass bottles and then clean them. I don't see why we can't take our week shopping home in the box it was delivered to the store in rather then plastic bags. I don't see why we can't self recycle stuff in our own homes.  I also don't see why products require so much packaging. But then again I'm a intelligent person who can see the big picture. I don't think the environment is greatly at risk the majority of people still agree with me. But I do think we can do small common sense things to further our resources and reduce pollution.

The free market solves problem that exist. The free market solves problems people are concerned about your green stuff is not one of them.

We don't know how the universe actually works, that's the whole point. Why does it need to be bullshit science in stead of bullshit science with based around emotion?

My point about the show taking itself more seriously is that I feel like the production quality has gone way up and the enemies feel much more polished. I can't imagine Moffat doing an enemy like the Slitheen or the Adipose. I'm also happy to see the departure of the ridiculous 70's-porno lighting from the Rose seasons.

true,Totenglocke42,null,null,"&gt; I'm currently watching The Thick of It and I'm amazed at this sheer ability he has to channel pure rage and anger.

The fact that he's angry doesn't make him a good actor.  A good actor can do a *range* of emotions and personalities.  He's very one-dimensional.  As for age?  There are plenty of *good* actors that are in their 50's if they wanted someone older and Tennant was big fan but you're forgetting one thing - David Tennant *is a fucking amazing actor*.  Capaldi doesn't even come close to David Tennant in acting ability.

Sorry, but when you have a string of great actors in the lead like they have, going to some mediocre guy and making the show look like a low budget SyFy Channel show that can't afford decent actors is a huge step backwards.

I'm still hoping (I know it's in vain) that this is just another joke by the BBC, kind of like when they told us that Matt Smith was going to be the Doctor through the end of 2014 and then went ""Just kidding, he'll be gone at the end of the year!""  Since I know that won't happen, I'll be crossing my fingers and hoping for another Eccelston who only lasts for one season.  No one I know who's a fan is happy about this except for Reddit and the only reasons Redditors can give for why he's a good choice are: 1) ""He's old"" 2) ""He's a fan of the show"" and 3) ""I can't wait to see him act like Malcolm Tucker and say *Fuck off you stupid fucking Dalek's*!""

HOWEVER! Introducing John Hurt as a version of the Doctor bumps Eleven back up to the Eleventh regeneration. But then there is Ten's fake out regeneration where he did the gold burst thing, but didn't actually change forms. If that counts as a true regeneration then Eleven is actually the 12th regeneration, making Peter Capaldi the 13th regeneration.

Ed Balls) also use zero-hours contracts.  As a policy it's not ialways bad in itself, but it is when workers have no other choices.  Some people like zero-hours contracts - the NHS has 1000s of workers on zero-hours contracts, they are known as ""Bank"" workers and it's incredibly popular.  Means you can pick and choose when you work without being tied down to regular hours (which suits lots of people, often alongside their normal regular job).  The challenge comes when you are banned from taking a second job which some orgs (e.g. McDonald's) seem to be doing.

As Guido Fawkes pointed out today, will the Labour Party insist that all workers at their next conference venue are on non-zero contracts?  I bet that many of the staff will be workers who sign up with a venue (like I did at university) to work big events as and when needed but without a formal set-hours contract.

If Bale leaves, and thats a big if, I hope they do it as soon as possible. We need time to spend the money. It could be argued that chadli would replace him at the wing, but i thought of him more as cover for both wings, not a starting position. 

Im not sure if this is true or not, but i read that we will only be getting 20 mil a year for 4-5 years. This 80-100 mil bid shouldnt be as tempting as it sounds, and everyone would prefer getting that money from champions league football, not real madrid.

I am glad I checked to see if it had been asked.I have confusion about this too, because the way people talk about having a female doctor, it seems like the desire is for a female doctor who identifies as a female. I am not the most informed about such things, but I thought a big part of the LGBTQ world is that gender identity isn't fluid or something you decide to change. I certainly feel that way as a straight woman.Maybe Time Lords are different. Maybe some of them, like the Corsair, do have more flexibility when it comes to gender/sexuality.  The Doctor has never acted like that was part of his identity. Maybe that is what the writers mean by not ready. There needs to be some groundwork laid showing the Doctor could identify as female. It would be really hard to follow as a viewer if the Doctor was a pretty clearly heterosexual man with a man's identity one minute and then a heterosexual woman who identifies as a woman next. Those are such basic parts of how we identify ourselves as humans, that it would be hard to follow that character as the same one we know and love.I still think it would be nice to see in the future, but I think there would need to be some story building to it so we could identify the female Doctor as the one we have always known.",0,1375898918,null,0,false,0,cbix0nw,t3_1juwh9,t1_cbix0nw,t3_1juwh9,null,1429912103,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

There seems to be a divide between 1) people saying that Russia is completely evil in every way and should be treated as such by the international community and 2) people talking of hypocrisy with regards to personal freedoms in other countries.

Here's the point. I think most can agree on relative morality, but it follows that we should also be able to come to some international consensus of what each end of the spectrum looks like. Russia's current treatment of LGBT is, I think, clearly far towards the 'bad' end. On this point I think I am in agreement with the majority. 

It's that simple. 

The Olympics are a huge gathering of international communities. If we collectively oppose Russia's persecution of LGBT then boycotting is the Olympics is not hypocritical, or 'political' (Fry even explains that the word 'politics' derives from the Greek word for 'of the people'), it's simply the will of those who would attend/watch the event. 

Fry is completely right to make his opinion known, and we are completely right to support him, or not.

No. As you said, we don't need the cash. But even if we were to completely ignore that facet of the argument, look at who we have to play in these positions assuming said transfers would happen. For CB we have an aging Terry, Cahill, Young talents in Kalas and Omeruno (spelling?), and we could play Brana there like last season. None of those players have the talent or playstyle of Luiz.

Now, look at who we have for Strikers: Lukaku, Torres, Ba, and Lalkovic once he returns from loan. Torres is nowhere near his old form, but Lukaku obviously had tons of potential and hopefully Ba (with a proper preseason with the team) will regain some of his form again and look threatening.

You are absolutely correct that the show is now fantasy instead of scifi, but, honestly, I really miss that aspect of the show.  There is certainly something to be said for telling the personal, direct stores of Moffat, but I liked it better when those were contrasted with the galaxy spawning epics of RTD.  I think the decrease in 2+ part stories in the last season or so has contributed significantly to this feeling for me.

Thinking about ""scary"" episodes, as much as I love ""Hide"" (and while it certainly gets...scifi-ish very late in the episode), I'd rather watch ""Midnight"" every time.  There is a lot of good fantasy out there right now.  I wish Doctor Who could find a bit more of its scifi vibe again.

The two founding ideals of the NHS are

1) Funded out of general taxation and free at the point of use

2) Access to care determined by clinical need, regardless of ability to pay

Older Redditors will remember when British Leyland was a nationalised industry. Despite being nationalised, you still had to pay for you car and rich people paid more and got better ones. The nationalisation/privatisation debate is orthogonal to the ideals of the NHS.

Under appropriate circumstances, the government can uphold the two founding ideals and yet purchase care for a patient in the South East of England from a French hospital.
(Contrived Example: Doctor: You say that your hernia was giving you trouble during your recent holiday in France; how would you like a Eurostar ticket and an operation in Calais?)

Why should a patient care that their nurse is British and *directly* employed by Her Majesties Government?

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"I only caught the last 20 or so minutes and the goals as gifs so here are a couple of late game thoughts:

* Having Countinho behind Borini makes a HUGE difference for Borini. I’ve always asserted his best attributes are his movement, work-rate, and ability to find space. I think the problem so far is that we haven’t had someone who is on his wavelength for seeing his movement for what it is. *Enter Countinho.* Borini is finally getting great passes to reward his great movement. As a Plan B “fox-in-the-box” striker he looks to have someone to help him unlock that potential. Great to see but the finishing needs work.

* Kelly is probably rusty and still recovering but he still looks nothing like a Rodger’s right back. I think he has tons of potential but it just isn’t as a wingback. Sure, he’d be great against someone like Stoke when you want as many tough headers on the pitch as once but Johnson still deserves the start any other da. Wisdom and Toure look solid. I’m especially impressed with Wisdom at CB. I’ve been hearing the rave reviews but it was nice to finally see him in action.

* Assaidi who? He hasn't featured much this pre-season and I can see why. I’m assuming he’ll be off sooner rather than later. Got an assist late on but seemed anonymous or missing a more-or-less sitter.

* From the highlights Aspas looks quite the player. Very excited to see him during the season.

I didn't get to see Allen or Alberto. How were they? Where exactly does Alberto play?

1. To new fans, RTD Who is ""proper Who"" and tend to assume that Moffat, by doing some things differently from Davies, is getting it wrong. Admittedly, the complete cast change didn't help smooth over the first head writer change of the New Series. 

2. Many new fans watched the RTD era in a matter of weeks via Netflix or some such thing. The experience of watching the Moffat era at a much slower pace allows the viewer to dwell more on the things they didn't like and feel more disappointed when an arc doesn't  wrap up the way they wanted since they've spent more time with it.

3. Due to Moffat's worse relations with the press than Davies, many publications have taken an anti-Moffat stance as a way of bullying him into being more open.

true,SlaterATX,flair4,,"It's true that a good manager will adapt his tactics to his players and not the other way around, but there's a reason you don't see a 3-6-1 drawn up too often (if ever); tactically it's a mess. While a 3-5-2 might shape up in a game occasionally to look like 6 in midfield, as a starting formation it confuses too much in the middle. Not practical even if you have an impressive stable of midfielders you want to see run out each week.

As far as a 3-5-2 is concerned, it could maybe works for Spurs, but definitely not with Walker in the side or Bale at forward. 

A proper 3-5-2 depends on the presence of 3 solid and laterally mobile center-halves at the back. Spurs benefit from having Walker in the side when he's able to overlap on the wing and provide attacking width. Otherwise, he's a serviceable defender. A good outside back, but would be poor in a back 3. Kaboul would be a better option.

The problem with Bale as a forward in a 3-5-2 is that he wouldn't have the same opportunities to roam, receive the ball deep, and make those driving runs toward goal he's now known for. In a 3-5-2, your forwards are ideally pressing the opposition's backline deep and looking for opportunities to make quick runs in behind or receive balls to feet or over-the-top to hold up for midfield runners. This suits Soldado's game, and even Ade's at his best, but definitely not Bale's. Even on the wing in a 3-5-2 Bale would be marginalized, as wings in this formation are relied upon primarily for width and crosses into the box but see the goal far less than wide mids in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-4-2. 

Bale or no Bale (hoping Bale), I think we're building a squad that is well suited to play a high tempo 4-3-3 that can seamlessly transition to a more defensive, possession-oriented 4-2-3-1 after a lead.

Means we actually have about £5m left in the reported transfer budget and we are still reportedly shopping THudd, Parker, Naughton, BAE, Livermore and either Ade or JD (and depending on the source Townsend and potentially Gylfi though i think those are BS personally), which means we could possibly sign an additional 1-2 players if we are smart about it and the reported budget is correct.

Now if we suddenly go out and buy a ~£30m player and a ~£15m player....then concerns are very much warranted.

at the moment, we have just spent wisely to strengthen the team and given the TV money may even have a little bit more money that is being reported.  I think we are doing all we can to give AVB the team he wants to push for the CL this season.",0,1375902450,null,0,false,0,cbiyhos,t3_1jwg0h,t1_cbiyhos,t3_1jwg0h,null,1429911416,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

I seriously doubt someone becomes a Senior animal keeper without some serious attatchment to the animals they work with, and doubt even moreso that they would one day decide to out of the blue, punch a seal. I mean, cruelty to animals is sort of exactly what the selection process for that job is designed to filter out. Maybe he is some kind of nutcase that has been stealthily abusing animals on the sly, but again I doubt that. 

I'm betting he was probably a bit overly physical in the weighing process or the animal suddenly tried to bite and he reacted by hitting it on the nose. I mean, if its been checked by the vet and its absolutely fine then the guy really couldn't have actually given it much of a blow, if he even did. I'm not saying that I'm condoning hitting animals needlessly, but if its the choice between getting bitten or slapping something on the nose I know what I'd go for.

 Also, Its a Mirror article. There's no information as to when the incident occured or who it involved, its simply an allegation that at some point (assumingly recently) a seal may have been hit by a keeper, a named vet looked at it and now everything's fine.

Capoue is a very talented player who's main focus is the ability to play DM.  Sandro is coming off a pretty major injury and this allows us to give Sandro a legitimate backup.  That is just on the surface what Capoue brings to us.

Consider that Capoue can play CB (saw someone say he can cover RB as well but i haven't seen that anywhere) and CM which allows us to have Capoue serve as coverage for Sandro, our CB's and Paulinho in the more advanced CM slot (box-to-box not AM).  That is one player.

This means we can shift Parker and THudd out saving on salary, means that we can look to get a single defender who can cover multiple slots instead of a CB and a LB.  Means we can send Carroll out on loan where he will get more time than he would if we kept him in house.

Each manager manages around 8 to 10 social workers. Each senior manager managers around 4 or 5 managers and the assistant director manages about 4 to 6 senior managers. 


All frontline social workers have to attend case meetings, court dates, family visits and one to ones. They all have clinical supervision and regular team meetings. They also have to attend regular training to stay on top of things and maintain their registration. 

I bet you can only think of 3 or 4 cases in the last 10 years when things have gone wrong - Victoria Climbie, Baby P etc. In each case at least one person and usually more has been strung out to dry as a result, evem though they are usually collective failures. In reality, it goes wrong much more often, you just don't hear about it. Despite, with around 10,000 kids on care or at risk each year, major cuts, increasing workload and the constant threat of appearing the cover of the Daily Mail if you miss a signal, it works surprisingly well.

A frustration for me is when we are defending and none of our players step in to make a tackle. It seems like they are all just trying to slow the opposition down and wait for a teammate to win the ball. 
As I said, they were all tired so that plays a huge part in the performance. Naismith looked a whole lot better than last season. Oviedo looks good. Barkley will step up big this season.

true,Ploufy,null,null,"The idea is simply that by using z-score, you are assuming that the data follows a normal distribution. The question is what are the properties of the normal distribution and does our data agree with our assumptions ( example: stock markets: 
if you assume that stock markets follow a normal distribution you would be suggesting that: 
* returns have a constant mean
* returns are homoscedastic (constant variance)
* returns have zero-excess kurtosis
* returns have zero skewness

However take any stock, calculate the returns and look at the graph and you will see excess kurtosis and skewness, if you want to be more formal you could do a Jarque-Bera test, where you will reject the null hypothesis of a normal distribution).
 
In the blog you linked, they say "" Rankings amongst players at same position based on attacking potential (based on Z-score)"" I would argue that player's abilities do not follow a normal distribution as there are far too many outliers in players (i.e. too many shit -Crystal Palace, and too good -Arsenal,Man Utd, Chelsea etc..). Additionally, making projections with a normal distributions means that outlier events have zero chance of happening (West Brom beating Chelsea) or close enough to zero that by running your 10,000 simulations and averaging it's never going to happen. The effect is that your assumptions about player's attribute play a huge part in your simulations.

true,chrisjd,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxfordshire,"&gt;There are places with completely free market economics. You call them tax havens.

Tax havens don't do any real business. Companies are based in these countries purely for tax reasons, often they have no customers or even employees in the countries they are supposedly based, just a PO box. They are parasites feeding off the real economies of other countries. Great example of free market economics then.

&gt;You have to lobby if the other side is lobbying. Do you understand how lobbying works? Please look that up also. There is absolutely nothing wrong with lobbying.

Again I have no idea what you are saying? Who is on the other side of rail companies lobbying for subsidies?

&gt;By your questionable logic the train tracks should not even have been built in the first place.

There's a huge difference between building the tracks in the first place and building new tracks to compete with an existing service.

&gt;Every single green intuitive costs more to environment then it gains. Why bother making it worse? IDK so idiots like you will vote for it?

Yeah keep sticking your head in the sand, renewables produce less CO2  than fossil fuels. Fuel duty undoubtedly puts people off driving and encourages them to buy more fuel efficient cars. The fact the government forced car companies to fit catalytic converters has reduced fuel emissions. There are hundreds of successful green initiatives, you just choose to ignore them because reality doesn't fit with your ideology.

&gt;No us right-wingers like to do this that are logical and sensible. I don't see why we can't use glass bottles and then clean them. I don't see why we can't take our week shopping home in the box it was delivered to the store in rather then plastic bags. I don't see why we can't self recycle stuff in our own homes. I also don't see why products require so much packaging. But then again I'm a intelligent person who can see the big picture. I don't think the environment is greatly at risk the majority of people still agree with me. But I do think we can do small common sense things to further our resources and reduce pollution.

&gt;The free market solves problem that exist. The free market solves problems people are concerned about your green stuff is not one of them.

Look up [Tradegy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Climate change is a classic example of it, and you've described the problem very well. Most people are seriously worried about climate change, but few people are willing to go far enough to make the changes to their lifestyles to combat it, because it seems pointless when everyone else might just carry on and continue to destroy the environment. Only the government, through subsidies and taxation, can make a significant change to climate change by rewarding green behavior and taxing individuals and most importantly companies that pollute.",0,1375908510,null,0,false,0,cbj0zh2,t3_1jqkpj,t1_cbj0zh2,t1_cbivs9a,null,1429910242,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A new party needs three things. Good, clear leadership. A clear and concise manifesto with tactics and strategy. As well as a marketing campaign to build support. Trouble is there are many more interests who can assemble that with the resources they have without having to scrimp and save. My assessment, barring a dramatic shift in public opinion, a benevolent billionaire, or a powerful figure to rally behind there is no likelihood that anything will change and Thatcher's children will continue the slow conversion to destroy socialism and turn us into nothing but productive little consumers.

Shift is 2 12 hour days, followed by 2 12 hour nights then 4 days off. Basically the same shifts as wholetime firefighters. It's a little family unfriendly, but it of course depends on your home situation.

Some days there can be few calls, some are non stop. In my county there are usually 5 guys or girls handling the whole county. One in command, one handling 999 calls, one operating the radio, with the other two available for overload, or training if not busy. This can go down to 4 with annual leave or possibly 3 with sickness. The roles are rotated regularly and interchangeable if for example one is already taking a 999 call, anyone else can perform any task.

&gt;literally 9 hours non-stop in front of a computer taking emergency stressful calls... is this how it is?

It can be. You have to imagine, if there is a large fire, there will be a large amount of 999 calls. They are the ones who talk to people who are potentially trapped in a house fire or in a smashed vehicle. They need to root out the important information such as address, situation, number of casualties, then they need to use this info to decide what resources to send. 1 fire engine, 2, 3, 10? The mass decontamination response?

Then there is the prank calls or silly calls, which always happen, and the malicious calls to try and filter out.

Yes, you can actually get a cup of tea or take a piss if you can. They can't refuse you basic refreshments and facilities, but if they have it all on, they hold it and use that radio or phone.

&gt;What if you get and address wrong and kind of... someone dies or something because of your mistake. 

All calls are recorded so they can listen back, and serious incidents are usually listed to by both the phone operator and the officer in charge of control for 2 sets of ears. 99 times out of 100 and wrong addresses that are given, are done so by the caller. It's easy to say something road, when you mean something street, or get a number wrong, however, local knowledge by the fire crews that attend and getting people to confirm addresses usually overcomes this. Incorrect addresses are fairly common, but rarely if ever a huge problem. Large incidents have multiple calls regarding them, and so plenty of chances to find the correct address before an attendance arrives.

One major problem I find is the passing on of information from the police or ambulance. We have several 'Pre determined attendance' numbers, meaning how many fire appliances are sent to certain incidents. For example, a building fire gets 2 pumps, a persons reported fire gets 3 pumps and an ambulance, an RTC with persons trapped gets 2 pumps, etc, etc, etc. Control staff get the information they need from the caller and send the PDA, upgrading it if it sounds like it needs it, however, the police or ambulance service have a habit of understating the incident.

A police officer will say ""We need fire to clean up this RTC"" to his control and that will be passed on in that text to ours. What he actually means is ""We have an RTC with 2 persons trapped by injures requiring extrication."" Fire don't get that info, so they send an attendance for a small RTC make safe, rather than a persons trapped event, which is more people, more equipment, and so on our arrival we need to make up for another attendance to assist.

*What does Immunicity do?*

Immunicity gets you to add a Proxy Auto Configuration file (PAC). A PAC can tell your browser to send your internet traffic through different proxies depending on the URL. A PAC is very powerful, it could tell your browser to send *every* request through their servers.

At the time of writing this, this is the PAC file they are offering for Google Chrome. 

http://pastebin.com/ShgpPSq6

As you can see they are sending a list of websites, mainly porn sites and torrent sites, through their proxies.

If you are going to these sites through their proxies, they basically have ""god mode"" for these sites, they can see everything you are doing, any login information you send, or even edit the page content without your knowledge.

(Yes I know HTTPS makes this less possible, but many HTTPS pages load HTTP resources which can be attacked etc...)

As long as you are not logging in to any sites on that list, I would say you have nothing to worry about.

If I put on my *super* paranoid hat, I would say it is possible they are serving malicious PAC files to a subset of users. Perhaps they say everyone using IE6 gets an malicious PAC as they are the least technically minded users, and everyone else gets the aforementioned version. 

Or maybe they targeted you by your IP because they really hate you.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; The belief that risk could be spirited away through clever mathematics and lots of middlemen is what caused the financial crisis.

Actually the problem was the maths wasn't clever.

A lot of financial markets are about spreading risk.  Say your an airline and you self a ticket today.  You are worried about the price for fuel in 6 months time, so you buy an option.  That is because you don't want the price to rise, you don't care if it falls, you've made your profit on the price of the ticket today.  However some speculators might think it overpriced, so they would take a position that would let them profit from this happening, at the expense of it rising.  Obviously that is a very useful thing.

However if you've got say 100 mortgages, and you say that on average 3% default, that doesn't mean you can just say only 3 from that package will.  Because ultimately if they are all in the same town, the people defaulting on the mortgage would be related, General Motors close the factory and boom, 50%+ of the mortgages default.

This was the issue, a lack of pricing in for correlated risk.

But it got more complex.  Say Lehman Brothers goes bust, well hold on a second, because it turns out everyone has been doing trades with them, and it is depressing them too, as well as you.

It is simplistic to try and blame a few rottern apples for this, yes there were some terrible NINJA loans sold to people who never should have been offered them.

But there is a deeper problem, if a system has been making money for 3 years, and someone says *hang on, this has no idea of correlated risk or credit value adjustments* they get ignored, because it's been making money, they are just a chicken little.  Many institutes haven't changed that much, they still have the management structure that rewards only declared profit, not loss prevention or stability provision.  If the incentive structure isn't fixed, no progress will be made.

Sadly, there are a bunch of ill educated types who haven't worked in the sector, who have no real understanding of these things, who talk a lot about the problems in a dramatic way, promoting silly ideas.  They have a habit of playing right in to the hands of people who want to support the status quo, because they prevent informed discussion of the topics.  : (",0,1375909864,null,0,false,0,cbj1j5o,t3_1jvhlq,t1_cbj1j5o,t1_cbiqn8g,null,1429909985,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

With a midfield as powerful as ours, there is no need to overload it into a 3-6-1 as we would be making sacrifices in terms of defenders/strikers to shore up what is likely an already overwhelming force.

A 3-6-1 formation is built around short passes and possession football.  Teams that want to starve the opposition of possession. It would suit a team like Stoke if they weren't so defensive. 

A basic ideal in tactics is to try and control the ball with as few midfielders as possible. This gives you a stronger force in attack and/or a safer defence.

4-3-3 is exceptional for us. It keeps our defence stable, allows us more bite in attack, and thanks to our exceptionally strong and flexible midfield we can control the game against X-4-X or potentially even X-5-X depending on the abilities of our opponent.

true,TLKv3,null,null,"I feel like the only way they could EVER do it correctly is to clearly state upon the announcement of the then-actor portraying The Doctor leaving the show to outright say ""we'll be heavily considering female actresses for the role as well"". Make sure people know weeks, if not months, ahead of time that it can happen. Then upon hiring the actress immediately announce it. Don't try to keep secrets about it, be as open as possible. It'll soften people up months before the Series actually airs with her so they go into the Series comfortable with it. And then write the show as usual without bringing up the fact The Doctor is female except for the first 30 seconds of his/her regeneration.

I'd also suggest revealing something each month until the Series airs. Companion's new wardrobe, a hint or two of The Doctor's new outfit, clues to the first story or how the regeneration happens, etc. Keep people curious and wanting to know how it happens and want more of her mystery unveiled.

In principle this prevents a cascade because the derivatives are denominated in dollars.

All this talk of improving GDP and employment numbers etc kind of overlooks the original massive problem which remains basically unchanged and liable to blow up again - the system is fragile!

true,captainlavender,smith,Smith,"Well I don't like people getting downvoted without being responded to, so hell, I'll bite.

I think the Doctor's youth and the decisions to repeatedly harp on his sex appeal are largely a product of writing, and particularly writing things that Moffat thinks teenage fans will like (whether or not they do). I think most fans, teen girls included, have gotten a bit annoyed by the companions falling for the young, cute Doctor over and over and over again. I see this same thing on Sherlock, actually -- we spend a lot of time on the main character as some irresistible sex symbol, and we see multiple ladies fall for him (some quite improbably), yet he rejects them all. It's actually pretty annoying, even if you are a fan of romantic storylines. That said, some people like the romance. It's clearly true. But it bears remembering that these people are not controlling the show. If they want to go moon-eyed over the romance, that's basically their right. If you dislike it or find it to be ""nonsense"", hopefully there are ways for you to avoid it. Doesn't make it wrong. Sometimes stuff makes people happy. Remember the ending of The Doctor Dances? I had to get up and do a victory dance, I was so pumped. If it's a kiss that makes some fan giddy, that's fine by me. We all have different tastes.

I think we may be miscommunicating about your second point. I am not arguing that male objectification doesn't happen. Actually, judging by movies in recent years, it seems to be suddenly happening in a way I've never even seen before. I'm only saying that it is far more conspicuous because of how unusual it is. Guys are basically expected to enjoy hot girls -- there's no stigma. But many women are very uncomfortable enjoying hot guys, because we're not supposed to notice that stuff. Strip clubs, for example -- a man or a woman may enter one, and grab a few drinks, and there's nothing too abnormal about it. But the reason you mostly see bachelorette parties and other parties at strip clubs featuring guys is that a woman patronizing a strip club alone is seen as very unusual, and outside the norm. Women are taught not to objectify, for the most part, and even to ignore their own libidos. And if a man walked into a strip club that featured men, odds are he would be uncomfortable. Because male nudity for the viewing of women is weird. An oddity. It makes a lot of people uneasy.

I think we may simply disagree about wardrobe choices. Because there are so many in-universe justifications for fanservice and nudity, I tend to start by asking myself, how much nudity is there, and from what gender? Then, I look for an in-universe explanation and judge for myself how justified vs. how superfluous the nudity/fanservice was. In this case, I would not say that the Doctor's keen sense of fashion is what dictates his outfits, nor his adherence to human norms such as ""old dudes wear suits"". So, really, I'm not actually sure why he doesn't wear revealing clothing. To me, this in-universe justification is weak.

Non-native English speakers tend to notice it rather more because, as well as disguising three-quarter of other Rs as Hs (as in *rather* becoming *rathuh*), we then do this baffling thing of putting in new ones where they don't exist.

And there is no way you could possibly believe that they wouldn't be able to find a guy for this male part, or that they could somehow find a women that is going to play the part so well that they have to use her over using a guy.

It just doesn't make sense.

And I'm sick of people spouting nonsence like ""this blanket statement."" to try and somehow discard what other people say. It's a guys part, and we were even told so during the live show. The only reason to make it a women would be for the wow factor in chainging it up. It's that simple. It might as well be a fact.

The simple fact though is that the position has not been open to women, and they would have to specifically open the part up to women in order to try and fine people, so they would be looking for a women to fill the role. They would have to have a reason to do that. And that reason would definitely be to mix things up in some way.

There needs to be some restructuring of Stormont either politicly or operationally, personally I'd like to see some form of loyal opposition (but this will cause issues given that a sizeable amount of the executive aren't loyal anyway) so that it can effectively deal with social and economic issues present in the country. this will have a knock on effect of demonstrating quite clearly that cooperation is possible and beneficial. 

We also have the issue of how ministries are dished out among the executive, the aims of the current system are good and I agree with them however it leaves a lot to be desired when actually forming an executive, you have the country mostly voting at least economically, right wing, yet we have a great risk of a socialist party getting the finance ministry. You have one department deciding who gets the money but not how it is spent, which doesn't help with coordinating economic growth. It is essentially pot luck if the party you voted for gets to deal with the reasons you voted for them.

Also the selection process for first and second minister is peculiar, the house is presented with a pair and has to vote on the pair, yea or nae, of the vote is against another pair is selected, some think, and I'm inclined to agree with them, that you should vote on an individual basis. This however, could create a misrepresentation at the top posts but is likely to result in relative moderates in the top two positions, UUP and SDLP, which would result in better cooperation.

There is no reason for them to LOOK for a women, especially over a guy, for the role of the Doctor, a male role.

There isn't anything to ensure it, but there is enough for us to gather that he identifies as male, and there is enough for us to go on to tell whether or not a female would be good in the role.

Moffat's statement of ""I think it's about time a man plays the queen."" should make it clear enough that even he knows that the part is a male part. 

I hope he or anyone else that believes they have found a female doctor character takes a good hard look at the show and really weights the options.

Not only that, but Russia is a country that most of us would consider vaguely close to us culturally - they have similar religious basis and while their recent political history has been all over the place, they had similar imperialism to the UK for a while.

When an average person hears news about people being killed or arrested for homosexuality in, for example, Egypt, their first reaction (however incorrect) could easily be ""oh, it's still really bad there, maybe it's improving, at least it won't happen here because we're not predominantly Muslim or particularly religious at all"". But when they hear about similar things in Russia, suddenly that changes to ""things are getting worse there, and I thought Russia was more like Europe, so I don't really have any reasons for it not to happen here"".

Stephen Fry is asking the IOC and the UK and all the other countries to take action against this regression because human rights progression is something that should happen relatively naturally in most countries, so interfering doesn't help much, but *regression* is scary and bad and should be discouraged if at all possible. The IOC *did* interfere during Apartheid in South Africa, which was another example of a sort of regression and, combined with all the trading bans and everything else, the international pressure probably contributed quite a lot to the shift in opinion of Apartheid. I doubt the IOC will actually do anything, but it's as much about pointing out that they're not doing anything when asked for it as actually getting a result - if they were never asked, the IOC could just say that they didn't know it was an issue or something stupid like that.",0,1375920338,null,0,false,0,cbj5ch7,t3_1jvsxr,t1_cbj5ch7,t1_cbit86g,null,1429908206,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;Conduct on the part of an employee which is so bad that it destroys the employer/employee relationship, and merits instant dismissal without notice or pay in lieu of notice.

&gt;**Other lesser offences**, often relating to work and work performance - **for example poor timekeeping**, absenteeism, use of workplace facilities, personal appearance, negligence or sub-standard work - **do not usually amount to gross misconduct.**

true,mind_pro,null,null,"Joe Cole is a similar type of players to Hazard. These kind of players tend to use the ball alot and when they are in top form, those touches looks easy to the eye and are useful in making plays. That's why he won player of the year (similarly, wouldn't you say Hazard could have won that award this year too?) But when they are not in form, something they can usually do with 3 touches turns into 5 touches and those extra touches can affect their performance greatly. In the case of Joe Cole, since Mourinho's plays tend to revolves around a CF or a CM, the ball time (the minutes he has the ball) Joe Cole gets was subsequently lesser than it was before and when a player likes Joe Cole who uses the ball alot doesn't get the ball as much, his performance will suffer and that is why Joe Cole was terrible by the time he was sold 

Kalou on the other hand is not the kind of player who uses the ball. Instead, he wants a place in the starting line up and his way of doing it was to hold on to the ball whenever he gets it and tries to finishing everything by himself. Players like this don't see the game thoroughly as they do not understand that in any games, movement of the player is as important as scoring. In the case of Kalou (winger), sometimes you just won't get the ball even if you make those runs down the side because Chelsea has enough capable players to make plays in the middle instead on relying crosses for chance creation. And when Kalou doesn't get the ball as often, he felt that he needs to prove himself (not knowing that making runs are as important) and always goes back to midfield as gets the ball (which disrupts the play) and then dribbles it down the side a little before cutting into the middle to find space for a shot. 

Sturridge is alot like Kalou. He wants to prove himself by scoring instead of making spaces for himself and the team. If you watch some replays, you will see that 80% of them time if they have the ball, they push it down the side a little before cutting into the middle and shoot. Players like these looks good when they do score (like Robben, gets the ball, never pass, brings it to the middle and shoot), but when they fail to produce, they are the first to fall down the pecking order. 

And that is why he does not have enough quality to play for a club like Chelsea. Because when he is in top form, he fails to score with this play style, and when he is not in form, you know the play ends right where he gets the ball.",0,1375922084,null,0,false,0,cbj5xje,t3_1ju1ue,t1_cbj5xje,t1_cbj2r8q,null,1429907933,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

* In off-field terms, any doubts about Rodgers being a rookie have all but been extinguished. It is today that FSG's calculated gamble in picking someone who'd never managed a 'big club' before, truly paid off. It really does feel like Rodgers has been around forever.

* In on-field terms, Our system seems extremely fluid, and last season Suarez worked out the way he did because the attack was centered around him. Now, we have many more bright sparks, and the system isn't going to revolve around Suarez anymore. This system has admittedly worked too, as we saw in the second half of the season. And as we can roughly make out (albeit against lower opposition) in that this is only going to get better.

* May not mean much, but this pre-season has definitely been a silver lining around the Suarez saga. And instills in me renewed hope that the club will see brighter times, with or without Suarez.

I live in Mississippi, which I'm sure you can imagine is still insanely racially divided. My father is a minister and lives in a more impoverished part of the state than I. The railroad tracks literally form the racial divide in his town - ""across the tracks"" is basically a huge slum for African-Americans. 

Anyway, the reason this relates to your post is, a common term for African-Americans in that area is ""you-know-who."" ""Don't go to that park, that park is for you-know-who."" ""Don't drive down 15th Street, you-know-who lives around there.""

Back when season 6 actually aired, BBC America made a fuss and I was mildly curious so a friend who had been pestering me for awhile to get into -- we started there together. It wasn't a great launch point. I'd seen a few other episodes -- Blink, etc -- and I liked em ""okay"" but I didn't fall in love with it.

That said, I don't know why or what happened, but this year I just decided to show some of the episodes I had seen to my fiancee and something clicked. I suddenly got the ""Doctor."" I say that, because for me the charm of the show isn't so much the sci-fi aspect (I do love sci-fi, but that's not what stands out for me) -- suddenly he kinda became the quirky not-so-awesome-awesome superhero. I love his idealism and youthfulness and lack of cynicism -- for me, specially this day in age, it's not something you often find in a protagonist. And from there, I loved the hints of his darker side and his secret. 

I've now seen (and many of them, multiple times) everything from the reboot and am a die-hard fan. I didn't love the second half of season 7 but cannot wait nonetheless for the 50th. I don't know.

I will, however, spare you the standard ""timey-wimey"" cop out and suggest one possible explanation:

They never actually *meet* in the 50th.

We know they're both *appear* the 50th, but that doesn't mean they actually *interact* in the 50th. Perhaps 10 modifies his sonic for River to use in the library (remember, her sonic had the dampers, red setting, and neural relay), and then gives it to 11 to give to River later. (Or perhaps 10 gives it to Hurt, who ultimately redeems himself by saving River in this manner.)

Obviously, this is purely speculative. We'll have to wait and see what really happens. But if we're *ever* going to see River get her sonic, the 50th seems the most likely occasion.

&gt; it also looks like 11's. 

I have to disagree on that point. It's clearly 10's sonic with some extra bits tacked on. The only resemblance to 11's is the presence of some gold trim, but it's not even the *same* gold trim.

true,imperio115,null,null,"Firstly I'm gonna say that it's not gonna be a woman playing the doctor for a long time. why not? Well I’m going to have to agree with Neil Gaiman on this point that it’s not quite the time for a female Doctor just yet. Like his post says on tumblr, it would change the dynamic of the show too much and there would be a massive cut-off between a female doctor and the other Doctors. It’s not that I think it’s entirely impossible to have a female Doctor, I just think it’s something the show/story should build up to. I want it to be as canon as possible. And by canon I don’t just mean the Doctor randomly saying the Corsair was a “baaaad girl” at some point in his life. I want that possibility to be openly discussed and explored in the show, a part of the story. Casting a woman for the role right now would come off as too sudden and too forced. Again, I don’t think Moffat is to blame, at least not entirely. Let’s try to remember that even though he is showrunner, he does have to run important decisions through the powers-that-be at the BBC.

The comment Helen Mirren made was quite rightly deserved I personally thought i do think a woman should play the doctor. However I thought Moffat was fairly reserved in his response considering how people were quick to grasp onto her comments and hold her opinion up as a shining example of how things should be done. If it were me I would have went on T.V and told Mirren to keep her fucking opinions to herself unless she want to come and audition-which, btw Mirren said absolutely not.

Who knows, maybe by the time Moffat is casting his third, fourth or fifth Doctor personally, then he will go with a woman or even a person of color? Given him time. Let him play around with Who to see what works.

And really if someone is preparing a response to this I ask you this: Are we so insecure in the sexes that every major character NEEDS to be a woman to now seem unsexist? I think there shouldn’t be another batman played by a white male. Time to make a Batgirl movie now! Ironman? Hell no. Sexist! Why does he get three movies AND the Avengers? Time for an Ironwoman.

Funny how there was little problem with the other 11 male Doctors, but ahhh, Steven. Yes, we don’t like Steven, everything he does it wrong.

Moffat asked a convention in Cardiff-just to test the waters- of how they would feel about a female Doctor. The response was apparently luke warm. Sorry but Tumblr, and every other social media platform that these sensitive butthole individuals who think the doctor shouldnt be another male are on isn’t the be all and end all of the world and it’s opinions. You want a female Doctor so badly then the Moffat haters should start a campaign-get a petition and send it to the BBC. Show then how many people would like a female Doctor instead of writing snippy comments on a website.

Moffat also wrote a comic relief special for charity in 1999 where Joanna Lumley was the Doctor. That’s right, he can write a female Doctor and he does this when he doesn’t have to. also already been a female doctor. He is a busy man with more than one show to run why should he bother giving himself even more work? He is not obliged to give you specials or charity sketches, but he does. Moffat has also said the Doctor could theoretically turn into a woman, which is more than any other show runner has ever said.

So please, if you don’t like Moffat than feel free not to watch. come back and enjoy your Who when he leaves. Don’t expect people to disagree when you continually tag your hate at steven moffat. If you made a post on about Sherlock left saying how the writing and they characters sucked then you would expect to be shot down in flames. No one is going to discuss the merits of poorly written episodes or problems in the timeline when the end of your argument is always going to be Moffat sucks or Moffat is sexist and hates women, because that is a tired argument.


Ranted a bit there but this whole debate about the doctor not being a female and the animosity pointed at steven moffat really bugs me.

Through a combination of government propaganda (drip feeding sound bytes about how benefits costs x amount of orphanages) and certain tabloids and television programs picking fringe cases and presenting them as the norm, there are a lot of people who see benefits as a big problem in the country, and a drain on resources. 

So, the question the government are saying isn't 'how should we make sure the system does not fail?', it is 'why should we care?'

For one, this goes along with Tory policy and ideology. We've seen with the Bedroom Tax that the government will follow through a policy if it fits their principles, even if it was set to not succeed from the get go.

Secondly, the only people this will majorly effect is jobless people. Now, jobless people don't tend to vote Tory, as they don't fit the typical demographic of a Conservative voter. So, they won't lose many votes over it.

Also, because it has been bashed into the public that people on benefits, or specifically the dole, are bad, many won't care. There has been a growing idea that it is unfair that workers should pay for people who don't have jobs. If these people had a job in the first place, they would not be effected by the failings of the system, so it's their own fault. 

And finally, it will save the government many. As with the Bedroom tax, even though it has failed for the public, it means the government can get more money in the bank, so it doesn't really matter. 

I don't really think it is a case of the government being naive, and not knowing these new systems will fail. I think they know full well that they will, they just don't care. ",0,1375927835,null,0,false,0,cbj7wio,t3_1jvrtq,t1_cbj7wio,t3_1jvrtq,null,1429907013,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I actually agree with some of the points. I think attacking Fry as a pompous is unwarranted and unnecessary, but as the Telegraph writer - Brendan O'Neill - is correct in asserting that if you banned every nation that does bad things from hosting essentially what is essentially a sporting event that got a bit out-of-hand (seriously, the navel-gazing that takes place amongst writers about how historically important the modern games are is quite excessive), you wouldn't be able to host said games in most nations. I mean, the People's Republic of China - an autocratic oligarchy - was given the games. The United States and the USSR frequently had the summer and winter games *during the Cold War,* and era wherein US and Soviet leaders spent their time playing games with foreign governments and peoples, leading to the deaths of thousands, likely millions, of individuals. Hell, both the second Summer Olympics and first Winter Olympics took place in France, at a time when France had a vast Empire that spanned and subjugated a variety of foreign nations. The Olympics can be a symbol of international unity, but they aren't a cudgel with which ""progressive"" nations should use to force less progressive nations into complying with their views. I mean, ignoring the fact that most first world governments do bad things, if you are going to be ultra-strict about human rights and what not, you would basically ban any developing and third world countries from ever having the games. Sorry Russia, you don't get them. Neither do you, Brazil, nor you, China, India, etc. If Fry had his way, hosting the games would be the sole responsibility of white Westerners.",0,1375928557,null,0,false,0,cbj85tk,t3_1jvsxr,t1_cbj85tk,t1_cbit88q,null,1429906892,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,[deleted],null,null,"I know someone who refused to hand over the password to their encrypted laptop and ended up getting a 2 year prison sentence as the letter you've shown here says, although they only ended up serving 1 year of those 2 years behind bars, because in the UK you only serve 50% of your prison sentence actually in prison. The judges will find against you very quickly and there is no defence, ""I forgot"" or ""I lost the password"" won't count for shit in court, although I'm sure your lawyer has already told you this. This isn't like a debt collector or train fine threat where the maximum sentence is 2 years but you usually get a fine, you **will** get 2 years in this case automatically, cut and dry, very quickly. There won't be any long trials or anything like that, it's over in a few seconds and happens to many people every day.  

You have to decide if whatever is on the laptop will get you a longer prison sentence than 2 years, and decide whether to give them the password or not. Worth noting that if it's nothing serious on there, the police probably wont care about it and might not even find as much as you expect, they just run automated scanning programs.

This is why everyone should use [hidden volumes](http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/hidden-volume) when using Truecrypt to make an encrypted area on their computer, because then the encrypted area just looks like random noise and there's no way for the police to prove you have any encrypted stuff on your computer, and so they can't even ask you for a password because they don't even know you are hiding anything, essentially you get plausible deniability. You can even make whole hidden container operating systems, so one password logs into a fake operating system which is clean and looks innocent, and you can give this password to the police, and another password logs you into your naughty operating system where you keep your naughty stuff, which the police think doesn't even exist.

There is one technicality in the law which means that you can give the password to the police to your encrypted computer, but they aren't just allowed to pillage through the data willy nilly. It's something to do with data protection, company law and medical law. You can say something along the lines of you have private customer data, or private medical data on the computer and that the police aren't allowed to look at it freely. In this circumstance you still have to give the encryption password to the police, but you can then nominate an independent barrister to look through all the data before the police and decide what might be relevant to the police to be used in your case in the court of law. The barrister might hand everything over to the police that they would have found anyway, but more often than not they don't dig very deeply and don't hand as much over as the police forensics people would have found themselves. Worth trying anyway, I know someone who did this and ""got off lightly"", although they were very wealthy and paid for a good barrister.",0,1375931122,null,0,1375931853,0,cbj92a8,t3_1jxgmg,t1_cbj92a8,t3_1jxgmg,null,1429906460,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I loved them all, and sang their name as loud as I could, but still they left. So now I don't get too attached. Apart from Alonso, we went on to better things without them anyway. That doesn't mean I hate them. I just appreciate them while they're here and accept that one day they may leave.

Unfortunately, once the club or the player decides it's time to part ways, thing can get messy. Both parties want the fans on side, so you end up with all kinds of nonsense in the press. And that's where we are now.

Suarez appreciates the fans, but we aren't the first club to sing his name from the rafters. His main priority is to win trophies, but he would have liked to have left without upsetting the supporters. So initially we got a load of half-baked excuses to justify his decision. 

Some people are putting a great deal of effort in to pointing out the inconsistencies, but everything he said was just part of the game - a game that the club is just as happy to play. Ultimately - and to eventually answer your question - I want the best players possible at Liverpool Football Club. If that  means playing lads who've fluttered their eye-lashes at other clubs, so be it. 

In short, I forgave Gerrard, I can forgive Suarez.

Sure, the players who are playing 90 minutes need to take it slower for sure but for the players who know they are getting subbed at half or 10 minutes or so after half, is 45 minutes too long to play 100%? I think that's just absolute rubbish.


Some other things:

1. de Bruyne in the pivot got completely ran over. Essien's fitness was Lampard level so our midfield got completely overran in the second half. de Bruyne also got noticeably frustrated when he missed a few passes and started trying to get too cheeky. Started the half well, but missed just about every pass in the last ten minutes.

2. The passing out from the back four need significant work. Crosses never broke the first man, long balls out were nowhere close, and they turned the ball over in the midfield on four or five occasions. 

3. I think Moses took a bit of step back against quality opposition in Marcelo. Became a one trick pony

4. Torres did more in two or three plays than Lukaku did in the entire game. 

5. Again, thought van Ginkel played great, Hazard is coming along nicely, Cole was great in defense.

6. Yeah, I know it's preseason, but there was a lot of ball watching and jogging back on defense which is the opposite of what I expect a Mourinho team to be doing defensively. ",0,1375932826,null,0,1375933052,0,cbj9noc,t3_1jxkbs,t1_cbj9noc,t3_1jxkbs,null,1429906182,15,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,15

He had some good tackles and kept possession reasonably well but whenever he got the ball it looked like he was sweating his balls off to get it off his foot. He made a lot of passes backward which didn't really help with the build up play. Lukaku didn't really get involved but I don't think that was completely his fault. I'm guessing Mourinho wanted him to stay up really high and be played over the top but obviously no one actually played him anything he could work with which I think might be because his runs and timing need a little bit of work. Either way it looked like Mourinho didn't  want him to be checking back and linking with play a lot so I don't think his lack of touches was completely his fault.  I was pleased with the way Essien played when he was in. Kept possession and played some nice balls around. Oscar played pretty well and I still think he should have a starting spot over De Bruyne who I think needs a little bit of time before before sharing minutes with Oscar or whoever 50/50. Torres actually played pretty well but I still don't want him as a starter. Obviously we might have to depending on the form of our other forwards but if anyone thinks he can consistently lead pure attack next year then they are being really ambitious.

Rodgers has said many times Liverpool need men and men with the right mentality. That IS Costa. He is also not in the least solely a brute. He is much more than that. Carroll got shunted out because he was poor on the ball and slow. Carroll will never, mark my words, start for an English champions league side. The requirements for success dictate a style of football Andy does not fit.

Costa, on the other hand, has plied his trade in Brazil and Spain. He has proven himself to be an adept all-around attacker. He may be different than Mickey in his style, but the results are much the same.

&gt;Lukaku could catch fire at any point this season as his chemistry with Hazmatar grows.

He could so it not a guarantee with him, We need a striker who will be ready form August 17 until May 31. Lukaku will come good in the future but I think he's still young and inexperience and with the competition in England and across Europe bulking up their squad with experience I don't think Lukaku is the right option right now.

&gt;Ba, I honestly think has worse knee problems than Torres and, though can give you an occasional great goal, tends to disappear for larger stretches of the match and not make any meaningful contributions on the ball.

Same problem with Torres and even worse, Bad knee, no confidence, cant create space, cant hold the ball up, bad at link up plays, and disappear in most games. 

&gt;Cech_Mate, i beg thee. Give Torres one last chance, please.

How many chance will Torres get, I've never heard let give Bosingwa or Kalou, Marin or Sturridge or anyother fallen blues a chance, why must we keep giving this one fellow so many chances.

It seems like Mou hasn't got a good team enough to play 4-3-3. Mata's missing also made the midfield seem lack of creativity.

More importantly, Chelsea's defense made a few crucial mistakes. For the first goal, Ramries got Marcelo away and Cahill could not block the shot. For the second, Ivanovic also committed a very unnecessary foul on Ronaldo on a dangerous spot. Even Cech showed more mistakes than he has usually.

The team is still young and they definitely have great room for improvement and I believe this game is a very good lesson for them playing in the coming season.

I went to see The Wolverine on Friday with a group of friends, including one woman who makes no secret of her attraction to Hugh Jackman, even with her husband.

Sitting in front of us were three women who spent most of the movie 'commenting' (and by that I mean drooling) about Jackman who spends long, protracted periods of time in the film either with no shirt on or wearing tank tops so small he may as well be shirtless. 

It took the woman in our group to tell them to be quiet as none of the men felt like they could. We all agreed that if any of us had done so they would have gotten angry.

Now, maybe it works both ways, right? The four main female characters are all played by current and former fashion models. The female lead is played by a stunningly beautiful woman named Tao Okamoto. Except it doesn't work that way. Except for the villain's comic book accurate tight outfit which she only wears at the end of the film, there's zero fanservice for men compared to almost an entire movie of it for women.

Compare this to another movie - Star Trek Into Darkness - where a female character appears for two seconds in her underwear. This has provoked outrage on r/startrek and the film's writers have even apologised for it. 

Video games and comic books come in for endless criticism whenever male fans get a bit of fanservice. Seems like everything I enjoy is affected by this one way or another.

true,ElevenRedsII,null,null,"..thats one clever ass title OP! ^^thats ^^my ^^boy

Like some have said already something needs to happen soon

now i get the feeling....that regardless of all thats been said and happened...BR is going to want to keep Suarez on and try and convince him to help us get top 4 this season.

buuuut because Suarez was a MAJOR dick by going public in that interview and threatening to take legal action against us, he's going to resist the fuck out of staying because of fan backlash and 'damage' to his image and 'reputation'..yeah i know, tell me about it

right nows there seems to be a 'my dad is harder than your dad' contest between them, with suarez going public and BR making him train alone, although its clear what both sides want the way they are going about it is only pushing things in the other direction

-------------------------------------
so, 

IF BR can convince him to stay AND play and give his 100%, then were in with a real good top 4 chance but although fans may start to cheer him again they certainly would have lost all there trust in him, but anything less or if he gets the feeling suarez isnt trying on the pitch or under performing so we transfer list him BR will catch on early and either bench him or let him rot in the reserves

There is NO WAY we are selling suarez to arsenal (with the exception of a super bid even then i doubt it) so suarez calling for a transfer to them is a waste of time and only really putting himself further out of favor with the fans

the other option is accepting a foreign transfer, now this is a big gamble..because were likely to lose out on his real value and selling him for a slight increase on his original purchase price would be a giant mistake, but with a ban, an untrustworthy reputation and us saying no to any offers i cant see anyone other than madrid willing to offering enough money to interest us

Two of us went over. We're from Belfast, and the weekend before we were in Prague for a mate's stag weekend. One drunk evening we were discussing how eastern Europe isn't really that big if you think about it, and we could totally drive to Athens from Prague. A cooler head prevailed and checked flights, thinking that there wouldn't be many people flying from Prague to Athens. Flights were only 125 quid! Bargain! We then proceeded with the stag.

After 3 days of solid drinking, the horrors were starting to kick in, and it came time for the rest of the lads to go home. Our flight wasn't until later, so we had to watch the rest of our mates drive of to their loving homes, and leave us. At that time I felt like crying. Only one thing for it was to get back on the sauce, which we did.

Our flight into Athens got in about 3 in the morning, so we were starting to sober up. We got our bags, and were about to jump into a taxi when we realised we didn't know where we were going, as we had no hotel. We hoped on the internet in the airport and started searching for somewhere to stay, but every hotel in Athens was filled to the rafters. Then came the frightening realisation that we were in a foreign country where we knew no-one, spoke none of the language, had nowhere to stay and had the bitch of all hangovers fast approaching.

So fuck it, we hopped in a taxi and headed for the city center. We got left off in what we approximated the city center, and slept a few hours on some grass in a roundabout. We felt a bit better, so we went exploring and found Sytagma Square (where most of the photos were taken) and it was glorious. Thousands of Liverpool fans from all over the world and most of them were in our predicament. Milan were nowhere. So we spent another night there sleeping rough and partying. One of the best nights ever. I swapped my top for an Olympiakos one from some Greek lad I met [here](http://i.imgur.com/2hYEAJa.jpg)

Tickets were the next stumbling block. There were none. Touts were charging up to 500 euro, which was too much wallet for us. Then my mate who's stag we were one phoned me. One of the other lads who was on the stag, and who I'd never met previously, worked for the Irish Football Association. He'd been on a course a few weeks before with someone from Liverpool who was on the staff (medical or scouting, I forget which). He put me in touch with him and he had a spare! Nice one! We found him in Athens and made contact. 

Problem: he only had one. We took it off him anyway and bought him a few beers confident that we could pick up another somewhere, even if we had to buy off a tout and split the difference in cost.

We even got a bed for the night. We got chatting to a couple of Dutch lads who were staying in what they said was a huge hostel room. A quick chat with the owner and he got us a couple of camp beds. Best night sleep I ever had.

The day of the match came round, and after a while we headed up to the stadium, which was a good 15 miles away. Still without a 2nd ticket, we started asking around outside the stadium, but even the touts had none. My mate bought a scarf because he'd swapped away his Liverpool top and wanted some colours. 

Kick off time was fast approaching and we saw the desperation of people wanting to get in. Time after time we saw kids storming the fence in numbers, and a lot of them overwhelmed security and got in. We even saw some utter scumbag punch a middle-aged lady, steal her ticket and leg it before anyone knew what happened.

We were resigning ourselves to the fact that we weren't going to get a ticket. I was going to sell my one ticket, because we'd came that far together, so we could go to the bar and watch it together, but my mate persuaded me to go one without him. Reluctantly, I did, which put a bit of a dampener on things.

It was a good 20 minute walk through the old Olympic park to the stadium, so I near the gates, I heard a shout behind me! I turned round and my mate was bounding up behind me with a ticket! He'd been asking around after I left, and got talking to a scouser who had a spare, but who didn't want to sell to a local because he was disgusted with the touts extorting people. He'd saw his Liverpool scarf and gave him the ticket (for a small profit :) )

So we were both in! I had never been more confident about a result in my life. It was fate. The whole adventure of getting there was leading up to this moment. Now for the match......

.....and the less said about it the better. It's hard to watch them loose when they were by far and away the better team. As soon as Xabi fouled outside the area and I saw Pirlo step up, I knew exactly what was going to happen. There was no way back after that.

So we were pretty dejected after the game, and wanted to get out of Athens, but there were no flights back to Ireland for 3 days, and even that required a night's stop-over in Milan of all places. So we buggered off to one of the Greek islands for a few days and had some well earned rest. Even stopping in Milan wasn't so bad. Most fans we met were sympathetic to our story, but didn't have any qualms gloating because of what happened 2 years previous.

So we ended up back home 10 days after originally leaving for a 2 day stag do, with a lot of making up to do to the missus.",0,1375947154,null,0,false,0,cbjdibd,t3_1jwtyu,t1_cbjdibd,t3_1jwtyu,null,1429904386,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I have to say, I rather loathe the way people compare anything bad today with the Nazis. Fry is making a direct comparison to the treatment of Jews by Hitler, to that of gay people by Putin. Not really true, is it? Are gay people in Russia banned from public office? From academia? Are they being hunted out from those posts?

I understand the general comparison in this instance is to a specific time in Hitler's rule, and specific legislation (Fry is not claiming Putin is sending thousands of gays to the gas chamber, for example) but generally the whole 'just like Hitler' or even worse people claiming modern leaders are worse than Hitler completely undermines their case - it's extremely ignorant. 

For example, shit like this http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/07/how-do-we-stop-a-modern-day-adolf-hitler/ and this which have ridiculously provocative headlines http://www.boyculture.com/boy_culture/2013/07/is-putin-the-next-hitler.html

I am gay, I don't like what is going on in Russia (or Uganda, or wherever else) but I am always uncomfortable with this comparison to Hitler.

Suarez is definitely not the kind of person I think any club would want to have. Suarez is definitely the kind of player any club in the world wishes they could have. I don't understand why he wants out of Liverpool so much, what happens if Arsenal get matched up with PSV or Fenerbahce and don't make it through to UCL? He said he was happy at Liverpool in January, the only thing that's changed is he had gone off and did something stupid which affected not only himself, but Liverpool as whole. Gerrard praises him as a player, and Suarez loved it, but nobody will ever praise him as a person. He's selfish, he says that he tried his best to get LFC to champions league last season. So what did he do, have an amazing season but end it off by doing something stupid once again, biting Ivanovic. Yes I'm pretty angry at Suarez because he knows how important he is to Liverpool, and to think he would lie just to leave is childish. Never expected this from him.

true,cramen,troughton,Troughton,"Okay, okay, I think it's worth watching generally in order. If anything just because it's probably harder to start with the higher visual quality and then work back to the black and white stuff. Some are long, the show doesn't really nail down the format until the fourth doctor, so early stories can be 2 episodes or they get as long as 8 or 10. Here's my picks, I've bolded the two or three best ones in my opinion of each group:

**One**

With the first doctor, you really should watch the opening two stories. I mean they're meandering and the caveman thing isn't completely riveting, and Dalek 'cannon' doesn't really strictly hew to what's set out here, but it's fascinating I think. Otherwise I think that Susan's leaving and the first regeneration are the two big things to make sure to watch.

* **10,000 BC**

* **The Daleks**

* The Dalek Invasion of Earth

* The Chase

* The Time Meddler

* The Tenth Planet

**Two**

I have a bit of a bias towards the second doctor, that said there's a lot of incomplete stories. I've tried to be restrained in my picks, but I think the Invasion is a must as UNIT's first big outing and the bad guy is fantastic, as is the War Games for the real introduction of the Time Lords. It is 10 parts long... but I think it's worth it.

* The Tomb of the Cybermen

* The Mind Robber

* **The Invasion**

* The Seeds of Death

* **The War Games**

**Three**

The Third doctor is also really good. The tone of the show changes completely, again with the doctor trapped on earth. The stories, particularly in the first years are long, but they're excellent. Also Make sure to see Roger Delgado's Master. He's easily the best in the role, I think. The whole second year of the Third Doctor are Master stories, I recommended the first one, but any of them will probably do.

* **Spearhead from Space**

* The Ambassadors of Death

* Inferno

* **Terror of the Autons**

* The Three Doctors

* The Green Death

* The Time Warrior

* Planet of the Spiders

**Four**

Okay, so there'll be a lot here but he was in the show for 7 years, and despite the fact that stories these days are only 40 mins long, and his were mostly 4x20mins, he's still got more stories to his name than any other doctor. It's worth seeing him arrive in Robot, and it's worth seeing some of every year as the tone shifts dramatically throughout his time. Also time lord society comes into the forefront for the first time in the Deadly Assassin.

* Robot

* **The Ark in Space**

* **Genesis of the Daleks**

* Pyramids of Mars

* The Seeds of Doom

* The Deadly Assassin

* The Face of Evil

* **Talons of Weng-Chiang**

* The Horror of Fang Rock

* The Invasion of Time

* The Pirate Planet
 
* **City of Death**

* **Logopolis**

**Five**

I'm not a huge fan of Five, but he does have some great stories. The show is a lot more about the ensemble and unreliable companions. The last three stories put together make for a really good climax to the 'nice' Doctor.

* **Kinda**

* Black Orchid

* Earthshock

* Enlightenment

* Resurrection of the Daleks

* Planet of Fire

* **Caves of Androzani**

**Six**

The Sixth is a big shift for the show again. It gets darker and more violent, while at the same time still being very incongruously 80's neon in the style that began at the end of the Fourth Doctor. Most people don't like him, he's brash and mean. Personally, I think it was a great *idea* but the plotlines and scripts can be pretty weak. Trial of a Time Lord is seminal though (and a bit of a cheat, it's a whole season of 14 episodes).

* Attack of the Cybermen

* Vengeance on Varos

* **Trial of a Time Lord**

**Seven**

I like the Seventh, this was the show struggling to stay alive. There's a few missteps, but there's also a hint of promise. A hint of the darker edge to the Doctor that the new show has taken it's own spin on.

* Remembrance of the Daleks

* Battlefield

* **Ghostlight**

With nowhere else to go - of course smokers will congregate in the beer gardens - the only place where they can keep their drink *and* smoke at the same time (since taking your pub-bought drink out of the pub premises will also land you in trouble). 

In other words, the article is much ado about nothing. It's great that we can enjoy pub food and drink indoors - without smoke being an issue. But short of banning smoking completely - where else are we expecting smokers to go?

Yet few people would suggest repealing such a ban today, despite our fire suppression techniques been much better (and the lack of wooden escalators) could probably mitigate any fire risk.

As a non smoker, it would be nicer for me if we banned people from smoking in densely crowded places, when there isn't much wind.  However I think that is rather unpractical.  But smokers have to acknowledge that their smoke is *not nice* for some other people.

Whilst the health benefits of passive smoking are completely debatable, if I was a parent I wouldn't take children to a beer garden that was smoking (or one where people get drunk either!) as I wouldn't want them to associate such smoking activities as normal life anymore than I would excessive drinking.

We don't *really* know yet. The manufacturers aren't required to say exactly how the E-liquid is made or any of its side-effects, because it's not regulated by a health authority in the UK. That's why the government wants them to come under NHS prescription.

Edit: We may know some things (thanks /u/Riddla26), but not enough for the British government to be satisfied. Remember that each E-cig company has different methods of producing the liquid. And because the manufacture of the liquids is not regulated by any health or government body, it is not possible to determine what is actually going in there.

&gt; The World Health Organization recommends against making claims that they are safer than cigarettes or that they help with stopping smoking

I personally believe that E-cigarettes are almost certainly ""less bad"" for you than regular cigarettes, but there was once a time when everyone thought cigarettes were good for you.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","Provided there's an equal distribution of choice, I'd be all for this. The issue would mostly arise at a social level where there'd be a tug-of-war between friends who smoke and friends who don't - and where to go for your drinks. 

Understand though that my issue with smokers *isn't* that they smoke. I don't care provided I'm not stuck in a room with them that is unavoidable (which is how it used to be, when I would come home with a headache and smelling of smoke to the extent that all my clothes needed washing). If that's whining? Too bad, I don't like headaches or having to wash my clothes because of other people - nothing insane about that. 

My real issue crops up when anything non-smokers say about smokers is instantly dismissed as whining or being weak in some way. Is that not a ridiculous and dismissive stance to take - before smokers themselves say that the situation is unfair? Of course there are some bad eggs on either side - people who will go above and beyond to complain about how things are. 

Fact is I have friends who smoke and work with people who smoke. I socialise with both and am therefore around smoke. That's life - I don't make them feel shitty about it and the most indication they might get that I care is if I strategically stand up-wind of where the smoke is blowing. I don't lecture them nor comment at all - and I stand in the cold with them as we have a drink. 

But in turn *they* don't complain to me about how things are for smokers or imply I'm somehow to blame or that I'm whining. They are mindful of where their smoke is blowing and make an effort to blow it out into open air - rather than at anyone. I couldn't ask more of them and we all just get on with it. 

The issue - for me - is when a smoker comes along who starts implying that anyone who looks at them the wrong way or doesn't entirely agree is whining. ",0,1375959055,null,0,false,0,cbjf68f,t3_1jxzx9,t1_cbjf68f,t1_cbjexrb,null,1429903609,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

The growing acceptance is very very recent, it was only *decriminalised* throughout the US ten years ago. 2003. Ten years after Russia decriminalised it, incidentally. Before then you could be locked up for it. Not ""promoting"" it, not trying to convince people it was normal, just having consensual gay sex, in private. Prison. Would you have called for a boycott of the Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2002?

One day I am sure discrimination against gays will be universally looked on as skin to sexism or racism but we simply aren't there yet. Not on a world level, not even in the West; homosexuals still don't have equality in *most* Western countries, and certainly don't in the United States, where they are still legally discriminated against by federal and most state law.

Why is what Russia is doing worse than what other countries do? Why is it worse that what Britain did in invading Iraq? If you recall, *millions* took to the streets worldwide over that one, rather more than are protesting Russia on LGBT rights. Why wasn't London 2012 boycotted? You see where this could go, surely? Who has clean enough hands to host the things? No one. 

I'm all for protesting Russia's position on LGBT rights but the idea they are going to have the Games taken away from them over it, or even that there will be a single major nation boycott is absolute la la land. It has no grounding whatsoever in reality. I'm not even sure it's the worst thing Russia is doing right now. I'm pretty sure it's not.

What you are saying sounds like something a child would say when they don't understand that things have consequences. 

You are insisting that you are entitled to your lifestyle regardless of whether or not this has repercussions. I don't believe that nuclear energy is safe. The big elephant here is in Japan leaking toxic stuff into the sea and no one can seem to do anything about it or wants to pay for it. 

I believe that if the only way to continue to power modern civilisation is to put the lives of your children and their children's children at risk, it's not acceptable. If I have to review my lifestyle expectations in view of this, I am mature enough to deal with it.

Unfortunately i think Quagliarella would have too much of an ego after being at Juve to play second fiddle, he would at the very least have to be top of the rotation.

Con's include not getting sick pay and not being paid when you take holidays however every place I've worked for has paid about ten percent per hour I work towards a holiday fund which I would then claim every four months or so which was something. It's not all bad but I definitely worry about where it's heading and when you have a lot of staff competing for available hours it does raise the standard of the workforce to a degree but in the end people are people so the backstabbing, sucking up culture endures and the better relationship you have with the managers the more hours you get which over time results in the high school mentality that exists in these zero hour environments. These types of contracts are great for employers and make total sense to the profit driven, shareholder concerned business owner but they cause resentment in the workplace between those who have the good contracts and those who aren't able to break into that loop because unfortunately like associates with like and twats hire other less capable twats and putting your head above the parapet affects the hours you'll receive so the individualistic personality is driven down and the non questioning, conformists are rewarded. If the future is unpaid internships for those who can afford to work them and zero hour contracts for the rest it will be great for the business owner and have massive effects on society and the notions of what is right- putting profit above what should essentially be human rights- fair contracts with guaranteed hours and basic holiday and sick pay.

true,KultureShoque,eng-rutland,"May Be Foreign, Beware","Everything we in the rich west enjoy is a product of oil. Also we are all eating oil, rich or poor. It's all oil.

That's where I refer to physics. It's my understanding that oil produced the energy. Not magic or the will of the lord or anything so abstract. Oil is burned. The chemicals of oil are extracted and used in agriculture. 

The word *physics* refers to my understanding that energy has certain features and behaviours that are, from our current perspective, not flexible. Oil is unique. There is nothing else like it. 

A huge infrastructure of products, food, energy hungry machines is entirely based on oil. Oil is a store of millions of years of sunlight packed into a convenient, easy to transport liquid.
Oil is running out. Instead of gushing out of a hole in the ground it now is found in tar sands, it needs to be extracted by putting earth into a giant washing machine.
There is, at present no other way having so much energy. There is no other way to fertilise dead soil either. Let's say the plastic bags we can live without without anyone freaking out.

The only existing technology we have that can compete is generating electricity using nuclear power. (Here's *physics* again. Nuclear radiation is harmful. It's not clear to me how much or how pervasive this harm is but if you wander into the wrong part of a nuclear power plant you will get cancer and die. If you go for a swim in the nuclear waste pool, you will die. If you spill that water into the sea, it doesn't sound like a trivial thing. Again, this is all down to the way the universe seems to work and it can't be changed by the will of puny and insignificant humans who, because they discovered oil in a stroke of luck think they are masters of nature. Hahah.)


First - how easy do you think it will be to replace all the things we do with internal combustion engines with electricity?
Second - how are you going to feed billions of people when the price of oil is too high to make starvation the only economic option?
Third - how are future generations going to manage or decomission nuclear power plants if there is a deterioration of civilisation to the extent that humans no longer have the required expertise and resources?
Supporting the use of nuclear seems to me an incredibly selfish ideology. You can't face a reduction in your lifestyle (we need to cut energy use by 90%, already a substantial percentage of humanity lives this way - what makes you so special?) so you support the implementation of a technology that may mean humanity and other beings have to suffer and die in the future, after you and your comfortable life are long dead.",0,1375961436,null,0,false,0,cbjfi17,t3_1jvgzn,t1_cbjfi17,t1_cbiqk2b,null,1429903456,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Perhaps you should take your own advice?

Also I'd bet that percentage is much much higher if you looked at people who frequently go to the pub on an evening. And I'd bet that the percent of non-smokers are bothered by people smoking in the beer garden.

Just because something upsets you doesn't automatically make you right or mean that what is bothering you needs banning. And you have the gall to lecture people about entitlement? Take long hard look at what you are saying mate. 

From your other comment: 

&gt;What would really satisfy smokers, short of everything going back to how it was before? If that's the case - what rights to clean air can non-smokers truly expect?

Many people here are only complaining about being moaned at for smoking outside, a lot of people said they supported/understood the ban.

There isn't an issue about 'clean air' caused by smokers as smoking in enclosed public spaces is banned. If you mean the smell then just tough it out or, y'know, don't sit next to someone smoking outside. If you mean pollutants then maybe your time would be better spent moaning about things that do actually affect the enviroment and people's health significantly more than passive smoking out doors.

Also surely the people most bothered by this are the ones who frequent pubs most?  Obviously they have no qualms about the dangers of alcohol to themselves but are happy to lecture others on the, now, neglible effect it has on their health.

The long term effects of SOME of the flavourings are a question mark, but the FUD spread by most of the news outlets basically boils down to ""UNTIL WE CAN BE 1000000% SURE THEY WON'T KILL YOU (or figure out how to tax them or better render them ineffective), KEEP SMOKING THE THINGS THAT WILL DEFINITELY KILL YOU!""

Civilisation would change completely. Maybe that's what needs to happen. But it isn't going to anytime soon, because we as a species are too numerous and too addicted to energy.

To get renewable energy off the ground we need industry to smelt steel for wind turbines, to manufacture batteries for storage, to research and develop new technologies we haven't dreamed of yet. For industry to operate, we need a consistent source of energy and I see nuclear as the least-bad option available to us, especially in places with low tectonic activity. I lived a few miles from Hunterston B for 18 years and can't ever recall fearing for my life. Germany phased out nuclear even though with modern fast breeder reactors the waste becomes much less of a problem, and now they're churning out more CO2 from coal than ever.

My point is that boycotting doesn't have to be labelled hypocritical just because one boycotts for one issue and not another. The boycotter's moral convictions are made clear by whether he/she boycotts or not. Just because you feel one issue is bigger than another doesn't mean someone else does.

Furthermore, a collective boycott will arise if people feel strongly enough aout the issue. But boycotting Russia for LGBT issues does not mean the people feel apathy about the UK's foreign policy, rather the LGBT issue is just one that arose at that time because it was of a particular prominence in the public's conscience, and/or - as I suspect - the UK in general falls more toward the 'good' end if the spectrum. In an ideal world we boycott many things but a combination of moral relativism (some countries are responsible for bad things but, overall, are not boycott material) and colletive conscience means we don't. That's not hypocritical, it's just the way of things. 

Countries aren't either good or bad, they're a mixture which is not black or white. When all is said and done, the UK is not worth boycotting because it's one of the better countries out there (in, I think, most people's opinion). Some seem to think Russia is.

If you're referring to the outside world / standing next to someone / standing 50ft away from them... then specify it - otherwise why should I assume you mean anything other than exactly what you say? 

As I've gone on to say, I do have friends and they do smoke - hell I live with a couple of smokers - and get on fine with all of them. I go and stand outside with them as they smoke and I don't say a damn thing to them.

I also don't say anything to the other smokers around them. I don't look at them funny, I don't cough and I don't make any remarks. The *only* time this would change is if someone blew smoke directly into my face at close range - but I don't think that's an over-reaction? 

I tell you all this because just as you insinuate that I think you're a crazy drug addict, I don't want you to think I'm a crazed smoke-hater who flies off the handle at the slightest smell of it. 

I *am* however aware of the dangers of direct and passive smoking - and unfortunately the health issues don't just vanish the moment you step outside. They may be reduced - but without us looking at *every* environment - it's impossible to say how much for sure. 

I say that because my local has a small, high-walled beer garden and the ventilation level is rubbish - smoke lingers there. On the flip side there are country pubs with a strong breeze where smoke is gone as soon as it's exhaled.

true,sneakyi,lfcflame,,".....huge inflow of cash from their owners. 

....and aquire the top talent for their squads.

....and compete in the top competitions with the ambition of winning them

The lowering of our expectations for our club has been complete. We are now officially with Everton, WBA ect.

Ever building towards a magical day where our best players don't want to leave. 

Where we will be competing on a level with the top clubs once again.

....and all from the top of our mountains of morality by doing it without huge amounts of money coming from our owners pockets.

Personally, I feel if the first team was being properly strengthened, yes maybe by paying over the odds for players to come at this point, then our top players might believe in the 'project'.

Maybe our captain wouldn't have to tell the press that we need 2-3 quality players and keep Suarez to realistically sustain a challenge for 4th place.

Put your hands in you pockets FSG.

Media handling is not the most important aspect of club ownership.

Without a study of every environment, we can't say for sure. In some it lingers - in others it disappears quickly. The fact remains that *if you inhale passive smoke, it is harmful*.

NBC is going to be showing 20 games on their main broadcast channel this year which is going to generate a lot of interest, and will put it right up against college football games going on at the same time. The college games at that time are usually not very good so a lot of sports fans clicking around are likely to end up watching it out of curiosity, and then be quickly attracted to the pace and physical qualities on display in the Prem. I'm assuming also that NBC with their ""all in"" statement will be working to up the quality of the video coverage and commentary over and above Fox Soccer's previous efforts. Fox soccer was improving toward it's end but I always felt sub-standard relative to coverage from other American sports. Also, NBC has announced plans to have a highlight show modeled on Match of the Day and Match of the Day 2 (they are planning on keeping the same name) and are forming a partnership with the current show's presenters. This will be an excellent introduction to the league for those whose curiosity is piqued. The great thing about the Premier League in my opinion is the phenomenal talent it puts on display from the top to bottom of the league, and MOTD (completely unknown to a lot of current American followers of the Prem) will put that on display for a wider audience. I was a casual fan for quite some time myself, but once I started downloading MOTD on a regular basis I was really sucked in watching the talent of players and clubs I'd previously never even heard of. Also, to promote more interest in the top teams NBC is going to have shows during weeknights that highlight the previous matches of the Manchester Clubs, the big London sides (Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal), and last but certainly not least Liverpool. I've also read somewhere they are working on an app they will promote to help American fans choose a side to support. So yeah I'd say its pretty baked in at this point.

Smokers have to be harried and punished, and that's a religious and moral point for a certain category of non-smokers and campaigners.

If you accept the premise that second hand smoke is dangerous then, no, you can't win. Being whiny that you can't win just seems childish as a result. Of course using ""you people"" and ""punishment"" when describing you being asked to smoke (a choice you make) outside to protect the health of other people also does that. 

&gt; On this - ""I did edit my post to reflect this. Some jobs simply are dangerous in that they can't be done without risk but it's still expected that the employer take every step they can to minimise that danger."" I could reply that many of those jobs don't need to be done at all, we could just stop doing them and cut out the risk entirely...

true,podpool,null,null,"Liverpool striker Luis Suarez admits he still hopes to come to a ""friendly"" resolution with the club over his transfer saga.

Suarez is looking to secure a move away from Anfield this summer and has called in the help of the Professional Footballers' Association to try and mediate over a reported buy-out clause in his contract.

The Uruguayan has claimed Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has reneged on an agreement last summer which would allow the player to leave for a Champions League club.

The claim from Suarez has infuriated Rodgers and Liverpool with the player now being forced to train alone with Rodgers suggesting the 26-year-old had shown a ""total disrespect"" to the club with his outburst.

Suarez remains determined to leave Liverpool, but says he is ""still defending the Liverpool shirt"" until his future is resolved.

""I'm still defending the Liverpool shirt and I will do so until the last minute,"" Suarez is quoted as saying Marca.

""My aim is to reach an agreement with the club in a friendly manner and I hope the clause we agreed a year ago is fulfilled. Up to now, it hasn't been.

""It's not that I want to or am desperate to leave, but I like things to be clear and a year ago I made my position to the club clear.""

Suarez also revealed he is prepared to ignore pleas from Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard to stay as he set his heart on playing for a club in the Champions League.

""A Champions League team (Arsenal) is making a big effort to get me and one always wants to be where they feel comfortable."" 
Luis Suarez
""Gerrard has a lot of history with Liverpool and his words are very important but everyone should understand that I need to play the Champions League to keep growing as a footballer,"" added Suarez.

""Now I have the chance, I want to take it.

""A Champions League team (Arsenal) is making a big effort to get me and one always wants to be where they feel comfortable.""

Real Madrid have been credited with an interest in Suarez and the former Ajax man admits he would jump at the chance of joining the Spanish giants

""There were a lot of rumours (about Real) that were different to reality: Madrid never called me personally or Liverpool to try and negotiate,"" continued Suarez.

""Every player aspires to reach the top and Real Madrid is among the most important clubs in the world. It would be very difficult to say no to Real Madrid.""",0,1375966744,null,0,false,0,cbjghdm,t3_1jy8ry,t1_cbjghdm,t3_1jy8ry,null,1429902985,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

true,Imson,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"I disagree. I don't think it is as harmful as you think. Before the ban, death contributed to 2nd smoke where something like 12.5 out of 1,000,000 lung cancer deaths for people who where exposed to 2nd hand smoke VS 10 out of 1,000,000 for those who were not. 

Now this might well indicate a correlation, all be it very small. But lets try to remember that different people respond to things differently. The worlds oldest women with a heavy smokers for 93. You might argue that she would have lived longer if she didn't smoke but at 127(or something), i don't think she really gave a fuck. Some people are just going to get cancer, smokers or non. Smoking might bring your cancer out earlier than if you had not. Some people have good genes, some people don't. 

Now, some people might not respond well to smoke. People with breathing related conditions for example. We could well argue that all smoking should be banned just so people like that can go and sit in a beer garden. Although we would be overlooking a the risk of exposure to pollution from cars and other sources. But we aren't about to ban cars, its much easier the vilify smokers as the cause of other peoples problems. Besides, cars are necessary, smoking is not. Surely that's logical. 

Maybe we could ban interesting conversations because some people don't have the confidence or relevant knowledge to join in. Ok well, im being a bit silly now. But the point im trying to make is that most arguments against  things like smoking have far more to do with taking offense and wanting to modify the behavior of others to better suit ourselves. Its easy to work up a storm about the possible effect of 2nd hand smoke. If you don't smoke, you tend not to like the smell and things that you don't like are bad. Logical. 

Again, im not saying smoke is good. But, 12.5 in every million vs 10 in every million. Who's at the risk here? The guy working in a bar 40hours a week (pre-smoking ban) or the or the person that sat in a beer garden for a few hours on a sunny afternoon? Perspective.

No there is a lot said about it.  In London we've got the pollution exclusion zone as well as congestion charging encouragements for ZEVs.

Many do.  Screaming kids or all kids are not welcome at many of my favourite places.

However **I was not advocating any ban** merely pointing out that I wouldn't go to a lot of the beer gardens I frequent in somewhere like London with a child, ever.  Surely that's understandable point of view?

I'm an asthmatic, and if I'm already suffering smoke really makes it worse.  Now if I'm with a group of 3 smokers it isn't hard for me to simply sit upwind.  If there is one smoker and five non-smokers, then it isn't practical for everyone to do that.

so, we have a situation where smoker can't enjoy a smoke inside the building, and can't enjoy one out in a pub beer garden either.

lots of folk (me included) don't smoke inside my own home - this is a combination of elements, including the smoking ban - this is positive.

i wouldn't repeal the ban on smoking on the underground, last time i was on it plenty of people were smoking anyway (not on the train).",0,1375968147,null,0,false,0,cbjgtt9,t3_1jxzx9,t1_cbjgtt9,t1_cbjgp73,null,1429902824,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But many people do.  I am again not saying to legislate against it, but having a push to let people know that they should look at their surroundings before lighting up is a good idea.

&gt;it sounds callous but it is not my fault you are an asthmatic, if i knew you had problem with smoke then i wouldn't smoke around you out of consideration.

The problem comes with who's right is the scared one.  Normally I think its down to the majority.  Take a car, if there are 4 people, 3 of whom smoke, well its going to be a smokeful journey isn't it.  If only one of the four smokes, that isn't fair everyone should get smelly.  It is that kind of balance.

Hence why I say I don't want any kind of ban, just awareness and self-regulation.   Society has shifted its views so much in 20 years.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;but people complaining bout systemic abuse of the idea both over here and the states, where these contracts are both more widely used and longer established, are making shit up? Huh.

Who are these 'people'.

The ONS, the defacto go-to has only 250k people on them.  A new study says it might be more like 1M.  Ok fair enough.

Let's look at that study:
http://www.cipd.co.uk/pressoffice/press-releases/zero-hours-contracts-more-widespread-thought-050813.aspx
This as far as I can tell is the source for the articles in the Guardian and Newstatesmen, it was certainly the source of the 1 million claims.

Right, so what do we actually have to back up that claim?  14% of respondents.  Or about 00.5% of the workforce.

Now your comment about over here and the states, I'm guessing you've never hired someone in the US or here for that matter?  There are one hell of a lot of differences in statutory obligations which can't be eschewed by employment contracts.  Even if they become a sole trading services company there are still complex rules around handling of them.  Boats are statistically dangerous in Somalia, lets ban boats in the UK!  That isn't to say we can't learn mistakes to avoid by looking at the US, but because something doesn't work there, doesn't mean it doesn't here.

Now my final point is, if 14% of people on zero hours are un-able to live the basic quality of life they want.  What about people on other employment methods?  You have to compare them against the alternatives you are proposing.  Power transmission via power lines is loss full.  It is also the most efficient form we have.

Some drops appeared years after the smoking ban was introduced but other campaigns such as increased tv spots advertising the dangers, pictures on packets, NHS stop smoking lines etc have to be taken into account too. Also considering the gap between the ban coming into place and the beginning of the drop (around 2010 I think) in addition to considering the relatively small amount of people likely to spend so much time in pubs or restaurants that it would become a major and constant inconvenience I'm not convinced of the ban as a trigger to quit in any major way.

The ban was brought in to prevent second hand smoke exposure and that's where it's had major effects.

Are we trapped in a vortex of mutual sarcasm now?

&gt;Highly selectively.

It's not perfect and health and safety can sometimes come across as silly but largely you are vastly less likely to come to harm at work than in the past and have more recourse if you do. 

&gt;We... Who is this we? 

Everyone, walking out your door is a risk, not walking out your door is a risk. Our country and the political system you are a part of by living here has often taken measures that restrict a given person personal freedom in order to protect others from risk. We accept a given level of risk that someone might attempt to murder us by just being alive but we try and minimize that by making it illegal and having police so we can attempt to stop it. 

&gt;Most of the decisions are relatively arbitrary and based more on noise and lobbying than science and democratic decision making. Since you raised cars, and I wasn't specifically thinking of them - there are a myriad of ways that corporations and capitalists are fucking up the planet - it's not the existence of cars at all that I object to, but the effective exclusion of alternatives by policy and subsidy, and the manner in which they're unnecessarily promoted for the most inappropriate uses possible with maximal government support.

I agree, I just have no idea what this has to do with stopping you indulging in your habit inside workplaces and public spaces which you admit hurts those around you?

My point about cars was that lots of people are killed in them and by them, they are a very risky thing, we try and regulate and control their use as far as we can without outright banning them because they are integrale part of modern life. To put it another way I don't think you'd argue that you should be able to drive on sidewalks just because you feel like it.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; i don't know what you means?

Lets use the example of after enjoying a nice meal.  One table has just finished, so they all light up.  Meanwhile another table next to them is still eating.

Who has the 'right' to have their comfort, put above the others.  Smokers generally show signs of withdrawal rather quickly.  Some disturbingly so.  Who has the right to have what they want?  If there is one smoker and 5 people who will have their quality of life lessened, then surely the smoker should suffer (ie not smoke).

That is what I am trying to get at.  How do you balance it?

&gt;are you saying that a beer garden is the equivalent to being in a car? 

In London there are some really, really piss poor excuses for a beer garden, but it is afterall a 16 square meter patio that lets you get some daylight, you want to enjoy what you can.  However they also channel and funnel smoke.  If the author of the beeb article was talking about those places, I can see their point.  However myself I'd just sooner not spend £4 a pint in a place that isn't nice.

&gt;People can stop and get out for a smoke in your hypothetical car journey - no-one is really going to moan about that.

I've had it more than once.  Trying to drive down to Cornwall very quickly from London, it's a 4 hour trip, rapidly becomes 4.5hours with breaks.  Now if it was 10pm by the time we left, and I'm driving, I really don't want to be still on the road after 2am, not after a day of work.  Telling the one smoker to man the fuck up doesn't help them.

&gt;people can choose to go where there is likely to be smoke or not, it is their choice.

But that is the rub.  Why not turn it the other way round.  People can choose where to go that they will be allowed to smoke or not?  We already have this with alcohol in many town centres, you can't just drink anywhere.  Which whilst I appreciate helps them with the drunk problem ruins it for everyone again.

But yes things that are the last mile to houses jump out as easy to see ones.  Wireless is also included in that as there are only so many frequencies that can be used.

Streets are also one.  Those are normally owned by the government.  One can only have so many streets going to any particular place.  So parking on them might have some competition from parking garages but that is not much competition.  
For cities that run them they are normally a money maker for that city.  Even when the parking is priced at say $.25 an hour to $1 an hour the city is making money from them.
When they go over to private hands in this case it becomes $6 or more.
The city does make some money from selling the rights but the company that bought the rights makes much more.

The service is the same it's just more expensive and when cities run them they make the city money.  Those are two key parts.  With those two things happening there is no reason to sell off the rights. 
There is no added value to the end user having the parking rights in private hands.  And there is no lost value for the end users having the parking run by the city. 

Also having higher prices on things like street parking does have affects on the local economy.  People are less likely to go to the local businesses as the price rises for parking.  So that also needs to be taken into account.
