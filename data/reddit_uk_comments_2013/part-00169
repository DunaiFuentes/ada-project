Not really, some things are finite and don't grow with the economy, they really are a zero sum game. Other things have nothing to do with economics and I'd even be so radical as to say that I think the economy should serve society not the other way around.

Space for example is a limited resource, property and rental prices increase with population density. People either sacrifice space, or they work for more hours a week to pay for somewhere to live (compared to their peers).

The more people that exist within a state the less its government can cater to the needs of each one. Over the course of my lifetime my worth as a human being has been diluted by 10% due to population growth, shared out among other people for economic benefits. 

&gt; Competition is a fact of life. You could close the gates completely but it doesn't change the fact that we operate in a global marketplace. 

A government ought to protect its population from the global market via protectionist strategies, and immigration controls are a good tool here.

Whoever you support, you'll have a blast watching the Barclay's Premier League. You'll encounter more diverse style, intensity, passion, and drama than any other league.

Look out, though. Supporting Chelsea is not for the faint of heart. People love to hate Chelsea... for their location in a rich part of London (who cares?), for their perceived lack of 'istory (1st London club to win the UCL, wha?!), their wealthy foreign owner (even though the pejorative Chelski doesn't even make sense because it's a Polish suffix... and he has a bitchin' yacht), and their fringe supporters, notably the Headhunters (but really, hooliganism was bad everywhere, and if groups were defined by their worst elements, we'd all have something to be ashamed of).

So don't let anyone bust your balls too much. Chelsea FC are a really fun and exciting team to support. The players are well treated and loyal to the club. You will have moments that bring you to tears (Moscow) and others than bring you to happier tears (Munich, ""He done it!"").

Depending on where you live in the States, you may find a few fellow Blues or even a semi-official supporters club. But also a lot of haters. Don't get carried away with the rivalries just yet. You'll get to form your own opinions as the seasons go on. For now, enjoy the football, enjoy the league, and up the Blues.

Bank staff don't treat a sort code, account number and name as information which can be used for fraud. You've got the bits of it that can be used for fraud (at a push). The other part is just filler. Plenty of people don't want to steal money, they just want to find stuff out.

Ask for a transfer of significant money and people treat it differently.

&gt; This simply isn't true. Periodically I'll order audits

Any system which relies on an individual ordering audits is going to fail. There will be tens or hundreds of people on a shift in a call centre, manual requests and inspections are never going to work.

It's a million miles behind the controls on medical records.

&gt; Industry salary averages (and not just at the top level) have beat national trends.

Possibly, but banks have massively expanded call centre staff at the expense of branches. Call centre staff are cheaper than branch staff. They are trained less well, staff turnover is an issue.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt; Standing still a car takes up more space, but in moving traffic a cyclist actually takes up much more space on the roads. A car can't pass a cyclist in a single lane and cyclists are usually not capable of keeping up with traffic, this means space on the highways being utilized inefficiently. When cars are stopped at traffic lights a cyclist can however pass a car in a single lane of traffic, this then uses even more space when the car has to repass the cyclist which exacerbates the problem.

You raise some valid points. But they are all mostly flawed.

The number one thing that is worth pointing out is the idea that cyclists slow traffic. While in some cases this is obviously true, it certainly is not true on the whole.

As an occasional slow and very fast cyclist I can say with total certainly that within a city most traffic is constantly stopping at lights and junctions. The average speed of traffic in some city's is as slow as 15mph (I read once that in London it's as slow as 11mph at times). It's possible to cycle along at 12 mph, not impeding traffic at all, allowing cars to overtake, and then catching them up again once they are stuck in traffic (at lights or junctions) again and again and again. It often brings a smile to my face when on occasions I might slow a car down - it will overtake me, speed down the road, and get stuck behind another 20 cars. Me being there, or me slowing him down made zero difference to his journey.

Cars don't see this effect on a whole because 9/10 most cars are stuck behind the car in front.

In addition to this, places like London (an extreme example) has 25% cycling traffic at rush hour. There is no doubt that not only do cyclists take up less space (largely because there not a lot of space, and they fill the gaps better than cars) but if each if those cyclists stopped cycling and used a car the city would be in probably total gridlock twice a day.

The other thing to note. What does have a massive effect on traffic flow are things like lights and junctions. It's at these points where it's useful to get as much traffic though as quickly as possible. In situations like this cyclists massively out preform  cars and larger vehicles.

And finally, when a car stops in traffic (maybe to turn off) all traffic behind it stops. Cyclists are small enough that things like this are a total non issue.

And also finally (again) - iv raced my wife into the city, she drivers, I cycle. Door to door I'm faster on the bike.

The other Potash producer in Belarus pulled out of their deal and now the value of his share has tumbled nearly $500 million because investors realize potash is a shit business (pun intended) when it isn't rigged.

to give you an idea of how good the market was with price fixing, Uralkali wasn't even the larges firm yet they profited $1.6 billion last year on $4 billion in revenue .. that is 40% pure profit digging out something that is pretty common but very concentrated.

Kerimov (Anzhi owner) and guys like him aren't as rich as Forbes etc. suggest. That Forbes value is the sum of all his public holdings taken at current market valuation. A lot of these businesses are very cyclical, so for eg. when the price of coal falls 50% and the price of gold 30% the guy who is worth $7 billion because he owns a stake in Russia's largest gold and coal mines, and then a large stake in potash, is suddenly screwed. A 30% price drop in coal means more than a 30% drop in his personal wealth since he buys his share in these companies with a lot of debt

To Kerimo's credit though, he did pick the last crash in 2008 in russian resources and cashed out. He missed it this time, don't think it will wipe him out but he will get nailed pretty hard. 

Anzhi need to reduce their expenditure from $180 million to $50-60 million and live within their means. 

the crash happen ~3 weeks ago:

true,slippyg,null,null,"This isn't entirely true. A section 8 notice informs the tenants of the landlords intent to seek possession in court under certain grounds. Some of the grounds (1-8 iirc) are mandatory and mean the judge has to award possession. The other 9 are discretionary meaning the landlord will have to persuade the court to rule in his or her favour. If the tenancy agreement states that the tenants may not sublet then they are in breach of their contract and the landlord can seek possession under ground 12 however if there is no such provision within the tenancy agreement then it is my understanding the tenants are within their rights to sublet. In this situation it is probably more cost effective for the landlord to issue a section 21 which guarantees possession subject to few rules such as deposits having been protected etc. but is far less hassle and cheaper in terms of court fees. A section 21 notice can be served at any time during the tenancy but cannot take affect until the end of the fixed term or (assuming the most common type of tenancy an assured short hold tenancy) after 2 rental periods if paying monthly, when the tenancy has become periodic. In regards to the duration of which a notice is enforceable what you have written applies to a section 21 as well, there is no expiry date though it would be prudent to remind your tenants if they are living under a 'live' section 21

On the subject of deciding if the tenants have made themselves internally homeless or not, the notice given does not affect the outcome of the councils investigations. You are just as unlikely to find that the council accepts a duty to rehouse you if you have been evicted through the section 21 route, than if you had been served a section 8 notice. A housing options worker will investigate the reasons for possession if a section 21 is given as for many landlords it is the easier route. Intentionality is determined on action and inaction, not the type of notice given, in this case you are right that the council would say that the tenants had made themselves intentionally homeless however the person subletting would be unlikely to be found at fault.

Sorry to nitpick.

The winter is bitingly cold and windy (speaking as someone from comparatively mild and consistent North Yorkshire), but yet the summer is also unbearably hot (speaking even more emphatically as someone used to the much more pleasantly cold and windy summers of North Yorkshire). Either arrive prepared or be prepared to buy the appropriate clothes.

Be careful of subject initiations if you have them. Doing silly things is OK in general. Urinating at a porter while perched in a tree is not, which someone at my college apparently did, and is not the best start for your Cambridge studies.

Porters often look scary, but the majority are actually very nice. They are there to help you and if you're friendly they are often extremely helpful.

Cambridge tuition is built around questions and making mistakes. Being as quiet as a mouse in lectures is fine (although not strictly necessary), but you should aim to make as many mistakes as possible as quickly and noticeably as possible in supervisions and supervision work. That way, you will be corrected before exam time. Don't worry too much about whether your supervisors think you're clever - not only do they understand that everyone makes mistakes, but their predictions also don't necessarily matter. You will likely be predicted a 2:1 by every supervisor regardless of what you have got before or will get in future.

Don't worry too much about forming a deep friendship with the first people you meet at Cambridge (I realise this is probably general advice).

No, you're definitely right, it makes no sense at all.

I'm not *incredibly* concerned about Bale missing the first few matches, but the squad with him in it would be world-class and without him is merely excellent.  And really any purchases we make, if they improve the squad, we'll have to wait on those as well.

In there I think Johnson takes a deserved amount of stick. 

Really I think Agger has always been a bit overvalued. Perhaps he's been such a mainstay for so long he's become underrated. But I'd say his lack of aerial prowess has really hurt us more than his attacking ability has helped us.

Personally I've always felt his long runs forward have been fairly useless. I can't remember a moment where a serious attacking movement has come out of them.

That said, would I let him move on? Absolutely not. The devil you know versus the devil you don't. CB is a tricky position. Mistakes can really kill you.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;While I'm not conceding that cyclists take up less space on the road, it would not be crucial to my argument if they did as they still take up at least some space on the road.

Ok....some space yes. As do parked cars, pedestrians. Point is cyclists aid flow much better than cars, and cause zero damage to the surface.


It should be encouraged.

But If you want to talk about how much cyclists should pay how would you calculate it? 

Remember though that the cheapest vehicle (above £0) is I think something like a moped which pays £20

And consider the road is so heavily designed for cars (traffic lights/multiple lanes/motorways/speed bumps/cameras) and the pollution a car emits, and the effect said pollution (noise too why not) has on people's health. Then you have the large obesity problem not helped by cars. Which has knock on effects to the nhs and works days. You would also need to factor in the deaths and accidents largely caused by cars, and the congestion/cost this brings resulting in further time/work lost.

How much should a cyclist pay? 

On a personal note - I'm happy to pay a cycle tax, I pay VED on my 2 cars which I leave in the garage most days, but in principle I'm happy to pay anything (I can afford it). What I'm not happy about is taxing a clean and efficient mode of transport that anyone (rich/poor/young/old) can use that has many more benefits to society than most of the cars currently on the road.

&gt;This is the wrong attitude for sharing the roads with other people.

Not at all.
Slowing down a car is only ever done when needed (see pinch points etc) and never to be spiteful.

They didn't mind the label, they thought I was a freak, dressed in black, listened to metal etc. But we got talking, its the same as any other subculture, some good people, some douchebags. They loved modifying cars and dance music and spending a lot of time hanging out with each other, pretty sociable really and although we never saw eye to eye on music or clothing I did actually like them. The problems that exist in that subculture are in other places, violence, drugs, law breaking. But stereotyping just goes for what's most visible; for them it's speeding, drinking too much and battering someone, however all the chavs I knew worked pretty hard and in all sorts of jobs. Same dismissive stereotyping as emo kids cut themselves or goths are satanists, sloanies have more money than sense, that sort of thing. I think a lot of people in the media are chavs, some footballers, some models, actors, singers, the cast of the essex programme, they haven't been ""written off"", they're really successful and from all sorts of backgrounds.

&gt;• Inappropriate speed

Over the past year or two EVERYTHING is on reddit. Like literally everything. No matter what i post, it's from reddit. I could get it from a different source, but they'll have got it on reddit. Panic Dots also gets a bunch of hits from reddit. There is nothing i can do about content being on reddit. It's too big. The only way i can do that is to create my own content. I used to make my own content, but i stopped because i got bullied by different people. I am an awful writer. I used to do it because i really enjoyed it, but now i don't bother. It's not worth the trouble. The hate mail, tweets, comments i used to get would drag me down to the gutter. ""Youre not a real journalist"" ""that was the worst thing i ever read"" the list goes on and on and on. It's not worth it. So i stuck to pictures and videos. 

Laverys/Pavilion are like my second home. They are the some of the best people i have ever met and i owe a lot to them. I will never, ever be able to sing their praises enough.
 
I have snapped out at a few people before and i always wish i didnt. Ask my girlfriend, i always regret it, but i guess thats too late. That being said i have only lost it a bit with people that are slagging what i do or something i shared. 

Today i apologised for a joke i made about the Hudson. I made a comment that i shouldn't have and i said sorry for it. I joked about their windows being smashed by thugs. Why did i do that? Because they publicly mocked a list i made and tagged a bunch of other bars into it so they could see it. I was hurt by what they did and they were hurt by what i did. I said sorry for it. Since then there's been a massive internet witch hunt been going on by one member of the Hudson Staff. They emailed all my employers saying how bad i was and i was saying bad things. They screenshot my nasty tweet and told everyone to share it so everyone could see how much of a cunt i am. Its insane the lengths they go to. They want to make out like I'm a massive troll, when really I've said a few things wrong and always apologised. If we were to look through any of our twitter accounts or facebook accounts I'm sure we've all said something negative about someone. 

I get made out like im a shit journalist, but ive never once said i'm a journalist. In fact, i got so much of that abuse that i put on my ""about us"" section on panic dots that i wasnt a journalist. I'm just a guy that made a blog. 

I have no idea how this post can backlash on me, but i'm pretty sure it will at some point.

To answer your actual post...what kind of stuff would you like to see? Contrary to popular belief, I *do* like hearing what people think and if people have ideas that are cool I do try to get them going. Like if someone said they wanted to start a podcast id be like YEAHHHH LETS DO IT! I'm always up for anything. Some things stick and some things dont. That's life. 

Although, PD changes a lot. It started as a podcast, then a music news site, then LOADS of local stuff, reviews/events etc etc. Then onto films, tv stuff. Now it has Ice Hockey and NFL. It basically changes with me. If i get into something, then i like to make posts about it. If i stop enjoying ice hockey then i'll not post about it. If i become a foodie i'll make a food section. It's just my blog - though, anyone can use it. I've always said that. Feedback is always great to hear. 

Richard.

His spins are more effective than people give him credit for, and he was far better for us last season than people are willing to admit. I get that he lacks a forward pushing creative power, but his experience and temperament make him utterly invaluable to the team.

And if I have any criticism of AVB, it's that he doesn't value experience as much as perhaps he should, as we have seen at Chelsea, and even Spurs (think: Dawson), so having Scott is so important.

However, I've experienced a few games where the atmosphere has turned nasty, and often it is because of heavy-handedness of either police or stewards.

One notable example was one of the Leeds games in League One, where we were let out of the ground but then kettled just outside of it. The situation quickly got out of hand with people shouting abuse at police, bottles being thrown and people knocking over barricades. It was a bizarre decision to do it and the results were as expected. It was particularly odd as there wasn't even the suggestion fo there being trouble until that point.

I'm not making an anti-police point, as normally they are good lads who are on the whole well humoured and professional. However, sometimes the tactics can be poor, and lead to people getting involved because the policing style creates an air of expectancy. Another example would be that Millwall game where there was a huge crowd outside Rossi's. The majority of that crowd were people waiting to see what would happen because of the silly amount of police horses and officers on the scene, and the troublemakers were likely encouraged to act up because of the sense of security of being in such a large crowd.

Basically what I'm saying is don't give up on the policing, but don't overdo it either. Treat people like animals and they'll act like them.",0,1376616257,null,0,false,0,cbop1sc,t3_1kfhjs,t1_cbop1sc,t1_cboorci,null,1429813387,1,false,swanseacity,t5_2tip4,1

The reality is that what brings success in a leage campaign is a well balanced squad and stability. Integrating new players is *a risk*. If buying and loading up new players was the key to success then City would have won the league in 09/10, 10/11 and Chelsea would have won it last season. IT isn't a coincidence that the reality is that City won the league after a year of stability.

It takes a really good manager to integrate a new team with new players and to be successful (even when Mourinho does it he is filling in his 'formula')",0,1376621367,null,0,false,0,cboqufy,t3_1kg66f,t1_cboqufy,t1_cbomyr0,null,1429812536,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Yes, he is quite strong and has decent pace about him. However, it has to be said that he was objectively one of the club's worst senior defensive players last year. He is lacking in defensive ability and his talent really hinges on his ability to either use his body or recover with pace against weaker wingers. The same argument has been made for Jose (falsely), but having seen both play, it's quite obvious Jose is by far the better player. I don't rate Aly highly, but I also don't rate paying absurd money for Siqueira despite how talented he is. The fact is Cissokho can come and either: continue to look second rate among top flight defenders (as in a ""weakest link"" so to speak) or take the step up and prove the potential around his from a young age is warranted after another move to a talented, recognizable team. It's no surprise he was at Lyon, just missed a move to Milan, moved to Valencia, and is now on loan at Liverpool. The physical attributes are there for a left-sided defender, but he needs to improve his defensive game and quickly because the Premier League is going to get the better of him if he doesn't.

Yesterday though I had a teen girl come in my store all decked out in Doctor Who stuff, including a sonic screwdriver in her pocket, that she gleefully whipped out when I said, ""Doctor Who fan, huh?""  I immediately asked her, ""So, how do you feel about Peter Capaldi as #12?"" and she just lit up and said she was so excited and that she had a lot of hope that it ""gets back to its roots""

Having started with Tom Baker (and eventually getting caught up on Pertwee and a little of Troughton) personally, I've felt the division since the first season of David Tennant.  It sounds so hipsterish to say, but I kind of hate the fact that Doctor Who went mainstream.

I am extremely excited about Capaldi as #12 because it is such an opportunity to go back to solid writing instead of running around all the time and flirting.  Lets bring that balance back to sharp and biting wit with just a hint of flirt.

Well, whether you agree with it or not, that is what the law says, and it's true. I looked on the government's website, but it's so dumbed down I cannot believe it. Wikipedia is more detailed.

Then you have the large obesity problem not helped by cars. Which has knock on effects to the nhs and works days. You would also need to factor in the deaths and accidents largely caused by cars, and the congestion/cost this brings resulting in further time/work lost.

Let's also consider the enormous contribution that motor vehicles make to the overall economy, employing hundreds of thousands in vehicle manufacturing, parts production, retail and maintenance. Then there are the many people employed in road haulage and the logistics industries. The traffic wardens, road builders, civil engineering, taxi drivers and millions of others who would not be able to work if they did not have a car. 

If you took all of those jobs away, the UK would collapse, worse than Greece or Spain. The benefits that cars and the rest of the VED paying vehicles contribute to the rest of the economy is far in excess of the trifling benefits from cycling...

It's not bollocks, FSG have said it and I've seen it discussed many times. 

""The fee for Torres was dependent on what Newcastle asked for Carroll,"" Henry said, explaining that Liverpool wanted Carroll, plus £15m, to replace Torres.


Regarding the fool who does't read and then says ""but we still paid **£35m** for Carroll... you can hear what you want to hear and disregard the rest, that's fine by me but I hope FSG and such actually try to learn from mistakes rather than petulantly freaking that Carroll cost £35m.

* Injured bench is not the end of the world... provided you know your first team will all play.
* Walker is good... you should really have 3 higher priced defenders that push up the field - Johnson/Enrique/Ivanovic/Zabaleta/Walker/Evra/Rafael etc because they get shed loads of points with the combination of clean sheets/goals/assists. The other 2 defenders should be from different teams and the cheapest starters you can find (as you'll very rarely use them)
* 3 Chelsea players is too much to pass up on this GW... Hull and Villa both at home! lots of points. Based on last season Chelsea are a good bet anyway, so not often you'd need to replace them anyway. The only query at the moment is who Mourinho is going to play up front!
* Save money on goal keepers. Joe Hart didn't really do any better than the likes of Mignolet/Jaaskaleinen/Begovic/Vorm/Ruddy (before injury) last season, and that money can be invested in players that will score more points.

Otherwise it's pretty good, might not be a high point team the first game week but over the course of the season, Michu etc are a no brainer.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;Let's also consider the enormous contribution that motor vehicles make to the overall economy, employing hundreds of thousands in vehicle manufacturing, parts production, retail and maintenance. Then there are the many people employed in road haulage and the logistics industries. The traffic wardens, road builders, civil engineering, taxi drivers and millions of others who would not be able to work if they did not have a car.

Sure - all of which is aided by the more space generated by the bike - Unless of course you want more roads to be built and more cars in general?

And all irrelevant to my point anyway, as more cycling would have no effect on these industries anyway.

Also, you assume these people/industries would die - lets assume you're right (which you're not). What difference would it make in the long term?. Other industries would take its place (as they usually do). Should we hold on to a technology just to keep people employed or should we move for a better balance?

You also assume...

""millions of others who would not be able to work if they did not have a car.""

No one is saying we should dump the car (I have 2, i like them very much). What people (myself inc) are saying if the statistic that 75% of journeys are less than 4 miles is true (or something like that, cant remember the exact figure) perhaps, to make life easier for everyone that we look for other, more economic/less waste full ways to get around. But if you still want to do your Sunday shop use your car, I know I will be. Its all about using the right tool for the job. Personally I think moving a ton of metal to go 3 miles down a road is madness  (old and disabled people excluded).


Also, I sure you noticed i compared my bike to a moped - I did not compare it to a Eddie Stobart truck for obvious reasons.

Of course if you want to take this approach ....

&gt;economy is far in excess of the trifling benefits from cycling

you are right (sorta), but it lacks forward thinking. The potential benefits are massive - £6 billion is being spent on obesity, no idea for heart disease and diabetes. Ever been to Amsterdam - its lovely, ever been to London...its a pretty aggressive place.

Take the health benefits - you could save billions there (every year) and still not have any measurable effect on the car/road industry - other than less fuel being sold obviously.


As if you believe current figures - 86% of cyclists own cars, there is no reason to believe that figure would drop if cycling uptake was greater.

Given the RBCT is the study they give major weight to in coming to their conclusions, it's unsurprising that the new paper is doubtful about the utility of culling, despite the fact several other studies have shown culling can be effective, and that bTB was somehow significantly reduced in range in 1930s-1970s using a less sensitive cattle test in conjunction with culling of affected cattle and local badgers.

true,thatguy147,null,null,"Thanks for organising the meetup Martin, but unfortunately I didn't enjoy it too much. In fact you appeared to be a little condescending at times, for example I recall an instance when you and another redditor were talking about Macs, I tried to join in and you said ""Oh sorry, we're just geeking out"" and cut me out. When in fact my background is very technical and I'm quite interested in Macs. 

I've been somewhat relying on the Meetups as a way to meet new people. Since I've moved to the UK I've found it very difficult to make friends over here as I don't work with people my age. Personally, the meetup at the Maypole has actually put me off going to further Meetups. I was kind of hoping to meet some Redditors who were at the Meetup at the Avery as I got on very well with those guys. Some of the guys at the Maypole Meetup were pretty easy to talk to and were quite interesting.

The Cards Against Humanity game would have been more fun if we were in a more quieter environment. I know one of the redditors (not my housemate) had difficulty hearing/understanding the game and was somewhat ignored when trying to participate. There was a lot of 'messing' from your team and on several occasions your team was 'talking down' on others trying to play. I'm going to put that down to being a little drunk/tipsy, but that's still no excuse.

You're obviously enthusiastic and perhaps very ambitious with your plans for future Meetups, but personally, I would be very surprised if I was the only person who felt the way I do.

From my experience, a lot of the resentment from car users (of which I am one too) seems to be from cyclists ""holding up traffic"" and that they shouldn't be on the same roads as cars.  Unfortunately, describing VED as ""road tax"" seems to reinforce this (incorrect) opinion.  In reality, cyclists are traffic too and car drivers need to be taught to treat them in the same way as any other vehicle, as per the highway code.

I agree that infrastructure in this country is sadly lacking and many of the so-called cycle lanes are merely paint on the road, put there by councils to count towards their total path milage and are often more dangerous to use than the actual road.  Hopefully this situation is changing (albeit slowly) and in the future we will see more and better facilities for cyclists.

If you are asking because you want to know if we can sign players, we definitely can. We have around £12m per year to go to get back to the old wage level, and we are allowed to increase it a further £15m or so after that. 

We won't spend it all - there has been a consistency at the club in the past 18 months to pay players according to the new scale. Willian is on around £100k at Anzhi, I can see him fitting either our £70k p.w first team category or the £100k a week top category (which contains 3 players).

It reminds me of the time the Pope came to Britain and warned about 'aggressive secularism' and everyone laughed at him for it, saying that it doesn't exist. Simple fact is that aggressive secularism is quite real. See for example Cromwell banning Christmas, or the French Revolutionary week, in which they chose to measure their time based on the reason, logic and humanism of modular 10 mathematics as opposed to myths in an old book. Both of things went down so well.

I fully anticipate to see a large public movement before I'm dead deeming it child abuse to take a child to church, teach him or her that there's a god, and teach him or her to pray, and that as such children should be taken into care to keep them away from abusive parents.

If Bale got injured then I still think Spurs could fill the void with Holtby, Lennon, Chadli, Dembele. Central midfield I love Gerrard and Lucas but Gerrard is aging and Lucas has had a serious injury he's still catching up from whereas Spurs have Paulinho and Sandro who I both rate highly. Defensively I'd say we're fairly similar but Vertonghen is brilliant and also scores goals. Agger is injury prone and who knows if Skrtel will re-find form. Can Toure hack it still? Time will tell. Hugo Lloris I'd rate better than Mignolet but I'm open on that changing fairly soon after I've seen him play more.

You can repeat a year at sixth form, and I know plenty who have.

You're not over 19, so it might be different but it might not. You need to ask your college.

Also it might be worth getting in touch with your universities and explaining the situation - you failed to meet their offer due to medical issues, you are planning on retaking, can you defer your offer until next year? I don't know if that's allowed but you never know if you don't ask. I'd say it's worth checking before you decide to just reapply, because it's my experience that offers tend to be harsher for people applying after a year out (which is why you ought to apply for deferred entry if you're doing a gap year).

If you're going to the cost and effort of invalidity proceedings then any professional worth anything at all will be filing as many supporting arguments as they can rather than just relying on one argument.

So I guess to summarise, you won't necessarily lose your trade mark if you allow similar marks on the register but it *will* certainly weaken your position in any disputes.

I'm sorry that you both feel the same way.

I think a little misreading of the situation has occurred on both parts here, so I'd like to address your feeling slighted and hopefully make amends for anything you feel put out by.

The first thing you raise is certainly way way different from how I read the situation, so I'm sorry if you took that as an offense, if anything I was throwing out the 'sorry, we were geeking out' as an apology for us getting carried away when it seemed like you were a bit bored by us getting caught up in our conversation, it wasn't mean as any doubting of your credentials, as obviously you're both pretty technical people from the conversation we had at the start, but geekdom is a wide spectrum and that discussion didn't seem like something you were thrilled by, so apologies if you felt like it was an insult, it certainly wasn't, the opposite was my intention, I'd have loved to have had a chat with you about the more technical stuff etc as your jobs were right up my alley, but for whatever reason things didn't flow in that direction.

The CAH game I agree would have been slightly better in a quieter environment, I'm still not sure if everyone knew what was going on with the rules, haha. Apologies if Sleepy_Tiger felt ignored, as I certainly wouldn't ignore anyone on purpose, it was real hard to converse across the table at points when it got loud, so some people may have not heard people at times?  I couldn't speak for the conversations that were going on over that side, but there was certainly no malice from the sofa side I can say for sure!

The messing and such I can only say as par for the course with a game like CAH, especially when at a pub and the drinks are flowing! This is why I have further activities being planned in mind when the meets grow, I'm sure more tame activities would follow, this was just a test run to see the initial numbers etc and then once we can rely on that, we can start doing more fun things, and certain things that don't require friendly jousting like CAH ;)

Again, I'm sorry you guys have taken away so many negatives from it so I apologise for that and hope this helps gain a little perspective from my side on things :)

Micky is the most dynamic, most direct, and biggest goalscoring threat of the bunch.  He's a workhorse in addition to those things as well, he'll run for days and never stop.  Just a superb player.  He pushes Coutinho to a wider area but it's well worth it to accomodate him.

Willian is a really tricky, pacey player who is most at home on the left but can play all across the front.  He'll contribute with goals, assists, and a constant dribbling threat.  He won't be scoring as much as Micky and he won't be nearly as active defending but he'll give us one hell of a threat down the flank.  He's basically the player that we're all hoping Sterling develops into.

Costa: Big and strong, hard worker.  He's also bat-shit insane.  I absolutely love the guy's will to win though, he's unassailable.  I think he'd offer the least in terms of overall ability (although he's still good) of the three but his incredible mental strength and never say die attitude would be a huge boon for us.

It shouldn't hurt your CV *provided* you include plenty of other details as well. Unless you have something outstandingly damaging as an interest (fox hunting, for example) - the chances are your interests won't do you any harm. 

That said, don't provide too much information about your video gaming hobbies unless it's really relevant to the role. 

A month or so ago I was looking at the CV of a graduate looking to enter an IT Support role who had probably given more information about the World of Warcraft guild he was running and the various characters he had levelled than he had actually included about his academic experience.

I think this Roma fan's blog post explains him quite well:

&gt; The last three years, he's on 0.48 goals per game. He's nothing spectacular, particularly given he's a sunk cost in every other aspect of the sport. Simply because Roma hasn't had a bomber in the last years outside of the inimitable Totti doesn't make him great. 

&gt; Now, to assess his value as an employee, member of a group, and teammate? Negative five million. He's toxic. His teammates may like him, but that doesn't dismiss the controversy he courts or simple fact he makes going about their jobs more difficult, and that's the hallmark of a poor employee. You may throw the best office parties and I'm damn sure Pablo does, but that doesn't mean the rest of their hours are more pleasant because you aren't up to snuff in other areas.

I really hope they haven't put in a bid for him because I see Pablo + London = really bad idea. I don't think we have the players or the manager to really put him in his place when he goes into loose cannon mode either.

What happens is that children are given different tasks in the same subject area and are taught things appropriate to their ability.

Whether they are low ability or high ability if too many children aren't making the minimum expected progress then a school will fail the inspection.

There is an argument for ability based segregation in schools but it's not about 'good families' and 'bad families', it's not about 'rich' and 'poor', 'upper', 'middle' or 'lower' class.

I'd support a fully proportional, elected House of Commons, and to balance I'd have a House of Lords where members are appointed based upon merit by the recommendations of an independent appointments commission.

I also agree that hereditary peers and the Lords Spiritual should be abolished - religion should have no place in politics. However I agree with /u/java8888 that members should be appointed for life. As a deliberatory body appointed to scrutinise the work of the lower house, they should be free to voice their views without having to pander to the electorate to secure their next vote. Obviously since it's a life appointment, the appointments commission would have to ensure that each member of the Lords has demonstrable knowledge and experience in a particular field that would be valuable to the process (Medical professionals, engineers, academics, lawyers, technology specialists, representatives of the media industry, security specialists, bankers etc.) and not just retired politicians from the Commons unless they have a particular point of expertise.",0,1376662641,null,0,false,0,cbozxv3,t3_1khfr0,t1_cbozxv3,t1_cboywu8,null,1429808280,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

---
* Stoke (H)

Would hope to get off to a convincing win. We are favourites, but we haven't won our first game of the season for ages it feels like. Hopefully the kop will sing us home, and we can start moving on from the rather stressful transfer window. Mark Hughes's first prem game, so Stoke aren't exactly settled either. Predicting 3 points.

---

---
        
* Villa (A)

Quite similar pre-season. Benteke wanting out then reversing his decision 10 days later. This could be on the mind. A few players in but notably Bent is out to Fulham on loan. We should be routinely winning these games. Starting off our away campaign with a win would be excellent. Predicting 3 points.

---

---
   
* Man United (H)

A draw would be a brilliant result. Obviously Moyes's first taste of this fixture, right off the back of Chelsea 6 days prior. United in very unfamiliar ground without Fergie, but will still be a force. Hoping for a draw, either team could edge it. Predicting 1 point.

----

---
      
* Swansea (A)

I feel this could be a big test. Swansea of course up and running as a premier league side. They've made some pretty good singings over the summer (jonjo mate please don't pull a goal like in the under 21s thanks) and i think they'll be a tough game. Hoping for 3 but realistically predicting 1 point.

----

---

*Southampton (H)

Saints second season in the prem, a couple of nice signings too. Their first few games are not too bad so we'll be the first big test. Home support should help. Hoping a string of solid performances at home will see Anfield becoming, excuse the cliche, a 'fortress' for the rest of the year. Again, should be a routine win all things considered. Hoping to bag 3 points here.

----
----------

Overall, i'm saying from the first 5 games 11 points. Hopefully some decent displays to drive up confidence, could nab 13 if we show swansea what's what. Glad we have a couple of alright fixtures before united. Also good we get a test like that quite early on in the season to keep grounded and so on.

true,DoominaBottle,null,null,"Never give them your details if it is not your responsibility to pay for the TV license. They will harass you and attempt intimation at a criminal level to get money and will refuse to acknowledge evidence that proves otherwise. 

When I had just left university and had recently moved into a joint tenancy with friends. The contract of our let stated that the landlord would provide a TV license however after a month we started receiving letters stating we were not covered, in addition several of these letters addressed to he property were for flats and rooms that didn't exist.

Initially we contacted the landlord who informed us the flats were covered and we need not worry but he couldn't provide a paper copy of the TV licence as it was purchased in bulk and the paperwork had details of other properties on it. (This was actually true as we discovered later)

Another month passed and we were receiving about 12 increasingly threatening letters (1 for each of the 8 rooms then several random none existent rooms) a week which were cramming up our mailbox.  
Not sure if the land lord had lied to us or not we contacted the TV license people directly over the phone and informed them of our tenancy agreement and the contact details of the landlord. It was all very polite and official and we thought it was all sorted out.

We were wrong.

The following week we received more letters all marked final warning and informing us inspectors would arrive at the property in the future if we still had not paid by the months end and that there would be a £40 fine. 
We contacted them again, in spite of all the information we had given them they had no record of our call on the system or anything we had told them, spending another 20 minutes covering it all again they confirmed the database had been updated and we need not worry sceptical we decided to wait.

The following week more final warning letters arrived with the same information as before, now quite frustrated we contacted them for a third time and again the same excuse the database had not be altered  they had no record of our call on the system or anything we had told them. Now we had enough we told them that it wasn't acceptable, that it was the responsibility of the landlord and that we would put forward a complaint of harassment if it continued.

Following week an inspector arrives and I come home to find two of my housemates have let him in and are calmly showing him the tenancy agreement and giving him a physical copy of the landlords details which he copies to his form with notes and then for good measure staples it to the form. He then politely and seeming good natured asks for the name and phone number so he can contact us later to inform us that the situation has been dealt with.  

This was a start of a campaign of harassment for the next **three** god damn months, my housemate would receive at least one phone call every 2 to 3 days at various times of the day demanding money in spite of been repeatedly told that we had a license and it was the responsibility of the landlord. The landlord himself repeatedly contacted them (with us present) informing them of the license details and that it had been paid but that didn't end it. My housemate even received a court order and date over it, finally one of the people finally did their job and updated the database thankfully preventing the requirement to go to court but we've never forgiven them for it.    

There was nothing legally we could do either, no complaints were taken seriously and it wasn't recognised as harassment because it was a government organisation. ",0,1376665045,null,0,false,0,cbp0pyo,t3_1kgheg,t1_cbp0pyo,t3_1kgheg,null,1429807916,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

That's certainly the assertion we are continually circling. So, let's get down to the brass tacks and I will ask you to demonstrate a case in the last 30 years where that has been true, if you are aware of one. I think any court could understand the differences in scale between 'Redwell Beer' and, for example, 'Red Boll Energy Beverage' in terms of infringement. While I have no doubt that going after 'Red Boll' is completely justified, I am saying that it is a matter of degree and, in the absence of any proof that going after evidently non-infringing (but slightly similar) marks has any influence on a court decision (an assertion like the one you made previously to that effect is not proof) it makes neither legal nor business sense to do so, especially considering the damage to reputation that it now incurs.

In other words, demonstrate that not going after such minor similarities has significance in the over-documented, information-rich, evidence-saturated modern 'information' age, or it's nothing more than an old wives tale that may have once been true but is now just accepted, unchallenged wisdom - especially when (if you are a large company) you have multiple trademarks in multiple countries which back each other up through the Madrid Agreement / WIPO.",0,1376670315,null,0,false,0,cbp2m49,t3_1keqlc,t1_cbp2m49,t1_cboxj6h,null,1429807033,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As G_Morgan said, using the extra lane will make the queue shorter, which can have advantages. Eg, it might mean that the queue doesn't back up to the previous junction, which means people leaving at that junction don't get held up.

But here is the problem. Traffic in the merge lane will be moving slower than the other lanes (because they are having to way to be let in at the far end). Who is going to want to queue for longer in the slowest moving lane, just to make the queue shorter?

Government has a department in the library of the House of Commons that consists of research monkeys like myself who go out and compile the latest information on sectors of the economy, trends, legislation etc. This information is filtered through advisor's who's job it is to transpose the information into knowledge that their MP can use to assist them in the job.

It's a good system, but one that is ultimately lost on the public as it's a bit too heady to explain in any kind of easily digestible sound-byte. 

The reason why this system works is because it's impossible for an MP to do his MP duties (largely administrative work outside of election season) whilst still staying on top of his field (teaching, healthcare, justice, immigration, whatever). Naturally as time goes by they become out of touch and so they need a constant stream of fresh information from the civil service.

The big ones from here on out are:

- The Christmas special between Seasons 2 and 3 (""The Runaway Bride"")
- The ""gap year"" Specials between Seasons 4 and 5 (""The Next Doctor,"" ""Planet of the Dead,"" ""The Waters of Mars,"" ""The End of Time"")
- The 2012 Christmas special, which comes smack in the middle of Season 7 (there's Season 7 part 1, or episodes 1-5, then ""The Snowmen,"" then Season 7 part 2, or episodes 6-13)

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"1. 106 episodes of the classic series no longer exist. Videotape was expensive and reruns weren't a thing at the time, so the BBC erased and reused most of the tapes. This mainly affects Seasons 3, 4 and 5, though stories from Seasons 1, 2, and 6 are missing, as well. So complete seasons sets of Seasons 1-6 are impossible.

2. The Classic Series was a serial, meaning each season was comprised of stories which were each made up of 4-6 episodes (some as little as 2, some as many as 12). Each DVD release is of an individual story. So each DVD release is roughly movie-length.

3. There are only two seasons that have complete season sets - Season 16 (""The Key to Time"") and Season 23 (""The Trial of a Time Lord""). The rest, as I said, are individual, movie-length stories of 4-6 episodes a piece.

And [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1k047w/where_can_i_find_dvds_of_the_old_seasons_of/cbkd4yh) is a list I made recently with Amazon.com links to every US (Region 1) release of every story. I've also included the names of lost stories, but of course they don't have DVD releases so they don't have links.

There are fan-made ""reconstructions"" of the lost episodes, which are essentially still images played under the surviving audio tracks for each episode (all the audio tracks still exist), which are nice but a bit difficult to watch. The BBC has also released the audio tracks on CD with linking narration by some of the original actors to describe action you can't see, which I've heard are much easier to do than the reconstructions. Finally, almost all of the stories are available in adapted novelization format.

Hope that helps! The other commenters here have linked to places where you can watch the episodes online, I'm mainly focusing on the DVD aspect.",0,1376675106,null,0,false,0,cbp4h0l,t3_1khe0h,t1_cbp4h0l,t3_1khe0h,null,1429806166,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Property isn't theft, theft becomes possible though violation of someone's claimed ownership of private property, that's theft.

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"I'm not sure if all the 'blame' can be squarely laid with the current Government - but they're certainly not doing anything to help, so draw your own conclusions. The big problem the new commissioning organisations have since the April 2013 NHS changes (disclaimer - I work in one!) is that the Governments own guidelines come down strongly on the side of putting everything we do up for tender. Those guidelines are the Section 75 regulations that there was a bit of a furore about earlier this year. They are drafted in a way that basically means if a Clinical Commissioning Group (who now commission most Hospital, Mental Health and Community Health Services) don't tender, we open ourselves up to legal challenge. No CCGs have really tried this yet, so it's all new ground - and few will be brave enough to risk trying being the first when it's taxpayers money they're playing legal roulette with.

So while Labour didnt really help much in the past - and PFIs and LIFT deals are still having damaging effects, it is noticeably different now. It is worth noting that much of this need to tender contracts out for pretty much everything flows from European legislation - however previous Governments had not insisted that the pre April 2013 organisations followed it. They used to circumvent European legislation by using 'pilots' or similar contracting mechanisms to ensure that the best placed NHS organisations got the contracts. The section 75 regulations and Government legal advice has made clear this is no longer an option.

Of course, other NHS organisations are still very able to bid for our tenders - and in some ways they would have an advantage, as they have clinical experience. But the procurement process is designed to ensure a level playing field - and a private provider has to have the same chance to get the contract as an existing NHS provider. Otherwise we're back at legal challenge and spending taxpayers money in court. The other slight problem is that the private providers waiting on the sidelines for these tenders to go up often have significantly larger procurement teams and expertise in bidding for contracts than NHS organisations, who've had little exposure to the procurement process under historical practices. Plus, as we were warned in a piece of legal advise just this week - private providers also often have an in house legal team waiting to challenge on anything they can. Unsurprisingly these legal and bidding teams are not something NHS organisations have invested in over the years - being 'somewhat' more focused on nurses and medical equipment!

I could go on - but the end result is that now, more than any other time in NHS history, we're much more open to what you could call privatisation. The sad thing is, you probably won't see it happening - it'll happen area by area, contract by contract until someone realises that Care UK are running most of the services in South East England and Serco have bought up Devon. All of these contracts come up for tender at different times, in different places (there's 212 CCGs!), making it hard to track and see it happening. It really is privatisation by stealth, at a snails pace.

The one part I find the most terrifying of all is that a huge amount of Community Health Services contracts are due for renewal next year and beyond - all over the country. The last time they were tendered for was in 2010 and generally they went out on 3-5 year contracts. Now when I say 'contract renewal', this Governments guidance is that we can't just extend the contract - we need to re tender, exposing a huge chunk of services to private providers.

I just don't see your point that CofE schools specifically segregate communities. I also don't see a problem that a faith school would actually give preference to people of faith. Seems kind of hypocritical to want a good CofE education, but not actually want to be a member of the CofE. 

People who are bitter that CofE schools are better than other local schools could take a leaf out of the CofE system - build a school which is centered around a community. The school my sister's kids goes to - not CofE - relies heavily on parental input.

I'm discussing why we haven't seen anything close to what Coates is probably capable of. My comments have never been a passionate defence of Sebastian Coates' performances. They've largely been poor. But at the same time what do you expect from a lad who never got a fair crack of the whip. Another example was the Man City at home under Rodgers, Coates played really well, adapted to the high line and possession football quite nicely then Skrtel makes a huge rick, costs us the game. Next game vs. Sunderland, Agger's back and Coates is dropped. Doesn't play again until the derby, I think. 

&gt;I agree that it is difficult to perform with your team if you don't get time with them, but that is the life of an unproven footballer. 

This is a big flaw in British football's young player development. Big clubs buy up the talent but can't get them playing 1st division football at a lower level. This is why youth development is so bad here, it's particularly difficult for defenders. Most young centre halves end up as utility players or second choice full backs until they're 23 or older.

School governing bodies can be fined, for example, if the academy is closed for a day. The buildings are privatised.

Academy status, introduced under the Tories and spreading fast, allows participating schools to employ 'teachers' without qualified teacher status, at a salary chosen by the headteacher/governors and under a contract that doesn't have to adhere to any national standard. There is no regulation as to how many qualifications a teacher has to have other than those set by the governing body of the academy. As a stand alone entity, an academy is a private business.

Academies can employ anyone as an 'instructor' and pay them less than they pay teachers. That means the academy is saving money and the kids are, in a lot of cases, receiving a poorer standard of education. This will force teachers to work for less and make it harder for them to find positions.

In the latest survey, over 50% of qualified teachers in England said they wanted to leave the profession. The Tories have succeeded in sabotaging our schools and the education of the young generation. 

Apart from OFSTED, these academies answer to no-one, and believe me, OFSTED are a joke of a regulator.

This is true, but as I keep saying: at the point when he was being benched ahead of Carra, he hadn't put in these poor performances. Young of players usually do much better in a run of games rather than just the occasional cup match, or the occasional switch to 3-5-2 at half time.


&gt;I'm just not sure how you reconcile this feeling with the feeling of a supporter that Liverpool needs to be playing its best players. 

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by this. Which feeling is which, I'm confused. Liverpool  FC needs to play its best players in the games that matter, dead rubbers should be used to give younger players an opportunity, especially as they're so hard to come by during the rest of the season.

&gt; I don't see that as a distinctly English flaw, but more of a problem with top clubs in general. Not to mention that if you have a world class spine, a la Barca, you can let your youth players in more easily since they will be playing with top players who can help cover up any mistakes they may make.

But Barca have Barca B, other La Liga clubs can have B teams, if they want to, so can Portugese clubs. Serie A has the co ownership system and so on. English football has nothing.

&gt;It's sort of chicken or egg, for me. Did Coates not take his chances or did he not get the right chances at the right times to be in the best position to take them?

That doesn't prove that children from 'bad families' drag down children from 'good families' or that the education provided by the schools would get worse.

You don't see how a school that requires you to be a member of X to join segregates a community?  Interestingly the vast majority of CofE schools were setup to provide an education to *all* children as opposed to the private/public schools, which required a fee.  Funny how they are now all so fussy about people being CofE...  I wonder what could have caused that?!

The point is, *is this the best way to run our education system?*

It's obviously not the best way because we have a vast gulf between good state schools and bad ones, a vast gulf between postcodes, between social classes etc.  and the system we currently employ only goes to harm social cohesion and mobility.

Story time: I was sitting in a pub with some friends when this girl (average body type, early twenties, blonde) walks up to me and asks if I owe her £5. I'm confused, thinking that maybe I misheard her? I've never seen her before, after all.

She repeats the question. I say ""Of course not, I've never even seen you before."" She then says, and this is a direct quote, ""Well then give me my five quid back.""

I tried to laugh it off, but she started shouting, I stood up and she started pushing me.

Then the bouncer came and quite literally threw her outside. She called the police because the bouncer attacked her, but then she ran away before they arrived.

I don't think it's a bad signing. He's a regular for the Swedish national team, and in a world cup year, he's not going to want to be sitting on the bench all season, so he'll be pushing RvW and Hooper as hard as he can. An acquaintance who knows the turkish leagues reckons he's fallen out with Galatasaray's coach, so it wouldn't surprise me if he's trying to force the move to get regular football.

He's an experienced head who knows the Prem from his time with Bolton, and supposedly a big presence in the dressing room which is something we might need with all our youngsters. He's also likely to be fluent in English, so we shouldn't have any communication issues.

It's only going to be a short-term signing, perhaps a year or two at the most. He's the fourth striker we need, and without a transfer fee there's still money available for a CB or CAM.

Tell me how his poor performances the season afterwards have any impact on this premise?

true,tjcefc,null,null,"Players to watch out for:


   Kevin Mirallas will be the main danger man for Everton this season. He showed many moments of class last season and has continued to do the same in pre-season. If he can stay fit I have no doubt he will be one of the most potent attacking players in the league. 

Ross Barkley is a player whom I believe will really showcase his talents this season and hopefully become a critical part of the team playing in his favoured role behind the striker. He is unlikely to be starting every game (at the beginning of the season anyway) but he will be given far more game time this season than any other. He looked very sharp in pre-season and has already proved to the Everton fans that he has a lot of potential with some of his performances last season, particularly away at Arsenal. I believe this is the season he will make his mark on the Premier League and show everybody he is more than worth the hype. He is fairly quick, has great awareness of space and can drive with the ball and take players on.   Whilst expectations do have to be kept in check, I am confident that he will flourish in the Everton team under Roberto Martinez by providing us with some much needed incision in the final third. It is very important fans don’t get on his back for making the odd mistake though. He is a young lad who will only learn by making mistakes and the fans should be instilling him with confidence in order to help him contribute to the team. 

   Gerard Deulofeu is another Everton player to look out for. He is a fairly unknown entity insofar as very few players, if any at all, will have faced him before. This could end up working to Everton’s favour if he is able to surprise some with his raw ability to take players on from wide positions using his pace. Expectations certainly have to be realistic for this 19-year old and his decision-making will need to improve in order for him to be a consistent starter. However, considering he is widely accepted as Barcelona’s most promising youth player there is no doubt he could provide some moments of sheer brilliance that could secure some vital points for Everton this season.

Concluding Remarks: 

The significance and size of the current transition taking place at Goodison Park cannot be overlooked. Replacing David Moyes after such a long period of time was always going to be difficult, and success simply will not happen over night. This season could see us slip a few places in the league table as we adjust to life under Roberto Matrinez. However, a good run in either of the cups is a very real possibility. In all likelihood, we will concede a few more goals than we did last season and there may be times when we look a little open at the back or make a mistake or two that leads to a goal. However, football is about the individual moments of ecstasy and jubilation that cannot be explained by words and can only be experienced. I have no doubt that with Martinez at the helm and with some of the attacking talent he has at his disposal, we may just have a few more special moments than we’ve been used to at Everton.

http://buildings.westsussex.gov.uk/ePlanningOPS/loadFullDetails.do?aplId=1154

A lot of us ordinary people have voiced our concerns with fracking so Cuadrilla is now saying they have no IMMEDIATE (notice the key word there) plans to frack in Balcombe.

However, their planning permission does allow them to frack. Why would they be exploring for gas if they had no intention to release the gas?

From the FAQ PDF available on the above link:

"" What does ‘well testing’ involve?
The information provided with the application indicated that the horizontal well will be washed with
around 20m3 of dilute (10%) hydrochloric acid to clear it of any debris.
It notes that nitrogen (an inert gas) will then be pumped down to flush the well, returning any liquids
or solids remaining in the wellhole.
After this process, any water (produced water) and oil will be pumped to the surface and stored. At
this point an evaluation will be made on the economic viability of the operation.""

The described process to explore the well smells a lot like fracking to me...Notice the words in brackets produced water... What I wonder is produced water? 

If you download the PDF from the above link entitled 8. Appendix -C The Drilling Process you will see on page 7 it states:

""TESTING PROCEDURE
The main aim of the Lower Stumble (Balcombe) exploratory well is to test for natural gas/oil trapped in the shale and thin sandstone layers in the Upper Furassic Formations which lie directly beneath the crest of the Bolney Anticticline...""

It later states:
""There may be a need to stimulate the stage at which flows gas/oil.... Stimulation is carried out by pumping water (no doubt 'produced' or toxic chemical water) under pressure into the natural fractures in the shale formations to open them up...""

Now for a definition of fracking:
From wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_fracturing
 ""Hydraulic fracturing is the fracturing of rock by a pressurized liquid.""

From Oxford Dictionary:
http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hydraulic-fracturing
""noun
[mass noun]
the forcing open of fissures in subterranean rocks by introducing liquid at high pressure, especially to extract oil or gas.""

It's obviously a classic debate, and there is no right answer. I feel that Coates never impressed, even when he wasn't poor, so perhaps it made more sense to go with the guy who might've been a bit down in form but had a huge body of work that proved he was a class player.

I agree. But don't you agree that at the end of 11/12, we had the perfect opportunity to give Coates that run of games, but Carragher was picked ahead of him (in fact, if I remember correctly at times we had all our centre halves available but still chose to play Carra, for whatever reason, I'm guessing to get him to 2nd in the all time caps list).

&gt;I equate that sending players out on loan to the Championship on England. While it is good experience, it doesn't really translate to first team success at a top flight club. What does is getting regular time with your first team

Exactly. The problem for English football is that no one has found a way to get round this. Roberto Martinez talks about this a lot and says it's English football's biggest problem. Look at Callum McManaman, released by Everton at 16 but at 22 he finally developed and played out of his skin in Wigan's cup run.

Critical Factors this season:

Keeping Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini:

This is fairly obvious and has received widespread media coverage but really is absolutely imperative in order for Everton to have a successful and progressive season. We are already lacking in central midfield and if Fellaini was to be sold at this stage in the transfer window I believe that would be absolutely disastrous and simply cannot happen. 

Retaining defensive solidarity:

Only Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal conceded fewer goals in the Premier League than Everton last season. This defensive solidity which has been a hallmark of David Moyes’ managerial style has to be somewhat retained under Martinez. You will struggle to find a football fan in the world who thinks Everton won’t concede more goals this season than last, but that is to be expected with the change in tactical outlook. However, in terms of personnel, we are highly likely to have the same starting defence as last season, which I believe, is one of the most balanced back fours in the league. On top of that, in Baines and Coleman we have two of the best attacking full-backs in the league who are also both competent in terms of defensive ability. Martinez’s ability to correctly utilise the quality we have in our back four will be a decisive factor in determining how successful the upcoming season is.
    

The form of Nikica Jelavic:

Jelavic endured a difficult campaign last season scoring just seven premier league goals. This poor form was costly as we created the 4th most number of chances in the league (480 – which was more than Arsenal and Manchester United) but sadly there were too many occasions in which nobody was able to take them. The combination of Martinez’s free-flowing football and having numerous speedy attacking players will surely result in an abundance of chances being created. If Jelavic can recapture the form he showed when he first joined the club then there is a lot to be excited about. 

Patience from fans and the team:

I believe this is a critical factor that cannot be understated. This is a transitional period in Everton’s history and is not going to come good overnight. David Moyes left Everton in a great position to try and build for the future. Roberto Matrinez is a young manager who is learning all the time, his style of football is undeniably different to Moyes’ and thus it is going to be a potentially lengthy period before Martinez can be fairly judged. The Goodison faithful will be doing nobody any favours if they start getting edgy when we keep the ball in defence or critical if a pass or two goes astray. Likewise, the players themselves will have to be patient, particularly in possession. Nobody wants to see Distin and Jagielka playing hoof-ball.

Judging people based on their clothing is nothing to be proud of.  I like wearing tracksuits mainly because they're comfortable and people tend to leave me alone when I wear 'em too (likely stuck with the same prejudice you seem to have).  Likewise when I wear hoodies.

Doesn't make me a cunt, being a cunt makes me a cunt.  Everybody, regardless of rage/gender/social status/clothing has the capacity for cuntish behaviour.  We've all been cunts.  These chavs in the video were cunts.  Sean Penn is a cunt.  I'm sure Stephen Fry has been a cunt to someone.  Point is: cunts are cunts, and we've all been cunts at some point in our lives - wearing a suit and tie, as opposed to a trackie, didn't make us cunts, our behaviour did.

All MPs are barred from holding any form of employment (very broad definition) ever again after their office ends.  Instead they get a nice pension to compensate for all those lost earnings.

Option 2.

All MPs lose all right to privacy upon their election.

A special branch of police (or auditors) is employed to put all MPs under permanent 24 hour / 365 day surveillance while they are in office.

I must stress that all this information is readily available on the Internet.

Kids present with Neuroblastoma more than one likes to see, roughly 100 cases a year in the UK. The kid in question has what is said on the blog as 'High Risk' Neuroblastoma. It's an even more unusual form of the standard Neuroblastoma and presents in kids between birth and 2 years of age, as OP has said in the comments there's around 250 cases in the world).

What normally happens is the kid gets some chemo and a lot of radiation. What happened in this case due to the rarity is there was the opportunity for said kid to receive a newly emerging form of radiation treatment over in the US. Naturally, flying a high risk sick child (and family) all the way to the USA to receive very expensive treatment not covered by the NHS required a massive fund raising push and so the 'Appeal' was born.

All the different treatments went as well as could have been hoped, and I do mean this. His blog says he went into full remission. That's a home run for a Cancer Patient.

Check out the first paragraph under the Heading; [Refractory and relapsed neuroblastoma](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroblastoma)

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"I think it's important to recognise that there's a difference between method and execution.

Fracking as a method, just like most other forms of power generation, can be really rather safe in HSE terms.

Can it be done badly? Sure. Can it be done well? Also, sure. Has it been done well for about 40 years? Actually, yes. Fracking has been done for years in the conventional drilling industry. 

If you take the Texan examples listed in that guardian piece you give, well, yes if you allow people to take a few million gallons of water a day from aquifers which are massively overused already that will cause problems. Texas has systemic problems with its water infrastructure and lax state legislation has allowed for some cowboy companies to cause real problems for local communities.

The dead cattle thing was just an example of sheer stupidity (I read the report) from the operator when they decided to dump a bunch of drilling fluid (essentially just water, biocide, and HCL) into a field. Surprise surprise, you make a bunch of cows take an acid bath and they die. People should go to court for that for criminal damage. That said, that's an egregious example of stupidity which you just do not find in the UK oil sector. Companies in the UK go to huge expense to ship drilling fluids back on shore to treatment facilities already. The old days of ""just dump it wherever's nearest"" are long gone for anything at any significant concentrations (&gt; 50 ppm). It's worth noting though that any onshore rig which had done a similar thing would have killed those cows, this was not related to the fact that it was a frack job, in fact fracking fluids are remarkably strictly limited in their composition compared with the usual drilling fluids used for a drill.

So can fracking be done badly? Yes, sure. Can any energy generation technique be badly executed? Yes, sure. Can fracking be done well? Again, yes. The UK has an excellent history with regards to oil and gas regulation, and its offshore regulatory body is among the best in the world. The fact that the UK placed a moratorium on frack jobs immediately following the first tremors in order to give people time to formulate suitable regulation is a sign that regulatory processes are working exactly as they should, not an example that things are going wrong.

Basically, I think you're succumbing to the hysteria and not looking at this rationally. Fracking *really* isn't a big a deal so long as it's done within a stable and sensible regulatory framework just the sort of frameworks the UK uses in O&amp;G.",0,1376687545,null,0,false,0,cbp98v4,t3_1kguyw,t1_cbp98v4,t1_cbp7nbn,null,1429803867,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Last Saturday was the first online (let alone reddit) meetup that I'd ever been to. As I described it to my SO afterwards: it was an... experience. There were both positives and negatives for me in there.

I find myself agreeing with /u/thatguy147 and /u/Sleepy_Tiger (who, incidentally, were the two I most enjoyed engaging with - no offence to anyone else intended) in that I found you a bit condescending at times. There again maybe that's because I don't know you, your ways or your mannerisms. You're obviously a very driven chap with a lot of ""Cambridge pride"" (never really understood pride of being from somewhere myself). I also felt that I saw the beginnings of a kind of clique on one side of the table, but that could be another snap judgement.

I did enjoy the majority of conversation (read: what I could hear) and getting to know a little bit about some new folks. Some of it did feel a bit forced, but I guess that's a natural starting place.
I wouldn't like to commit now to being ""one of the regulars"", I would have to come to a few first to see if they're something I can enjoy a bit more than I did last week. That said - I would like to come to at least a few to give it a fair chance. 

Personally, I wouldn't force it as much as you seem to be - a bit more chilled and casual would perhaps draw a bit more interest?

Edit: Also the whole ""celeb"" thing - not really my bag. We're all people, people!

Programming is as important now as basic literacy has been since we decided it was a good idea to have everyone able to read and write - which opened up what we now consider to be civilisation.

The priesthood mention is no mistake, programmers are the real power now - corporations, governments and institutions of all kinds are relying on automation more and more. The world financial system is no more than a distributed computer system in which human action is becoming increasingly irrelevant. 

We can either be like the Priesthood, jealously guarding our secrets and passing down our interpretations of what works, or we can allow everyone to participate in a new world where, maybe, we can all make systems that perform our tasks for us.

We had no idea how universal literacy would change our society when we started, and it's entirely possible that basic computer and programming literacy will lead to another radical transformation - imagine a society in which everyone understands how to program, think critically about problems and break them into solvable parts. Computers as true general-purpose tools for all, rather than devices for the passive consumption of content.

""Big Bank Welfare Queens Unprofitable Without Government Subsidies, So Why Don’t We Regulate Them Like Utilities?

Quite a few readers excitedly sent a link to a Bloomberg editorial, “Why Should Taxpayers Give Big Banks $83 Billion a Year?” which summarizes a study by Kenichi Ueda of the International Monetary Fund and Beatrice Weder di Mauro of the University of Mainz that the editors used to extrapolate that the five biggest US banks are “barely profitable” if they weren’t able to borrow at artificially cheap rates thanks to the market perception that they are too big too fail.

The Bloomberg article, while analytically flawed, still winds up being too charitable. It looked at only one subsidy, how the implicit guarantee too big to fail guarantee lowers the borrowing costs of the biggest banks. Now on the one hand, Matt Levine is correct to point out that Bloomberg sloppily applied a funding cost advantage based on bond yields to deposits and short-term funding as well. However, he also cheerily acts as if deposit insurance is fairly priced (as in banks are “paying” for deposit insurance, hence no subsidy there). That’s bollocks, and Levine ought to know better. Even Greenspan conceded that FDIC insurance was too cheap.

The highly respected Andy Haldane of the Bank of England, in a 2010 paper, “The $100 billion Question” reached a conclusion not quite as dire as Bloomberg’s, but still in the ballpark:

Table 4 shows the estimated value of that subsidy for the same sample of UK and global banks, again between 2007 and 2009. For UK banks, the average annual subsidy for the top five banks over these years was over £50 billion – roughly equal to UK banks’ annual profits prior to the crisis. At the height of the crisis, the subsidy was larger still. For the sample of global banks, the average annual subsidy for the top five banks was just less than $60 billion per year. These are not small sums. 

So the biggest banks are borderline profitable to unprofitable over the cycle. And remember, the first acute phase of the crisis didn’t start until August 2007, and there were intervening periods through September 2008 where risk spreads fell back.

And remember, we really aren’t looking at the right question. Funding subsidies are only one piece of the puzzle.

Ed Kane of Boston University estimated that in 2009, the cost of systemic risk insurance to the largest banks would have been roughly $300 billion. If we look at the five biggest banks in the Bloomberg list (JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman) and look at the proportion of funds they took in the $205 billion TARP Capital Purchase Program plus the additional $20 billion each in equity purchases for Citi and BofA through the Targeted Investment Program, you get that those banks received 57% of the total.* Let be generous and round it down to 50%. You still get an estimated $150 billion in subsides for the five biggest banks. So contra Levine and big bank defenders, doing a more precise tally actually makes matters worse, not better, for the big banks.

Moreover, none of these analyses factor in the ongoing subsidies of ZIRP and quantitative easing. Lest anyone forget, interest rates were dropped to the floor to keep the banks from keeling over and the Fed dares not increase them until it deems the economy to be looking perkier. I’ve seen estimates that the cost of ZIRP to savers is $350 billion. That is yet another subsidy to the banks, particularly the biggest ones. Recall that this is the second time in a decade that the Fed has chosen to impose negative interest rates to help banks. Greenspan also dropped Fed funds rates in the dot bomb era, not for the usual one quarter, which had been the Fed’s previous behavior in a recession, but for a full nine quarters. Greenspan was apparently unduly concerned that a stock market downturn lead to deflation.

QE is a harder-to-measure subsidy. QE has been focused on lowering the cost of mortgage credit, which gooses the value of mortgage-related assets. Even though the Fed focuses on how it helps homeowners, it isn’t hard to imagine that the central bank is at least as concerned with how it flatters bank balance sheets.

And we have other important forms of government support. The US has been pushing, hard, for foreign countries to open their financial markets so they can be conquered by US financial firms. They strong-armed the Japanese to deregulate banking, with the result that they went head over heels for zaitech (speculation financial engineering), which no doubt served to make their joint real estate/stock market bubbles worse. The Asian crisis served as another opportunity to wedge the door open in formerly protected markets. How much is it worth to have Bob Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner lobbying on your behalf?

And make no mistake that the decision to treat banks as favored children is long-standing. Consider this:

Our current approach to regulating commercial banks is bankrupt….After years of benign neglect, we are now engaged in debate over the future of our banking system at a time when our banking system is, along with our economy, fundamentally weaker than at any time since the Depression….

In fact, a credit crunch is underway…As the economy weakens, the cash flows of supporting the debt payments of all sectors of the economy erode. As defaults mount, bankers curtail credit further. Borrowers curtail their expenditures further. Economic activity falls. Cash flow falls. Credit flows are curtailed further. Given the heavy debt burden of many sectors of the economy, and the weakness of the banking system, a downward spiral, once started, could continue for quite a while…

Even if we are lucky and are able to arrest this spiral, the recovery is likely to be anemic…

Today, the banking system is like a long-neglected bridge. The nation has not been paying attention to it; its functions are taken for granted. It is now beginning to show signs of rapid deterioration. Unless a major effort is taken to shore it up, it is likely to collapse.

Fortunately, President Bush, the Treasury department, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and many members of Congress are well aware that the problems in the banking industry need to be addressed now, and a new answer is needed. Indeed, in early 1991, there appeared to be a concerted effort by government to improve the profitability of the banking system….This is the central issue we face.

The book was Bankrupt, and author was Lowell Bryan, one of the three leaders of McKinsey’s banking practice at the time. It is typical McKinsey leading edge conventional wisdom: banks desperately needed to rebuild their capital bases, ergo, they needed regulation oriented towards making them more profitable. Since the deregulation of the 1980s had led directly to the savings &amp; loan industry blowing itself up impressively (aided in many of the most dramatic cases by Mike Milken), one might conclude that haphazard deregulation is not such a bright idea. And the weakened equity bases of banks also might mean they needed breaks until they got back on their feet, not permanently.""",0,1376699576,null,0,false,0,cbpdau1,t3_1kh5kp,t1_cbpdau1,t1_cbp7sz1,null,1429801975,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

""It turned out that Greenspan’s engineering of an extremely steep yield curve in fact did enable banks to earn their way back out of the hole they were in much faster than the pundits expected. But banks had been pushing to get into higher-return investment banking businesses since the 1960s, and used the change in regulatory assumptions to their full advantage. All restrictions on interstate banking were eliminated in 1994. By 1996, Glass Steagall was a dead letter.**

The point is that the banking industry has been profitable (at times, seemingly very profitable) only at the result of long standing government intervention to assure its profitability. It is no exaggeration to say that the banking industry enjoys so much public support that it can in no way be considered to be a private enterprise. But we’ve put in place the worst of all possible worlds: we’ve allowed an industry that couldn’t figure out how to operate profitably on its own to extract undeservedly large subsidies, with the result that financial services industry has become extractive. Its pay is wildly out of line with the social benefits it provides (indeed, many of its most predatory activities are also its best remunerated) and it has also grown disproportionately large, sucking resources away from better uses (we’d clearly be better off if math and physics grads were tackling real world problems rather than devising better HFT algorithms. And when you have bank branches displacing liquor stores, you know something is out of whack).

The better solution in 1991 would have been to engineer a modestly and reliably profitable and boring banking industry. But that would have taken a lot more thought than letting bankers do what they wanted, which was enter the Wild West of investment banking. The result has been more frequent and severe financial crises, culminating with one that nearly destroyed the global economy. Unfortunately, no one in the officialdom seems able to recognize that the only time we had a long period of stability in the banking system in the US was when banks were strictly regulated and made only modest profits. Until policymakers are willing to act on that understanding, financiers will keep up their extortionate practices until they bleed their host dry.

\*Trying to factor in AIG would not improve the picture, since the reason for saving AIG was that banks were its credit default swaps counterparties, so the salvage operation for AIG was a backdoor bailout of the big US and international banks. You would show the spillover to foreign banks, but Kane’s number was for domestic banks only.


\** The Fed issued a ruling that permitted bank holding companies to obtain as much as 25% of their revenues from investment banking activities.
