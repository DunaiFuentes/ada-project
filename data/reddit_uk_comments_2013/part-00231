Personally, I think that's going a bit far. The exact situation is kind of irrelevant because I wasn't violent or particularly aggressive to this woman, beyond using harsh language.

If you must know the parking situation: the residents zone in front of her house is rarely (if ever) full. The zones (and non-zones) directly in front and opposite my house are nearly always full after about 7-8pm. I returned home at about 3am after working for 16 hours straight. I'd done this maybe 6-8 times in the month before and had to park in the residents zone opposite her house, never had I taken the last spot in that zone. Further, these are not dedicated spots, they're shared. Every single time I'd done this, she'd left a printed note saying YOU DON'T HAVE A PERMIT TO PARK HERE, despite me checking the council rules saying that I did. Sounds more like she's the shitty neighbour who doesn't know how to share.

I suspect her upset is because of the local student population. I happened to be a student at the time, but I also happen to own the house - her anger was misplaced with me.

In fact, even modern houses aren't really good enough, our building regs have been completely inadequate with regards to energy efficiency for decades.

Insulating these properties effectively is extremely expensive. You need external wall insulation on every exposed wall with careful detailing around the roof line, external services etc. You're looking at £15k+ for a decent job. Then you need upgraded windows, doors, loft insulation, a-rated boilers, draught-proofing, floor insulation (which is extremely disruptive and almost always incorrectly installed). When you've done all that you need to sort your ventilation out otherwise you'll run into a host of other problems. The costs just keep racking up for increasingly small returns. 

There's a reason people don't install external insulation at market rates, it would take you about 30 years to pay back. 

Don't even get me started on the financial payback of unsubsidised renewable energy systems.

The bill for adequately improving the UK housing stock would run into hundreds of billions. We'd be better off knocking them all down and starting again. 

We're going to really suffer as a country when energy starts to get really expensive (the current price is still extraordinarily cheap). Hell, people in my county already sit in the dark for 3-4 days a fortnight because they don't have enough money to put on the meter.

I'm no great fan of Defoe, I'd replace both of them if I could. But if I had to choose one, Adebayor would be gone in an instant.

I mean serious question. What has he brought to the club in the last 12 months? We paid him over 9 million pounds last season (3 times what we paid Defoe) What has he done to say ""hey I was shit last season, but I'm working my ass off to prove that I am worthy of playing for  this team""?

AVB says Defoe trains hard, and works hard to push for the number 1 strikers spot, while Adebayor gets sent to train with the reserves and breaks team rules by not showing up to the game.

That's really the type of person you want in the team? We're better than that. The club deserves better.

It has nothing about anyone being ""offended"" or ""insulted"". It does seem like the sentencing may have been too harsh, the details would need to be made more clear before anyone can really say I think, but from the looks of it it's not just because someone felt offended or insulted.

The test at that company was a clock app that had some bugs in it, and you had to fix it. 2-3 compile time bugs, and a couple of run-time bugs. When I was doing it, I only had notepad and the commandline, and no internet, and completed it successfully. I remember one ""spectacular"" candidate that got legendary status for not knowing how to compile java programs via commandline (javac), and they didn't get the shitty laptop with the busted wifi, so they could've googled it, but iirc they sat on the problem for ages without asking, and didn't try to use the javac help once they knew what program to use. 

Especially if you don't have experience - have a portfolio on pendrive or on the web. Some companies (generally smaller ones) will be interested in taking a look and interested in a demo. Pretty sure showing I could write working code assisted with my first job. 

So being able to fucking code is a big one. Surprisingly so. Sane problem-solving is a very good trait to have, knowing how to find out stuff you don't know, at least rudimentary understanding of the domain of the company you're going to work for is good too. (e.g. if they're a web-based company, expect questions on common site attacks/SQL injection). If you've worked for a company that does agile, they like that too, but showing knowledge of agile-scrum can be a nice thing - even if the company has no fucking clue what agile is (looking at you, company named after a shape).

&gt;Setting out the latest available overview of child well-being in 29 of the world’s most advance economies, this report puts the UK in 16th position, below Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Portugal.

&gt;Worrying findings include high rates of teenage pregnancy, and high numbers of young people out of education, employment and training. The UK has one of the highest alcohol abuse rates among 11-15 year olds, and was placed in the bottom third of the infant mortality league table.

&gt;Although the Report Card shows the UK moved up the league table in overall well being, since 2010 the downgrading of youth policy and cuts to local government services are having a profound negative effect on young people age 15-19.

For me, this is the single most important measure of any country because children of today make up the society of tomorrow. Without investing in kids, you have no future.

Admittedly, there's a long and violent history of doing this by force, but I think that British culture is basically defined by looking at other people and just assimilating the bits we like into our own little world. What's more British than curry, Chinese takeaway, kebabs, German luxury estate cars, Japanese motorbikes, French wine, crappy Australian lager that they don't even drink, fizzy wine brewed by Benedictine monks (Buckfast is based on an old French recipe), and the best football players in the world coming over and playing for our league sides, to name just a few examples? 

Nothing more British than realising that we live on a tiny, rain-sodden, wind-blown, bleak and gloomy set of islands sitting in the North Atlantic, and that, instead of leaving - because it's very reassuring to live on such a simultaneously wonderful and crappy rock - the best way of brightening the place up is to bring the rest of the world to us.

I also keep leftovers from the night before so at least 2 or 3 mornings a week I can nuke something.  

15 min Morning Chicken Saag recipe with using two small saucepans.  If you use a high heat on the pans all the time its very quick.
  
* Chop a small onion, a couple of garlic cloves, 3 chillies and fry on a high heat with 1 ts ground coriander, 1ts turmeric, 1/2 ts of ground cardamom and 3 ts cumin.
* In the other pan at the same time, boil 1/2 a can of chopped tomatoes and 3 big handfuls of spinach.
* Once  the onions have browned (2/3 mins) add to the spinach pot.
* Fry a bit of thinly cut chicken in the onion pot till cooked (white but not browned - 5 mins max?) 
* Blitz the tomatoes and spinach mixture till its chopped fine but not liquidised. 
* add the tomatoes and spinach mixture to the chicken and bring to the boil.

Vary the recipe to include all your left over meat / veg.  It can all go in.

Chilli omelets are even quicker - 2 or 3 chillies mixed with 2 eggs and then cook like a French omelet - maybe 3 mins? 

Honestly, try this for a week, even if it means getting up 5 mins earlier, and the idea of eating something like oats or cereal first thing in the morning will make you gag.  Because its more protein than carb, you feel more energised all day, and you get a load of fibre and vitamins to boot.

Don't they? They seem to spend rather a lot of money on disability benefits, grants and schemes. Far more than they are giving in grants to these companies.

Just think. If people exercised personal responsibility and didn't pirate to the level they do now then this money which could have been spent on other things wouldn't need to be spent on this. Do you have any pirated media or software? If so then you're as much to blame for the government spending this money in this way as anyone else who has.

---------SG-------JH------  
------------Coutinho-------

I think Lucas is good enough to adapt to a faux-CB role. If either of our fullbacks bomb forward, Lucas can slot in deep to maintain shape during our attacking phase. SG &amp; JH will still have the freedom to operate the midfield and link up with Coutinho.

In the recovery phase, Lucas will effectively remain in the CB position. During our possession &amp; buildup phase, he can push higher and give an outlet to link up our midfield/defense.

However, this clearly hangs on consistently superlative expectations from Lucas. Still, this would let us play with wingbacks while allowing our 4 best midfielders on the field simultaneously.

I definitely don't think she would have - and she doesn't, for exactly the reason you mention.

I definitely didn't like her at first because I was so fucking shattered about Rose leaving and Martha being in love with him, but she really just grew on me. I felt her pain when he looked right through her and I applauded her strength when she stood up to him. She was exactly what he needed at the time and he her. She didn't let her feeling for him cloud her judgement and knew when to stand up for herself and leave. That takes a shitload of courage.

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt; If you think the Iraq War was against the majority will of the people, how do you explain the same party being elected after the event?

Quite easily. The alternatives were even worse.

&gt;And with regards to socialism, what evidence do you have that giving people direct democracy would improve anything?

What evidence do you have that direct democracy over the Internet wouldn't improve things? None, because we haven't tried it yet.

&gt;The current system allows parties to take the best course of action even if it's unpopular - something you wouldn't get if everyone had a say.

The best course of action for who? The majority workers or the minority capitalists who control the corporations and through them the economy and government?

&gt;The last time I can think of the people being given a direct option was when Heath had the 'who runs the country' election over the union strikes and got a hung parliament. Or more recently, when Greece decided that asking the population if they wanted to pay or dismiss their national debt was a fair option (one they wisely decided against at the 11th hour).

Neither of those are or would be examples of direct democracy. They're just giving people a vote. Direct democracy is more about taking part in the discussion which leads to the idea to be voted upon in the first place.

Simply giving someone the opportunity to vote is not enough, you need to give them the opportunity to take part in every step of the process.

&gt;People will mostly vote for what's best for them personally, not what's best for the country.

People will vote for the idea which seems best to them, an idea they may have helped to shape. These ideas would be proposed by anyone and be refined or dismissed by people with an actual interest and knowledge on those subjects.

&gt;It's interesting that you use reddit as an example - I don't take opinions on reddit as a barometer, just an example of who visits reddit/ who shouts the loudest.

An example. You may not take the opinions of most redditors seriously, but I bet you do when someone is doing an AMA and is speaking about things you know they're knowledgeable about. There are many excellent opinions on reddit as well as a load of noise. You just need to get into the more focused, subject-oriented subreddits.

It's actually celebrated in loads of countries, though:

&gt; Countries that celebrate St George's Day include England, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Georgia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Republic of Macedonia. Cities include Moscow in Russia, Genova in Italy, Ljubljana in Slovenia, Beirut in Lebanon, Qormi and Victoria in Malta and many others. It is also celebrated in the old Crown of Aragon in Spain—Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and Majorca.

&gt; St George's Day is known as the Feast of Saint George by Palestinians and is celebrated in the Monastery of Saint George in al-Khader, near Bethlehem. It is also known as Georgemas.

&gt; Besides the 23 April feast, some Orthodox Churches have additional feasts dedicated to St George. The country of Georgia celebrates the feast St. George on 23 April and, more prominently, 10 November (Julian Calendar), which currently fall on 6 May and 23 November (Gregorian Calendar), respectively. The Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the dedication of the Church of St George in Kiev by Yaroslav I the Wise in 1051 on 26 November (Julian Calendar), which currently falls on the Gregorian 9 December.

&gt; In the General Calendar of the Roman Rite, the feast of Saint George is on 23 April. In the Tridentine Calendar it was given the rank of ""Semidouble"". In Pope Pius XII's 1955 calendar this rank is reduced to ""Simple."" In Pope John XXIII's 1960 calendar the celebration to just a ""Commemoration"". In Pope Paul VI's revision of the calendar, that came into force in 1969, it was given the equivalent rank of a ""Memorial"", of optional use. In some countries, such as England, the rank is higher.

The point was that if such a large percentage of the population were against it, they would have voted another party in as a protest vote. They didn't, here *or* in the USA.

&gt;What evidence do you have that direct democracy over the Internet wouldn't improve things? None, because we haven't tried it yet.

Which means you have to provide some evidence that it will, instead of suggesting that something being untried means it's worth a shot when the stakes are that high. And it could be argued that other countries have tried it which serves as an example that corruption isn't as easily dealt with (take the steps China is currently following to combat their corruption as an example).

&gt;The best course of action for who? 

The country as a whole.

&gt;The majority workers or the minority capitalists who control the corporations and through them the economy and government?

Company's have *influence* on the government via lobbying - that's not the same as control. And remember, we're now a financial services country - you have to provide an alternative industry and make sure it's in place before you can throw that away.

&gt;Direct democracy is more about taking part in the discussion which leads to the idea to be voted upon in the first place.

There was plenty of discussion in 1974. And, I would imagine, plenty going on in Greece (more, in fact, since they had the internet) - so what happened? Sure, the parties will give their own opinions, but it's up to the voters to discuss things anyway, with the system we have. If people aren't having them in large enough numbers, it could be because they don't see the need - they're already voting for people to do that for them - so how will you encourage these people to take part?

&gt;These ideas would be proposed by anyone and be refined or dismissed by people with an actual interest and knowledge on those subjects.

But that happens already, on sites like this - and if enough people get behind what is seen as a good idea, it gets taken up by local councillors/ MP's. I'm not sure *insisting* that people do this instead of it being an option is achievable.

&gt; You just need to get into the more focused, subject-oriented subreddits.

That's true, but reddit is also an excellent example of how many people are prepared to wade in with opinions that don't really have any relevance or realism - complaining that this country is capitalist is just one of them. Of *course* it's capitalist, but suggestions that are actually achievable are always going to be given more time than 'well it's because we're not following *my* idealised solution'. The population is simply too large to suddenly decide to affect a complete change - just like so many corporations are so far into Windows that suggesting linux when it's over ten years too late is laughable. Now, consider how many upvotes anti-capitalist statements get - is that a true measure of the populations opinion, or a measure of how many anti-capitalists go on reddit? If we transpose that to the political system, we're back to how-do-we-get-people-to-join-in-without-forcing-them.

I think we (Brits) need to learn to respect peoples privacy as a society more. We have weak laws for privacy and Government surveillance and we have an awful response to the GCHQ revelations and I think it all stems from the public's basic lack of respect for other peoples privacy and thirst for juicy gossip like the stuff that's coming out of this trial.

ETA: I feel a lot of people are confusing the fact it needs to be menitoned in court and as such it will be reported in press with the manner it's reported in. Lot's of publications are reporting on it in atypical detail. The BBC for example read out an excerpt from one of Brooks' messages then quickly gave a justification for it as it showed the intimate bond of trust between Coulson and Brooks but normally they wouldn't bother with cheap sentimental tat like that.

No, you are doing the typical thing someone who has a contrary point does - asking questions with ever reducing level of detail until you can get me to the point where I don't have an answer, and then ""prove"" me wrong. It is the same argument style Occupy protestors encountered, the bashing over the head of all suggestions as imperfect while blithely ignoring the imperfections of the current system.

You are purposely misinterpreting things I am saying, such as interpreting an attempt to cut down on political bias by using groups as an attempt to say it is not possible for bias to exist in groups.

FTFY

&gt;What if the people don't want socialism or don't agree on the type? What will you do if the people want fascism? What if they use your direct internet democracy to bring back the death penalty and kick out foreigners? What if they vote in favour of privatisation?

If after an informed debate about an issue, the people decide to implement a certain proposal, then that is the will of the people. Sometime people make mistakes though but in a direct democracy, those mistaken solutions could be reversed at any time by the people.

So, the people implement fascism, realise they don't like, then abandon it for something better. Next time someone suggest fascism, the people point out that they've already tried that and it was shit.

Why would an informed worker vote for privatisation if that resulted in 90% of the value created by their labour being siphoned off by middlemen? Would you agree to do the same work for £20,000 when you currently get £200,000?

&gt;What will you do with the defenders of our constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy? Will I be sent to the Gulags or simply put up against a wall and shot?

I advocate implementing socialism by voting in a party which would then work towards scrapping the party system and implementing worker ownership and direct democracy over the Internet. If the people didn't want this, they wouldn't vote for the party in the first place.

Violent revolution is not the only way to implement socialism.

&gt;What will you do with the defenders of our constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy? Will I be sent to the Gulags or simply put up against a wall and shot?

Nothing, if they work within the system. They can either work for a living like everyone else or move to another country that hasn't implemented socialism and try to continue to exploit that nations labour and resources. These capitalists are already wealthy enough that they don't need to work. I's just tell them to keep their money and do what they want.

The other is that he is intelligent, calculating, and realises that the EDL is running out of steam and if he wants to avoid going to prison for longer and ensuring he gets a decent long term job with a public profile joining Quiliam, which is a nepotistic think tank funded by the government to do high profile things like this.

It didn't - and I didn't have to do anything to find out why because (at work) we don't have to support home OSX machines because (whisper it) nobody uses it - the answer is always format to FAT/ FAT32...but of course, you know this, right? OS7/8/9 didn't support NTFS for years, and I remember when it reached the stage of read-but-not-write.....but since you're still evading, let's try the reverse explain why NTFS drives can't be read on OSX machines by default (or Apple file systems aren't recognised by Windows). You can evade the point as much as you like, but until you address it I'll just keep giving licensing examples. There are plenty, as I'm sure you're aware, making your replies a bit laughable.

You're right - one of us is a SysAdmin that works mostly on Windows and the occasional linux server, just like 90% of corporations in the world...in other words, a professional :-) If you're going to argue that, go look at the job boards; how about that, almost 90% of them ask for Windows experience and not much else, right up to Technical Architect....but of course, I wouldn't know that, would I?

&gt;Don't whine that your fuck ups mean the computer can't do something when you're blatantly and admitted to being incompetent.

*Still* avoiding? Wow, for a 'sysadmin' you're desperate. OK, I'll remind you;

* OSX Has the lion's share of the non-windows userbase on desktops. Which is....?

* You're suggesting that all games are indie and in no way owned by the console manufacturers? Good luck with that.

* Because techincal possibilities don't have anything to do with licensing restrictions.

Arsenal and Spurs are a little worrisome, but I am more worried about Spurs because their team has changed more drastically than Arsenal's. In my opinion, Arsenal can go either way, but if we actually keep consistent pressure winning away at emirates is very doable even with an in form Ozil. 

The way I see us beating Spurs is by beating them with offensive pressure, not defensive soundness. They have a shit ton a clean sheets this season, yet they only seem to win by one point (and like three have been penalties). Let Suarez and Sturridge do the talking at White Hart Lane.

James I/VI was her successor and he wasn't about to go Catholic either.

Meanwhile, Elizabeth I had done a lot to calm down the political scene around her, and propagandists like William Shakespeare did not hurt her cause with the common people.

I also think (I can't believe I'm saying this) he should potentially replace Gerrard, not Henderson.

Gerrard (despite popular opinion) has not had a bad start to the season, at all. But as we all know Cptn. Fantastic is getting older, and we shouldn't be playing him 90 minutes, game after game - we're effectively reducing the time he'll be able to play for us before he has to retire.

This match would be perfect to try this - We want Lucas, we want the tireless energy Box-to-Box that Henderson can provide, and we want the attacking power of Suarez, Coutinho and Sturridge.

So my suggestion is that we continue to play 3-5-2 (with the wingbacks dropping a little bit deeper) but have both Henderson and Lucas in support of the back 3. We play Coutinho at the front of the midfield triangle, with SAS upfront.

In reality however, Gerrard is almost a guaranteed starter. Under this circumstance, no - I think Henderson should play again, and we use Coutinho off the bench (depending on the score) in the second half.

&gt;Chadli has picked up hamstring injury. 

&gt;Ade has a foot contusion from last training session pre-Hull (Tuesday)

&gt;Zeki still fucked from Anzhi

&gt;Danny Rose hasn't yet come back for training yet, still take more time

&gt;Andros is /fit/ to play, will use splint for hand

On opponents

&gt;Everton have made a great start, significant due to the managerial change

&gt;They are in the run for top 4 after such a great start

&gt;Great manager, who likes to attack

&gt;They play great football and it will be a good match

On the game

&gt;Guys [Spurs players] are driven to get revenge for last seasons results. Spurs see it as a drastic reason for why they didn't get top 4 last season

On Lukaku

&gt;Chelsea didn't make a mistake sending Lukaku on loan, they have 3 great strikers

&gt;Potential is there for Lukaku to become a very influential striker

On the lane

&gt;We had great atmosphere at the lane at the CoC against Hull and am glad the message got across to the fans

On new signings

&gt;We are acheiving what we want at the moment are happy with the way we are going

&gt;We have one of the best defences in Europe, but this can change very quickly

&gt;The players are bonding well and coping with the change in system.
&gt;Great team spirit

On change of system

&gt;We try to build from the back

&gt;Want to use quick players to get in behind

&gt;Sometimes space isn't there so we slow the play down

&gt;We like to shoot often

&gt;We like to have possession

&gt;This is the right track for us (possession/shooting stats being high)

On Kyle Walker signing a new contract

&gt;Extremely important, we have high hopes for him because he broke into the club so young

&gt;Was generating interest from other clubs but loves Tottenham, loves playing for Tottenham so they extension made sense

On the table

&gt;The leading pack (1st - 7th) has broken away

&gt;Utd have had difficult fixtures and have easier ones coming up, they should catch up making 1-8 tight.

On Danny Rose injury

&gt;Have to wait for pain to go away, scans say joint is fine

&gt;Taking conservative approach

&gt;Player has trained, run and shot with boots on without pain

&gt;Coming along well, expecting him back after November international break

On Utd

&gt;The drama surrounding Utd is warranted

&gt;Champions of England should not be in this position

&gt;Moyes has had it easy considering how the media treated me [AVB] after similar results for Chelsea

&gt;By the end of the season they will be competing for first place

Taking implies a loss and a gain, where as copying is only a gain. Hence why copyright is a contract to be able to legally produce and copyright infringement an only civil infringement on the right holder for which you can attempt to seek damages that would have to be proven. Unlike theft in which you know what the damage is because something you had is missing.

The difficulty in talking about this is that when you want to talk about copyright infringement for what it is, and why it is that way people assume you are some how apologising for piracy or suggesting that it's not a bad thing because you've questioned the usefulness of ""theft"". It's like punching some one has always been call tax fraud and people think that because you want to talk about the actual act of punching some one with out bringing up unrelated tax codes you are some how suggesting people should dodge tax. 

It's increasingly important because we need honest debates about harm because we need honest debates about the law. For over 100 years we've seen nothing but broader more strict copyright laws (terms always just happen to expand when Micky Mouse is due to enter public domain) that increasingly favoured publishers over content creators and the debate has always been framed by the big publishers in terms of theft because the moral outrage got them what they wanted. Those laws increasingly are infringing on free speech and underpin attempts to regulate or flat out break the internet and they, if they carry on as they have, arguably are going to cause harm to the culture they are meant to invigorate.

If they're going to need to train you, the best choice for most companies is to pay for you to go on a course (not uncommon for programmers to be shitty teachers). That means, even if they did accept candidates without the skills they want, they'd probably end up reducing the wage to cover the training costs. Also, those kinds of offers aren't common, as people have a habit of doing the training then quitting. Some companies combat this by having an employment contract that says if you leave within a certain time period, you need to pay for the training, but it is a hassle, which can be avoided by employing someone who already has working knowledge and wants to use it. 

Even if you're not going to touch the PHP side of things for a year, if the company wants you to transition from a junior to a non-junior role, it helps to have the knowledge ready and waiting... again, instead of the rigmarole that's trying to arrange for someone to go on a course (finding funds, finding suitable dates, ensuring you're going to actually learn something).

He's been a bit poor in his defensive decision making as of late

If we want to tinker with something it should be against easier opposition first so that we are not at as big a risk of losing points, and especially not against a direct top 4 rival.  We can build some confidence and comfort with the new setup this way.  I'm all for changing things up a bit to try and find a better balance in our first team, but I would prefer to do it in a way that doesn't present a huge risk to 3 important points.  

The idea of an eventual Lucas/Henderson/Coutinho midfield 3 is really delicious and I think in a couple of years when Gerrard has really fallen off it's exactly what we're going to see.  I'm a little skeptical of if Henderson has quite the vision and passing range required to distribute the ball quickly and accurately when we break out into an offensive transition or counterattack but Coutinho can certainly share the load on that responsibility (Gerrard has been the one doing it so far).

This will be amplified next year - if we get a top 4 spot and Gerrard has played in the World Cup all summer, I fear it will take it's toll.

Specific to this game however, I'm really torn... Arsenal are going to have a lot of possession, and we'll be chasing them around a lot. I definitely reckon BR will have a plan to play counter attacking football, and that either involves having Gerrard deliver a precise long ball up to the front (just like the wonder ball to Sturridge at the start of the season) with Henderson's/Johnson's pace to get up to the other end of the pitch to assist SAS, or Henderson/Cissokho/Johnson to bring the ball up the pitch and use Coutinho's/SAS' agility to get balls through the defense.

We'll find out tomorrow what BR has up his sleeve; I have definitely learned to trust him over the last 12 months and I have complete confidence in him to make the right call tomorrow.

Either way, I cannot wait - going to be a blinding game to watch!

His argument still stems on the fact that Muslims are ""bad"" and they need regulating. In part I would agree, but only as far as to say that anyone (regardless of race/religion) who partakes in hate speeches needs regulating/stopped. The EDL are as guilty of that as anyone.

I once photographed an EDL march - As a photographer I found it fascinating, scary and very worthwhile. I was treated quite well by them, and I was protected by them on one occasion when things kicked off. What was interesting was when I was photographing them I noticed this thin scrawny guy photographing me. I later learnt that he was an EDL member. I also later learn that there is a website dedicated to people that piss the EDL off. I wondered that maybe my record was being cataloged. But nothing (luckily) came of it.

The thing I did notice - they where not all thugs, most of them where, but maybe 10% where very articulate and communicated with the crowd and police very well, they managed the march and if not for those guys I suspect it would have been carnage. The other 50-90% where begging for a fight.

I think this will certainly be what our midfield looks like as Gerrard gets closer and closer to retirement, but as you said, Henderson's not there yet, nor will he be for some time.

But this:
&gt; He's been a bit poor in his defensive decision making as of late

Is part of the reason I suggested it - as good as he is, he simply doesn't have the energy to effectively chase the ball around for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what he's going to have to do in this game.

Arsenal will be passing the ball for fun, and we are going to have to hold strong and take a beating until we can intercept and counter. Their agility in midfield is deeply worrying; only have to look at the Wilshere goal against Norwich to see what we're going to have to hold up against.

Like you said though - It's going to be bloody brilliant to watch, I have been looking forward to it all week.

At the end of the day news is a commodity within a free market, and sadly just like everything else the onus has fallen to us to consume responsibly. We're offered muck racking tabloid tripe that's heavy on conjecture and sensationalism, and people take it because it's easy to consume and it's more entertaining. The problem is we as consumers are perpetuating the system, unaware of the political ramifications of our actions a lot of the time. It's like buying a McDonald's instead of making a dinner, it's easier to take the easy road and get a quick easily digestible product, but it's strengthening a system and a culture that many people just wouldn't agree with if they saw the consequence.

You will *never* run out of *Doctor Who* episodes to watch. Even if you forego the first couple of eras of the classic series, you can start watching the Tom Baker years (1974), and there will be enough *Doctor Who* to last you a lifetime. 

&gt;should I rush to get caught up and see it in theaters, or skip seeing it in theaters and try my luck at finding it later when I have caught up. 

You won't have to try your luck - ""The Day of the Doctor"" should be very easy to find, wherever you look. 

What I would suggest is to watch the rest of the revival at your own pace. When you're done with that, read Wikipedia or ask /r/gallifrey for the important points from the classic series to know about before going into the ""The Day of the Doctor"".

Please explain to the class what the X stands for.

&gt;I don't think anyone is saying UNIX itself is bad for gaming, but you need to understand the UNIX market.

Would that be the market which can be summed up as IBM?  They're pretty much the only company out there still selling an actual UNIX machine (AIX on POWER).   SCO is dead, Sun is dead in all but name for the most part and I don't think HP have much interest in HP-UX at all these days (although that's the same as IBM but at least they list some machines you can buy/lease). 

Or did you mean the Linux market?  Which whilst full of some quite irritating people isn't THAT fractured with the right sized hammer you can probably make a given piece of software work on a different distro.  Not something you can often do with the UNIX's. 

&gt;As you can't play a PS4 game on a OSX machine nor on your iPhone. So lumping them together to make a point is idiotic.

So the PS4 doesn't run a derived FreeBSD OS then, even though Sony confirmed that was the case.  Fair enough.  I also never said you COULD play PS4 games on anything other than a PS4, that was intimated quite heavily by the other nonce.

That is a bit of an overstatement. Sure, they class among one of the worst but I wouldn't say they were the worst regime ever.

The Japanese Empire [experimented on prisoners of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_subject_research#Japan) during WWII and their soldiers [raped and murdered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre) hundreds of thousands of civilians in China. The British Empire was responsible for the starvation of [60 million Indians over three centuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_India) and in particular [Winston Churchill](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7991820/Winston-Churchill-blamed-for-1m-deaths-in-India-famine.html) was extremely racist (""I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion."") against Indians. All of these things are on-par or worse than the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany. However, due to Nazi Germany being something which is immediately recognisable as bad the mainstream media has repeatedly used it as the 'bad guy' which has made people overstate it in comparison to other events.

No three does not equal all as I'm sure you realise. However when the very group tasked to catch scum police instead conspire to protect them I'm going to just assume they are all scum.

* Pretty much impossible for any little scrote to deny that thay've been hit when the evidence is splattered all over their face in bright orange paint.

* It actually hurts a bit, so therefore is a) more manly and b) makes you think more about what you're doing to avoid getting shot.

* very few lizards who spend £100's on military surplus websites so they can perfect their Delta Force 'loadout'. I did try airsoft a few years back and most of the guys I went with were sound and didn't take it at all seriously, but one mug had a full US Army ranger desert kit (think Black Hawk Down) when we went airsofting in woodland. He also actually wore armour plates in his chest rig, as if that would somehow increase the authenticity of the experience.

Clearly the debate is far from straight forward, even among taxi operators/representatives.

Looking at the average increases for a 5-mile trip on the BBC link that OP provided, the increases for special rates are even more eye-watering (a 42.6% increase on a five mile trip on Xmas Day, in example).

One thing I would be interested to see, is if the increase would still be required, if there was better regulation on the distribution and use of plates that are given to new taxi drivers.

I would guess that prices would be better, if the amount of plates available were reduced and work/miles completed was studied more closely by the council, or an independent body.

Vs Arsenal, you want players who (in Rodgers' speak) have courage with the ball. The more possession we have, the less Wilshire/Cazorla/Ozil have it. That's the main reason for Agger over Skrtel. I prefer Hendo to Lucas for his extra pace, specifically against and on the counter attack. Then, re-asses after 60': 

-- if we need to defend a lead, swap Lucas &lt;-&gt; Coutinho or Cisshoko

-- if we need a goal, Moses / Sterling &lt;-&gt; Coutinho or Cisshoko

There is already far too much focus on simply recalling formulae in school maths and the suggestion to increase this is both irresponsible and foolish. Is it better to be able to simply recall formulae and algorithms for a few exams before forgetting it as you'll never use it again? Or, is it better to teach children critical thinking skills which they'll be able to use for problem solving in later life? I understand why teachers teach maths in this way because it does achieve better grades but we end up with less capable people.

Children often ask when they are going to use the quadratic formula (or some such) as an adult and so what's the point in learning it. This is it. There isn't a point.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Ramsey and Ozil are Arsenal's attacking power, they're at the heart of the overwhelming majority of things Arsenal does that lead to goals.  Giroud becomes invisible when he doesn't get service and Wilshere feeds on the play of the other 2.  If we shut Ozil and Ramsey down we're in with a huge shout.  I want to see Henderson with instructions to never give Ramsey an inch to breathe through the middle.  I don't think Gerrard has the legs to run with Ramsey all match and Lucas will have his hands quite full with Ozil and Wilshere/Arteta (whichever one of them is the furthest forward at a given time).

Unless Coutinho starts and hits form instantly on his return we're going to have a very tough time playing through their midfield.  They play with 5 and they play narrow so there won't be much space for us.  Playing through the center of the park will mean we have to play very fast in transitions or they will be a bit overwhelming.  This does mean Johnson and whoever plays down the other flank should see a lot of green grass to play in though and Johnson in particular can be extremely dangerous going forward when he's up for it.  Our 3-5-2 will be interesting lining up against Arsenal because it's extremely solid through the middle.

I'm cautiously optimistic for tomorrow.  I can't help feeding on the feel good buzz and that makes part of me expect a win but I know the reality is this is going to be a very hard fixture.

true,MarcusOrlyius,null,null,"&gt;The point was that if such a large percentage of the population were against it, they would have voted another party in as a protest vote. They didn't, here or in the USA.

Why would they vote for another party that also wanted to go to war. That would make no sense as a form of protest.

&gt;Which means you have to provide some evidence that it will, instead of suggesting that something being untried means it's worth a shot when the stakes are that high. And it could be argued that other countries have tried it which serves as an example that corruption isn't as easily dealt with (take the steps China is currently following to combat their corruption as an example).

What's China got to do with anything? China does not use direct democracy. If you want evidence of direct democracy in the 21st century, then look at the Internet, look at open source, look at websites like reddit and look at software like bitcoin.

&gt;The country as a whole.

Which means what exactly? A country doesn't have needs, nor wants. It's just an artificial boundary, laid down in order to enforce control over the people within it. What's best for someone in Aberdeen may not the best for someone in London, so why apply the solution solution when there is no need to? Why should someone who's never been to Scotland, never mind Aberdeen, get to decide what's best for people in Aberdeen? Some things would be good though to apply to the whole country. Direct democracy over the Internet can quite easily handle local government, but can also scale up to handle national, global or even interplanetary government.

&gt;Company's have influence on the government via lobbying - that's not the same as control. And remember, we're now a financial services country - you have to provide an alternative industry and make sure it's in place before you can throw that away.

Those financial services pretty much brought the global economy to ruin and what have been the consequences for their owners? Basically, nothing.

From this article here, we get:

&gt;In 2011, financial and insurance services contributed £125.4 billion in gross value added
(GVA) to the UK economy, 9.4% of the UK’s total GVA. London accounted for 45.8% of the
total financial and insurance sector GVA in the UK in 2009. The sector’s contribution to UK
jobs is around 3.6%. Trade in financial services makes up a substantial proportion of the
UK’s trade surplus in services. In 2010-11 the banking sector alone contributed £21.0 billion
to UK tax receipts in corporation tax, income tax and national insurance. 

Is the UK really a financial services based economy with 10% of the GVA? Seems to me that just applies to London, which reinforces my other point about what's best for London not being what's best for the rest of the nation. Perhaps some financial services wouldn't even be needed if socialism was implemented, and stuff like bitcoin can automate services that are needed.

&gt;But that happens already, on sites like this - and if enough people get behind what is seen as a good idea, it gets taken up by local councillors/ MP's. I'm not sure insisting that people do this instead of it being an option is achievable.

Exactly. So why not cut out the councillor who could quite easily reject the idea because his rich mate paid him a bribe to do so? Why do you think that the councillor is needed? Does the councillor single handedly implement the idea? No, the councillor basically tells workers to implement the idea. Why can't the vote be recorded publicly, electronically and securely, perhaps in a blockchain like bitcoin uses? Why can't the workers access that public record and then implement the idea that was voted for? Or perhaps there could be another piece of software which checks the public record for ideas which have been voted on and need implementing, assigning that work to a manager, who would then set the workers to implement it.

People wouldn't *have* to participate in discussions or votes if they didn't want to, they simply have the *opportunity* to do so.

&gt;That's true, but reddit is also an excellent example of how many people are prepared to wade in with opinions that don't really have any relevance or realism - complaining that this country is capitalist is just one of them. Of course it's capitalist, but suggestions that are actually achievable are always going to be given more time than 'well it's because we're not following my idealised solution'. The population is simply too large to suddenly decide to affect a complete change - just like so many corporations are so far into Windows that suggesting linux when it's over ten years too late is laughable. Now, consider how many upvotes anti-capitalist statements get - is that a true measure of the populations opinion, or a measure of how many anti-capitalists go on reddit? If we transpose that to the political system, we're back to how-do-we-get-people-to-join-in-without-forcing-them.

With instant, global communications and knowledge flowing more freely than ever, the flaws of capitalism are becoming all too apparent and people are demanding change from our party based governments. How can there be any real change from them though, if they refuse to let go of these systems which are failing society so badly? People are engaging in direct democracy already without even knowing it. Some of the pirate parties are based on direct democracy. People are already joining in. They're being forced to though. Forced by capitalists who have shaped the economy in order to exploit other peoples labour. Forced by capitalists who brought the global economy crashing down. Forced by capitalists who take MPs aboard their yachts and then get fascist, corporate friendly laws passed.

This is how all taxes work. You start with broad brackets and lump everyone into these brackets and obviously then you can give discounts for people who would be unfairly hit by the broad sweeps of the taxman.

Don't think it couldn't be done. You could even merge it with council tax or something. Or even simpler would be to just increase the income tax for obese people, add an extra 2% for example. Don't want to be weighed by the ATOS (paid for by the taxpayer naturally!) medical examiner when you start your job? You'll get that 2% extra income tax by default.

You haven't been able to smell them because you're *in* them all the time!

I recall a particularly objectionable weekend some years back when I'd got back with an ex (don't do this folks), spent half a day going to his flat in the chuff-end-of-nowhere, turned up, and not only did he not have any food or coffee (the latter of which is punishable by hanging, imo), but every item of clothing he wore smelled of dirty skin and hair. Why? He kept them all on the floor and had wore them for weeks. Needless to say, I was hardly jumping his bones. 

You can't smell what you're surrounded by. I smoke and I *hate* the smell of smoke, it's bloody rancid, so even though I can't always smell it on my stuff, I wash them as often as possible.

Same with you and your jeans mate. You can't smell you because you are you.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; A small herd of elephants that were being complained about for over a decade yet the police did nothing.

As was the case with Saville. I'd heard the rumours myself decades ago, it was hardly a big secret. Same with the abuse in the church and care homes, Sinéad ripped that picture up on SNL over twenty years ago. 

Failings in the UK police to deal with child abuse are not proof of a great conspiracy to avoid ""offending"" Muslims.  This is the same police force that has been frequently proven to have racist elements who would have loved to have jailed these guys. 

&gt; Saville was grooming children and getting away with it. The BBC and the people of that era are now under major investigation for this huge cover up.

As are the other cases involving Muslim groups. I fail to see the disparity here. Attitudes to sexual abuse of children have changed massively in the last couple of decades. 

&gt; A lot more than ""two or three"", that's for sure.

Indeed but would you agree that it's quite clear that Muslims rape children in the UK far less than the rampant white-on-white sex abuse that is continually coming to light in our land?

Remember, this started with mention about how the EDL were using the Muslim cases to suggest that Islam is inherently evil. The hugely disproportionate coverage of those cases is quite disgusting in general and it's very clearly warped your perception of the issue.

&gt; They're not all from care homes. Many of these girls live with their parents. 

A large number are, you should look into it, the number of abuse victims who are in care is vastly higher than the overall number of kids in care. Children in that situation are very easy prey.

&gt; Fucking hell mate, just watch one documentary on these cases and you will actually understand the issue at hand.

I don't need to, I saw it myself growing up. 13 year old girls sleeping with 20 year old guys, witnessed both when my female peers were 13 and later when my male peers were 20. I remember the girls bragging about the ages of their boyfriends and that they had cars and then the comments about how seedy the 20 year old boys were. No one reported them to the police though, no one got jailed, not even when some of them got pregnant and had children. They were absolutely ""grooming"" them, ""plying"" them with booze and hash and the occasional e. 

I also personally know two girls who were abused by dozens of men when they were in state care during the 80s. One of them was abused by a couple of Muslim guys but there were also far more white men. Why should I watch interviews in a documentary when I've seen first hand the damage this can do to a person? Both girls have serious emotional issues now.

&gt; Burying your head in the sand when confronted with all this evidence. ""Well white people rape kids as well"" is a shitty excuse for ignoring this. 

Oh, do please go away. How can you twist my words to suggest that I advocate ignoring it?

Tommy Robinson and his followers where claiming that Muslims had a distinctive failing in that the want to rape children. They'd frequently mention Muhammed's wives. The entire argument falls flat on it's face when the numbers are brought out. 

IMHO the UK has a bit of a problem with child abuse in general. It's Friday night, why not take a walk through your local town centre right now where you'll see young girls hanging around with much older men? Somewhere near you a white guy in his 20s is giving drink to underage girls with the hope of having some form of sex with them. Where is your outrage? Where is the advocacy group to stop it? Why are YOU ignoring it?

&gt; and thanks to people like Tommy Robinson the police are finally cracking down on them.

It has very little to do with the EDL, the police have been forced to act across the entire board on the subject in general thanks to changes in public attitude. The media are covering it extensively because that's exactly what sells these days. Islamophobia also sells so these cases are pure win-win for them.

If we take that Hurt is the true 9th incarnation and that Tennant's aborted regeneration in ""Journey's End"" used up one of his lives as Moffat may have alluded to then that would make David and Matt the 12th and final lives of the Doctor respectively.

&gt;&gt;This summer, I traveled for the first time to England

Trololololol, or language barrier here? Do you mean you've been going to *a gym* for years and ""that one"" made you feel ""all cosy?""

&gt;In the evening I decided to check the city out, there were way less people so I thought it's much better than during the day. The town was packed with homeless people, sometimes harassing me, asking me for cigarettes, even if I wasn't smoking(I don't smoke), and 14-15 years old drunk teenagers asking me if I had something to sniff (drugs).

###Welcome To England

&gt;This was the night that made me book a flight back to Italy the next morning and get out of there. I will never again visit England. I know not everyone is like that and there are a lot of cities but the experience was so bad that I started to hate England and everything that has to do with it.

By making things more exam based (and more difficult in general), people who struggle with basic maths and English aren't suddenly going to become better, rather they will struggle. 

Osbourne and Cameron and friends seem to think that by making the courses more academically orientated, they will help those who aren't as good academically, which just won't work. Unless, of course, they actually don't really give a shit about those academically minded, and think it's best to leave them uneducated and ship them off into an apprenticeship at Poundland when they hit 18, which is the opinion I'm leaning towards.

Also, the bollocks they keep spouting about history GCSE and A-levels, saying that they need to be more chronological (even though they pretty much are), and need to be more about Britain (even though most of it is, and I don't want History to turn into 'Pro-British Propaganda', which they are obviously hinting towards), but that's a whole different matter.",0,1383348567,null,0,1383348774,0,cd4rrc3,t3_1poglp,t1_cd4rrc3,t1_cd4cfpj,null,1428894743,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For example calling Paulinho a defensive anchor is misleading considering he is a goalscoring midfielder

It claims we have had a favourable early schedule when in reality we have collected more points form these fixtures than we did last season and have had a more difficult fixture list than Arsenal and Liverpool and after tomorrows game, probably on par or slightly easier than the others. 

It also claims we got a penalty in the 89th minute penalty vs Palace which is obviously not true considering it was somewhere around the 60th minute...

'Little quality to these chances'... Not exactly true either (true in the game vs Hull), In games vs Cardiff, Norwich, Swansea and even Chelsea we creates plenty of good chances and probably should have scored more IMO

&gt; 'R310 RCF Ford Mondeo' is also concerned with the theme of the supply and sourcing of construction materials, and follows the journey of a Ford Mondeo car and its eventual manifestation as a recycled reinforcing bar within the Cabot Circus car park. The work pays homage to the fact that all the reinforcing steel used to construct the car park is 100% recycled. The car, purchased by Neville on E-bay, was driven to a scrap yard in Newport where it was de-polluted and shredded to become 680 kgs of steel which was then transported to Celsa, the Spanish-owned steelworks in Cardiff, where it was melted down and turned into a 32 mm re-bar. The cast number given to the steel scrap enabled it to be tracked to its final destination in a concrete column on the car park's third level where the Ford Mondeo's registration number 'R310 RCF' is inscribed into the column to mark its place.

See also [these photos](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/image_galleries/cabotcircus_apr08_gallery.shtml?9).

Also, I would say that it was almost certainly created at the time the concrete was poured, by adding the letters in relief to the mould used to form the column shape (rather than routed out afterwards).",0,1383350672,null,0,false,0,cd4sgec,t3_1ppxa6,t1_cd4sgec,t3_1ppxa6,null,1428894419,23,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,23

It is just some extra guidelines that mean 'Organic' food can't have been used with pesticides and are generally farmed more 'environmentally friendly' than the other. This makes little to no difference in the actual taste, size, and overall quality of the food.

Also, 'non organic' does not mean that it is genetically modified. Also, genetically modified food is perfectly fine. Why? Because that is essentially what farming has been doing for years. It is the equivalent of breeding dogs, the breeds change, get more specific, and have certain qualities that people find desirable in them.

With well placed and subtle knocks you can get the sheep to tap it's hooves in any pattern or rhythm you wish (very good reflexes, have sheep) and that will make noises on the floor. The more into it you get, you may want to experiment with augmenting the sound by placing the sheep upside down and suspending cymbals above its hooves; this is quite an advanced technique though.",0,1383352269,null,0,false,0,cd4sz9s,t3_1ppjca,t1_cd4sz9s,t1_cd4sonz,null,1428894174,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

If such a party couldn't win the vote, then the people aren't ready for socialism and socialists have no business trying to overthrow a representative democracy in order to implement an unrepresentative dictatorship of the minority.

Jumping straight to violence is reactionary and opportunist, direct democracy over the Internet would be truly revolutionary though.

&gt; Also, genetically modified food is perfectly fine. Why? Because that is essentially what farming has been doing for years. It is the equivalent of breeding dogs, the breeds change, get more specific, and have certain qualities that people find desirable in them.

From a less knee-jerk perspective of GM foods, the main issue people have the GM crops is that they are subject to intellectual property law. So, for example, Monsanto could modify a crop so that it produces 20x the amount of food. So, with more food, the population of the planet is allowed to grow. However, a few years down the line, Monsanto could decide that increasing demand would increase profits, so they begin selling less seeds, leading to widespread famine. It's an extreme example, but overall people don't like the idea of companies having such a tight grip over agriculture.

There's no way that's a certainty. Say we qualify - what's our goal for the season after going to be? Finish top 4 again - consolidate ourselves as a proper top 4 club and not let the return of CL football impact our league form. Alongside that, get out of the group stages of CL at the very least. 

In contrast, if he goes to Madrid, he'll be challenging for a league title, and aiming to make the semis of the CL at the very least. 

So even if we're back in the CL next season, we're probably still at least a further 2 seasons of uninterrupted progress away from being able to match Madrid's ambitions, and therefore the level of trophies available. Plus he probably prefers Spain to England - can't blame him for that - and even though we're Liverpool, Real Madrid has always had an appeal and a prestige that's hard to match. Also wages - Suarez has gotten a pay increase every season he's been with us, so it's not as if he's not conscious of the level of money his performances deserve.
