true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt;New Deal was a failure

No, it wasn't.  Many unscrupulous people were able to quickly setup small clusters of 'charities' that were staffed by nothing but New Dealer's and a 'supervisor' and reap that juicy £2,500 per person, per month.  Remembering to find fault with them at the 5 month mark so you can get fresh people in. 

So it was fabulously successful when it came to letting the actual scum bleed the system dry.  Not so much for actual ""getting people back in to work"" though.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"I agree. But I don't think it should be the basis for history lessons. They should be about a broad understanding. People should know 1066, 1215, 1805, 1914, 1982 etc. people should have a good understanding of each period of our history including recent history (Blair's years for example).

The academic analysis should be kept to a minimum to leave room for the wider general knowledge because that is far more important at their age. The way you want it done would leave kids very good at analysing political cartoons from the Edwardian period but ignorant of which countries actually made up our Empire, which ethnic groups make up the English people, why we have a Monarch as Head of State, how Parliament evolved from its humble beginnings, because that is what we've been left with after years of bad teaching.

To change topic slightly, there's a similar problem with geography. Kids are very good at understanding what a developing country is and why they're so poor, but ask one to point to Hull on a map and they'd have some trouble. Many would have trouble even drawing a map of Great Britain and labelling it with major cities. This is mostly the result of overly academic teaching rather than knowledge teaching.

I get what you're saying and I understand the reasoning behind it, but it has been proven to not work since most people don't have the will or interest to put the methods you've thought them to any use.

Foley was dreadful.

Sako was anonymous. Hardly ran for anything and at one point was content to stand and watch O'Hara wing the ball into no one instead of running into the box himself.

It has to be mixed up. We played a completely defensive team and as a result reaped nothing but a clean sheet from the game.

Unless you can secure a job quickly, I think that it would be worth staying in Sweden as (I believe) that social security is better there and have family/friends. You can still apply for jobs over here while in Sweden. It would help to know your qualifications and background to help more, as this will hugely effect what jobs you can reasonably hope to get. A degree in something would help, though there are plenty of unemployed graduates in the UK. A degree in economics, law, any science, computing or mathematics would be helpful, as these graduates are (generally) more employable. I would also advise utilizing the fact that you can (I assume) speak Swedish, which is very rare in the UK. This would set you up very well in translation services or in multinational organisations. Every multinational organisation particularly likes people with several languages.

I am in London and (obviously) would reccomend a big city: London, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Birmingham, Cardiff or Belfast. While cost of living is higher, there are more jobs which is important at the moment. There are also far more immigrants and it would be easy to find a Swedish pub/shop/restaurant (especially if you live in London).

I'd say it's like when 999 operators reveal the inappropriate ""emergency"" calls they've had in the previous year.  They're a bit of a laugh but they highlight an important area and probably make you think twice about getting an ambulance for a [paper cut](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/News/999-timewasters-hit-already-under-fire-ambulance-service-17122012.htm).

I definitely think it's a leap to say that encouraging people to go to their GP rather than A&amp;E will discourage people from going to their GP entirely.  The focus is on minor illnesses that aren't emergencies and should never be considered such.  Knee pain for three years?  Are you having a laugh?

You do raise a good point, there *are* issues with patients being unwilling to go to their doctor (the so-called [symptom iceberg](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21473756), where GPs only see a minority of the people with symptoms); indeed there are adverts at the moment trying to address this (""if you've had any of these symptoms, see your doctor).

Ivanovic and Terry as I feel they know each other a lot and have routine in big games. Azpi because i feel he has potential and Cole cuz he's the best.
Ramires on the right side as he's a very mobile player and would defend and attack well, like he did in CL 2012, I feel Moses could fit in this position as well. 
Mikel/Romeu as fearsome ball catchers and Lampard or Luiz as deep lying playmakers (Pirlostyle).

I don't think you would get him cheaply in the summer.
We was under contract until [2015](http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=1511071.html).
He got his extension because he earned himself a higher salary and not because his contract was close to end. 

And while it is true that Müller wasn't that happy during the sommer, I haven't spent 1 second thinking Bayern would let him go.

I am sure that Bayern would have reacted in the same way they did when Gomez and Ribery were a bit unhappy, too.

Eric was rocketed to Earth from the moon as a baby, and gained his powers because the crescent moon resembles a banana. Bananaman resembles Superman in two respects. Firstly, he has a kryptonite-style weakness to mouldy bananas. Furthermore, he even has a Fortress of Solitude-style building at the North Pole, made out of a giant banana. During early board meetings, the designers thought of the aspect of Bananagirl to accompany the series. The girl would have been called Margaret Wimp, and be the ""sister"" of Eric. This idea was scrapped later on in production, because the concept of two children being related without parents would be too far-fetched for children to understand, however the idea was revived for a Beano comic strip.

In the 1991 Dandy Annual, Bananaman's origin was changed to that of being a normal Earth baby in a maternity hospital, who obtained his powers after unintentionally eating a banana in which General Blight had hidden a stolen supply of Saturnium (presumably similar to uranium, neptunium or plutonium), and accidentally left it next to Eric. However, later issues referred to the first origin as the real one.

true,Annaeus,cnty-expat,Flashbacks to my time in 'Nam,"Three reasons:

Firstly, simple economics. Money is inherently worthless, its only value is in what it can buy, and with the exception of raw materials such as land, everything that has value involves the application of human labour. The problem is not lack of money, it is lack of value in the economy. But people aren't going to work without being paid, and they're not going to get paid unless someone else spends money to buy what they produce. So there must be spending, which begets more spending, and so on and so forth. The problem right now is that nobody is spending because there is no certainty that they will be able to earn money to replace what they spend. The only entity large enough and powerful enough to create spending through fiat alone, rather than by 'encouraging confidence' in others, is the government. Therefore, the government must spend, so people can work and spend themselves, requiring more work, more value, and more spending.

Secondly, austerity has been tried, and is failing. In spite of the UK's 'success' in implementing its austerity program, it has not had the expected effects - in fact, as the ever-extending predictions for how long austerity will be required, it seems to be making things worse. Greece's austerity program is producing civil unrest, and the complete abandonment of the Euro in some areas and its replacement with bartering.

Thirdly, a recession of this length and depth is rare, and the only other comparable instance in the modern world is the great depression - and the solution then was borrow and spend. Even Germany's solution was massive government spending; the economic success was significant even if the other consequences were, shall we say, less desirable.

That being said, I am not certain that this is entirely the correct approach as you suggest. Economics is too complex to be certain about anything; I just happen to think that this is a better solution, and more likely to succeed, than austerity.",0,1358704100,null,0,false,0,c80bz9y,t3_16tf4e,t1_c80bz9y,t1_c80b7ym,null,1431022530,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Perhaps we can only ask ""who is the greatest of x generation, unless, of course, you're over 65 years old and have been supporting, and watching the team forever. I wonder who THEY would name, the greatest?

Personally: there's nothing he can do to match Dalgish. My favourite players to watch: Craig Johnson, Peter Beardsley, Michael Owen, Alan Hansen.

Defoe's goal scoring is drying up, and as someone mentioned - when he's not scoring he's a real hinderance to the team. Dempsey works very hard (and took his goal well today), but if we're being brutally honest (I know he scored, but come on...) he's maybe not got the creativity needed to unlock defences (like aModric/VdVaart etc). Maybe if he was playing with someone other than Defoe.

Looking back at the game against QPR and today both teams sat deep without the ball and made it hard to get in behind them with pace (our normal source of goals.) Without another creative player or an out-and-out striker we might struggle. It's reasonable to assume that outside of Arsenal, Man City, and Chelsea most teams will adopt a similar approach to Man U and QPR in an attempt to stifle our attacking threat.

More positively: the midfield was brilliant, Parker &amp; Dembele worked very hard, Lennon was Motm and although Bale had a quiet game he looked a lot better when he had BAE supporting him with overlaps. Dawson was solid at the back and had great distribution, he seemed very comfortable on the ball despite the weather. Walker is still making mistakes, but he can only get better.

This might sound bad but I think Moyes deserves better than the cursed tenure of the Chelsea managerial seat. If Moyes comes I think he's going to come with a plan. What it is I don't know, but I think it's going to be long term with a vision for the future and a plan to utilize our young players in the first team and on loan.

I worry that if his plan doesn't mean silverware in his first season, or if it means working the knots out of a new vision for the club it's going to mean Moyes will be out on his ass.

I get it, Chelsea is a top tier club. We aren't Bottomham and we're not Arsenal. We don't treat a fourth place finish like winning a trophy. But, people are critical of how quick Chelsea (Roman) is to throw the baby out with the bathwater. 

We say it every time there's a new skipper, ""Hopefully this brings stability"". But if bringing in Moyes means he's not going to be given a fair shot unless we sit on top of the table for 30+ weeks I'd just rather him stay at Everton.

Don't worry about this situation too much. Just persevere. Everyone I know who was here as an international student found the rest of my tribe to be a mix of friendly or unfriendly depending who you talk to. 

Being assertive and cheery will actually be refreshing to people, I'd say. 

Manchester slang often replaces double 'tt' with 'kh' - so 'bokhle' for 'bottle' - or gets rid of it altogether - so 'bo'uhl' for 'bottle'. 

The 'g' gets dropped off the end of verbs, so for example *cookin'* for *cooking*, *dancin'* for *dancing*, etc. 

Also the 'a' in 'dancing' would be like the 'a' in Dan, as opposed the 'ar' in car.  

Mate = Bro. 'Cunt' can sometimes be affectionate here, which has caused some misunderstandings with Americans in my experience. 

There's a system of social respect between males in the north of England which has a lot to do with being someone who listens, and making sure you don't talk over people. Unfortunately it also involves a ban on any conversation seen as too 'pretentious', or 'intellectual'. Don't worry about this, but do bear it in mind if someone has an inexplicable problem with you.

Drinking beers or ciders will be seen as more trustworthy than drinking wine. 

If someone winds down a car window and asks you if you know about the BBC it might mean 'big bag of coke', i.e. do you want to buy some. You definitely don't. Likewise people trying to sell pills on the street. I'm always surprised how many people fall for this.       

Person in ghetto gear + several of them + they're coming over and trying to strike up a conversation and being weirdly over-friendly = be wary, some people like to fuck with 'foreigners'. 

On the other hand, person who happens to be in ghetto gear = is just a person, this is fairly standard manchester style, does not signify that they want to mug you or anything like that. 

Deansgate Locks area is glossy, cheap and full testosterone, if you're drinking there keep your guard up. Northern Quarter is where graphic designers and people in bands live. Rusholme is great people and great food + some young guys who like acting hard, so if you're going to be there at night, it can be best to be on the safe side and go as part of a group. Fallowfield is a sort of jungle gym for drunk students.

If you feel up to the challenge, do some reading first. Find out what to expect and what's different. Television in 1963 bears absolutely no resemblance to television in 2012 (or even 2005, believe it or not). 

There have been *many, many people* who get on such a *Doctor Who* buzz that they wake up at the crack of dawn and say ""I'm going to go all the way back to the beginning and watch the very first episode of *Doctor Who*!""

Ten minutes into Episode 1 of *An Unearthly Child*, with its slow pace, theatre acting, bizarre incidental music and completely different characterization of the Doctor, their attention wanders. By the time they hear the TARDIS materialization sound for the first time, they've spent more time on Facebook than they have watching the episode. 

If you still want to do it, there are hundreds of resources to help you along - this place, /r/gallifrey, Wikipedia, the TARDIS Wiki, the Outpost Gallifrey forums, etc.

My personal recommendation would be to start with the Third Doctor. All his stories still exist, the pacing is slightly better, and the characterization is a shade more in line with what you're probably used to now.

Originally to keep the peace.... Which is ironic in this case.

This was mentioned to point out that 

1. The law doesn't work - no one obeys it anyway (morally why should they ?) It make the law in general look silly as the law is not police-able.

2. The damage of prohibition  - as there is no legal avenue to purchase cannabis I have to fund criminals to buy it.

So what if I repeatedly break this (non) law ? How is society suffering ? Its not with the exception of the fact that criminals get funded which is because of the stupid law. 

The times in 1967 started a campaign to legalize cannabis, signed by no less than the Beatles.

http://www.beatlesbible.com/1967/07/24/the-beatles-call-for-the-legalisation-of-marijuana/

'The law against marijuana is immoral in principle and unworkable in practice.'  

Nothing has changed in that respect.

I think of the law on cannabis now as immoral as law against homosexuality in the 50/60's - The state has no business interfering in your personal life if you are not harming society.

&gt; Met investigates guesthouse child abuse claims

&gt; Tom Watson called for an investigation into the political links of Peter Righton in October
Police have begun an investigation into historical allegations of child abuse at a south-west London guesthouse. Operation Fernbridge will examine claims that a 1980s paedophile ring, with links to the then government, [edit: say it! Say Tory MPs you cowards!!] abused boys at Elm Guest House, Barnes. Last year MP Tom Watson called for an investigation into the political links of convicted paedophile Peter Righton.

&gt; Righton worked as a consultant to the National Children's Bureau until his arrest in 1992. A week ago police working for a scoping exercise, Operation Fairbank, took boxes of documents from the London home of Mary Moss, who worked as an advocate for abused children at the now defunct National Association for Young People in Care. Ms Moss said the documents contained evidence that senior figures from a number of political parties had abused children at Elm Guest House and elsewhere.

&gt; There is no suggestion that Ms Moss is herself under investigation. Elm Guest House is now a private residence and the current occupants are not connected to the allegations. Operation Fernbridge will be led by the Metropolitan Police Service's Child Abuse Investigation Command.

Team:
GK:Cech; RB: Azpilicueta RCB: Terry LCB: Cahill LB: Cole

Subs:
Ivanovic (for rb/cb position)

Moses (for lm/lcm position) /romeu (for cdm position)
Oscar/marin (for cam/lcm position)
torres (for striker/cam position)
bertrnd (for lb, lcb position)

main strategy:
 
mikel to go deep to help terry and cahill. azpi to stay wide to stop cross from right. cole to go front to help up with early crosses. ramires to play box to box freely. lampard to play holding midfielder. hazard to come in to cover lampard during defense and move to wings while attacking. mata to play the ball and create chances. dembe ba to play target man the way drogba used to. 

tactical sub strategy:
luiz go in to replace terry or bertrand replaces cole, oscar/marin replace lampard, torres replaces mata. in that case, torres to move up to cf position, and oscar/marin to act as playmaker. mikel to play holding midfielder, ramires to move to more central location to help mikel and save energy (considering terry, lampard and cole are old so playing them full 90 minutes will be a problem)

i do the similar strategy in fifa13 too and it works even during sims. i do want to play luiz in first 11, but he does not fit well for cdm over mikel and cahill is much better than him for cb position.

For cards sold in the run-up to Christmas (ie most of them) the supermarkets probably haven't paid HMV yet, and will make a strong case that they shouldn't have to. So they get to look like the good guys but it doesn't cost them anything.

Also, the money is given back is store vouchers, and as it was a gift people will spend them on extra things they might not otherwise have bought. So, free money.

In addition, people might have a case for claiming them anyway, and it would cause a PR shitstorm whatever. Certainly one could ask why they were selling HMV cards when they must have known the how risky a purchase it was.

Plus in terms of playing style Gerrard and Kroos are completely different, especially the Gerrard of old.

One of the few players that comes close to replicating a younger Gerrard, IMO, is Kevin De Bruyne. He's not as direct as Gerrard, but he's a much better dribbler and has a left foot to boot ^ba ^dum ^tss. De Bruyne shares more similarities than differences with Gerrard though, specifically the fact that he has [a fucking rocket for a shot](http://youtu.be/MkRnyS17EFY?t=1m4s). He also shares a similar level of ability in his passing range, passing accuracy, vision, and crossing ability that Gerrard has.

Unfortunately they're not his best games this year, but it's all I could find after a quick search, and it gives you an idea about his overall game.

He started out as winger/AM hybrid at Genk, transfered to Chelsea, and was then loaned out to Werder Bremen where he has played as a CAM and CM for them, as one of the 2 attacking mids in Bremen's single pivot 3 man midfield. He's also shown the ability to be able to make the transition to a deeper role, but he would have to get better defensively if that were to happen. Quite honestly, he's my perfect AM and I'm really fucking jealous that Chelsea have him. Hopefully they get another CAM in the summer, like Isco, and create a logjam at that position forcing him to transfer to another team for playing time, with that other team being us, although all of this is highly unlikely and will probably never happen ^but ^I ^can ^dream .",0,1358718499,null,0,false,0,c80gdgx,t3_16xfdg,t1_c80gdgx,t1_c809t9c,null,1431024653,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Because if it's the latter, as soon as HMV's administrators announce they're not accepting gift cards, arguably the goods are no longer fit for purpose.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"It's interesting for me to watch a new fan base react to Henry and Werner. There have been a lot of questions: 1) Will FSG spend money on big players? 2) How does FSG approach team building? 3) Are they here to stay?

Here are my answers:

1) Yes, they absolutely will. I feel like Liverpool fans have been nervous that Liverpool will become less and less attractive because FSG is stingy, but I'm telling you that this is not the case. They are simply very patient and will not spend if the price is not right. They will overspend on occasion if they are really in love with a player, they simply will not grossly overpay as we just saw with Sneijder.

Here's an example: about 3 years ago there was a bidding war for Mark Texiera, an all star 1st baseman. It was basically only the Red Sox and the Yankees who could afford him, and the price got so high that Henry finally said, ""He's incredibly valuable, but this is too much.""

*The next season* Alex Gonzalez emerged as just as good of a first baseman as Texiera, and the Red Sox were able to get him for less money since the Yankees had already filled the position for a hefty price the year before. 

So FSG is very calculating and patient, but I want to reassure Liverpool fans that yes, John Henry is rich as hell and will absolutely spend when the time is right. My dream is that they're positioning for Alonso in the summer, but I think we're all hoping for that :)

2) As you can see, FSG is obsessed with youth and spotting talent very early, *keeping* the talent you have (Wisdom, Sterling, Gerrard) but one thing that hasn't been talked about yet is how stat-oriented the owners are. They brought a lot of innovation to baseball by looking at new ways to evaluate a player's impact on both sides of the ball.

I actually believe that football has some work to do in this regard. Scoring is so difficult - it either takes a string of brilliant play or a massive error - that it's hard to just look at goals as a measure of a player's worth. You've seen clubs start to look at ""chances created"" and other such metrics, and I think FSG will continue to innovate here and spot talent where others don't. We can already see how wrong Chelsea was about Sturridge imo.

FSG also does have a strong sense of tradition. They completely renovated historic Fenway Park (built 1912, not quite as old as Anfield) and the fans are very pleased with the work. They pay extra to make sure that icons retire with the club. I guarantee you Gerrard and Carra will retire in red.

3) Honestly, I have no idea. FSG really enjoys owning sports franchises, but it's unclear whether it will translate into a long term passion. We'll have to wait and see, but I'm a Liverpool supporter for life regardless.

Baseball has no spending limits at all. If you want to spend $200 million, you just pay a small luxury tax, which doesn't stop the top teams like FSG's Red Sox from buying almost whatever they want.

Once you're spending at a high level, it's up to your organization to evaluate players and build a strong academy (or minor leagues in the MLB) and that's how you succeed.

&gt;Censorship is harmful in some cases, but in others it helps.

I disagree.

&gt;but films, music and video games are censored in an effort to shield children from stuff they shouldn't know about.

I take no issue with video games or movies being restricted to adults only - but that is not what happened in this case. In this case, a man is being prosecuted for posting a video. That is wrong. There is no moral justification for that. That video does no harm. What happened in the video did, but the video itself is harmless and to prosecute a man for that is absolutely terrible.

&gt;In this case, the guy was posting the videos on Facebook, where children or vulnerable people could see it.

Oh so you're going with the *think of the children* excuse eh?

I've got a plan, how about we get rid of sharp knives? I mean, kids *could* access them, and sometimes do. Lets ban them. Lets also ban cars. Kids sometimes joyride by stealing cars. Lets ban them too.

No? Right, yeah, that's a thought, parents have to be parents. It's not my fault there are kids in the world, why should my choices be restricted because there are? Lets ban Nietzsche, I mean fuck if I'd been exposed to those ideas at 12 I might have just topped myself, powerful stuff that it is.

Yet we don't, do we? Your argument is disgusting because it's based on the emotive attachment we have to children and the vulnerable without realising that members of our society have a responsibility to them but that that does not extend to limiting ourselves.

You're supporting tyranny here, you're going to chuckle at that term, because you think ""it's no big deal, this is just some video"" but that's exactly what you're supporting. You're saying that someone in our society should elevate themselves above me, and above you, and say ""no, these people must not watch this, i have decided that they may not, and its for their own good"" - that's tyranny.

For me, us finishing higher up the league is more important than our 'enemies' doing better.  
  
I think holding a grudge to the point where wishing the results go against them where it would also hinder our progress is a bit much.  
  
I want City, United and Chelsea to be winning all their games too, not just the ones against the other big rivals. If we hit a slump we need all the other in-reach (both above and below in the table) to be doing poorly.  
  
My brief ideal scenario is:  
  
All the out-of-reach top 3 teams win every game remaining except against us.
All the in-reach teams lose to the lower teams, and draw when playing each other (max points ""against"" us = 2 instead of 3)  
Roughly the bottom 5 teams in the league are always winning (whoever is at the bottom).  
  
For Liverpool to get 4th this season, we need to have a second half of the season that is over 7 points better off than all the teams above us, not just one team slumping.

Honestly, my dream is to get enough money to buy back the house I grew up in and maybe open up a small corner shop like there was when I grew up.


God the memories I had, where everyone in the village would have a big fete on the village green with communal BBQ, and everyone would sit on the hill and have their picture taken.

Pretty much; it's part of the form you fill out when you get a mortgage.

The way I see it, GCSEs are important for your A levels, your A levels are important to get into uni, and uni is important for getting a job (assuming you want to go to uni; clearly it's not the only route in life nor is it the only way to get a job. Assume I'm talking about medicine or veterinary those of you who wish to protest the uni/job issue cause that's a whole different topic).

So if you get a low mark in Biology, then your school may not let you do Biology A level, and if you want to become a doctor then you're screwed (in terms of that route in anyway).  

Of course, you can go other routes into jobs and still have a good life, but I'd say try not to fail so you can keep your options open.

My goal is to change your mind.

&gt;I just think that this is dangerous material which should be minimised from the public view as much as possible.

By force or by encouragement? By encouragement I can live with. By force, I can not. You're saying minimised. Censorship does not minimise, it takes away completely. Censorship does not say ""Well, this isn't that good so we won't run adverts for it"", it bans something. Completely. 100%. It tries to erase an artefact from society on the basis that a small portion of that society can dictate what is good the rest of that society.

&gt;There's no political aim to it, I like our country the way it is now, i don't want it to get more censored.

Maybe so, but you don't seem to want there to be *less* censorship, which if you respected your fellow citizen you would.

Now don't get me wrong, I think the average citizen in this country is pretty dumb, not politically aware in the slightest, don't even get me started on philosophical knowledge. But the solution to a lack of knowledge is not less knowledge and information and discussion, even if we don't *like* an in particular piece of knowledge, more of it can only ever be a good thing. The more people experience, develop, understand, think, even if they're thinking ""my god this video is horrible"" - hey, maybe some of them will go out and learn about human rights. They *might* do that if they see a horrible video, they *won't* if that video is banned. Add it all together and you get to the inevitable conclusion that censorship is *always* bad. It's *always* one person deciding they know what is best for another, which necessitates the idea that some people shouldn't truly be free, shouldn't really get to make their own decisions because the people in charge have decided they can't be trusted to make the *right* decisions.

Does that sound like freedom to you? Because, it doesn't to me. That's not what I want. For me, for you, or for any other adult in this country.

Forward 1 year got A and B at at A level.

Was told to apply to uni and got entry for Aston. Told them I wasn't interested as they's rejected me (bitter and stupid? Moi?) previously. Went to shitty poly.

Got a cool degree, lost my virginity. Got a 13k job (1990) in whatever the milk round. Was made redundant 9 months later. So blagged my self into a 20k (1991) job for three years. Made redundant (they offered me 6 months money) so wanked on UB40 for 6 months. 

Got a contract earning 20/hour. 6 months later got a contract earning 1300/week. Fas forward 5 years earnhing 50/hour. Fast forward another 10 years. Had kids, blah blah. Been unemployed a few times (2 recessions). Did some Y2k. Saved nothing (LOL - stupid? Moi?)

Now living a few minutes from sandy beach in Auckland, still programming and work from home when I like, or office 10 mins away.

Only one regret - should have gone Uni and not Poly to study physics not computing. ho hum.

true,Beleza,lfc12,,"My 2 cents. Keep in mind many of these outs require someone coming in so we can keep our already (Semi-limited) squad depth intact.

**On Loan**

Coates - He NEEDS to be playing every week if he is going to develop into the player we all know he can be. It's important he plays every week and comes up against different attackers and makes mistake so he can learn how to deal with any situation he may encounter.

Suso - We all can see he has great potential but as said above, he needs to be playing at a lower level where he can work on that final pass.

**Sell**

Pacheco - He just isn't going to break through into the first team. He has had plenty of chances and if 4 managers can't quite find a role for him, I don't know who will. I think he deserves to be playing some first team football, preferably in his native Spain.

Downing - Yeah, he has been solid in the last couple games but he just isn't a BR attacking player. A player of his wages (I'm not sure what they are but I imagine they aren't cheap) could be put towards a much more capable player. However, I'd prefer we have an immediate replacement lined up just to make sure we don't get too short on squad depth.

Assaidi - Strong rumors he is off to Ajax who wanted him in the first place. I don't think he is going to make it at Anfield and lets cash in on him now. I know he hasn't been given a big chance and it takes time to adjust but he is just such an odd signing. I'd love to be proved wrong and have him score a hat-trick every game. 

Carroll &amp; Spearing - Neither really have a place here anymore, that much is obvious. I'm not sure what else to say.

**Other**

Doni - Already gone IMO. If he did come back i'm sure we'll send him back to Brazil on a free. Brad Jones is a fine backup and we're looking at some younger keeps to come in soon. 

Carragher - I wouldn't mind if he stuck around another season. Obviously he has lost the pace but he is a good personality and can really help mentor younger players.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"It's actually a bit more complicated than that. It's not only about shots on goal and the amount that go in. One could argue that hey, if we're truly taking 500 shots on goal, looks like we've got our strikeforce sorted out! We just need to improve on the positioning of those shots yeah? It's not going to make sense to simply cite accurate shots on goal as a reason to get another striker.

Let me give you an HONEST reason for why we're not netting as many as we should. The problem is Defoe.

* He makes no run.
* He doesn't get into half decent positions.
* He takes shots primarily from distance.
* He's not willing to adapt his game.

It's crazy. We have a striker in Defoe who is at the peak of his fitness, he plays week in week out, runs around like a madman when he is on the ball or is making a run, but doesn't adapt to what Spurs need.

Spurs need a poacher. Defoe CAN be one, but he's not willing to. He WANTS to be a striker who shoots from distance, who nibbles past players, when we ALREADY HAVE players in Bale, Lennon, Dembele, Dempsey who can shoot from distance and can nibble past players. We need someone they can PASS to or put through and they all have the ability to do that.

Defoe's an impact sub at best. When we need 200 shots on goal in the last 20 minutes because we're drawing or losing, he'd be great to get on because he'd riddle the goal with shots since he'll come on with all that energy. But from the off, he's annoying to have on.

Those shots that you're talking about, 60% are Defoe shooting as soon as he gets on the ball, 25% are Bale shooting from 40 yards because he has no one to pass to and the rest are legit shots that get us goals or saves.

We need a finisher.",0,1358735965,null,0,false,0,c80ly8k,t3_16yion,t1_c80ly8k,t3_16yion,null,1431027364,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"Great questions! It's strange now since things in Boston and Liverpool are somewhat linked since they're spending from the same pool of money. Since I think Liverpool fans will find this interesting, here's a history of what FSG has done in Boston since its purchase in 2002.

There are really two baseball teams that matter: the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees (think Real Madrid and Barcelona). They are almost always #1 and #2 in spending, although the damn Yankees always spend more and are always #1 (around $200 million a year, compared to $55 million for the cheapest team). 

The teams and their fan bases absolutely hate each other, and for a century the Red Sox were the whipping boy. They choked at every turn, most famously in the 1986 World Series when [Bill Buckner let a ground ball through his legs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8sNBxf1NC8). For those of you who don't know baseball, all he had to do was catch a slow roller and step on the base to win the entire championship. This is the equivalent of a goalkeeper accidentally kicking a ball into his own goal to lose the Champions League final (not an exaggeration).

When FSG took over in 2002, the Red Sox had not won a World Series since 1918, despite being essentially a top five team for most of that time. FSG immediately brought in a brilliant young general manager (managing director) who started signing players based on stats that other people weren't looking at. We grew a lot of talent through our minor league system (academy) which saved a lot of money, and didn't get trapped in long term deals with aging stars looking for pension money. We also employed a new system: started teaching *incredibly* patient plate discipline and good defense, and we became brilliant evaluators of talent. Signings were all working out, and things started to click. The turnaround was so drastic, the Red Sox won two world series in 2004 and 2007.

**Now finally to your question** and you can just skip here if this rant has been way too long. In recent years FSG got overexcited and way overspent on stars which simply did not work out. They gambled on big stars who had just come off of injuries, and gave long deals to inconsistent players. In 2011 The team had an historic collapse and became the only team in history to fail to make the playoffs with a 9 game lead going into September. The new manager FSG hired in 2012 was a smart guy but an awful people person, and caused more problems than he solved, leading to another down year.

Astoundingly, in the biggest August deal in baseball history, FSG was able to dump all of these underperforming stars onto the Dodgers, getting rid of $120 million overnight and spending it on new, younger players. They still have some of that money left to spend though, and fans are waiting to see what they do with it, which may not happen this year.

Basically after last year the fans all want the Red Sox to go back to the old model of evaluating young talent and spending a lot of money *wisely* instead of a lot of money stupidly. FSG wholeheartedly agrees, and it may mean spending some of that money next year which will be a better year for free agents (more player contracts expiring in the transfer window).

So FSG made a mistake: it overspent wildly instead of relying on its old model of smart spending (which does not mean stingy spending). They made some interesting moves in the offseason but most fans understand that it will take another season to burn off the fat of our mistakes. Not all of us can spend our way out of *every* problem like the Yankees can. We will spend out of most of them though :)

Hopefully this offers some insight into how FSG operates and how they've learned on the fly. Despite recent stumbles, they've been wildly successful with 2 championships and have shown a willingness to both spend money and adapt quickly.

To anyone who downvotes just for the length, I completely understand and my apologies :P

It's really interesting to see that there seems to be similarities in spending patterns for both teams around the same time frame since they've been in charge of both Boston and Liverpool.  Wildly overspending on inconsistent players for Liverpool around the same time that the Red Sox's mega-rich players started to slide, leading to both teams spending more wisely in recent months.

I'm actually *fairly* familiar with baseball and the Red Sox history, but obviously not even in the same league as your knowledge of LFC.  I used to live in the States and one of my best friends went to Emerson and thus became a semi-serious Red Sox fan, so I've picked up bits here and there from him.  I definitely didn't know enough about the recent history though, particularly the reasons for their poorer form in the last year or two, as I moved back to the UK last year.

Thanks again for your answer, really interesting read.

That's kind of what I was getting at when I said we need striker who are better at both making the right decision and executing. If the shot's not on, don't take it just for the sake of it.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Yeah, I agree with them learning from their mistakes.  Not going to lie, I was quite disillusioned with them after the transfer deadline day debacle in August, but after some time I could see their reasons.  We blew lots of money on players who were not worth nearly as much as we thought (although Henderson is improving dramatically and so is Downing on a smaller scale, but he's older and has less future potential growth), so of course FSG will be reluctant to part with the cash unless the right deal for the right player comes along at the right time.  Sturridge is exactly that player; he may be the best signing we've made in years.  

I hate allowing myself to get too excited about the situation though, especially after a big win like yesterday or our other wins this season, because so often they're followed by a loss.  We also have Arsenal and City away in the next couple of weeks, so I'm not raising my hopes too high, but would be very happy with 3 points from those 2 matches.  But to be honest, losses to the bigger teams don't seem to hurt me as much this year.  I was gutted when we lost to United last week, but not AS gutted as usual.  We showed signs of quality, especially with Sturridge on the pitch.  We're definitely going through a transitional period, so hopefully with another couple of smart signings either by the end of January or over the summer we'll be much better situated to push on for the top-4 next season.

Some clubs, not naming names, but they reside in West London, seem to operate with the exact opposite philosophy to us.  It's all about throwing money at a problem and managers and players hoping they don't fall victim to the capriciousness of the execs.

I got nervous after the August deadline as well, but actually NOT because FSG didn't spend money, but because I could tell that they WANTED to and deals fell through unexpectedly. I think they clearly let Carroll go to free up space because a replacement deal was imminent. Then when it fell through it was too late! I'm chalking it up to a rookie mistake as an organization new to the game, but I hope they make one more interesting signing before the end of this month to make up for it.

And good point about that certain West London club. FSG has been dealing with this kind of opponent in the Yankees for a decade. It's frustrating when your mistakes hurt and your opponents just buy their way out of problems.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I think its safe to say that we do need to look at a striker.  The frustrating part is that we have all been saying this for 4-5 windows and we still are in the same boat.

Now i understand the principles of ""soccernomics"" and how it applies to transfers and i know that Levy &amp; Co. are believers in these principles. These principles are:

1. New managers waste money, ergo, limit their say in transfers. (*so far, Check*)

2.Draw opinion from several people from different backgrounds. (*we have been doing this for a few seasons, Check*)

3.Avoid stars of recent international tournaments. (*We seem to do this regularly. Check*)

4.Avoid certain nationalities (e.g. Brazilian, Dutch) as they are overpriced. (*We seem to dodge the dutch, but Belgians and French aren't exactly cheap nationalities at the moment*)

5.Buy players in their early twenties; older players are overvalued and youngsters aren’t fully developed. (*check*)

6.Sell a player either before buyers see deterioration in his game or when a club offers more than he’s worth. (*check*)

**7.Replace your best players before selling.** (*not great at this*)

**8.Never buy strikers because they are overpriced; develop them instead.** (*not great at this*)

9.Buy players with personal problems , then help them deal with their issues. (*Ade? Check*)

10.Help new players relocate. (*We seem to do alright with this, Check*)

These are actually good ways to run your transfers, problem is we aren't great at replacing our best players and we seem to have **NO CLUE** how to develop a front line striker. True Kane could be something but we just don't know at the moment and we don't have any ""in house"" strikers on the team.

So we aren't developing strikers, we aren't spending on strikers and our scouts don't seem to be finding strikers.  Think about it, when we were in the CL we supposedly targeted Aguero, Llorrente and Rossi and didn't bid enough. Since then who have been our targets at striker?  Primarily Llorrente, Remy and Damiao.  We seemed to have soured on Remy, Llorrente doesn't seem to want to play for us and neither does Damiao, and even our newest target Abaumeyang seems annoyed by us.  Who are our other targets?  Why don't we seem to add any more targets to the list?  More importantly aside from Coulibaly why don't we seem to be looking at young strikers to buy cheap and develop on our own? 

We seem incapable of doing anything with strikers and now we are one niggling hamstring away from having an absolute fiasco on our hands.  Holtby is great business and will help us if we can get him in, Diame (the new rumor) would be cheap cover for Scotty and Sandro also good business. But striker? nothing.  A major need and we don't seem to be chasing anything that we can take care of.  Why aren't we chasing Bony, Van Wolfswinkel, Soldado, one of Real's youth strikers? Why can't we take our skill of finding and signing midfielders and apply it to striker?

Obvious way to abuse it - phone someone before breaking in. They now can't make an emergency call - at least not on the landline.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Yeah, it's the thing that anarchists say that tends to freak more people out than any other - abolish private property, property is theft, etc.  In actual fact, what Proudhon said was property is robbery, and he also said it was freedom and that it was impossible too, so he was clearly arguing something a bit more profound than rich people are thieving bastards (What Is Property isn't the easiest anarchist classic though, so I'd start elsewhere if the urge to learn more comes upon you).  

So, why do anarchists oppose private property?  We argue that taking a part of the earth, which is absolutely scarce and our common heritage, for one's personal, permanent and exclusive use is not only tantamount to theft, it is in fact identical to it - and, because it is achieved through the force of the State, it is actually robbery.  

But further, consequences flow from this robbery, in the form of hierarchies and coercive relations between people - it blocks people from accessing the materials they need to live and work independently and forces them into selling their labour - ultimately it destroys freedom.

So, what is private property?  (You knew I'd get around to it! ;-))  Private property is the grant by the State (or King or Dictator, etc.) of exclusive domain over scarce and necessary things to the exclusion and disempowerment of others - effectively fee simple and alloidal title.  Principally over land, but also covering large workplaces, means of production, distribution networks, etc.  It's contrasted with possession which is the usufructuary right to use property.  Although an anarcho-communist rather than a mutualist, Iain Mckay addresses the distinction fairly succinctly in his letter to [Liberty](http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/anarchism/property.html).

Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continue to be debated in Britain's newspapers: on 4 October 2005 Alan Davies told The Daily Telegraph that Eccleston had been ""overworked"" by the BBC, and had left the role because he was ""exhausted"".[11] Ten days later, Eccleston told the Daily Mirror this was not true, and expressed some irritation at Davies for his comments.[12] In a 2010 interview, Eccleston revealed that he left the show because he ""didn't enjoy the environment and the culture that the cast and crew had to work in"", but that he was proud of having played the role.[13]

From Wikipedia.

He doesn't hate fans or act like dicks to them, and he doesn't hate DW, he just didn't enjoy working with that crew but is very glad that he did. Please stop whining about Eccleston because nobody but Davies, Eccleston, and the crew know the full story aside from what I posted.

That's... not quite what it's saying. Well. It is. But it isn't. Oversimplification, I guess? 

It might be that it's something you have to experience to really understand. I know I experienced it. (I knew my current SO for years as a vague acquaintance and didn't feel any attraction to him, but after accidentally being ""forced"" to spend one weekend together with him I realized that I didn't want to leave his side.

I'd also look into places like reed.co.uk and monster.co.uk for other bilingual jobs. Polish your CV (kan skicka mallen jag använde för mitt CV om du vill) and upload it. 

Now, recruitment agencies over here do not work the same as Manpower in Sweden. If they think your CV looks nice for a position they have available they will call you and, depending on the job, you will work directly for the company they are recruiting for. None of that ""tillsvidareanställning/vikariat"" stuff. 
I suggest you start looking at those sites before you do anything else.

This is so, so true. He really needs his confidence back, at Chelsea it just seems like he hesitates to go alone or go for a shot or something like that. He gets a lot of stick from the Chelsea fans so he's consistently pressured to perform better, which makes him seem more nervous overall.

true,hobbesoxon,null,null,"Good questions!  I'm an engineer, but it's been four years since I was a student (now tutoring).  That said,

1. The workload helps, oddly.  You learn to prioritise, be effective, and *get things done*.  This is a hugely useful life skill.

2. I've lived in Oxford for nine years now, and could happily stay here.  It's beautiful, has a great life to it, and is close to London for the odd week-end.

3. Living in London is tough.  Tough!  Living in Oxford is gentle and sweet.  No comparison, for me.

4. See #1: it induces hard work, but, afterwards, you struggle to imagine how it could be any different.  The idea is that the breaks between terms are longer, during you are encouraged to consolidate your learning from the previous term (in time for Collections when you return - informal examinations, which don't go towards your final degree mark, but which do help a ton in improving your understanding).

5. See #4.  Also, the breaks (""vacs"") are supposed to be time for you to do something interesting.  Internships.  Exploring.  Getting away from it all.  Your college tutors usually help with getting Internships, and these are gold-dust on the CV these days.

6. Plenty of colleges let you ""live in"" for all four years.  Otherwise, it's down to renting privately with some friends.  Both are fun.  ""Living out"" is a useful life experience. ;)

7. Everyone loves Engineering Science.  Especially employers!

8. Maybe one afternoon per week, but it's there to help you understand the course.  Build a modem.  Program a mouse to navigate a maze.  Etc.

9. I stayed on for a doctoral degree (DPhil) and was won over by the academic life.  Engineering Science puts you in the perfect place to decide.  Plenty go on to the City, but also plenty go on to become good researchers.

10. Easily.  The Oxford undergrad course has very strong links with industry, including Rolls-Royce (who bankroll a large proportion of the Department).  Internships in aero are quite easy to get, as are good PhDs (elsewhere, or staying on at Oxford).

11. Huge community in all colleges, *especially* at Catz.  I was there, and totally loved it.  The engineering tutors (Drs. Gillespie and Byrne) make life a complete treasure; they have the experience and life of the students at the heart of their college duties.  I've been through (heh) nine colleges now, and Catz is certainly the most vibrant, and the most enjoyable for Engineering Science students.  Although none are bad, of course.  I still get invited back for the odd Schools Dinner (leaving dinner), and am always amazed at the warmth and friendliness of the place - particularly the engineers.

12. Unreservedly!

13. I would say not - because it is only general for the first two years, and then you can get as deeply into your chosen specialism as you wish.  Being taught by world-class researchers in their field (who also know how to teach) is worth its weight in gold.

14. Engineering Science every time - the whole course demonstrates how interrelated everything is, and how it is all, basically, applied maths.  The same tricks and tactics come up in every discipline.  I'm in machine learning now, and it's surprising how many advantages you get from being able to import novel ideas from other disciplines within Engineering.  It's all about fresh ideas and ""cross-pollenation"". :)",0,1358766315,null,0,false,0,c80sflj,t3_16rabz,t1_c80sflj,t3_16rabz,null,1435640674,3,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,3

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"Not necessarily - I for one regularly imitate people's accents, simply because that's what they sound like over any particular dislike for them (or where they're from).

This translates into (for example) doing an indian accent when doing an impression of HP/ Dell/ etc. helpdesks, where they answer in such a thick accent you can only just follow what they're saying, and then realise they're telling you that their name is 'Derek' or 'Kevin' - the joke is pretty obviously based on the helpdesk respondent blatantly not really having that name and not even being in the country you're calling from, rather than 'ooo are people with 'X' accent thick'.

I personally see the problem overall as one of looking-to-be-offended; if someone gets upset if I do an indian accent, or highlight something funny about indian culture that doesn't make sense, why are they not upset at the Kumars making a career out of it? It doesn't really (to me) change anything in terms of offensiveness, but time and again being a part of the race/ group/ etc. that you're making fun of  is used as an excuse to do so. Remember one of them got an OBE, and said he'd probably have sold it by the end of the week? How is this acceptable? Remember Lenny Henry doing his 'OOOOOOKEEEEEE' schtick years ago? I see no real difference between LH and Jim Davidson doing it, when (if we're going to take offence) it could be suggested that LH (and the Kumars) were actually being *more* offensive because he was/ they were lampooning their own people.

Then there's the issue of how far away someone has to be from to be covered by this - I'm from London, but I regularly make fun of people who talk with a really strong east-end accent despite their being from Orpington (or similar), and as for Ja-fake-an and any number of made-up, affected languages....well, it's open season.

We either allow everyone to do it, or we don't allow anyone. There's a big difference between 'look at this geographical/ cultural difference, isn't it funny' and 'hahaha you have what I consider to be a stupid accent therefore you are stupid', and denying anyone the option of even highlighting any racial or geographical differences at all will, to my mind, leave us all poorer - anyone can decide they're offended by anything, but following that road will lead to nobody being allowed to say anything at all (regardless of whether it's criticsm or praise). And ultimately, I don't think anyone generally does an accent specifically to imply that *everyone from that country is similar* (otherwise they're highlighting their own ignorance, and shoot themselves in the foot), just like someone doing a mock-chav 'street' accent is not suggesting that everyone from the UK is a chav (unless, of course, someone's looking to be offended!)",0,1358768154,null,0,1358772956,0,c80sm48,t3_16syr1,t1_c80sm48,t1_c80pwfl,null,1431030589,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Never sure about this term tbh.  Does it mean only poor people can see the logic of left wing economics?

I mean, clearly, people who don't live their ideals are shits, whether that is those on the left or the right (Ayn Rand taking welfare for example - although I honestly don't begrudge her this, I just think it shows she was wrong), and I'm sure we can find plenty of each.

I think less about ""sharing the burden"" as about ensuring effort is 100% rewarded and that no one is excluded from the party.

Or people who vote Lib Dem and have a good tax accountant doing as much as possible to avoid tax.

There's probably an element of rich people not being allowed to disagree with a system which they've flourished under, although I agree that that does paint socialism and other left wing ideologies as very opportunistic and therefore in quite an unfair and disfavourable light.

I completely support the exact same sentence, but because I don't subscribe to a labour theory of value, I have vasly different ideas about what a reward should be.

It would surely be necessary though, given that some would accumulate any resources they're given, and others wouldn't.

Can I take away my rent/mortgage and council tax payment from my income and say I 'don't receive it because it gets spent? Could I then claim that tax free? Nope. 

In that case, she receives X amount each month and gives it to the council and landlord. Regardless of the ins and outs of HOW she receives it. Just because she doesn't see it doesn't mean the taxpayer doesn't pay for it. Money isn't free you know?


Please note: I'm not saying anything about the amount she receives, just the argument of that author that she is not in receipt of the money.

The word algorithm comes from the name of the 9th century Muslim mathematician Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi. He's not well known in the West but he was pretty awesome http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB

It's not so much the religion as the interpretation of that religion and the institutions created by the religion and host culture. I think we feel quite safe and assume progress is inevitable but if we look back at history you can see that it's always possible to slip back into ignorance and darkness. I don't think radical Islam (or Christianity) are doing us any favours in this regard.

No, you see, the video actually inflicts no pain in this case, you'll note that it's actually the vigilantes who're doing the lynching, not the VCR cassette. So my solution:

We ban vigilante lynchings.

But wait! They're already illegal! So...now what? Why do you want the video to be illegal when lynchings are already illegal? If you're going to ban negative influences on people, where does that end? Honestly people arguing as you do kind of make me a bit violent, does that mean you should be prevented from expressing your opinions?

The problem with these policies of letter much poorer countries have unlimited economic migration within the EU is going to end up pushing countries out (the UK might if there's ever a referendum.) I'm for the EU, but it needs a more realistic migration policy. One country's socialised systems cannot support a multitude of citizens from a number of other countries.  

Also, youth unemployment (20%) is very high at the moment in the UK...do we really need another 4 million + 20 year olds coming here to work for below the legal minimum wage?

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"First of all don't confuse being a member with being a member of a fan club. There are Spurs supporters groups all over the world which are esentially fan clubs. Seperate to that you can become a Spurs member, I wouldn't call this a fan club membership. I assume you mean the latter but I just want to clear that up to avoid potential confusion.

Tickets can not be bought and sold and any ticket bought can only be used by the original purchaser. The club have the right to refuse admission, eject you from the stadium and punish the person who originally bought the ticket. I've never actually heard of it happening but I've always been very cautious. You might be okay if you borrow a friends ticket but if you buy from a tout what can you do if something goes wrong? They're not likely to give a refund.

The only 100% safe way of buying a ticket is direct from the ticket office (or via the web site). If you're not a season ticket holder and you want to go to games you need to be a member for 90% of matches since members get a two week window to buy tickets before anyone else and it's unusual, but not extremely unusual, for tickets to be sold to non-members. Members can also buy tickets posted for sale by other fans who can't use their ticket so a motivated person can get tickets as long as they're a member.

You don't say where you live. If you live abroad then you probably won't be coming to many matches but it might be worth having a membership if you'd really like to go to a game but can only make it once a year or once every two years. I believe you can buy a membership at any time so if it's just to get a ticket to a specific game then you can buy membership just before so it's not wasted.

There are other advantages to being a member. They send you a birthday card every year, you get a membership pack with some free gifts and of course you can say you've contributed to the club and are a small part in bringing a new player in. The money for new players has to come from somewhere and it's ticket sales, membership sales, program sales, refreshments, merchandise as well as sponsorship and TV rights.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"I don't want him to leave, but I have had the feeling for a while now that Rodgers is looking at other options and wants to move him on.

This is based on how little opportunity he is getting. Compare Coates to players that Rodgers *does* have faith in such as Wisdom, Shelvey, Suso and Sterling. He is getting no game time.

Consider this. We have 4 center backs, which is thin already. A full campaign of the Premier League, the Cups and Europe requires a squad with 6 centerbacks, usually. Look at Spurs now to see why you need depth in that position. Despite having 4 centerbacks, which is already thin, we have only used 3 of them. Agger and Skrtel have put in a ridiculous amount of minutes. The only full EPL appearance Coates has made was against City, when Agger was out. From then on, he has played as a sub twice in the League and made only 3 other appearances in Europe.

Its not like he didn't have the opportunity to get more game time - there have been plenty of ocassions where Agger or Skrtel needed either resting or to be dropped. Not only have they both put in a lot of time, but its been Carragher who is taking the minutes. Coates has played very, very little. He has played very little in a position where there is little competition for places and a position where most teams have 50% more players in the squad for than we do.

I would like to hold onto him, but I really think this loan is a way to move him on, rather than a way to develop the player. I'd even go as so far as to wager that Coates won't make another appearance for Liverpool (lest not without an injury)

We are definitely shopping for a center back. There was the Forren trial and the links to Diakite, who is not only an excellent CB but is running his current deal down. It is viable to get him in during the current window. I think moving Coates out on loan to West Brom or Wigan with a buy option would be dependant on getting one of Diakite, Fazio, Astori, Targett or outsiders Rodriguez (Fiorentina - having a hell of a season) and Flores (urgh, Swansea again)

FTR I think Diakate is the most likely target.

It's strange because the front page confirms at least once a month that the majority userbase of Reddit (Americans) absolutely love him. And that's the thing. Gordon's earned most of his fame and money through programs commissioned in America. He's taken the chef-reality TV program and run with it. He knows what his audience likes. But have you seen said programs? There are bits which the Americans point out as him being blunt but honest. That's fine and all, but when they're embedded in forty-five minutes of swearing needlessly and quite clearly putting on a front it just makes me cringe. 

Here's an analogy. Come Dine with Me was a fantastic idea until they realised that they could rake in the money if they just pointlessly insulted the contestants and specifically picked contestants that would be bitchy or at least open to producer influence. It's so cynical that it just becomes boring.

Gordon Ramsay could have it both ways. He could be respected all over,  but he panders to the idiots over on /r/funny.

It is odd they wouldn't opt for a younger player that's showing promise like Bernd Leno or Ter Stegen, but equally, Reina is probably more likely to want to move to Barca - his old club, and he's a proven keeper. He's right up there with Valdes and Cassilas. If he had been born 10 years earlier or later, he probably would've been Spain's first choice keeper. 

He may not be playing at his best right now, but it's probably just a blip. Most keepers hit their peak around 28-32, so he could still improve.

true,[deleted],null,null,"A few things - firstly there will not be millions more migrants, simply because this time all countries are opening up at the same time so realistically migrants will be choosing between UK, Germany, France,  Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden and Finland (if I only mention the relatively stable member nations. Migrants may still want to go to Ireland, Spain, Italy etc)

Secondly being in the EU means anyone who wants to leave the UK and apply for work abroad in Europe can do the same thing as the migrants coming here. May be a moot point as few British youths would want to, but it's worth mentioning because it is a benefit the EU provides.

Thirdly, what advantage is there for an employer to employ an economic migrant over a young British person? As far as I am aware, the same laws apply so the employer has to pay the same wage, pay the same NI, give the same perks etc. So there is no financial advantage - the decision has to come down to experience, interview skills, qualifications or a gut instinct. None of those are areas where a young migrant has a distinct advantage over a British youth? In fact, in my ignorant world view, I would expect the British youth to have a major advantage based on being educated in the UK (so their qualifications are understood and verified) and good English skills for interviews.

Finally, the point anyone opposed to open EU immigration overlooks is that simply by economic migrants entering the country, the economy grows. Now, I am not saying at a 1:1 job per migrant rate, but overall by having more people coming to the country, the country generates more money and therefore more jobs.

Youth unemployment in the UK has less to do with economic migration, and more to do with the perception of British school leavers. As with most perceptions it is incorrect for the vast majority, but it would seem at present when given the option of the a British youth or an economic migrant, the migrant is chosen. Why?

Although, I'd say we haven't progressed too far beyond that!  At least on a global scale.  And there's still chattel slavery in the US and UK to some extent.

&gt;because I don't subscribe to a labour theory of value, I have vasly different ideas about what a reward should be.

My ideology doesn't depend on it, although I think it's broadly empirically verified in a modified form.

&gt;It would surely be necessary though, given that some would accumulate any resources they're given, and others wouldn't.

Well, under anarchism it'd only be possible to accumulate resources to a limited extent, since there's no private property nor wage slavery.  You wouldn't be able to hold absentee titles to land nor recruit private security to protect it, and the community would support occupiers' rights over landlords'.  The only way it'd even be conceivable would be to build massive physical barriers, which would turn you in to a social pariah and make your existence pretty unpleasant.  People would not lionise hoarders under anarchism as they do under capitalism.

&gt;[Citation needed] perhaps.

For the rump we're going to agree on (the sick, the physically unable, etc.)  Or the fact that charity would be un/less necessary when everyone has a mortgage-free home and some land?  Don't forget that anarchism would be a far more efficient system than capitalism, and the workload on each individual would be far less than it is today.

In a paper submitted to the inquiry, Rachel Aldred, a London academic specialising in cycling, estimated a cost of just over £1.1bn a year for cycling to even begin the process of catching up with other nations, seemingly a lot but marginal set against the £16bn cost of just one rail project, Crossrail.

&gt;""Relatively, cycling is extraordinarily cheap,"" said Mayne. ""Cycling schemes routinely pay back their investment in one to three years. Your average road scheme pays back on paper in 20 years but usually doesn't pay back at all. You can hit your climate change targets, your health targets, everything else. It's a no-brainer.""

I think this is really important. Yes it needs investment, but it's relatively cheap and the returns are good. What's not to like?

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"I'm going to hijack this thread to repost what I posted in the tactics threat that didn't get many posts the other day, about the Norwich match. I'll then make a couple of additional comments at the end, in relation to the three diagrams at the end of the linked article.

&gt;I'd like to contrast how we played this game with how we played against United with a CM of Gerrard, Lucas and Allen.

&gt;Yesterday there was a lot of movement by the players at the top of the formation (and/including Johnson), with Gerrard a link between the top/front 4/5 players (Suarez, Sturridge, Downing, Henderson, and Johnson), and the defensive 4/5 players (Carra, Agger, Wisdom, Lucas and Johnson). This meant that everyone had a lot of space to move through/to and people to pass to, with lots of cross field and up/down field runs to open more space, receive and give better passes etc.

&gt;Against United however, the front players were very disconnected from the defensive players with both Gerrard and Allen trying to provide a link up, but both doing so from a very flat line that was either too close or too far away from the defence.

&gt;My worry is that a CM of Gerrard, Lucas and Allen simply won't work. Allen appears, to me, to be redundant in a 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 formation that we're trying to play. He neither distributes the ball well enough, nor reads the game to intercept/tackle well enough, compared to Gerrard or Lucas, leading him to be a bit ""jack of all trades, master of none"". Anything he does can be done better by both players, and I mean anything, in that he has nothing more to add. He's competent enough to fill in for either player as he did for Lucas at the start of the season, but not to play at the same time as both of them.

&gt;Further, if you look at the contribution of Henderson today, a player who has completely different attributes to his game to Allen, you see what is clearly missing when we load the CM with Allen in addition to Gerrard and Lucas: not enough pace, no shot threat, poorer tackling, less movement, and so on.

&gt;What're you thoughts on this? Do you think that these problems are systemic, or just a consequence of Allen having a poor game? I personally think they're systemic, and we won't - or at least shouldn't - be seeing Allen play in CM with Gerrard and Lucas again for the rest of the season regardless of Allen's form. Allen should be trained to be a replacement for Gerrard's new deep lying play making role.

All of what I've said above doesn't engage with the different formations for different stages of the game/ball possession, but I think the three diagrams Jed has at the end of the article show that Allen's (long term) place (for the rest of the season) has to be even more under threat. There's simply no way for him to fit into this system with Gerrard and Lucas playing.

(I did receive [one reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/16w0if/tactics_discussion_bestdayever/c80ewuw), where scaredstones had this to say in response:
&gt;Allen is really intelligent. I do think that he is on a run of bad games and I feel that he could do very well further up the pitch. But now that you mention it, i've always felt that he is better when pulling strings a la Gerrard. I'd say that Allen replacing Gerrard in the future would be a very good thing.

&gt;I still think Allen could do the job that Hendo did..but maybe not as consistently.

I'm starting to think that this is what's going to happen to Allen - he'll be used as an understudy for Gerrard, and a last 5-10 minute replacement for Lucas if necessary. But there'll be competition for this role, as Henderson and JonJo can also perform some of these duties. Given the possibility of Coutinho joining, our CM/AM is getting *very* crowded for this season, but should stand us in good stead in a couple of years when Gerrard won't be playing as much.",0,1358785646,null,0,false,0,c80vmij,t3_16xbtx,t1_c80vmij,t3_16xbtx,null,1431031993,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Dante-Raphael,null,null,"You do raise a good point.

However, surely it is still illegal to spread videos of murder due to the same principles I addressed, that is - people who want to watch people be murdered will still actively seek out films and create a demand for them? Granted, snuff films have never never been proved to exist, yet the distinction isn't entirely clear. People will still want to film murders soley because they know their is a market for it, whether a financial one or merely one of fame/infamy. This still *encourages* people to commit murder, even if their motive for murder is separate from their desire to film it.

I do understand it is a grey area. I've watched Vietnam-era war documentaries where people were executed/killed on film and photography and obviously those who distribute the film haven't been prosecuted. And yet, you could argue that is because they are almost state-sanctioned in a way. But then that raises arguments of the state having more liberties than its citizens.

Personally I'm happy that videos of illegal killings are illegal to share and spread in themselves, just because it provides a sense of respect for the victims and does not spread any fame that the killer or the filmer hopes to achieve in filming them. However, this could be contentious in the fact that, say the Government becomes corrupt and has officials perform illegal killings of citizens and refuses to prosecute them. A freely distributed video would be the only way to spread news of these happenings. Even claiming that the videos are evidence would be moot if the Government claims that they are not prosecuting for whatever reason.

I am conflicted, yet I am glad that they are illegal to spread in *this* case, but I can see scenarios where I wouldn't want the distribution of videos to be illegal, with very little differentiation between the two.

true,fuckyouimbritish,null,null,"1) As long as the house has enough bedrooms, there is no legal restriction.  Assuming you're looking for two double bedrooms, that's no problem.  However, if you're renting your lease may have a maximum occupancy.  Make sure you're clear about the number of tenants when looking around.

2) £700 pcm for a two double bed house seems a little on the low side for a city centre, but it greatly depends on the area.  Check www.rightmove.co.uk for rental prices in your area.

3) You need to budget for:

* rent: check rightmove
* council tax: depends on council and size/value of house. Check your local council's website for rates
* electric and gas: the average annual bill is somewhere in the region of £1000-1500
* water: average is something like £350 per year
* phone + internet: at least £10 pcm for line rental, plus whatever call/internet package you go for, minimum another £10 cpm
* TV licence
* satellite, cable or subscription TV if you want it

Some of those may occasionally be included in your rent, check the rental details.

4) If you're going to be renting:

* The landlord / letting agency will likely run a credit check. If you all are young and have no credit or rental history, you may need a guarantor - a responsible adult to guarantee the rent gets paid
* You'll need some cash up front for the deposit (usually 1.5 months' rent), plus the first month of rent up front.
* You need to think about whether you want a furnished or unfurnished property.  Unfurnished is cheaper, but you'll need to have your own furniture and (in most cases) kitchen appliances.
* When moving in, **check and double check** the inventory.  Mark down any existing damage or missing items, you **will be charged** for them at the end of your tenancy unless they are already noted in the inventory.
* Be very sure you trust your housemates.  If the house gets trashed, or rent goes unpaid, you are just as liable as they are.",0,1358787622,null,0,1358788052,0,c80w7cb,t3_16zqp5,t1_c80w7cb,t3_16zqp5,null,1431032269,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

&gt; 2) Is our goal currently realistic?

I don't know, where do you live? It would certainly be doable where I live - particularly if you're only looking for two bedrooms. 

&gt; 3) What are the usual cost of bills, aside from rent?

Well, for the flat you're looking at:

 - Council tax (this will depend on where you live and what kind of property it is, check your local council website for rates - and when you're looking at a property, ask which band it has been classified under). Say £140 total per month.
 - electricity/gas - possibly £80 total per month
 - TV License - £12 total per month
 - Internet, phone line, sky/cable tv £50+ total per month
 - Your mobile phone bill
 - Travel money - do you need a bus pass if you move? Car? Factor this in. 
 - House insurance. The landlord will take care of buildings insurance, but you'll want to insure your contents - say £20 total per month.
 - Food. This obviously depends on you, say £100 per month each. 


edit:
Aside from those costs, you'll need a deposit for the place and I recommend having some spare money saved before you actually make the move - particularly as you're moving in with friends, you won't want to possibly burden them and create friction in the relationship. Also, make sure everything is spelled out as soon as you move in. It should be clear who is dealing with the bills, when they are paid and how people should transfer for the money. For instance, if the electricity and gas is in your name - how do people pay their share? Are they handing you cash? Direct debit? Bank transfers? Make sure all of that is organised: write it all down and keep it in a folder incase anyone needs to check on their responsibilities. 

Also, living with friends can be difficult. You'll want to make sure duties such as cleaning etc are properly organised, to stop people getting annoyed at each other when dishes aren't cleaned etc. You can have a rule such as ""you make the mess, you clean it"" but that doesn't really cover things like general dusting, mopping the floor etc - so organise a rotation. Something like a spring clean every Sunday, with each couple taking a Sunday in turn. 

Finally, I would go to view as many flats as you can. Organise a whole bunch of them in one evening, to make sure you actually go and see them instead of just picking the first one that blows you away - if you need to be careful with your budget you should be careful to understand completely what you're buying for your money. That is, if you're spending £700 rather than £600, what is the difference? Do you need it?

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"The Damiao rumors seem to have slowed lately for a couple reasons i think. 1st he seems happy at Inter, he has never really come out and said he is any rush to move.  Secondly seems to be the multiple ownership, seems that Inter own about 60% of his rights, the Chairman of Inter owns another 20%+ and then 2 separate agents each own a portion of his rights.  Inter, the chairman and the agents all want to see max return on their investment so it seems like the goal posts keep moving, we offered £10m the first time around and Inter then told us the price was £12m, we went back again at £12m and Inter surprise said they wanted £14m and now this window we seem to have gone back at £15m and Inter surprisingly have now asked for £18m - £20m.  Tough to get a deal done when one side keeps changing their mind on the pricing.

I think its pretty clear that we need a striker of some sort but i'm not sure who we are looking at as we only seem to consistently target Llorrente, Remy and Damiao.  Considering Llorrente is off to Juve, Remy is at QPR and Damiao looks like it will never happen i would hope we are looking at someone else.

true,kimchifart,cnty-expat,Expat,"I'll address your points one by one:

'Firstly there will not be millions more migrants'

1. This is a VERY confident statement given the precedent with Poland, and proof from the census, with or without synchronised opening. 

2. The numbers are no where approaching being equal for cross migration. (you acknowledged this to be fair)

3. Advantages for employer: workers from abroad are more likely to work for below the minimum wage, take longer hours, less holiday and generally are probably more flexible to employer's requirements:

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowpay.gov.uk%2Flowpay%2Fresearch%2Fpdf%2Ft0Z96GJX.pdf&amp;ei=33X9UIGpHqrI0QXyxIHgDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfI62v8MDSUfyMpbs69Ztmze9rrw&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.d2k   (sorry for the huge fucking link, this is a study that confirms some of those points in 3.)

4. I guess it's whether you think the standard of living only pertains to the economy or if there are other factors. As far as I can see the EU is in its current state an exploitative capitalists wet dream. 

5. The migrant is chosen because of the points in 3. Non migrant workers were picking cabbages before the EU influx.

Thanks for your comments. I can see your point of view, but I can't agree with it. I also want to say I'm not approaching this from a xenophobic angle (I think Polish migrants have integrated as well as they possibly could have in my town), it's more about exploitative labour, and the fact that a social democracy (socialised medicine etc.) can't function properly if borders are completely open to poorer countries; it has too much potential for a surplus of cheap labour eating into the overall pay being offered by employers, especially for working class jobs. 

As regards to benefits, yes, I think only British citizens should be claiming benefits and find this a silly policy. I wouldn't dream of claiming benefits in another country, but fully acknowledge that migrant workers claim less benefits than locals. I would be happy to offer benefits to EU workers if the UK government could issue an invoice to their home nations; this would seem a fairer and more sustainable way of doing it as it shares the costs equally. It's more a point about citizenship and being invested in a democracy for me. I haven't made my mind up about this completely...the numbers for claims are smaller for EU migrants, so perhaps this is an area I might change my mind on. However, I really don't think the NHS is going to be able to cope with this in the long term. 

The EU...it's complicated. ",0,1358788522,null,0,1358789010,0,c80wh7z,t3_16zg76,t1_c80wh7z,t1_c80uvtd,null,1431032411,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The parent therefore may not murder or mutilate his child, and the law properly outlaws a parent from doing so. But the parent should have the legal right not to feed the child, i.e., to allow it to die. The law, therefore, may not properly compel the parent to feed a child or to keep it alive.""

**Cardiff:**
As you mentioned, you want to visit Cardiff. Cardiff is a rather nice city that was being regenerated (not only a Dr. Who reference for the exhibition there, but politically correct speak for ""we're making it look nice"") when last I visited. At the exhibition you might still be able to find a local map that outlines where different scenes were shot for different series which should eat up a few hours. There is a pretty good Wok to Walk in Saint Mary Street, and there is also a large castle that hosts venues on their grounds (I saw Florence + The Machine there). I was only there for a weekend, so the only thing I can really recommend you look out for are the street signs: They are both in English and Welsh - the only language on Earth designed to communicated advanced ideas and thoughts while also clearing your sinuses.

**Yorkshire:**
If you want a more rural setting, then you can visit Yorkshire and hire out a cottage for a few days. Recently, my girlfriend and I stayed at a cottage here and enjoyed ourselves immensely, though that is likely because we had access to a car and could journey from the remote location the cottage is set in. Whitby can be accessed by a railway station at nearby Pickering that still uses steam locomotives and their carriages which are approaching 40-50 years of age. It's authentic, but not exactly fun freezing your arse off on an expensive, slow train. Rural Yorkshire is like being in an episode of Heartbeat - a UK drama series set before we had the internet and the nourishing pornography it so readily provides. If you stay in York, you have access to much, much more including the steam railway museum which homes the Mallard - the first steam locomotive to travel over 100mph. A marvel of the engineering the British Empire was capable of - and we named it after a duck. There are also plenty of tea rooms which serve tea and scones - should anyone offer you a scone without cream and jam then politely decline and punch them in the throat.

**London:**
London has everything you could ever want, though the pace of life is very quick indeed. With that in mind, you might want to stay away from the tube and overground trains at rush hour as it gets pretty crowded. Getting around the city is very easy - just buy an Oyster card (more on this later). Local attractions include Camden Town (if you're a goth or want to buy drugs), Oxford Street (as a typical shopping street in London) and Westminster. Westminster is unique in that the interior of the tube station looks like an Escher picture crossed with a goth club. I suggest that on a clement day, you walk from Waterloo tube station to a ride on the London Eye then stroll across Westminster Bridge and see Parliament, then onwards to the Delis near the post office opposite Scotland Yard to grab something to eat in St. James' Park. You can also take the tube to Embankment and go to Gordon's wine bar (if it is still there), then walk across the bridge and take a left to walk along the south bank. I would also recommend Tower Bridge, just to say that you have been there. Also, if you can, try and see The 39 Steps.

We have things called Boris Bikes. British vernacular infers that these are whores seconded to the Mayor of London. In actual fact they are bicycles for public use.

**Stuff that needs pointing out:**

Oyster cards are pretty necessary for getting round London (and London only). They can be bought from any tube station and a lot of newsagents. To use one, take it to a tube station, find an oyster machine and top it up with money by following the steps on screen. To use it on the tube or bus, place the card on the yellow pad on tube gates or ticket machines on buses. When the card is read it displays the remaining balance to let you gauge when you should top up. Should my crap instructions provide insufficient, just watch what the natives do and copy them.

Everything is smaller in the UK. It is also more expensive. If you think it's bad, just think of the people that live here and how that affects our sex industry.

Never, ever talk to anyone in the street or on a platform or in a queue. We do not tolerate casual conversation. You will likely be committed to a mental institution.

We drive on the wrong side of the road. Red lights at traffic lights in America mean you can turn right. Over here it is illegal.

When traveling between the different cities of the UK, you must, MUST shop around and look very carefully at the differences in prices between trains and flights.

Our midfield is currently very solid with Lucas, Allen, Gerrard, Shelvey, Downing and Henderson we need more in attack so Coutinho will play with Suarez, Sturridge, Sterling and Borini (although Assaidi may go on loan but we'll see...)

It really seems that Rodgers or FSG are trying build a team that will be able to compete in 2-3 years. I think that this is actually a very good strategy considering Rodgers has proven himself capable of teaching young players and improving them. This will also provide much needed stability that the club has lacked in recent years while simultaneously establishing Liverpool's playing style which will make it easier to attract players in the future to the club (particularly those who fit our playing style).",0,1358790299,null,0,false,0,c80x1h9,t3_16zotv,t1_c80x1h9,t1_c80vjjo,null,1435640552,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"First things first, you can not compare this one to Poland for the exact reason I gave in my answer which is that unlike when Poland joined the EU, the UK is not sitting almost on its own with the doors open, it is now only accepting at the same time as ALL other member states. There will not be millions of migrants to the UK - or at least, it is extremely unlikely. If I was a migrant I wouldn't go to dodgy UK that looks like it wants to leave the EU and sits on a precarious economic position, I would go to Germany.

I think the situation is more complicated than you give credit for and your answer is based in the old paradigm of individual nation states rather than the new one of an integrated trading/migration block.

&gt;I would be happy to offer benefits to EU workers if the UK government could issue an invoice to their home nations; this would seem a fairer and more sustainable way of doing it as it shares the costs equally

That in itself is actually incredibly unfair and only benefits countries which at the moment are net receivers of migrants (bear in mind it's all well and good to make a policy when it benefits you but remember the situation will inevitably swing the other way some day). No EU member would ever agree to this policy.

Consider the following case: An 18 year old British student gets a fantastic job opportunity in Germany and leaves without ever having paid NI in the UK. Six months in to their stay in Germany, they get sick and have to use the German benefit system (I don't know hat benefits they would receive, or even if they are eligible after only 6 months, this is just to illustrate an example). So for 6 months they have paid tax in Germany, and have never paid NI in the UK.

According to your proposal, the British government now receives a bill for the benefit cost of that migrant. Is that fair? Is it fair that Germany gets the tax receipts but foots none of the bill? Would it be fair if the situation was reversed? And what if instead of Germany, it was actually Poland or Slovakia?

What you have to bear in mind is Britain *gains* from having these migrants, the economy grows, and the migrants pay in to the benefit system through NI. Sure there are cases where they pay nothing in and claim loads, but there are also reversed ones. Your suggestion picks and chooses and if we implement it, then we should also pay their NI and income tax back to their home state as well.",0,1358790482,null,0,false,0,c80x3lo,t3_16zg76,t1_c80x3lo,t1_c80wh7z,null,1431032712,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Right now, its pretty obvious our Interim Manager prefers Mata to stay in the middle, Oscar and Hazard semi-wide. This isn't a problem per say, but it does make us that little bit more predictable. 

It also doesn't help that with Oscar on the field, we become a much narrower looking team. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as its directly because of this, that we have been shredded apart by so many teams this season bombarding down the flanks and whipping a good cross into the box once we have been dispossessed with so many players high up the pitch.

In RDM's words, its all about balance. Finding the balance in our team right now is proving quite difficult to do, but we're getting there. Many of us started the season expecting to be come in third..so far we are on course for that, with a very outside chance of winning the league. Mazacar, as mouthwatering as it is, might not be the best balanced team we have right now...

It is said many times through the new series set starting at 9 that there was an oxygen field around the tardis and several times the doctor says that he enlarged the field hence why Amy was able to """"fly"""" out side the tardis in the beginning of Matt's season. 

As for the sonic screwdriver use. I can see where every body thinking its being over used but several times the screwdriver was destroyed in the 10ths timeline and it was always replaced. With Matt, he used the 10ths ss and when it finally got destroyed as he was in the tardis a new one was givin to him by the tardis. If you also pay attention to SITL river shows him a ss that was modded and said the doctor gave it some upgrades so at any point it can be changed. 

With the reincarnation of the doctor the tardis was changed too ( or anytime it was badly damaged). If you go to the episode in which Matt lands on the bubble out side the bigger bubble(the episode where the soul of the tardis is pulled out and put into another body) she states that she saves the control room of each incarnation of herself. Keeping that in mind not much was changed from 9 and 10 but Matt CRASHED the tardis and it wad all but destroyed but when the tardis was done regenerating the whole inside was reworked. My point is 9 hardly used the screen in his. 10 used it but it was indistinguishable to is as to what it was saying and in Matt's you could actually read the screen so why wouldn't the ss that was given to him by the tardis be able to do more.

For me, the fans should be proud of giving him such support for so long. What you're seeing is patience wearing thin and quite rightly too.

Kezman hardly played for us before being sold for a profit and Sheva had a better record than Torres. And he scored a blinder at the Lane.

Comparing that lot to Torres isn't quite right. I'm sure if they played over 100 games with the hand-wringing over what is wrong with him, accompanied with over £100m of investment in order to ""unlock"" him and help him ""rediscover his form"" then you'd see similar reactions to that now seen with Torres.

Don't worry too much: unless you're seriously considering any of the professional subjects (law, dentistry, veterinary, medicine, engineering) its very rare that apart from the very top unis they worry about GCSE grades, if at all. Please do check this for any uni you apply to though!

Equally, unless you want to do any of those subjects don't worry too much about not knowing specifically what you want to do yet. People swap course even after they're in uni.

As and Bs at GCSE will get you into college. Once you're there, you get your A level grades and 99% of the time your GCSE's pale into insignificance then. A friend of mine got 4 Cs at GCSE and he's at uni now doing the exact course he wanted to.

Firstly, you should probably review this before saying you want to visit England and then saying you wish to go to Cardiff:

http://qntm.org/uk ;)

Secondly, how long will you be here for?

If you want to visit London, Manchester, Cardiff and Liverpool then that will involve a LOT of travelling and probably quite a lot of expense, not to mention that you could spend weeks in each of those cities and still barely scratch the surface.

Do you have an idea on what sort of budget you guys have and how much you would be willing to spend on transport and accommodation?

* Keep to schedule, we finished first and sat around waiting for people who had played _one_ game in group two.

* Fuck columns, most retarded setup i've ever played on.

* I currently have near close to arthritis from the ice-windtunnel effect in London with my [hand losing nearly all it's skin.](http://db.tt/Eb8n2uuT) (Don't host events in winter!)

* Toilets! - If Gamerbase/You had some agreement with Trocadero's arcade for free entry into those gents downstairs it'd have been fine.

* We could have turned up at 11:00 as we'd planned because our first game was at 11:15, if you set times before and event for starts, don't expect people to turn up before.

* The whole way Group two was finalised was poor, Infused knew they had to win their game fast, for a higher chance of getting out of the groups. By them having later games they were given a ridiculously unfair advantage over uWe. 

* **This is disgraceful**, uWe were organised and on time and get punished.

* This lead on to the knock on effect of us having to play Infused in a bo1. Which is unfair on both us and Infused (and our Organisations/Sponsors who funded our attendance for this event.) I will be arrogant and say ""more so"" on Myself/Reason because we didn't drop a game in the groups and could have been out vs the team we should have met in the final.

* Someone should have been on hand for tech support all day, those PC's ran like shit and had slim to no ability to unplug that garbage Razer gear.

* Don't advertise Luminous as a caster and not have him turned up, he should have been contractually obliged to turn up.

* Slim to no web coverage, people came to me for information. I'm not part of Dotatalk. You even copied my group stage &amp; fixtures news post 1:1 from UKDota.net.

* No online updates of group standing and such for other people.

* Announced on joinDota, 0 coverage on joinDota.

* Props for people actually showering! (except one nameless person, you know who you are, sort it out.)

* HUGE shout out to steelseries, SpireCorp &amp; the powerball guys (will amend when someone tells me who they are.) 

* Durka is awesome, Rabbit showing everyone he's gonna be at TI3 soon with his LANter.

* Pyrion Flax and his pal did a great job but Pyrion, don't confuse confidence with cockyness/arrogance, you don't go 9&amp;0 on LAN without it.

* Massive thanks for organising the event DotaTalk, next time get it perfect pals!

* Props everyone for not taking my LANter to heart, You were all extremely sound, (except astonL).

Reason will be attending future events.

Let me explain.

I think that Hazard, Marin and Moses are our best wingers. Juan Mata is also a great winger, but he prefers to play a central role. From what I have seen from Oscar, he doesn't play very well as a winger. However, Oscar plays very very well as a central attacking midfielder. I could even see him playing as a holding midfielder tbh.

So if I had to choose between Mata and Oscar as CAM, I would choose Mata as the starter.

**tl;dr** Oscar is a better central attacking midfielder than winger, and Mata is a better CAM than Oscar, therefore Oscar should be Mata's backup/sub while we play true wingers like Hazard and Moses on the wings.",0,1358798868,null,0,false,0,c80zzew,t3_16zstc,t1_c80zzew,t3_16zstc,null,1431034182,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

It was National Express that I travelled with, which is a little more expensive than megabus. But having been on the MB once and hated it - little to no leg room (I'm 6 foot tall) and the travel emthod of choice for scum in the UK, it was just not something I would do.

Ok. Though experiment time. Let's suppose the government put a cap on housing benefit and kept reducing it. 

Do you think rents would go down or up? What effect would that have on a) government budgets and b) the amount people not on benefits pay in rent. 

I know when I was in Kilburn there were loads of people living in very expensive houses on housing benefit. That meant you needed to pay £1000+ a month to get anywhere. Now if you're earning substantially more than that you could afford it. But I knew people on £22K for a job in London and they ended up sharing. 

Meanwhile you'd get families where no one worked living in huge houses in the centre of London. Now I rent in London when I need to work there. If I don't I go somewhere cheaper. Why do families where no one work need to stay somewhere with such a high rent?

Look at the benefit cap 

https://www.gov.uk/benefit-cap

The level of the cap will be:

&gt; £500 a week for couples (with or without children living with them)
&gt;
&gt; £500 a week for single parents whose children live with them
&gt;
&gt; £350 a week for single adults who don’t have children, or whose children don’t live with them

We need to keep reducing the cap on housing benefit to force down rents. 

Also benefits need to be a temporary thing which reduce with time to force people to becoming self supporting.

Beveridge was supposed to have said that if people discover that benefits pay more than work they would be rational to claim benefits, but that it is up to the politicians to make sure that does not happen.

Firstly, for tapas, go to Indaba on Lochrin Terrace near Toll Cross. They do a mixture of Spanish, South African, and Venezuelan dishes, and it's all extremely tasty. They have a good range of meat, fish, and veggie dishes to suit everyone, and you can mix and match to your heart's content (though leave some room: the desserts are also amazing). The staff are very friendly too. I wish I could go there more often than I do.

Secondly, again near Toll Cross, try Passorn. They do divine Thai food. It's all very fresh-tasting, and you can set the heat level of the dish to suit your tolerance. The starters are some of the best around, and that's to say nothing of the main dishes. It's maybe a little more pricey than other options, but you're paying for the quality.

Lastly for now (I could go on) the best burrito in town can be found at Los Cardos on Leith Walk. If you've never had a burrito before, go and try one. If you have, go and try one. Seriously. These guys know their burritos, and it's a good, solid, meal. Again, both meat and veggie friendly, and affordable (and more-ish) too.

Hope this (belatedly) helps.

I like Moses a lot on the right wing, as he provides a more direct approach to the game and he has a high work rate on defense.  Ramires can play on the wing, but more as a defensive winger.  I think he plays superbly in the pivot, as long as he has a very creative CM beside him.

Bertrand will not/should not ever start anywhere on the right side of the field, as he is primarily a back up left back to Ashley Cole, yet sometimes is utilized on the left wing when the left side needs more defensive cover for when Cole is out of position attacking.

I think it is a problem. By playing all three of them together we effectively shut out our Striker. Ba and Torres require an opportunity to be 1v1 on a defender, but because of how narrow we play, the defenders can just camp around the goal and Mazacar will just pass-pass-pass like Barca.

I much prefer having Moses in the team as he atleast drags a CB out of position which creates more room infront of goal. You can see Torres (and to an extent Ba) having to make runs away from the goal when one of the trio have the ball so that they can create space. We then bitch and moan about Torres not being in a spot to score when his work dragging a defender got us into that position.

With Moses gone, I'd much rather us start Marin out on the left as he's a naturally wide player. Oscar can lend assistance to the Midfield to replace Mata or Lampard.",0,1358809069,null,0,false,0,c813fod,t3_16zstc,t1_c813fod,t1_c80xa71,null,1431035848,6,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,6

Also may I suggest looking at getting jobs with any of the Festivals while you are here. July and August is the high Festival Season (not sure if you are coming to this lovely city because of that, a lot of people are). 

There's the big ones like the Edinburgh Fringe, Edinburgh International Festival, the Edinburgh International Film Festival (though that may have been moved to June or sth), the Book Festival, etc. They are hiring for a lot of help (it's all short term contracts - so that should suit you well), but beware, quiet a number of the position they are hiring for are voluntary, so I don't think that would appeal to you two. Also, apply early, as the god jobs are competitive and deadlines tend to be relative early.

A quick google search with ""Edinburgh Festivals"" should give you plenty of Festival Websites on which you can then browse for jobs. Also individual venues are also hiring during this period.

Another thing is to apply to the big foodie and restaurant chains (Starbucks, Pizza Hut, etc) - some of them tend to seek extra help during the busy summer months. Also places on the High Street may be looking for extra hands.

Hope that helps you two out :)",0,1358810456,null,0,false,0,c813vvo,t3_170ntk,t1_c813vvo,t3_170ntk,null,1431036051,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

One of the things that marked out Chelsea as champions was their ability to call on someone as good as Cudicini should Cech ever be suspended, injured or loose his form. With Jones happy to play back up we are perfectly placed to bring through a bright young goalkeeper, just as United are doing with De Gea whilst having the (reletively) experienced Lindergaard in the wings pressuring their youngster to stay focused.
