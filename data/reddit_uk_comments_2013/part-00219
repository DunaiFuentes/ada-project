Cool, random comparison with a country that also lowered relative poverty to [13.1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_China) in the same time (2008) we lowered ours to [22%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_Kingdom).

It's funny how the Chinese haven't had this responsibility dumped on them within one generation, and perhaps if we weren't funnelling taxes into a welfare state we'll eventually bear sole responsibility for, we too would have the means and social preparation that comes with looking after a family member.

I'm merely entertaining the thought of how far must a government push the responsibility of the welfare state (which we've all paid for, young and old alike) onto its citizens, before it has to question the right to call itself a government at all?

The living room is largely heated by the warmth created when cooking dinner and we have the bedroom heating on for a few hours a day to take edge off.

* Wearing more clothes - providing you're not having to wear gloves indoors it's perfectly reasonable to wear a few layers and slippers in the winter months. There's a reason we keep blankets on the back of the sofa, it's so you can snuggle under it with a hot water bottle.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm not saying that there isn't an element of social give and take. But I think if you look at the generation currently in their 70s they've actually enjoyed a pretty good qualtiy of life. These are the guys who were youngsters during the war or born just after it, and were fortunate enough to avoid serving. They enjoyed state provided healthcare AND education, home ownership and general prosperity (as a generation).

Now if you look at people in their 30s they, probably for the first time in recent history, are looking at living out their lives to a potentially lower standard of living (obviously comparatively) than their parents. The inherant assumption that *""life gets better""* with each generation doesn't look like it will necessarily hold true for these guys. e.g. people whos parents were homeowners may live and die in the rental sector. People whos parents were constantly employed may suffer significant periods of unemployment. people whos parents were educated to become professionals may be unable to afford such an education or profession themselves.

&gt; We seem to think in Britain that its viable to live as independent units and for other people to do all the work and pay the bills. The costs simply don't stack up.

I don't think anyone is suggsting someone else should do the work and pay the bills. I have no issue with care being provided either by the state or a private provider - and me or my parents paying for it.

Personally I would advocate a model of care in which the assets of the elderly are used to pay for their care (essentially as we currently do) - but critically those assets are not physically sold until after they are dead, with a provision for them to leave an amont - for example up to Â£15,000 to each child. (Perhaps with a sliding scale formula... e.g. Â£15,000 for the first child, Â£12,500 for the second and Â£10,000 for the third - then Â£5,000 for each remaining child - to be added up and split equally between them). 

Essentially this was the outcome of the Dilnot commission although I would advocate a much lower threshold for taking assets to pay for care - I actually think inheritance, particularly of high value assets like land and property, is one of the biggest barriers to social mobility in this country.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No, I don't. The situation we are in now is vastly different to the Victorian railways. For starters - have you ever heard of this invention called the 'car' or the 'lorry'? They did not exist in Victorian England. meaning that most goods were carried  by the railways. They were the only transport, aside from canals, that we had available to us. Further to this they had an almost complete run of undeveloped land, and no existing lines to get in the way, along with a rapidly expanding economy and high demand. 

So how does that compare to today? Well, railways have to compete with these inventions called 'cars' and 'lorries' in terms of cost. These lorries and cars have the complete freedom to go anywhere in the country for less money, and if they cant reach somewhere a road can be laid down in a matter of days for very little money. Railways already have existing infrastructure that many people are reliant on every day, so it's not like you can close the whole system and revamp the whole thing, it needs to be done piecemeal. Finally we are a country that is a declining power.

First, them motherfuckas at the govmint do subsidise the rail companies, and bail they asses out if they need damn infastructure pro-jects. 

What them mofos demand in return is some of them fine ass performance indicators. [You done seen this shit in railway stations.](http://www.greateranglia.co.uk/about-us/performance-figures) If they performance indicators ain't tight, they asses ougta there! (Or the govmint don't bail they asses out quite as gen-er-ously.)

To be sure, this racket runnin' pretty smooth in some 'hoods. Them performance indicators pretty fine (o at least hella betta then that British rail system). The problem is this shit ain't adding value over the long term in many cases, and more than often, some franchises get pretty happy to hobble through on gov-mint protection money without payin' them performance indicators much 'tention.

To my mind, the market failure ain't in that there ain't no financial relationship between them passenger mo-fos and the companies, its that the govmint ain't as strict on the franchise playas as they could be fosho. 

But the way o the game is that once you start hardcore gangsta shit on  a franchise that just ain't playin' right, befo you know it, that neighbohood be a ghetto. Like mah homie Biggie said: 'Mo' franchises, mo' problems'.

They ain't no easy way to say this homie, but them govmint gangbangers gotta put some serious paper down to improve them shitty info-structure, and maybe even shirk in on tha turf of franchises that ain't playin right. But, they gotta play respect to those franchises that doin' a better job than they was back in the day! (Maybe even give them some extra dolla).

Problem is, them govmint mofo's don't wanna sign the cheque! Like all thangs, paper is the problem.

It is simply not practical for very many people to provide adequate care in their homes. I would welcome more help for carers, stuff like the right to flexible working hours and training on giving medicines, but the government's judgemental lecturing tone really worries me. If your local school is substandard it's your responsibility to set up a free school - if care homes are substandard it's your responsibity to turn your own house in to a care home. I really fear this is a slippery slope to a large scale dismantling of public services. I mean why don't we shut down all the schools and nurseries and tell parents they have to give up work to care for and educate their children personally?! There are reasons why we care for children
or the elderly in groups, a doctor visiting one care home to see 20 elderly people is more efficient than him having to visit 20 different houses. A professional carer is best employed working in one building spending their time caring instead of having to spend half their day commuting from one place to another.

The idea is that care homes would be a last resort, not that they'd go unused. Once they need more care than you can give them, then they either need to go into a home, or they need carers to come in.

In my experience there's a good few years when someone shouldn't really be living alone but before they need carers. This is the time when it would be great for them to live with family.

Even to make this economically viable we have to use an army of minimum wage staff, who in turn will need the state to pay for their care as low wages and no pension will limit their asset accumulating potential.

You don't need to tell that to people who are having problems paying their heating bills, though. They know that already.

It's an indication of being out of touch to make this suggestion (not that Cameron or his spokesman seem to actually have done so), because people who are having problems paying their heating bills are already wrapped up to the nines.

I'm not short of cash, but my last flat was a draughty single-glazed rental, and my last winter there (might have been my last two winters, I'm not sure) I decided to try without running the heating all the time.

Previous winters I had run heating constantly on full for hours a night, and it seemed like a waste, all that heat radiating out through the windows.

That last winter, I had rolled up towels as draft excluders by the doors, I had the curtains drawn. I was wearing two jumpers, two pairs of socks and I was still suffering with the pain of the cold.

Sitting at my desk, using my computer, twice a night I found myself having to fill a basin with hot water so I could soak my feet in it, because it was the only way to get properly warm.

My winter duvet wasn't enough on its own, so I slept in a summer sleeping bag underneath it &amp;/or with 4 litres of hot water bottles, and I still got chilblains (which are surprisingly and remarkably painful, by the way).

It is astonishing the difference that double-glazing makes, and it's just nonsense to imagine that people who are struggling are sitting around in their boxer shorts.

I have no idea how much heating a DSS giro buys you, but in my new flat running the heating for an hour would make it like a tropical paradise (I rarely run it for as much as 15 minutes, even through the winter), whereas in my last flat running the heating for an hour wouldn't make a jot of difference to the cold.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I have four issues with it really; 

* 1) The assumption that people should be socially obligated to do this. In asian cultures family ties are stronger - not just in old age, but throughout lifetime. So unlike here, it **is** an inherant social obligation. 'Total' respect for elders is engendered at a very young age to an extent that is unmatched in **any** western society... but that doesn't necessarily mean their way is right and our way is wrong, just because their way seems (on paper at least) to be morally virtuous. In Japan there are frequent stories in the newspapers of children who've kept the dead bodies of their parents locked up in their attics to avoid the financial ramifications of declaring them dead - or stories of the elderly subjected to terrible bullying and abuse by their own families who are trapped together by social obligation. Elderly people are vulnerable - whether its to abuse from a rogue care home or an unloving relative.

* 2) The notion that this sort of social change can be brought about at the click-of-a-ministers-finger. It can't and he knows it can't. This has nothing to do with caring for the elderly and everything to do with appealing to the significant elderly vote - that traditionally votes Tory. It's shooting fish in a barrel. Just like when David Cameron appears all tough on immigration or Nick Clegg gets a hard-on in the papers about nuclear disarmament or green energy. In a nutshell, its preaching to the choir, and politicians love it!

* 3) Done properly I don't see why purpose built care homes are necessarily a bad thing. I would actually also take this oppourtunity to point out that people on reddit tend to use the term *care home* synonymously to mean residential homes, warden controlled flats and nursing homes - when in reality these are three very different things. To use your example above; the ""gap"" between living alone and requiring full time care is theoretically bridged by something like a warden controlled flat or residential home... these don't provide any nursing or medical care - only living assistance and usually the minimum needed to keep people as independent as possible. Nursing homes (what most people mean when they say care homes) are really for people with end-stage dementia and most residents don't stay there for more than a couple of years at the very end of their life before either dying, ending up in a hospital and dying or moving to a hospice to die. There are also lots of other services to bridge that gap - like community centres, day hospitals etc. It just isn't fair to say that the elderly are just dumped off on their own and left to die.

* 4) Having an elderly relative come to live - and ultimately die in your family house can be a mixed experience. Not everybody is comfortable with that idea and people can feel very unsupported if they have a dying relative in their home, often for several weeks at the very end of their life with occasional visits from carers/macmillan nurses etc. It can be very frightening watching someone suffer under your own roof and feeling powerless to intervene - not everyone is equipped to deal with that. Hence where nursing homes and hopsices come in. Generally most residents in those kind of homes are only there for a very short period at the end of their life. It looks very traumatic because... well... dying is traumatic. Imagine trying to cope with that at home - some people can and some people can't. It shouldn't be an intrinsic social obligation.

**tl;dr** - its easy to see Hunts idea as a panacea for all our housing shortage/elderly population problems - but the reality is far more complicated. This has nothing to do with helping the elderly and everything to do with helping Hunts voter-popularity.

Joe only had a couple years where he could have really been an effective wing option, the rest of his career should have been spent unlocking defenses from a more central attacking position (sausage roll), ideally at a step or two below our level of play.",0,1382117456,null,0,1382118020,0,ccufwcz,t3_1op3ih,t1_ccufwcz,t1_ccuezdk,null,1429084590,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"To be honest, Townsend isn't really scoring from the right so I don't see it being a terrible idea to move him back to the left for a bit. It would give us natural width on that side which we've lacked massively with two righties. 

He's very two-footed and has scored some incredible curlers with his right foot, so I don't really think the side he plays on would impact him too heavily. 

Personally I don't really necessarily think he will even develop into a prolific goalscorer. I think he shows so much more promise as a creator. He can cross with both feet, he can beat his man at will, and he's getting better at playing those little intricate combinations around the box. His goalscoring is incredibly low-percentage because he doesn't really get into the box to shoot. 

The more I think about it, the more I think it would make sense to play Townsend as the more creative winger on either side and then Lamela or Sigurdsson or Chadli as more of a goal threat depending on who is in form and which side Townsend is playing on. 

I really want to see Lamela thrown into the team more so it would be nice to see Townsend on the left with Lamela on the right. I think that would work absolutely brilliantly because Lamela is more likely to get into the box and score. It would give us another player getting in there (with Soldado and Paulinho).

I know the cliche is it's a good problem to have but god damn who can you possibly drop? Certainly not Paulinho who looks like he could score 10 goals this season. Dembele looked iffy for a while but then suddenly he started dominating matches again. Sandro has been good in his cup matches but not good enough to walk into the team for league matches. Capoue was probably our best midfielder when fit but now he's coming off a nasty injury. 

In a perfect world I would play one of the destroyers with one of the more box-to-box players rather than both box-to-box players. I enjoy the all-action Dembinho midfield but it does sort of put a leash on both of them and it can leave space in behind. 

Paulinho/Capoue would be brilliant because it would really free up Paulinho. We already know what Sandro / Dembele can do.

true,threehappypenguins,null,null,"It could be the other way around. Perhaps they don't want to spoil things because we might NOT recognize her clothes (from previous seasons). Or will recognize the era of her clothes. For example, when Rose was last seen (and all the times before that), she always wore the ""2000's"" style pants (ie, flares/bell-bottoms) and the ""layered style"". It is pretty much standard nowadays EVERYWHERE that everyone wears skinny jeans, leggins, flats, etc. Look at what Clara wears. And what Amy wore. So if she's wearing skinny jeans or leggings or something (like what most girls wear now), we'll figure it out pretty quickly.

Furthermore, I know there is the debate about 10's Tardis being in it, but as others have pointed out, The Doctor gave Meta-Crisis a chunk of Tardis. So all he needs is a working chameleon circuit and to make his desktop theme the same as he had before. He DOES have different hair. And his suit is irrelevant. He can easily just get another suit that looked like one of his old ones. And the 10th doctor, after Journey's End, wore a blue suit again (The Waters of Mars) even though Meta-Crisis left with one of his blue suits. So the fact that he wears a blue suit doesn't mean he's the Meta-Crisis doctor. The same goes for Meta-Crisis. He can wear a brown pin-striped suit if he wants to and that doesn't make him the full Time Lord doctor. If that makes sense?

Though now that I've seen the pictures, take a look at 10's left hand in the one picture. I always just figured that Meta-Crisis and Rose would so obviously get married. If it was Meta-Crisis 10, wouldn't he have a ring on? LOL, I might be looking into this far too deeply haha... perhaps the Doctor just doesn't ""do rings"".

She is bothered about being 'outed' because this is a personal detail that she didn't wish to share across the radio network with, as said in the article, potentially hundreds of other officers. That seems fair enough to me.

Thirdly many would argue that being trans* is not a choice, but if you mean that she chose to live life and identify as a different gender then yes, that would be a choice. Bear in mind that it may have been unthinkable to her to carry on living life as the sex she was born, many studies have shown a much higher prevalence of mental health issues such as depression, and an increased rate of suicide attempts among trans* people.

true,Baro_87,null,null,"Those estimates I believe are grossly exaggerated, as they commonly are when supporting an economic argument for legislation of cannabis. There are key differences between cannabis and other (for comparison) legal drugs such as alcohol or tobacco which generate large sums of money for the treasury. Tobacco is an industrial crop, it is grown, cured, produced in a certain way, refined, packaged etc. Same for alcohol, to get it to taste nice and be consumer friendly there are major production processes/ companies refining and bottling the stuff. If it was cheaper for citizens to produce it themselves, they would do it. But they can't. They are successful products economically because of this. 

On the other hand, Cannabis can be grown anywhere. That's why there is so much of it on the streets, you can grow it in your back garden, dry it and smoke it, all you need are the seeds which are widely available. The government know this, the country is run based on a capitalist economic system, by big businesses. They know the figures on face value are appealing but there are other factors which affect it. On a slightly lesser note, the commonly known property of cannabis is that it makes people lazy and lethargic, to a capitalist system which is based upon production and output, this is not the desired effect. etc. You get the idea. It will not be legalized any time soon. 

To see a cannabis website saying it could generate shit loads of money is no surprise to be honest but I would be cautious in accepting it at face value. ",0,1382125810,null,0,false,0,ccuj9x7,t3_1oq0o3,t1_ccuj9x7,t3_1oq0o3,null,1429083013,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

This is a really round about way to get safer drugs out there, cutting out the current illegal vested interests while creating new industries AND keeping the legal interests happy. The Chinese are currently way ahead of us in this, and failing quite awfully in the minimization of harm...

EDIT: Really Reddit? You don't like this idea? Well we've been pushing for legalization since the 60s, the old guard has moved on and its STILL not happening, and unlikely to happen.  

Yes, the alcohol industry sucks; yes, the tobacco industry sucks; yes, the pharma industries suck...but until they all have a reason to get behind a push to come up with something different (i.e. something that does not threaten them) then we will continue to see the carnage that they wreak continue. That's per year 9,000 alcohol related deaths, 3,000 drug related deaths plus all the collateral damage that is caused. That's 12,000 deaths a year that can be avoided, tens of thousands more lives that can be spared the pain that comes with this. 

Drug use can be made SAFE. Drug use can be made ""acceptable"". *I* might be able to get wasted again! But it isn't going to happen until we more broadly regulate, it isn't going to happen until it is made ""safe"" and that isn't going to happen until the structures are in place to allow someone to *legally* make a profit; and the sad truth is that those in the best position to do so are those same industries who have vested interests in the status quo.",0,1382127006,null,0,1382136113,0,ccujr1y,t3_1oq0o3,t1_ccujr1y,t1_ccuj8fy,null,1429082791,-7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-7

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; We have way more disposable income than the average family in Singapore 

After looking after relatives in Singapore is taken into account, yes. My partner is from Singapore, and the cost of renting, energy and water is quite high. However, certainly if you are chinese-ethnicity Singaporean graduate, your earning potential is significantly higher than your European counterparts. Indeed, the average size of a flat is quite small, and they are prohibitively expensive unless you qualify for government support (which all young and first-time buying couples do) to get an HDB flat. 

If you take into account the government financial support for housing for couples (which includes tax breaks and repaying you some of your previously paid tax, as well as a preferential loan rate and subsidised house prices for HDBs), then you will find less of a disparity between disposable incomes than you think. 

For some of the work I do, I could be paid three times as much in Singapore and, because my partner would qualify us for an HDB flat (as long as we got married), we would end up paying just a little less in living expenses than we do here in Bristol. That's pretty standard if you talk to any UK ex-pat in Spore. 

Remember that low-paying jobs in Singapore are performed by immigrants and not Singaporean nationals (the majority of whom are university educated), so there is a definite skew there towards the high-end for naturalised citizens.

I don't disagree that it is rather different, as children are expected to live with their parents until they are married (and build up a sizeable amount in savings).  Perhaps if we had the same social situation, we would be better prepared to deal with our ageing parents. If, however, your parents kick you out at 16 or 18, they really shouldn't be surprised that their kid is unwilling to foot the bill for their 20 or 30 year decline, when their parents and culture never gave them the opportunity to build up a serious financial buffer before going into the 'real world' - as is common in most asian cultures. Also, once again, most chinese-ethnicity S'poreans become a single-breadwinner household as soon as elderly parents or children come into the picture, which could also account for the disposable income discrepancy.

For those of us whose parents were quite old when we were born, the situation is even worse in the UK as, in your early 30s when you are supposed to have your career established, you have to take time out to look after your elderly parents, putting you at a permanent skills and earning disadvantage. For a great many people I know with older parents they are put in the position of never being able to afford to have children - both in time costs and monetary costs as they are required to look after their parents at exactly the time they finally have enough security to have children.",0,1382129226,null,0,false,0,ccukn5b,t3_1op4xz,t1_ccukn5b,t1_ccuk0f5,null,1429082377,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,[deleted],null,null,"I find some of these studies more than slightly dubious for a few reasons:

""billions in tax""? Tobacco generates approximately Â£2bn a year in tax revenue. When you consider how much people tend to smoke (compared to how much weed you tend to smoke) and consider the fact that far more people smoke tobacco than will smoke weed, I could only see tax on cannabis only generating a small portion of what tobacco earns. You can't just set insane levels of tax as that'll just encourage people to keep growing it themselves.

Savings on the criminal justice system? The savings on policing would be fairly small, the UK spends under a billion for policing drugs but that includes all drugs, cannabis is only one section of the market so you'd maybe save 30% on that.

Secondary crime? Robberies etc? Cannabis isn't THAT expensive and it isn't addictive. If someone was to rob a house to buy cannabis when it was illegal, they'll rob a house to buy cannabis when it is legal. Most of secondary crime comes from the feeding the more addictive drugs (most notably heroin).

Lastly there's the cost. Cannabis does have health implications for long term use and the evidence for it's link to mental health issues is getting stronger (recent studies have shown it increases psychosis, even when outside factors like family history and age are taking into account). The increased numbers of people driving under the influence has a cost. Regulating and taxing the cannabis market has a cost. People just being high in general has a cost to society.

There may be a net boost to the economy but I don't think it's likely at all to be more than Â£100's of millions, those figures quoting Â£6bn just seem insane.",0,1382130956,null,0,false,0,cculazh,t3_1oq0o3,t1_cculazh,t3_1oq0o3,null,1429082067,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Rather than focus on getting more outside kids to join the school (which is not really going to happen on a large scale) they should focus on getting different schools to join together for events or outings or such.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19635239

http://www.vidmax.com/video/3015/Female_cop_beaten_to_a_pulp_by_a_driver_who_just_didn__39_t_want_to_go_back_to_jail/

Asking a very man-sounding person on the radio when they expect to hear a female officer, is just trying to look out for the officer.  Please watch video to see why.

The officer has a man's voice, this isn't rocket science.  It IS political correctness gone mad, and the Emporer's New Clothes.  A male officer who thinks (due to gender identity disorder) that he is female, has a man's voice and a woman's name, and we should be upset a dispatcher is confused and concerned when they hear a man's voice on the radio?

You think it was not just as obvious to every other officer on the force listening, that it was a man's voice?  Police departments work and operate on REALITIES and FACTS not the way 'we wish things would be'.  IF the officer didn't want to out themselves over the radio, they could have responded with:

* Stand by, dispatch, I will call you by phone.
* Stand by, dispatch, I will have my superior call you.
* Stand by, dispatch.  Sgt superior-officer, can you confirm my identity please?
* Stand by, dispatch, here is my badge number and code for confirmation.
* Stand by dispatch, here is a phone number for you to call to confirm.
* Stand by dispatch, here is my patrol partner to confirm.

Wow, look how fucking easy that is, when you are really a thinking police officer acting like a police officer.  Instead, Chapman CHOSE drama with a conscious decision to out themselves on the radio when that is not how an officer ever, ever confirms their identity.  And any police officer will tell you that there are procedures in place in every department all over the world for confirming your identity and your A.O.K. status.

&gt; I just went on the train line put in 2nd jan and from Bristol Temple Meads to Gatwick (arriving just before 8am)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That ticket is currently showing at Â£57.50
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My return ticket however is Â£101 (coming back on 16th) and means I have to stay overnight in the train station. Please put those details in and see if you don't get what I just said. 

I like a challenge. [I'm seeing that journey for Â£61.50 on one return ticket](http://i.imgur.com/e9OXvFm.png)

You need to leave early for that deal (4:45am!) and change trains a couple of times, but since it's a morning plane to catch, to me that'd be well worth it to save on eighty quid's parking alone. Your priorities might be different. 

Notice that it's an 'open return'. You can use the return half for any Gatwick-Bristol train time, up to a month after the outward journey. What time are you looking to leave Gatwick on the 16th? The open return should allow you onto any train.

Protip: Thetrainline.com is a scummy company, and I hope they go bust soon. They are just unnecessary middlemen - they're taking the train companies' prices, buying the tickets for you when you could do it yourself, then making all their profit from 'booking fees' and 'card fees'. You should never have to pay additional fees to book rail tickets in the UK, it's a sign that you're being ripped off.

Always book directly from a train company's website - in this case I picked FGW because it's their route, but you can get tickets for anywhere from any of the big franchise websites, and the prices *should* be the same. Run a mile if anyone tries to add additional charges!

Let me know if you can successfully book at that price or it doesn't work for you. I can take another pop at finding sensible ticket prices.",0,1382136363,null,0,1382136584,0,ccun5ge,t3_1opacw,t1_ccun5ge,t1_ccu8ybd,null,1429081177,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think a more suitable solution would be to make all drugs legal, but increase education and regulation. For example if you wanted to purchase a particular drug, you first had to see your local GP (or similar) who would explain to you the dangers and effects of such a drug. You would also be provided with information should you feel yourself becoming addicted and needing help, what to do if things go wrong, contact numbers, tell tale signs of addiction etc.

This would be part of the process to obtaining a photo ID drug license for the particular substance of choice, which would be used to purchase said drug. This wouldn't be a perfect system by any means, and there would certainly be those who would purchase drugs for other non-licensed drug users. There would have to be harsh penalties for those selling to others, and if properly regulated a license could be scanned at each point of purchase so those buying large quantities could be easily identified.

Taking away the stigma of drugs and providing present, correct and non-biased information would be a huge step forward in promoting the health of drug users. If someone wants to take heroin now, there's nothing really stopping them, but if you could talk to them before an addiction started you would be much better suited to helping the person further down the road.

Imagine a licensed heroin user starts buying in large quantities, they could be contacted and warned about the dangers of addiction and if they need assistance. If they are suspected of buying quantities to sell on their license could be revoked, or put on hold until they contact a GP/NHS clinic and have a discussion with a professional about their habit.

There are already companies in the US that have separated out the THC/CBD/etc and terpenes into capsules or e cig liquid for medical patients. These are proven to be more effective than their pharmaceutical counterparts like marinol.

Really cannabis legalisation/decriminalisation is the easiest most benign part of the war on drugs. Theres no physical addiction you have to worry about or the chance of someone actually dying from taking too much of it such as with opiates, benzodiazepines , alcohol and others.

We had 50/60 year olds who were just as clueless as us younger ones as they had never done it before. 

Main tips/things I took from it:

- You pay travel expenses upfront and receive them back at the end of the 2 weeks. If you're on a long trial then interim payments are made usually on a weekly basis. If you're in particular hardship there is extra provision. Parking charges are usually not paid but depends on the individual court. Best case scenario you'll be slightly out of pocket but not by much. Job wages are paid up to a certain amount with employer contact. 

- If you have major pre-planned events with proof (paid holiday, paid wedding, etc) then you can be excused.

- Long-trials are rare. Each week there is a fresh 'batch' of jurors. Most serve anywhere from a few days to the full 2 weeks. Sometimes on more than one trial - each lasting only a few days. If you're picked for a long-trial you'll be selected and informed of the expected duration. During my long-trial I saw many new sets of juror groups come and go. 

- Lunch &amp; coffee/tea is paid for. You'll either receive a card/money for the on-site cafeteria daily or money/expenses to purchase food elsewhere. Any money you choose not to use is given at the end anyway. 

- You'll be in a secure waiting room with some activities to do such as TV/board games/papers, etc. Bring a book, laptop, tablet or something to do. 

- All rules and regulations get explained via a video at the start. 

- Do what the judge says. They may change start times either later or earlier the next day. Be on time or risk a fine.

&gt; I'd use more weed if I could buy it whenever I stopped by morrisons, pretty sure other people would too.

Would you?  Would you use more regularly then, or more quantity over all? Why?  Do you feel you're not getting enough or are drugs particularly hard for you to acquire currently?  Most people seem to be able to get what they want/need in fairly short order, though there maybe some locations - small villages etc. - where you have to know someone.  I've hardly set foot in the UK for over a decade, and I don't use illegal drugs, but I know I would have little difficulty in scoring over an average weekend if I wished.  Perhaps there might be a convenience effect for current drug users, or even those who had always wanted to try but had been solely intimidated by the law, but these are probably few and far between.  If I walked into the average living room and plonked an injecting kit and some smack down on the table, do you reckon many people would get straight in to it?  Drug use, particularly certain kind of drugs and certain kinds of use, is generally indicative of underlying personal and social problems, and our best avenue of prevention is and has always been in addressing these, you can't police addiction away, and, although in rare cases it may act as a wake up call, in general the criminal justice system makes the problems associated with being a dependent drug user worse.

&gt;if the justice system is that bad, it's a problem with the justice system that needs to be addressed for everyone, not just drug users. Being imprisoned shouldn't cause you much harm, if it does in practice it probably does for everyone else too, and given it's supposed to be rehabilitative that's not great.

I agree (or believe if you don't) that the justice system needs to be reformed generally, and that there are far too many people in prison.  However, I wasn't thinking just in terms of imprisonment.  Imprisonment clearly does harm though, especially when it's for non-violent drug offences (which happens more often than people might think, though thankfully not nearly as often as in the States yet).  It pulls people out of their community support networks (which may be a good thing in some cases, but not necessarily), it disrupts education and employment, as well as making future employment a more precarious proposition.  It also hardens people's attitudes and often ends up teaching them new and more serious forms of offending.

But, as I say, it's not just the question of imprisonment, nor even of the impact of criminal records, it's also harm from shoddily manufactured illegal street drugs with variable excipients as compared to pharmaceutical quality ones, as well as the fact prohibition deters problematic drug users from engagement with health and social care, and education services, limits the effectiveness of needle exchange and disposal programmes, and can thus lead to increased rates of needle sharing, poor injecting practices, overdose, blood-borne viruses, and poorer health of dependent drug users generally, as well as increasing the harm to those around them.  Things are getting better as the CJS and health/social care services have more experience of working together and each others' needs, but see [here](http://www.exchangesupplies.org/article_paraphernalia_and_the_law_introduction.php) for an example of some of the stuff which has had to be ironed out.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I think it's more just about being transparent. Let me give you an example:

A football club regularly gets a turnout of 1000 per match, yielding Â£10,000. A new marketing agency pitches a season ticket campaign which they anticipate will yield 500 new visitors per match, with Â£5,000 revenue (minus Â£1,000 cost).

However, of those 500 'new' visitors, 250 were already coming to matches organically, so you have to add the extra Â£2,500 loss. Therefore:

Organic Ticket Sales: Â£10,000

New Season Ticket Sales: Â£5,000

Marketing costs for Season Ticket: -Â£1,000

Migration / loss from organic sales: -Â£2,500

Total: Â£11,500

So - it's still worth doing as a venture, (though crucially it raises the question of whether there are other ventures that with a Â£1,000 spend would yield greater than Â£1,500 additional revenue), but you can't simply claim 'Oh yea totally an extra Â£5,000 no problem'.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"Imgur was added to the IWF blacklist weeks ago, there was a thread about it in r/uk because people from numerous ISPs were experiencing very slow connections to imgur.

To briefly explain how the cleanfeed/IWF system works, it's designed to block individual files rather than whole sites. When you make a request, your ISP first checks to see if that IP address is listed in the blacklist. If not, the request is processed normally. If it is, the request is routed through a special proxy server. The proxy server will allow you to view the site except for specifically listed files.

What has presumably happened here is that the proxy server that VM use has fallen over. It'll probably be resolved soon, but imgur will likely remain on the blacklist for whatever reason, which means slow connections and unreliable proxy servers will remain a problem for everyone trying to access imgur from the UK for the foreseeable future

&gt; Users may also become panicky and suffer from paranoia. The effects of acid can last 12 hours or more which, if itâs a bad trip, can be very frightening.

So while ""psychotic problems"" sounds very scary, it's not (well unless you're having a bad trip).

Not something I would class as a good use of Police resources.  But the Home Office decided to make them Class A so I guess the blame is on them.

Anyway, the rest of your comment is very worrying:

&gt; And if you don't understand the importance of a trigger... then you don't understand mental health. 

I don't think either of us can confess to have definitive knowledge about mental health, because no one does. It's all very vague and wishy-washy and all that shit. It would be wise to remember we're both amateurs, as well. 

You argue that because other things can trigger schizophrenia (which, by the way, is far more complex an illness than you give it credit - it's been argued schizophrenia is just a dumping ground for all those who don't quite fit into more defined mental categories), it doesn't matter that marijuana does as well. 

Especially considering the fact that, thankfully, most of us go without traumatic events etc. and marijuana is much, much more widespread, how can you argue that a chemical trigger works in the same way as an environmental one? Furthermore, how can you brush extra risk of a life-altering illness aside like it doesn't matter?

Humour me, expert.

However, your point that so many 'apprenticeships' on the UJ site are pointless and created purely so that companies can get staff for 100 quid a week, not even being willing to pay minimum wage.

The stupid part being, any jobseeker takes these places, the DWP is now not paying Â£70 JSA, but they're paying over Â£150 in tax credits, along with all the other benefits that are still needed.  Getting people into these jobs actually costs us more than leaving people the hell alone.

Surely it would be better to actually start teaching children how to write a business letter, or do basic arithmetic if that is what businesses wanted, rather than saying to the children 'you aren't good enough'.

&gt;Gove defended his decision to introduce more testing for pupils by drawing an analogy between two airlines. ""Imagine that you had a choice not of schools, but of airlines. There is Test Airlines, very rigorous, and there is Warm and Fuzzy Airlines. What's the difference between the two? In Test Airlines they actually insist that the pilots have passed a test so that they can fly a plane. How old-fashioned can you get?

Jesus Christ Gove you speak a load of bollocks. This is just a terrible comparison on so many levels. Unlike with aeroplanes, there isn't a 'one size fits all' type of education for children, or for different subjects. School shouldn't be about weeding out bad prospects, like a test on an aeroplane or a pilot would be, it should be about nurturing children, and not only increasing their factual knowledge, but there thinking and creative skills.

You're entirely correct however, it needs to be redone and made actively useful.

Firstly, why the HELL is there no option to upload or create a covering letter when directly applying?  I told my advisor (who's excellent btw, no complaints about him, but plenty about everyone above him) and was advised that they'd probably not fix it, so all I could do was edit the cover letter into the start of my CV and upload that.

Secondly, add a report button to dodgy vacancies - tho of course they don't WANT to know about that, they don't care if you're robbed so long as you're applying.

Thirdly, let us edit our damn activity log, I've occasionally made a typo, and I know that if investigated, they could claim that when I typed that I did someone on the 15/08 and I meant 16/08 that I didn't do it on the date specified and sanctions ahoy.

His job is to break up play and maintain possession. Gerrard is slightly higher up. He's looking to keep pressure and find the attacking players who are making runs on goal. Moses is behind the strikers and is the most attacking minded of the three. His position takes the most risks and is there to link up play from the midfield to the strikers. His efforts tend to be of a low percentage, as he is trying to create goal scoring opportunities. Even Coutinho, at his best, will have the lowest passing % of the outfield when playing in that position.

Now Allen does many, many things well, but he simply isn't that player. We tried him in that 10 position a few times last season and it simply doesn't suit his style of play.

&gt;That study only excludes people with pre-existing psychological psychosis. Completely anecdotal evidence but it conveys the point I'm making. My girlfriend has a history of schizophrenia in the family, so she doesn't touch cannabis or any psychedelics - she has no symptoms of psychosis. (Unless I'm reading the article wrong and it includes family history - but even then it cannot account for the genes from schizophrenia being passed unknowingly (no one in their family 'triggering' their underlying psychosis) I also have a friend who's dad was schizophrenic.  He stopped smoking weed because he could feel psychosis sinking in. He stopped, and is fine now.

&gt;Also - the article makes no mention of permanent effects. 

&gt;Hopefully once we have handheld genome-mappers we would be able to advise people it wasn't safe for them to consume psychoactive chemicals (and once we find all the genes responsible!).

Cissokho looked terrible. His mistake on the second goal cost us the 3 points. Apart from the last ditch tackle in the second half his performance was not up to snuff. We obviously need Enrique.

Moses looked invisible. I only remember seeing him be a part of the game passing to suarez for studge's goal.

Suarez- had the passion, wanted to win it, always good, my MOTM tbh.

Sturridge- first half he looked lazy, second half he really picked it up. he looked a real threat the last 30-40 minutes.

Hendo/gerrard- decent but not good enough, first half performance was severely lacking. Really surprised at how incapable they were of pressing the ball with 10 men in the second half and how slow the play looked. 

Skrtel- looked immense, never saw any mistakes from him. glad he's back in form

in general we were given a great opportunity to prove ourselves in the second half and made a huge mistake that cost us the game. Also WTF are we doing in training that we can't score headers? I know set pieces have been our weakest spot since the beginning of time, but seriously? 2-3 perfect opportunities to score goals and no one could even get it in between the fucking posts!

Obviously we should have got the 3 points, but it is too early to say if we were a top 4 side we'd have won. Newcastle are better than their form suggests, Remy, Cabaye, Ben Arfa are excellent player.

We cannot play 3/5 at the back against teams with any kind of mobility. They outnumber us in midfield, and with our slow midfield and attacking full backs we will always concede too much room.

We played brilliantly last night - a real team performance and Bentley looks really confident in goal.

I understand he has pace and power, but you need more than that. No idea why sterling came on for Johnson instead of Moses, it was probably too late at that point anyway though (8 minutes left).

Mignolet was poor on the first. The shots is from miles out, across the goal so further to travel, well hit but not an absolute screamer. Watch the replay, he stands rooted to the spot before making a last minute dive. He has time to take a step across and easily cover it.

Toure didn't play well today, and wasn't good against Palace. He's lost some aggression from his game, compare how he bossed Benteke to how much freedom he gave the Newcastle forwards.

Skrtel was very good, his best game of the season.

Suarez looked a cut above everyone on the pitch technically and in his reading of the game.

The wingbacks were bad, johnson looked sluggish and Cissokho was just awful. Its a very tough position to play but for me Enrique has been playing it very well, and today we saw a huge dropoff in that position.

As I said in another post the other day - the conservatives have been doing a fair bit of this recently - with Cameron getting [tough on immigration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24575795), Jeremy Hunt [banging on about family values](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24572231) and now George Osborne [telling us young whippersnappers](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-says-secondrate-britain-must-rediscover-its-can-do-attitude-8890558.html) we don't work hard enough... I wouldn't fret too much about it. I suspect it's mostly aimed at trying to rein in the conservative right, that have recently drifted off in UKIPs direction.",0,1382195706,null,0,1382195906,0,ccuznuu,t3_1orrfc,t1_ccuznuu,t1_ccuy9f5,null,1429075169,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

But, what is the use of such forums if we can't say anything about our fave players?

With all due respect there was no way Lamps could have dipped that ball from that angle. By the way, it was Drogba and Luiz that mostly used that technique at Chelsea.

On top of that, it would explain why he acted all emo at the beginning of Nine's run because like psychologically, The Doctor does what needs to be done and typically doesn't get all bent about it unless it involves innocent people. There were no innocents in the Time War.

But perhaps The Doctor sees 8.5 (but in my theory, I'd prefer something like 9A) as an aberration, kinda of a denial trigger for him. He can't admit to himself that he really did lock the time war and cause a ton of death and misery in the process so as a coping mechanism, he puts it all on 9A but in the back of his head, he knows it was all him.

9A is just as much The Doctor as any of them, it's just hard to admit and the dermal regeneration into 9B would kind of make separation between the two easy to do because 9A only ""lived"" for a short time.

true,_lolwhat_,IM,isle of man,"This game was much closer than the score line suggest. Cardiff missed some very good chances and Cech made some brilliant saves. And the game by Marshall today had to be one of the worst performances I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the score line will overshadow Chelseas inability to sustain any form of an attack.

Brana was awful today. Haven't been able to say that since Swansea of last year. Everyone has an off day.

Luiz gave up that dumb goal, but he recovered. He really needs more discipline. 

While it was great sticking it up to the Spurs, at this point, Willian might have been a mistake.

While Lampard had a nice pass, that's all I can really say about what he did today. I still do not understand what his purpose is on the pitch. He is suppose to be a defensive midfielder, but he sits so high up that he ends up crowding the midfield. This also results in handcuffing Ramires. Ramires is brilliant when he is able to run freely and create chances out of random positions. But, he sits in a more stationary position when he playing with Lampard.

Once upon a time they used to. This week as a mature 40 something STEM undergrad student I found myself teaching 18 year old fellow students fresh out of A level maths how to do long division the old fashioned way so they could answer an assigment question which said to use long division to prove an equation was a factor of a quadratic. The stupid fucked up method of division of long numbers currently taught of drawing pretty lines between numbers just ended up in complete confusion.

 Chelsea fought back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood.* 

I've personally never seen such unequivocal language used in a match report. Usually they cop out and allude to a 'goal which replays suggest may have been harsh on Cardiff' or whatever but they just lead straight off with that. 

We were a bit lucky today (and have been a few times at home now), but fuck it, a lot of other teams (Man U) probably don't have the players to score the goals we did today to kill off the game. There is no way we didn't merit that win.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The reason it's not still not widely accepted in society is largely due to ignorance and sometimes even hatred towards trans* people, not because trans* people ""make a fuss every time their gender is brought up"". Emma Chapman does not represent the entire trans* community, so if people are making a judgement about all trans* people or how socially acceptable it will be based on her actions, or even just on the actions of other trans* activists, that's on them. Not all trans* people ""make a fuss"", and those that are perceived as doing so are not responsible for being trans* still not being widely accepted in society. 

There are still lots of people that do care about people's sexuality and gender identity, especially the later, with many people still not believing trans* people are the gender they identify as and voicing this directly to trans* people. The level of verbal and physical harassment trans* people get is also still shockingly high, so at times not coming out can be a matter of safety.

She couldn't have ""easily"" said she was trans\*, as she has evidently struggled a lot with it during her life and it's not something that she is completely comfortable with people knowing, which is understandable. Trans* people still face a lot of verbal and even physical harassment from others, so it's a very sensitive issue. 

She wasn't hiding and crying about it, she has probably had similar experiences throughout her life, and while she didn't necessarily respond in the best way, it wasn't just a case of her getting upset over nothing. It's not easy for someone to just act like everything's ok when they still get the message from society and from others that it's not. Both trans* people and non-trans* people need to work together to make it socially accepted, it can't just all be done by trans* people.

A lot of the stuff that used to matter - pension beneficiaries, etc are actually being extended to non-married partners nowadays so you *may* see no difference there.

The only other thing i can think of is a next-of-kin scenario (giving consent for life-saving treatment in hospital, maybe) as it may be that a non-married partner doesn't actually have any legal clout, and they'd have to seek consent from a blood relative instead.  But i don't actually know.

It's in an artsy-cartoon style, and it goes through each of the doctor's regenerations (more or less.) It's narrated by Matt Smith. It doesn't really hint much about the 50th though!

Edit: What Matt smith says:

""I've been running all my lives. Through time and space. Every second of every minute of every day for 900 years. I've fought for peace in a universe at war. Now the time has come to face the choices I've made in the name of the Doctor. Our future depends on one single moment of one impossible day. The day I've been running for all my life. The day of the doctor."" 

Edit2: If you pause at the time when the camera swings past Tennant, you can see London in the background. Whoever made this trailer was very precise in detail because you can see the Pinnacle, a skyscraper in London that has yet to be built.

Harsh as it may sound, its very sad that conditions in Nepal aren't better... but it isn't our fault, and we shouldn't be made to feel like we are morally obliged to do something about it because we aren't.

His main problem I feel is he'll miss a basic defensive task (clearing the ball) wanting to turn it into an attacking move to quickly. For someone that captained brazil this week he was off. I feel Cahill offers more defensively than David Luiz.
