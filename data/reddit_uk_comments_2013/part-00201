&gt; In September 2005, Ars ran an opinion piece looking at the economics of the next-gen optical formats. One argument by the guest op-ed writer was that Blu-ray was a considerably more expensive format. In March of 2006, Image Entertainment said it was concerned about the costs associated with Blu-ray.

&gt;Those concerns are being echoed by the porn industry, less than a year after it had apparently decided to go with Blu-ray. A spokesperson for one adult studio told TG Daily that HD DVD is easier and cheaper to produce and that it was the industry's belief ""there are more HD DVD players in homes than there are Blu-ray players, for example in the Xbox 360.""

&gt;Other adult studios agree. Another industry source told TG Daily, ""Only bigger studios can afford Blu-ray, and even then it's not economical.""

An organised protest with sign-offs from everyone with everyone agreeing is just a walk in a park, a demonstration of feet, a hands-up to whoever agrees with an already existing premise. A real protest is where  few agree and you're in the minority trying to point out to people what the problem is. For that you take the risk to make the story bigger to be a bigger nuisance to garner attention to your belief.

&gt; *Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody dared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.*

Without using any direct description he's managed to paint a very clever picture of the character, both physically and in personality, in just two sentences.

One of my group of friends is predominantly Asian, with no white people, and I always get banter (and to be fair that's all it is, but the fact that it's there is still an issue) about the fact that I hang around with a lot of white people and some of my closest friends are white British. As for the group of Muslim guys, I've had weird looks thrown at me when I'm hanging out with some of my female friends.

Sometimes people (on here, on r/soccer, on other sites, in the real world) can be dicks when you are trying to learn stuff, but most people will be helpful. Just ask when you have questions.

The comparisons made between the Spurs and Spurs were all ones that, to most, are pretty dissimilar. Dembélé as a passer and dribber? Completely different skill sets. It's the same as saying Kobe Bryant has excellent passing and dribbling abilities, so therefore would fit in nicely as a CM. The arena/stadiums are cool? Uh, ok. The players are from the same international countries? Yeah, like, no other clubs have similar representations.

As for the NBA and it embodying everything that is hurting football, if you are against the NBA then you must be against pretty much every other commercialized sport. In no way did American sports create the greed that is at the root of every social problem caused by corporations running rampant with no regard to their community. Each society did that on their own. Basketball might be one of the more international sports; it might not have the same exposure in the UK, but elsewhere in Europe, South America and East Asia, basketball has a large following. Basketball is no more American than football is English.

There are reasons to be frustrated with the current commercialism of football. The NBA is not one of them.

I apologize if my tone seems condescending/argumentative. I just think that the visceral negative reaction to something because it is not familiar is unbecoming of r/coys.

I'm a Sociologist so I'm biased, but I think there's brilliant issues brought up in the books. Take the prejudice against non-wizarding races, for example. No one cares about house elves apart from Hermione, they are pretty much abused in some cases. Look at the treatment Hagrid gets- from outright racism/creaturism from Umbridge, to even slight 'oh he's not really our sort is he?' from the Minister. Rowling shows so perfectly how these attitudes are endemic in society- you get some maniacs who believe in it really strongly, but she also shows how a LOT of people hold at least a watered down version of those views. A lot of people are still surprised by Hermione being a good witch, because she's muggle born. I think Rowling is just brilliant at showing the various ways prejudice plays out, with different levels of extremism, in different situations. The situation in the last book is basically Nazi England. People have their family histories traced, they have to register with the Ministry. That's what I think is very dark.

3) As a 'future player' he is behind (as many months as it takes for him to recover) all other player of his quality group)

I hope MvG recovers quickly, and as quickly learns how to be a true box-to-box midfielder in the premier league as soon as possible.

The formation looked really good, I'm not sure what the commentators where on about saying it was brand new after we used it a lot last season but after we warmed into it it worked for most of the game.

Big rivals: Chelsea, Arsenal and West Ham (although they're a bit shit to be honest and tend to hate us more than we hate them). They're all a bunch of cunts.

Legends: Ledley King is a god among men, Jimmy Greaves strode the penalty box like he owned it and Glen Hoddle made love to a football from midfield. There are others, but those should get you started.

We have a reputation for playing very nice, attacking football and going down in a blaze of glory rather than actually winning anything. That said, we've always had a lot of success in Cup competitions, hold a couple of cool records from our most successful period back in the 60s and we're currently enjoying the best Spurs side I've seen in my lifetime (I'm 26). In short, it's a really good time to be a fan.

Players to watch: we've just sold Gareth Bale for a world record transfer fee and bought a metric-shit-tonne of quality players to replace him. New guys to watch are Christian Eriksen, Eric Lamela, Paulinho and Roberto Soldado. Other favourites include Sandro, Jan Vertonghen and Hugo Lloris. Honestly, we've got a bunch of great players so I wouldn't advise you to look out for any one in particular.

Enjoy the game against the scum and welcome to the club!

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"That would imply Non-Muslims assimilating to Muslim culture which is not what he meant (I don't think) if both groups integrate in the proper way that word is intended neither group has to give anything up or change anything. We have rules against discrimination and violence that are sufficient to prosecute Muslims who act on some of the more screwed up part of their religion but the face they have those beliefs makes them not much different to Catholics or High Anglicans. I would consider Catholics to be integrated into British society and yet I don't think I give anything up or lose anything to have them here. Integration, to me at least means both groups living among one another lawfully and peacefully. If they do that and I let them then I don't see how many problems can arise. Being isolation so as a group may make things worse and may need to change but that goes both ways. There's plenty of media and political talk suggesting that Muslims should not be integrated with for whatever reason be it violence, sexual predation or supposed subversive views. 

It doesn't mean Muslims have to do British things - it doesn't cause me harm or loss to know or to see a Muslim living their life with their culture - and not does it mean I have to engage in or adopt any aspect of their culture.

And I've got to say that some of their actions regarding GMOs don't fill me with joy, like the other year when they were involved with those environmentalists trying to disrupt a well-conducted research project to answer some of  the questions that we need to answer before proceeding with more GMO usage. 

Obviously it's difficult to judge them on their actions as opposed to their words because they have such little influence right now.

true,OfMiceAndMouseMats,null,null,"/r/askreddit has revealed to me that some Americans love carrying around a knife in case a wild cardboard box emerges from the undergrowth and needs opening.  Don't carry a knife around as it is, in most cases, a criminal offence.  The police might well let you off if you plead ignorance, but you really don't need to carry a knife in the first place.  If you must, you can carry a sort of Swiss-army knife with a short blade.  

Don't expect waitresses and waiters to come to you for basically anything other than taking and dropping off your order and collecting your plates.  From my redditing, servers in America like to check up on you a lot.  It is also a good idea to ask for the bill at the end of the meal as it won't be brought to you otherwise.  Also, don't feel the need to tip!  You can if you want to - it is quite polite if you think you've received good service - but it ins't compulsory like in the US.

I don't speak on behalf of everyone, but we are quite a reserved people.  Just to provide context - a friend of mine went to America and an American came up to him and said, 'I've got that exact same shirt at home!  Cool!'  I'm not saying you would at home, but I wouldn't do that here.  You won't get beaten up or anything but it is unusual to just start up a conversation with a complete stranger just for the sake of it at, say, a bus stop.  

~~If you need to see a doctor, don't enquire about payment.  We've got you covered and the doctor might laugh at you.~~ You'll actually have to check about healthcare.  You'll get emergency care for free but you'll need to check to see if you are entitled to free anything else.  If I had to guess, I'd say you probably would be, but I'd check.

A 'rubber' is what you use to get rid of pencil marks, not something that stops you from catching something nasty from some woman of ill repute.  A 'fag' is a cigarette.  'Pudding' is another word for 'Dessert' and doesn't just refer to blancmange.  'Cheers' is another word for 'Thank you'.  'Alright?' tends to be a greeting rather than an actual enquiry on how you are doing, but it depends on context.  

Don't be afraid to ask if you don't understand what someone has said.  Some of our accents (geordie, yorkshire, etc) have subtitles on the telly even if the programme is just being broadcast in the UK, and a lot of slang and colloquialisms vary from city to city, so for an American it might be difficult.  I can't make out some American accents (especially deep South) I hear in films so I can empathise.

true,brettvirmalo,crest,KONE|2015,"Well done, mate. This is a good example of how, if the club just wanted to rearrange the elements, change the typefaces, and simplify shape, a competent designer could have knocked it out without much fuss. Overall composition is sound, new tower image works (though taller than the real thing), shapes bold and clear; renders well at small sizes and in one color.

The three crests for the vote exhibit none of the fundamental design competence you're showing here.

My critique (very nit-picky, but you're at that stage of the design):

* Adjusting Nil Satis typesetting to minimize the white space between letters would be wise; right now the white negative space dominates that space, and the words should be the hero down there. Interstate Bold or Extra Bold is much wider, they may allow you set your type to better fill the space.

* Maybe hunt down some simpler, bolder wreaths. Those are, by far, the most detailed elements in your crest, and don't extactly fit with the rest of the larger, bolder shapes.

* If possible, I'd increase the curve of the ribbon - see if you can eliminate the blue/black negative space between ribbon and shield but keep the yellow. Maybe tuck the curled ends behind the shield? The smaller examples show this to be an undesirable space.

* Finally, remove any superfluous elements in the tower. I think at the very least, the white border around the window (merge it with the stripe) and topmost (super tiny) dark shape on the roof could be removed.

OK.  Don't judge me.  I started watching the EPL during the 2002-2003 season.

I started to watch Chelsea games under Ranieri because I wanted to know why he was labeled as ""The Tinker Man"" Pretty soon I was just watching Chelsea matches almost exclusively(I liked the Lion crest also).

Yes he has not done well in producing numbers in the BPL but never let us down durning Champions. Even when matches aren't going Chelsea's way he always seems to be the one that never quits. He is also a fantastic play maker and not a selfish striker. Understandably yes, he is a professional but only human and the negative media towards him can't help. I think Torres would benefit from playing in a formation more like Rooney fell into when RVP arrived. Eto has or had pace. That's it. Ba is more of a predictor still striker. Chelsea even under a few mangers has had their striker. Torres. Create their chance from  20 yards and in. Torres can do that. Ba cannot. He need ball brought into him inside the 18. Eto's stile is his pace. Chelsea doesn't play long inside thro balls and that's what he likes. Also Cole, Hazard, and Ivanovic are playing the outside wings. Torres benefits from Mata and Mata from Torres. I said in a previous post I believe there might be a Spanish Portuguese rival behind doors that were not seeing. And I have now heard a few analysts make that point as well. I guess my point is, is that it's not about who is better but utilizing the talent of who you have. Time to try a new formation.

A stupid or silly person.

It's based around that. So a noddy TV show is one that's simplistic, dumbed down, trivial:

* Mastermind vs Pointless
* Frankenstein vs Twilight
* War and Peace vs The Very Hungry Caterpillar

EDIT: Found a proper source for the meaning we are using:

**noddy^3**

*Informal* very easy to use or understand; simplistic

Where people are being displaced there will always be opposition, especially where people have lived and made their lives for generations. The fact that 275 new homes are being built is negligible to the residents - if they're luxury apartments, they will be forced to leave the area as it's unlikely they'll be housed quickly in N17. If they're turned over to the council - which is very unlikely - they will command a higher cost and more than likely won't be housing those displaced.

I am all for the redevelopment as I personally loathe the walk between the train and my seat in the stadium but the article makes a valid point, one that 99.99% of us wouldn't have otherwise been aware of or - at the risk of sounding nonchalant to the human cost - really don't care about so long as there's a WHL at the end of it.",0,1380148513,null,0,1380148726,0,ccfes5u,t3_1n2xnp,t1_ccfes5u,t1_ccf0h52,null,1429342953,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

And I still fucking despise the term 'jobsworth' by the way. 

If somebody uses it about someone working hard, I discuss the fact that they take issues with people working hard and contributing to society, not the definition of the term because that's something I don't really care about. It is used as commonly to describe the 'hard worker', if not more so than it is to describe the 'unreasonable cunt'. 

I have the same technicality issues you do with 'jobsworth', with the word 'grass'. People don't technically understand what a grass is, and use it as a blanket term to describe anybody who gets police involved in anything, rather than when they are actually grassing... but that's another story and being from Liverpool is a very common stupid attitude around here.

Many people that fret over internet pornography do so because frankly, they find images to be particularly disturbing.  It's all about distribution and a global online market though.

So, the big argument isn't that standard sexual intercourse, or even imagery of sexual intercourse is particularly terrible.  Admittedly, they would prefer there was no sexual imagery, but it's things like scat porn, bestiality (I do take a hard-lined moral approach on this one though.  Animals can't consent.  Drawings and stories are whatever, but videos are not cool), and midget dungeon porn that *really* frightens them. 

Oh the depravity of it all.  People piss and shit on each other?  From the article:

&gt;Civilised society risked being undermined by ""the most bestial activities""

So it's not standard sex that frightens them, it's unorthodox, not biblically sanctioned sex that makes them think our society is declining.  Thing is though, people have been turned on by weird shit since the dawn of mankind.  What the internet does that changes the whole climate of pornographic distribution is that it allows niche markets opportunities for distribution of niche content. 

You linked to largely famous works of art, but they depicted pretty standard stuff.  Blowjobs, gay sex, orgies, etc.  Certain types of imagery are likely to be more common during certain eras and within certain cultures because our sexual interest are, not surprisingly, somewhat influenced by exposure.  If it weren't for porn, I wouldn't know some of the things it turns out I'm really in to.

So were there paintings of scat porn?  Statues of bestiality?  Yes, I'm certain there were.  The problem is, the local market for such things is small, and small minded moral policing folks likely destroyed a lot of it.  They didn't become famous because only a handful of people in any given location are going to be into that type of thing.  But, if you take it to the global stage (which is exactly what the internet does), suddenly you can produce content that will be enjoyed by all types.  Furries can get their fill, bondage folks can enjoy theirs, and people who want to watch machines fucking women?  Well, the internet has you covered.  So it's not that the internet is allowing us to become more depraved, it's that the internet is allowing people to finally find content that truly arouses them.  That's a *good* thing.",0,1380149346,null,0,false,0,ccff2ld,t3_1n0xxi,t1_ccff2ld,t1_ccevj0v,null,1429342818,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"Welcome to football mate. I am also from the States but as a Latino, I am always eager to introduce Americans to the beautiful game. As far as the game this Saturday...

Our coach used to manage Chelsea; he got canned for disappointing team performance, but Chelsea goes through 3 coaches every season. That's one bit of drama.

Both of our team are from London, so that's another bit of drama/rivalry that makes this an interesting match.

Lastly, Chelsea and Spurs make up the top 6 teams (Man U, City, Arsenal, and Liverpool), so it's guaranteed to be a good match to the trained eye. To those that watch football for the first time, they might not get how intense this fight might be, or why it might end at a draw.

Players to Watch:

Eriksen: New signing. Play-maker. His passes are deadly accurate and physics-defying. He's also got a mean cannon on both legs which allow him to make accurate long range shots. Lastly, his ability to dribble around defenders is a joy to watch. I think I'm not alone when I say he might be our best signing.

Lamela: New signing. Amazing dribbler, but finding his feet in the Premier League. Provided a key assist in our last league game. Hopefully this is the game where he finds his goal scoring instinct.

Soldado: New signing. Goal poacher from Spain. 5th leading goal scorer in La Liga (says a lot when the others are Messi, Ronaldo, and Falcao). Had a knack for scoring close range shots from the most impossible angles.

Paulinho: New signing. Midfielder from Brazil. Brazilian - 'nuff said.

Hugo Lloris: Goalie - Nice reflexes, but most impressive is his adoption of the sweeper/goalie role. Expect to see him run out of his goal to tackle on-coming strikers/attacking midfielders should our defenders fail.

Honorable mentions: 

Dembele: Midfielder - watching him play is like watching a bear gracefully ballet across the field while swatting flies trying to steal the ball from him. Not kidding.

Jan Vertonghen: defender with a knack for scoring goals and creating scoring opportunities.

Kyle Walker and Danny Rose: full-backs with blistering speed. 

Andros Townsend: winger - even faster with good ability to run at defenders. Be prepared to pull your hair when he shoots the ball repeatedly over the goal post when plenty of teammates are open.


In my opinion: Lewis Holtby: Midfielder - Has provided some beautiful assists these last couple games. He is really stepping up his game lately as there is so much competition in our squad.",0,1380149915,null,0,false,0,ccff9ko,t3_1n319g,t1_ccff9ko,t3_1n319g,null,1429342657,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Sure he misjudged a header and it lead to a goal but if Enrique doesn't lose Chicharito in the first place it wouldn't have mattered.

He was constantly an outlet for defense when they got themselves into trouble, and his set pieces were dangerous as usual. 

His role is different than years past and people are struggling to come to grips with it. He is a deep-lying playmaker, lots of teams have them but he's settled into one of the best around. He put in a solid shift today, and our captain can hold his head high.

Lucas was good today too, he did his usual clean up work efficiently and his passing was excellent. I thought him and Gerrard effectively controlled the midfield for most of the game.

And then of course there was the whole  disarming the land mines thing, she really wasn't frightened who's toes she stepped on or the media backlash (a nightmare for the palace).

Diana behaving like a paragon of virtue with all of her charities put the rest of the royal family in a bad light by comparison, they did publicly become more involved in charity work after her death but I don't think we'll ever see  public mourning on such a huge scale for any Royal like we witnessed for Diana, not even for the Queen.",0,1380150085,null,0,false,0,ccffboh,t3_1n2tu7,t1_ccffboh,t3_1n2tu7,null,1429342629,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

What next? Judges should not be questioned with regards to crimes they may have committed? People who donate to charities that support rape victims should not be questioned with regards to a rape they may have committed?  Giving people a free pass because they are probably innocent is madness.

May I just point out that two of the biggest parties in Denmark, [Socialistisk Folkeparti](http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/SF_-_Socialistisk_Folkeparti) and [Social Demokraterne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democrats_(Denmark)) are inherently Socialist and we in fact consider ourselves to be socialist in Denmark, albeit a capitalist version. If that's possible. 

Socialism certainly doesn't have any negative connotations in Scandinavia, although I will agree that Communism certainly does. 

Edit: Upon re-reading your comment, I realise you said that none of the parties would advocate a solely socialist form of government, which is accurate to an extent for Denmark (at least).

Off the ball he's been very poor. He's never been great off the ball, it's why Rafa put him on the wing. And that's what a deep-lying playmaker needs to be. Look at Pirlo or Scholes, they may not be the best defender but they're in the right place at the right time. There's a lot of times when midfields have just strolled through us this season. Shelvey's goal was a prime example. 

He is Steven Gerrard. He's a living legend, undoubtedly a top five player in the club's history, and that stops people from judging him objectively. He plays just as many sideways passes as Allen, but catches none of the stick for it. People applaud his gut-busting runs to make important tackles but don't mention that he had to make that run because he was caught out. 

Allen is more suited to the role. We should be looking for a dynamic DM to pair with him come January.

Two words of advice for the future:

* Don't book from The Trainline. They charge an extra booking fee. There are other sites that don't: you can book straight from the train company's website (and they do regular sales, so the chance of a discount is good); alternatively try [Redspottedhanky](http://redspottedhanky.com), who run a nice loyalty scheme.

I think you'd be stupid to say Mata's game is perfect. He's not a great defender, and more often that not he tends to look for the assist when he should take a shot. I think Mata has the drive that he wont take these recent comments lying down. I think JoMo knows a little criticism might light a fire under him, and show him he could be so much more that what he is now. I seem to remember Pep (I think) going on a rant to Messi when Messi was younger about how if he didn't stop drinking and eating pizza he would rot in the reserves. I feel it's that same sort of thing.

I don't think Mata will leave, especially because of his Bro-mance with Torres. I think by the end of the season, Mata could be the best player in the premier league.

So, by dropping VAT on the beer, they don't get to make any savings on the VAT (as they claim it back anyway), but we pay less VAT when we buy the beer.  
I'm still not entirely sure it adds up, though. If you have £10 to spend on beer, and beer costs £2.30/pint, including VAT @ 15% - you can afford to buy four pints, and you have 80p left.  
If the VAT is raised to 20%, beer is now £2,40/pint. You can still buy four beers, only now you have 40p left at the end of the night. The government has taken an extra 40p from you with the higher rate of VAT than at the lower rate.

At the same time America is facing record rising obesity rates across the board. There is a ton of proof that just because something feels good, tastes good, etc, that it is not good for you. People are still getting fat, smoking, drinking, eating like crap, and watching porn. These all arrive at very detrimental effects, it's just that lust is so terribly pervasive and widespread that the multitudes speak highly in favor of it, and humanity being a group mind, a social herd, seeks to adjust itself to the herd and does not worry about the individual. In fact if someone shows individualism they are ostracized, and you see this having happened to many people like Columbus, Galileo, the guy who discovered germs, etc.

The problem is that there is no debate here on reddit, people upvote what they like or want to be true not what is true, it's like all these agent Smith's are piling up on Neo but his only power is to say ""to hell with you lot, you don't argue with sense to begin with, only bias"". I mean that is the biggest problem, people like to rationalize and reason but it's usually towards all sorts of unreasonable ends.

And just, I can cook a little bit, I can write a decent joke but that about it. I tell you what sent me into a uber dimension of depression was that austrian dude last year Fritzl, Josef Fritzl. Now I don't know if you y'all remember there was this dude he held his daughter hostage for 24 years had seven babies with her and kept them locked in a dungeon that he built and kept it all secret from his wife. Let me ask you all a question how many of y'all know a man who can build a dungeon? I can't do that. I got friends who build houses they can't build dungeons. I'm just saying next to Fritzl I feel incompetent. 

Ooops sorry wrong Reg joke! ;)

&gt;But within that group of nice white people there's another group of white people and they're really really nice but they're real nervy, socially nervous. Awkward, constantly afraid that they're going to do the wrong thing. Say the wrong thing, not properly observe your customs. And a lot of them have a secret fear that they might be racist, but they don't know it. ""What if I'm racist but I don't know it? What if I run around doing racist things every day and I don't know it? What if I patronise racist institutions and take advantage of them and?"" And sometimes they panic and one of the things they do is try to run out and befriend an ethnic minoirity. They feel like, ""Well if I'm friends with an Ethnic minority how can I be racist?"" It's like being blessed by a black and sometimes what they really want is an ethnic minority to run things past. Just to see if stuff is racist or not you know? You know that TV series Love thy neighbour? Comedy classic or Racist? I was at a bar having a drink minding my own business guy walks up, white guy, friendly, joking, laughing. Suddenly he gets serious and he says, ""I need to ask you something."" I said, ""OK, what you got?"" ""I might have been racist recently but I'm not sure."" I said ""Aight..."" ""I was at a Cinema last tuesday and I bumped into a black guy and I said, 'Sorry didn't see you.' Now, you tell me was that racist?"" I'm like, ""Fuck man, I don't know. Was there hatred in your heart when you said it?""

true,mg117,null,null,"The British were indeed exhausted after the events of operation dynamo, which resulted in the near total loss of equipment including tanks, artillery and other such heavy weapons that would be required to fight off the seemingly inevitable invasion of Britain by Germany. 

However, what isn't taken into account by those clumsy with history is that  Germany was also exhausted by this point. German forces were depleted after having conquered numerous countries(Poland,France ect) which were astounding victories but had a great cost in Men/Machines/Resources. This, along with the fact that Germany's military had only recently developed into anything resembling a modern army, due to Versailles restrictions, meant that by the time Germany had reached the Channel it no longer had the energy/momentum that previously existed at the start of the blitzkrieg. Therefore Britain, in hindsight, was never really as close to invasion/close to destruction as believed

Operation Sea Lion (German invasion plan), therefore, is seen by many historians as a rather half-hearted  plan, one which Hitler wasn't particularly concerned about and one which seemed too difficult to be worth undertaking.
Not only have you the exhaustion of the German forces post-blitzkrieg but also these factors making an invasion too difficult an investment:

1) Lack of landing barges: No boats to ferry troops ashore, at least none to speak off, leading to hasty construction of landing barges unsuited for role and unlikely to have been even able to make it across the channel

2) Royal Navy: The Battle of Britain was not the Battle for Britain. It was simply for control of the skies. Had the Germans won this battle, the landings would still have had to face the might of the greatest naval fleet on the planet at the time, which undoubtedly would have been called from all 4 corners of the globe to defend the home nation. The much weaker kriegsmarine wouldn't have been able to match the Royal Navy's dominance over the Channel. Ergo no landing crafts, so even if the Germans had the skies, they would not have been able to control the sea. True, air attacks would have caused casualties amongst the Royal navy but Germany's air force at the time consisted of land- attack bombers fresh from the blitzkrieg, and not suited for naval attack like the Japanese planes were at Pearl Harbour. 

3) Hitler just wasn't that interested in invading due to his plans for the future Barbarossa operation taking shape. The British were beaten, it seemed, and it would have been incredibly costly to fully invade and finally destroy the country once and for all.Hitler also probably assumed that the UK would attempt to sue for peace, considering their situation, and was therefore of little immediate threat (at least to Europe). 

Therefore, although it didn't seem like it at the time for the terrified islanders, Britain was much safer than many think. America did not save the British, for by the time the Americans entered the war(1942)  the threat of invasion had long passed, which was at its height in 1940. The British saved themselves through their stunning air force/ navy and home front. 

What America did offer the British included money, loans, equipment. Maybe not decisive but very much needed. America did indeed ease Britain's darkest hour, but by no means did it save it. And as for saving Europe, well had it not been for Britain's willingness to stay in the war and allow itself to be used as a staging platform for the liberation of Europe, then it is quite possible that Europe would still be under the influence of Facism or perhaps even Communism. 

TLDR: Britain more secure at the time than believed, Invasion not as likely as believed, Britain secured its own safety way before direct American intervention and stayed in war to act as frontline for the liberation of Europe, using American/British/Canadian and other Commonwealth troops.",0,1380157354,null,0,1380157673,0,ccfhpn0,t3_1mychb,t1_ccfhpn0,t1_ccf5wqs,null,1429341515,9,false,INGLIN,t5_2v1ve,9

    Mignolet

For the backline, I would have had Toure sit slightly deeper than Skrtel and Sakho.  I probably would have pre-planned on Lucas to come off at half time as he needed a rest (was obvious before the game started really) and shifted Skrtel to center CB, Toure to CDM, and Ilori to RCB.  Would have weakened the back line a bit without Kolo in it to coordinate, but there was no way Lucas was going to make 90 minutes today and it would have been good experience for Ilori.

Major mistakes for me today were:

* Playing Gerrard (really needs a rest)
* Not playing more youth players to let them gain experience

In any case, it's a similar argument to that of violent video games. Children shouldn't be shown inappropriate material, I agree, and vendors place what controls on it that they can within reason, but it's the responsibility of the parent to monitor and/or control their child's exposure to the dangers that lurk on the internet.

Don't want your kids accessing porn on their smartphone? Why on earth are you giving your child a device that allows them unfettered to access the internet without adequate controls? Disable the data plan on the phone, [install a web filtering app](http://www.netnanny.com/mobile), or just give them a dumbphone - what does your kid really need a smartphone for? Are they expecting an urgent email or something? Explain to them that there are things out there that they are too young to fully understand yet. If they try and argue against it, then don't budge. Seriously, you're meant to be a parent, and you are meant to be the one who makes the rules.

They might be exposed by other kids at school, sure, you can't do much about that, but hopefully by that point you've had the birds and the bees talk, and you've explained to them that there is some dangerous and weird shit out on the internet, and it doesn't represent real life. Hopefully you've instilled at least some of your values on to your kid for them to allow them to make a decision as to whether it is a representation of real life things, or weird stuff, themselves.

They're going to reach an age where they're curious about sex, and the chances are that they're going to eventually stumble across porn in some form through their curiosity anyway; the best you can do as a parent is to prepare them for that moment. Simply shielding them from it by blocking porn on the entire internet, and thus absolving you of the responsibility of raising your child from a world that is full of weird things, is doing nothing more than bubble wrapping them and leaving them unprepared when they have to experience that kind of content in the real world when you can't supervise them.

I'm almost certain Mourinho will start Lampard, who is really an incredible footballing mind and will have read our tactics from the very beginning. It will take a very aggressive sort of possession based football with a lot of very quick closing down and excellent ball movement to retain both the possession and territorial advantage necessary to play effectively through the middle. Also, whoever plays left back will have to have a world class game, because Ivanovic has the very lethal combination of pace and strength that makes him almost unmarkable coming out of the back. I can't at all predict what will happen this game because this match up is pretty ridiculous. If we can stamp our authority over the middle third the game will go our way. If not, it could be a very long evening.

Basically, at home we should be golden because most teams try to cede possession and park the bus anyway, but I think Chelsea will come out very strong and play a physical and fast paced game.

true,0_-,null,null,"We are witnessing the beginning of the end. If you want to go way back to the days where humanity was just beginning, let's say as far back as the Akkadian Empire back in 24th and 22nd centuries BC. The entire empire fell apart because the agriculture failed and they all starved out. So that is how their empire was destroyed.

Ours runs in the opposite direction. We are overfeeding on everything. The result of that is not that we simply starve to death, but that we die of gluttony. It is an unnatural death, because it is unnatural to have so much food. Food, mind you, is metaphorical in this case. We are gluttonous with porn, with media consumption, with whatever. This has enormous consequences. 

Basically it boils down to the fact that with basic instinctive needs being met, the mental or ideological needs start becoming the basis of fear. At the beginning of World War II for example, before that even, it might not have been that people were starving, the problem was that they had to use a wheel barrow of money to buy bread. So it is an ideological problem, a mental thing. Money is imaginary, it has value that we assign to it. If they wanted to be fascist about baking bread instead of baking Jews then they could have ran in that direction too, and had lots of delicious bread. Then they would have food, clothing, and shelter, and everyone would be fine. But see, it's not like that, it's an ideological thing. Pride. Domination. 

And I mean you see that everywhere nowadays, everyone argues and wants to be right, people want to seem like gods, decorate themselves with medals and degrees from universities and just show that they are fit to dominate those who did not achieve such heights.

This is all interrelated and mixed in with sex, no one wants to have sex with someone below them, we always aspire for the heights, and we want security, and we want to exploit the world, to have all sorts of sensations and experiences.

Reality is far different. We don't accept life for what it is, we don't find a way of living that is in sync with what the planet and society can provide. We don't dominate our impulses, or bother to save in an age where pensions are ceasing to exist. We are setting ourselves up for destruction of group cohesion through violation of the social contract, ideological fear based propaganda sending billions of well fed, well clothed and well sheltered human beings to their death based on thoughts and just unconsciousness. If we were all conscious that we are doing OK and everyone is being fed to some extent, and we have shelter and clothing, then we would be getting rid of all these nukes and having a nuclear free world, but we allow unconsciousness (fear, angst) dominate us, and we allow pornography to mess up our expectations of how sexual life should be which harms family cohesion, and I could go on and on, this is not a simple thing to explain, but you get the general drift. Not to mention we sell each other down the river, with all these fake for profit universities popping up in the US just to cheat people.

true,ReservoirDog316,null,null,"Read Songs of Solomon and you'll see that it's poor form to say the bible talks down to sex within marriage.  Outside of marriage is bad but in marriage, SoS is very thorough in saying to just do what you want.  The bible even says as long as your partner consents, anything done within the married bed is fine.  

To put it in perspective, there's a mistranslated part of SoS where the guy is complimenting the girl from toe to head (he earlier did from head to toe).  In our bible, he starts giving compliments at her feet then legs then belly button then hips then breasts and ect.  Notice something off there? It's out of order since the hips should come before the belly button.  But if you look at the original translation, it's pretty clear it should've been translated to describe her vagina.  And the compliment for it was that it was a ""goblet filled with the best wine for drinking.""  

So yeah, before marriage is a clear abstinence message but once you're married, everything's permissible with your partner.  And for the record, there isn't a single line in SoS about getting pregnant as the goal after all that.  It's purely for enjoyment.  Any other view is contrary to what the bible teaches.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"Well now let's examine some companions in which this is not the case, shall we? 

Susan: Doctor's grand daughter, ran away from Gallifrey with him, travels with him because of a sense of him being the last connection she has with her home and has a tendency to end up in sticky situations but is devilishly clever and leaves him when she finds a new home (Earth post Dalek invasion)

Barbara: Ended up in the tardis by accident, generally doesn't get on with the doctor and a few times it saves their lives. (Also had a fellow teacher travelling with her named Ian who was also there by accident, they get to be somewhat romantic as it goes on but being stranded with a madman in a box for two years is probably enough to do that to any two people)

Polly: Literally just travelling with the doctor because it looked fun (Again with a guy friend who felt the same named Ben, no romantic involvement).

Zoe: Cocky genius, thought the doctor and Jamie were intellectually ill equipped to go on escapades alone so decided to go with them, was already the head scientific something something for a space station but I think it got blown up, I'm not sure some idiot burnt the tapes.

Liz: Not quite a genius but a quite brilliant scientist, chief scientific adviser to UNIT before the doctor came along, perfectly capable of taking care of herself except for that one time she got slashed up by a silurian, but we all know they're dangerous for anyone.

Jo: Traveled with the doctor because it was fun (And technically her job I suppose) managed to best The Master a couple of times (Yeah, that's how awesome she was) so, clearly very capable of taking care of herself.

Sarah Jane Smith: Led a rebellion against the doctor in medieval England because she thought he was evil leading to him being captured and put in a dungeon by her and some knights, nuf said.

Leela: Referred to as ""Savage"" occasionally because she came from a prehistoric planet and could work wonders with a knife, generally had the role in episodes of killing lots of whatever the enemy of the week was, probably the biggest badass in the show.

Romana: Initially sent by the High Council to help the Doctor find the key to time, stayed because it was fun. All round genius if initially inexperienced (Having never left Gallifrey) grows into being awesome, all around very good at saving the Doctor's life.

Tegan: Wildcard really, ended up on the Tardis by accident, stayed because the Master killed her Aunty (closest relative) has a tendency to run off on her own, occasionally this ends well, other times it ends badly, like I said, wildcard. 

Ace: Was bored of Earth, went with the Doctor because it was fun, makes her own explosives, listens to jazz, had a baseball bat super-weapon for a while, used it to murder a bunch of daleks. Total badass.

Donna Noble: Already gone into it.

Adelaide Brooke: Apparently she counts, I'm sure you don't need reminding of her total badassery.

Amy Pond: Grew up with the Doctor (technically) was certainly motivated initially by fear of commitment, stayed because it was fun and the Doctor's her best friend, again, because she (technically) grew up with him.

River Song: Travels with the doctor because it's fun and she's a total badass.",0,1380174374,null,0,false,0,ccfmrpi,t3_1n1cpz,t1_ccfmrpi,t1_ccfm5a8,null,1429339156,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Things you need to know: 
1) we all hate the gooners, they're called Arsenal, but we call them Woolwich, but you've already seen that.

2) Ledley King and Bill Nicholson are names you simply have to know. In recent years we have seen a legend born in Ledley king. He had a knee injury basically his whole career but still played for us for years. He only ever played for Tottenham. Bill Nicholson managed us in the 60's and is definitely our most successful coach. He's also been quoted as saying some really awesome stuff (just look at the sidebar) 

3) We want to finish fourth. That's all that really matters. 4th means champions league football (that's Europe's elite competition) and that's where every club wants to be, we've tasted it once, we want it back.

To make matters worse I live in Cornwall which is apparently one of the pilot areas for the ""Rural broadband rollout""  For 2.5 years my village waited to see if we would get a connection.  When the time came our cabinet wasn't connected to fiber due to the distance from the exchange.  We are now waiting see if we are to be offered a deal via Tooway satellite (well known for poor service, data-capping and port blocking) or something on G3.

true,Froolow,null,null,"Non serious bipolar disorder costs the NHS something like £10-15k to treat overall. Serious bipolar disorder costs more like £70-90k to treat overall (I don't have the exact figures to hand because I'm not at work, but I know I've got the orders of magnitude right because I remember thinking that a serious bipolar disorder patient costs almost as much to treat as a child with leukaemia). Figures are similar but less striking for depressive and personality disorders because they cost more to treat in their non-serious forms.

One of the big - probably the biggest - reason people delay seeking treatment for non-serious mental health problems is the stigma. Nobody bats an eyelid if you go to hospital for a heart stent related to your history of heavy smoking or overeating but woe betide anyone who lets slip that they have a fluoxetine prescription; people assume you are a mentally unstable maniac who is only one stay neurone away from murdering yourself and everyone around you. Because of this, many people who *should* have a prescription don't (and, we might note with some irony, this means they are far more likely to harm themselves). If there were no stigma at all about mental health - if it were treated as any other disease - it would be a hell of a lot easier to cure or treat people with these conditions, although there are still reasons mental health patients are a particularly tricky class of patients to treat (for example there are consent issues surrounding patients with severe psychopathy who don't really know where they are)

So back to Asda; it is hard to argue that this costume does much for removing the stigma around mental health. Even naming the costume 'Axe-wielding psychopath' wouldn't be perfect, because psychopathy is a legitimate medical disorder, but at least that is *better* than naming it 'mental patient' and grouping about quarter of the population under the same stigmatising umbrella.

So you ask 'what is dangerous?', and the answer is that if this costume is the nudge that causes one single non-serious bipolar disorder patient to delay treatment until they are seriously bipolar (perhaps thinking either, 'I don't want people to think i do things like that' or 'Because i dont do things like that i cant be mentally ill') the harm is about £60,000, plus the personal and social costs of allowing a disease which can be effectively managed in its non-serious form but can really only be palliated when it progresses to progress.

I'm a bit of a zealot about the NHS, but not so much that I don't see there is a clear reason not to ban *everything* that might stigmatise mental health patients. On the other hand, this isn't a 'ban', this is sufficient people who feel like me writing to Asda and Asda taking the decision that the bad publicity was not worth sticking to their (very stupid) guns.",0,1380186458,null,0,1380186684,0,ccfokff,t3_1n5ows,t1_ccfokff,t1_ccfmw99,null,1429338229,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It also solves the problem of how you play with Suarez and Sturridge because you can just play the two of them up front. However, we can see Rodgers switching back to the 4-2-3-1 he has been using so far this year. They’ve made a good start to the season, so switching formations completely might be slightly foolish.    
    
I think the jury is still out on whether we've have a good start or a lucky start to the season.    
Our first run of wins were by no means attack focused. We scored early and played defensively for the duration, not to mention the lack of turning up at all for the 2nd half.    
    
Apart from the fact that this formation was ""forced"" due to player availability, I think this is the evolution the squad needs to pose more of a threat.

Next thing he gets a letter with a fine through the door with a pic of the car and a pic of him sleeping so he approached a lawyer friend of his. Basically they can't enforce it, it's rubbish. Don't even send them a letter telling them you're not paying, seemingly that's like admitting you're in some way responsible and if you do they'll likely pursue it. Just ignore it completely. 

Funny really, you have those signs on the motorway: ""Tiredness can kill, take a break"" so you take a break, fall asleep, and they try and fine you for it.

The real issue of 'offensive' is however that in Group A, the only group that gets any press is the people in Group B. And by giving the label of group A to something specifically in group B you are implying a level of majority ownership of the group, or at least massively overblowing it in public perception; implying a much greater percentage of overlap then the reality, and giving a larger stigma to anyone in Group A as people think they might be in Group B as it's all they ever hear about (Statistically unlikely).

true,da__,null,null,"It seems like the 70s and 80s have tackled all the easy targets: the legislation was enacted and the idea that it's okay for women to work full time, just like her husband, has finally caught on. Now we're on to the tough stuff.

First, I don't think ""the number of women aged 16 to 64 in work"" (or men, for that matter) is at all a useful metric. Between 16 and 18, most people are full-time in high school/college, many don't work because they don't need to or don't have the time. An increasing number of women go to university, which can also put them out of the workforce. You can see lecture theatres literally filled with women these days, I'd imagine few of them also work. I think a more useful metric should start at about 25, or at least exclude those in non-work full-time programmes from the pool.

&gt; Though there are now some 13.4 million women aged between 16-64 in work, many are still in low-paid jobs and they are far less likely than men to be in charge, the study found.

That is a problem, but it's inter-connected to my next point: child-bearing. Women, by necessity, must take a break from work around the time of birth. The length of the break differs from case to case and depends on medical benchmarks, but at some point a break, even if it's only a week or so, must be taken. This cannot be escaped unless we find a different way to reproduce. This is the ""motherhood penalty"", as during the break (which often lasts several weeks, if not months), the woman often doesn't get to further her career, in fact, she sometimes even takes a step back.

&gt; Daisy Sands, policy manager at the Fawcett Society, believes the latest figures are further evidence that women still face a “motherhood penalty” at work.
&gt;
&gt; She said: “Women in the UK still tend to do the lion’s share of childcare. Add to this the lack of flexible working opportunities and prohibitively expensive childcare, and we face a situation where, for women, work all too often doesn’t pay.

Preferably, the child's father would also take a break, even if much shorter, to care for his child, but, unfortunately, very often they simply can't afford it at all. If it's the couple's first child, up until a few weeks ago the couple have had two people earning money, and suddenly there's only one person having to feed three.

&gt; Having a baby makes a man much more likely to be employed and a woman significantly less likely.

Exactly. The woman *can't*, the man *has to*.

&gt; Diane Elson, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Essex and chair of the Women’s Budget Group, believes the gender gap will not close until the workplace is radically rethought.

I agree with her wholeheartedly. We still organise our workplaces the way we have organised them before the war, when - at least in the middle class (on which we're basing our current society) - it was the woman's job to take care of the home, while the man's job was to pay for it. If they're both working the way we have ""always"" worked, either the home isn't taken care of, or the work isn't being done to the same standard.

&gt; Susan Himmelweit, professor of economics at the Open University, believes low pay for women creates a vicious circle, as it makes them less likely to stay in work after having children. She said: “So long as you have a gender pay gap – and these figures show you certainly do – it’s going to be the case that, if you’re in a couple and you’re only going to have one worker, it makes more sense for it to be the man in employment.”

It's simple logic.

Now, what can we do about it? The problem (and thus the solution) is twofold.

First of all, girls should be encouraged to study science and engineering. It shouldn't be weird or wrong for a teenage girl to take a great interest in a science subject. I think it's a social problem: teens seek approval from their peers, and the girl's peers will often reject the ""nerd"". An equal proportion of men and women should study and graduate with science or engineering degrees, there is no logical reason why it should be otherwise. Note that we can't achieve this synthetically, by artificially inflating the number of women entering the fields through quota systems. We still need the best scientists and engineers, and if currently it's mostly men, so be it. We can't just reject a bright male student to make room for half-arsed a female student. We must encourage *girls* to take up interest in early teens and make sure they follow through. Taking interest in a science and being smart shouldn't be something to be ashamed of, it's something to be proud of, and we must teach our children to recognise that, so that *they* encourage their friends. It's also important that we find successful females in male-dominated fields and make leaders out of them, take them to almost a celebrity status if we have to (of course, within reason). We need to show young girls that being a scientist or engineer or whatever doesn't make you any less of a woman. Then we'll have the ""women are all in the service sector"" problem ticked off.

Secondly, as prof. Himmelweit said, the workplace needs to be re-organised. The world has changed dramatically and the workplace system needs to reflect it. We must work less and be able to take more irregular breaks. Men should be encouraged and allowed to take paternity breaks. A break in employment due to the woman wanting to concentrate on her child during the first months of its growth - something very beneficial both for the family and for the newly-born person - not only cannot be seen as something negative, impacting her growth, it must be treated as something positive and encouraged. Bringing up a child teaches you important skills (like organisation), and those skills should be recognised by employers. The government could take a role here, offering training to mothers wanting to get back to work. Government-provided income, such as Child Benefit, is also a form of income, and compensates mothers for taking a hit to their salary/wage. Changing the system in a way that it doesn't negatively impact mothers is, of course, preferable to the government taking up the responsibility and spending tax money on what should be the employers' responsibility.",0,1380194329,null,0,false,0,ccfpfzt,t3_1n5zsj,t1_ccfpfzt,t3_1n5zsj,null,1429337820,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Taxation can be viewed as theft when it is spent against the interests of the electorate, ie as Zuma's governments have been prone to doing in SA. The rate is irrelevant.

As noted by the article, only BT and Fujitsu bid. This was basically because only BT and Fujitsu had the resources to pull it off, and BT's bid was cheaper and more realistic than Fujitsu's. IIRC the bids didn't all get settled at the same time, the Midlands + Wales were the first areas and once Fujitsu realised that their bids were way higher than BT's, they pulled out of the other areas. 

BT did take the bidding process very seriously, and from what I saw, was obsessed with pricing the whole thing up accurately and fairly (it was a nightmare involving *huge* quantities of data)

You can criticise BT for a lot of things, but the rural broadband thing is not really fair - there was just nobody else who could realistically have done it, and TBH it was a waste of everyone's time and resources putting it to tender in the first place.

**edit**: Also having read the rest of the article:

&gt;BT was further criticised in the report for failing to provide local authorities with full information about where exactly it would roll out superfast broadband services, which in turn hampered rivals from drawing up alternatives.

So basically BT was criticised for not letting it's rivals see the details of it's bid. Newsflash! That's how bidding processes work! You don't let your rivals see your hand.

&gt;And it was criticised for including a clause in its contract preventing local authorities it dealt with from disclosing the costs involved to other authorities negotiating contracts.

Again, this is how bidding processes work - you don't let your customer tell other customers what deal they got out of you, because then *everyone will want the same deal*. 

&gt;This lack of transparency meant the company ""exploited its quasi-monopoly position"" to limit access to both the wholesale and retail market ""to the detriment of the consumer"", concluded the report.

No, you asked an enormous, private company to tender for providing services. It put it's bid in. One other company bid and their bid was shit. So you only had one choice.

Most of this boils down to BT acted like a private company seeking profits. If you think that's a problem, blame Thatcher.",0,1380197158,null,0,1380197894,0,ccfpv49,t3_1n5adl,t1_ccfpv49,t3_1n5adl,null,1429337624,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Other than the Chicarito goal we were fairly solid the whole game through; and hell, we even played the 2nd half.

My MOTM was Enrique (and I'm sure I'll get flamed because of his corner blunder) but he played out of his skin yesterday. He was a total barricade over the ball in our half, finding passes to get out of presses, he was linking up well with Suarez, Moses, and Lucas; and you could tell the small rest helped him greatly. 

I truly enjoy the formation, I'm worried however that it's just a bandaid until Cou and Glen get back. 

When they do I could see Cou playing Moses' role, Glen going back to his spot, Hendo in the middle of a the park with Stevie (Lucas is VERY fatigued early on now and it's showing to even the gaffer).

Tl;dr - best complete game we've played in a while, I hope we don't learn this and try to adapt to the 4-3-3 when the lads come back from injury because we played a complete game w/ good passing and fair shooting.

We meet on every Monday night at the Nottingham Hackspace (on Roden St) theoretically between 7 and 9 in the evening, but more usually from 7ish to whenever everyone gets bored and goes home (which can be 9, or midnight, depending on how the session goes...) 

There is no obligation to be a member of the Hackspace (though of course we'd recommend it, because the Hackspace is awesome) and we are open to every level of ability from ""what on earth is this object with strings"" to blinding master of the arts, and we've a few uke's that folks can borrow if they've not got their own, and a couple of guitars. 

The rule is that everyone should be playing and having fun, so if someone is struggling then we change up, or slow down or whatever - it's about the fun and learning as we go. Chords are put up on a big projector, so everyone can keep up.

We've developed a little from the pure ukulele beginnings that are talked about in those links, and now incorporate a couple of banjos, guitar, bass and an occasional fiddler, and stray into American Old Time music fairly regularly.

Anyone is free to bring music or a song and we'll give it a shot.

Not only are they still incredibly important to being able to understand current culture and politics on both a local and world scale they are key to understanding both our own and other peoples history. There is also, for example, a huge value in the intersect between theology and philosophy and many other valuable things that can be learnt from their study.  

Most importantly the dogmatically rejecting teaching about them is a promotion of ignorance and you should be ashamed for even thinking it. It means nothing for a child to not be religious because they haven't been exposed to it and everything for them to have the knowledge they need to make their own informed choices about it. A child who reject religion based on the merit of their arguments and beliefs is a better informed member of our society and can defend the idea of separation of church and state based on an actual understanding of the issue at play.

This idea that religious eduction has to be about instilling belief is misguided and dangerous. The idea of not teaching about religions at all is, frankly, horrifying. Those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it and a society with out religion due to ignorance is no better than one that is religious for the same reasons. 

In short if you don't think children can be trusted when, presented with the evidence, to choose your side over the other then you really must have no actual conviction that you are right in the first place.

/s No, seriously, that is a common misconception but the prices are absolutely not the same.  
Tesco, Sainsbury's, et al can and do adjust prices to match. The rent they're paying on a city centre unit to open an Express will be far higher per square foot... they argue they need to make that back, it's just economics.

/u/threedaymonk is also correct that they only stock branded versions of items, selling for far more. But there's more to it than that - deals are totally different, so BOGOF-style offers often don't exist, and prices do change on *identical* products. Example:

    Large Tesco: Sells bananas by weight. (Around 68p/kg iirc). One banana is about 8-9p  
    Express: Sells bananas individually. 18p each

Eggs are another good one. In a large store, six battery eggs are under £1, and if you get a good deal then free-range may be £1.10-£1.40.  
In an Express-style store, you will pay £1.60-£2+

Cadbury's chocolate fingers stand out in my memory! Large store: £1, sometimes even 2 for £1. Small store: one box for £1.86-£2.20.  
How is that not a big deal? I am aware chocolate biscuits are not a low-budget purchase, but I'm damned if I'm going to pay double price for my shopping.

However, only the sith deal in absolutes.

Consequently when they and other parents take the opportunity to set up a school which will provide this, they deserve praise.

The same for Jews who are already an extreme minority but want the deep cultural ties associated with a Jewish education to help them interact and bond with their families and their heritage.

Hell, most people don't even know who the Baha'i are or what the Mormons believe. They just want their children educated within a certain cultural background.

We don't realise it, but our books, our language, our history, our assemblies are all deeply culturally English without us knowing. This is a small reaction to that, and considering they are taxpayers too, their views on education should not just be subject to the tyranny of the majority.

true,jtanz0,english,England (South Coast),"There are more to schools than their particular religious affiliations. OFSTED results (national rankings) play a massive part in where parent want their children to go to school. 

Some schools are better than others, this can be for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with faith affiliations. For example some head teachers are better at their jobs than others so end up with a better school this attracts better teachers who want to work in a good school. 

As another example is that it's an unfortunate truth that parents in more affluent areas tend to have more time and/or money (resources, tutors etc.) to invest in their children's education. This means that those schools in more affluent areas tend to have better results which means better OFSTED results which in turn attracts better staff and the cycle continues.

Schools constantly strive to do better in their OFSTED results because it means more parents are willing to send their children there so they get more funding. Also the better you do in OFSTED the less frequently you're inspected and ask any teacher when their job is the most stressful and they'll say during an OFSTED inspection.

Millions of years of evolution is based around a woman giving birth to her child and needing to nurture it.

There's also the fact it doesn't actually let you avoid much tax at all. It lets you avoid tax on any profits you give to the charity, but that means for every pound you donate you only safe about 30p. To actually pay £0 tax you would need to donate your entire net profit to charity, not just give to charity the amount you would have needed to pay in tax- no company does that. If you hide your actual net profit, that's no longer just tax avoidance, and some companies do that but it definitely isn't legal.

Most tax avoidance is done by moving your offices to/goods through a tax haven, liberally interpreting untested bits of law, using tax shelters, etc. It's interesting looking at all the ways people figure out how you can do it, including a few that involve setting up offices in several different countries, some of which have intentionally high taxes

The TUC has pledged a three-mile march against cuts to the National Health Service (NHS) that will pass the venue of the Conservative conference before protesters hold a rally, named Save Our HNS, at Manchester’s Whitworth Park.

The key rally will be attended by opposition Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham as well as leaders of the TUC and three of Britain’s largest unions Unite, Unison and the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union.

According to TUC, the protesters will address the impact of massive job and spending cuts as well as privatization of the most lucrative services on NHS.

The body says the latter is especially scandalous as many of the private companies slated to take over the services have been major donors to the Conservative party.

From what I understand the best thing for a child's education is to have a stable home life (feeling loved, supported with minimal upheaval from moving around/ parental relationship changes etc.); for the parents to believe in, prioritise and invest in their child's education e.g. reading with their child, helping and encouraging with homework and for parents to set appropriate boundaries which are consistently enforced.

Unfortunately no amount of money can substitute for this and the way of the world is (and this is a massive generalisation so of course there are exceptions) parents who are better off have more stable home life, are more likely to value education and have more time to invest in their kids.

true,DoctorWedgeworth,null,null,"There's a property bubble in London at the minute due to a load of money being invested in the property market from people in southern Europe, so there could be a crash. That shouldn't affect you unless you want to sell, and in fact is an extra reason to use that Government scheme because the amount you pay back is 20% of the property price at the time, not the amount you borrowed, so it insulates you a little against falling property prices.  

At your wage, assuming no bad credit and £5k deposit, you should be able to get a mortgage for half of that amount easily. You might be able to get a mortgage for the full amount with a full 5% deposit. The 20% equity loan mean it counts as a 25% deposit in the eyes of the mortgage so that helps, but seek a financial advisor.  

Buying a house with a friend seems like a good way to lose a friend to me. Have you tried living with them already? To me a much better idea would be if you both bought your own two-bed flat near one another and both rented the spare rooms out. You can rent out a room for £354/month tax-free under the rent-a-room scheme, which probably wouldn't be far off half of your mortgage. Speak with a financial advisor to see if that's a possibility.  

EDIT: Don't forget to factor into account solicitors fees, mortgage fees, maintenance fees for flats, the amount needed to furnish the whole flat because it will be an empty new build, paying for a bin etc. as a rule of thumb expect to have to pay around £2,000 on top of the cost to buy the place for the luxury of doing so.  

EDIT2: Also, you really need to be able to save to pay off the amount you borrowed off the Government. They don't make this overly clear, but it's interest free for 5 years, then a fixed percentage for a year (4% I *think* but research it), then it goes up a certain amount every year (I think it's inflation plus 1% but I could be wrong).

The reason some shops don't accept cards on small transactions is that there is a minimum flat rate fee, which eats into their profits more for lower value transactions.

Amex is different...

Amex has higher fees, so that's why its not accepted everywhere. The reason they can charge higher fees to merchants and still be in business is because they are (primarily) charge cards which *have* be repaid in full every month *but* have no credit limits, additionally with charge cards your credit is with the store, not Amex, so if you pay for something on Amex, the store doesn't get the money from Amex, until you pay your bill. 

So if you run an airline, you're unlikely to be able to pay for your £12,000 return first class plane ticket to sydney on a credit card, but you will on Amex, this is also why businesses use them.

REALLY? How stupid are you? I'm surprised you can breathe on your own. 
I don't know what history books you've been reading......obviously 1 titled, ""The Fantasy Outcome of the Revolutionary War"".

The FACTS of the Revolutionary War, not the FICTION you created in your head are that the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the American War of Independence, or simply the Revolutionary War in the United States, began as a war between the Kingdom of Great Britain, gradually growing into a larger world conflict. 

 The main result was an American victory and European recognition of the independence of the United States, with mixed results for the other powers. The craziest part is that at the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies &amp; the Americans began the war with significant disadvantages compared to the British. They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. 
And yet here we are, the UNITED States of AMERICA. 

I'm not trying to be an ass like you. If I WERE, I'd point to another prominent war in history that had it's turning point BECAUSE of U.S. involvement, but I'm not going to sink to your level. 

As stated so beautifully by monsieur_disparu, this isn't a ""violent takeover"", it's just something American fans of the show are trying to make happen in order to demonstrate our respect &amp; love for Doctor Who. 

And to another comment, WHY in the world would fans of Doctor Who in the US, start a petition to light up Big Ben or some other iconic British structure Tardis blue on the 50th? Why? Because we're in the US, seems to me that British citizens should start their OWN petition to do something like that. Besides, I'm 100% sure that should fans of Doctor Who in the US start a petition to light up Big Ben or another iconic British structure Tardis blue, you'd be bitching that we had no right to do that b/c those are BRITISH STRUCTURES, since we are American. 

Damned if we do, damned if we don't. Look, Doctor Who is a British creation, no 1 is disputing that. I'm so very sorry if it bothers you so much that there are American fans of the show, trying to honor DW in a prominent way on our countries soil. I had no idea showing our respect &amp; adoration for a British created show would create such negativity on the whole.

The USA only provided support to the European effort after all technological developments by the British were given to the USA.

The only way the USA would support the war in Europe was by securing Arms Leases with the UK, The return of territories in the Americas along with strict diplomatic orders to de-colonise the east Indies and Northern Africa. In the process, the USA developed a monopoly on Arms and Vehicle trade with the UK and British Empire.

The USA economy boomed and from that point on the USA was a global super power, the most powerful country in the world. If you think there was no profiteering going on, you're very naive. It continues to happen today, the modern USA unfortunately built it's legacy and prosperity from Warfare. Inevitably when the War ended, the sheer size of the USA was unsustainable. Which leads people to believe that is the reason we see so many wars with the USA in modern history. Their economy thrives at war. Their people are nice and their culture is like ours, But their Industries and Government makes so much money from war, it's scary. It's also why they have the largest military budget.

[Here](http://scoobysworkshop.com/calorie-calculator/) is one calculator to help you work out your Base Metabolic Rate and your Total Daily Energy Expenditure. [Here](http://thefitgirls.com/tdee-calculator.aspx) is another one. I would recommend googling and getting numbers from a few different sources in order to get an average - Some calculators strike me as overstating my TDEE.)

I'm currently trying to reduce my bodyfat percentage, and so am keeping to a 1800 calorie limit per day (regardless of how much exercise I do). I have a protein shake each morning in place of breakfast ([This](http://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/impact-whey-protein/10530943.html?menu=a) one - choc mint flavour if you're interested) which works out to about 400 calories for 2 scoops and a pint of skimmed milk. I find this works brilliantly for me, and is quite cheap.

Whether you drink it before or after your run will be down to personal preference. Personally, I prefer to train on an empty stomach, so I don't feel sick. I'll also be hungry post-training so putting off a shake until after exercising means that its easier to keep my calories low.

Reducing carbs is an excellent way to start cutting calories. I find 'boil in the bag' rice very helpful for limiting portion size, as you can get some that are single or double portion size, which prevents you from over-estimating how much you need.

Generally speaking, along with keeping a record of your weight in weekly increments, I would also suggest taking pictures of yourself naked/partially clothed every month or so. Then you get to see your progress in numbers and how your body shape changes, which is an excellent way to keep yourself motivated! 

You've got a solid 3 months before you want to start Keto now, so make the most of it! Start getting into the diet and exercise rhythm now and by the new year you'll hopefully have a solid routine in place!

Personally I think it would be unwise to dismiss as dead ends organised religion when it forms the historical basis of not only our culture but also the cultures of countless millions around the world especially where in many cases religion is far more ingrained in society than it is in ours. This in the context of an increasingly global economy and society.

Like it or not Religion is one of the pre-eminent forces in our world today and I personally think that a well rounded education should include a study of the principals of the major religions and how they impact society at both a micro and macro level. In order to grasp some of the basics of global politics at least a rudimentary understanding of religious and cultural differences is nigh on essential. 

Besides that religion is a good starting point for discussions on a wide range or moral and philosophical questions which personally I think everyone should be encouraged to consider. In principal many religions boil down to time tested moral and philosophical frameworks that inform cultures and ideas around the world and where they differ there are opportunities opened up through the study of those differences to promote critical thinking; reasoning and comparative logic as well as to a platform to express one's own beliefs (which, let's be fair, everyone loves to do).

This would be a step forward from the current situation, where even state-funded schools can get away with most of those things (probably not racism).  For example, IIRC, the law that prevents schools discriminating against LGBT pupils doesn't apply to RE or sex education lessons in church-aided schools, free schools, or academies, and Catholic schools [have certainly been known](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/feb/18/anti-gay-book-gove-row) to promote homophobia with no consequences.

I don't think you really have to worry so much about schools promoting racism, as the discrimination laws on race have virtually no exceptions and have been interpreted pretty strongly, as exemplified by a [Jewish school losing a race discrimination case](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8415678.stm) by requiring pupils to be Jewish under the traditional definition (you are Jewish if your mother is Jewish).",0,1380210623,null,0,false,0,ccftgds,t3_1n61ux,t1_ccftgds,t1_ccfseax,null,1429335949,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Mata is more offensively-minded, which is why he's a perfect central midfielder. I think we should consider a different positioning tactic. We've got 4 at the back, where I think we could easily drop to 3 (Cahill, Luiz/Terry, Cole), which opens up the midfield even more. We could have 3 in the midfield, with the two on the sides being more willing to track back defensively. That leaves 4 up front to focus mostly on offense.

&gt;Keep in mind that I only posted what I thought I could get away with in a non-porn subreddit. There's worse stuff out there; someone's already mentioned elsewhere that there was tentacle rape porn in the earlier 1900's, for example.
&gt;
&gt;In any case, it's a similar argument to that of violent video games. Children shouldn't be shown inappropriate material, I agree, and vendors place what controls on it that they can within reason, but it's the responsibility of the parent to monitor and/or control their child's exposure to the dangers that lurk on the internet.
&gt;
&gt;Don't want your kids accessing porn on their smartphone? Why on earth are you giving your child a device that allows them unfettered to access the internet without adequate controls? Disable the data plan on the phone, [install a web filtering app](http://www.netnanny.com/mobile), or just give them a dumbphone - what does your kid really need a smartphone for? Are they expecting an urgent email or something? Explain to them that there are things out there that they are too young to fully understand yet. If they try and argue against it, then don't budge. Seriously, you're meant to be a parent, and you are meant to be the one who makes the rules.
&gt;
&gt;They might be exposed by other kids at school, sure, you can't do much about that, but hopefully by that point you've had the birds and the bees talk, and you've explained to them that there is some dangerous and weird shit out on the internet, and it doesn't represent real life. Hopefully you've instilled at least some of your values on to your kid for them to allow them to make a decision as to whether it is a representation of real life things, or weird stuff, themselves.
&gt;
&gt;They're going to reach an age where they're curious about sex, and the chances are that they're going to eventually stumble across porn in some form through their curiosity anyway; the best you can do as a parent is to prepare them for that moment. Simply shielding them from it by blocking porn on the entire internet, and thus absolving you of the responsibility of raising your child from a world that is full of weird things, is doing nothing more than bubble wrapping them and leaving them unprepared when they have to experience that kind of content in the real world when you can't supervise them.

I dislike it for feminist reasons (exploitative towards women, much more addictive than paper porn, and the fact that there is infinite amount of moving images is much different than going to the store and buying a $2 Penthouse) Many actors in porn are in porn because they don't have marketable skills. People like to use the myth ""people who are in porn do it because they love sex!"". No. I'm sure there a few cases, but mostly it is for money or fame or the fact that they are not suitable for a ""normal"" job and porn industries exploit that by tempting them with promises of huge paychecks, being the new star, etc. Go watch *When Porn Ends*.



*Internet porn is not Playboy.
I bet you already knew this. The centerfold gets old pretty quickly. Internet porn is far more stimulating than fixed images. It’s due to the endless novelty and the ability to click from one image to the other. Another reason Internet porn is more stimulating is that one can escalate rather quickly to more kinky, or more shocking, material.*

Firstly, I don't think Rose will be ready to start. Naughton is probably our best option when Danny's injured, Jan have a hard time versus quick wingers. 

Paulinho and Dembele will most likely be our midfield duo in this game. Sandro's getting there, but he played 90 min against Villa, and I don't think AVB will rate him over Paulinho or Dembele as of yet. 

Lamela will most likely find himself on the bench against Chelsea. He's showing good progress and I think it's only a matter of time before we see him starting over Townsend, but I think AVB will give Andros atleast one more game. In the middle Eriksen is our obvious first choice, Holtby's getting there but Eriksen's been looking top class in his initial games. On the right Chadli works better as a winger than Siggy, and I think AVB feels the same way.

true,je_kay24,tardis,TARDIS,"I know everyone has different feelings on each of the Doctor's companions &amp; I know a lot dislike Rose, but I respectfully disagree with your statements.

&gt;who is willing to risk her entire family just to be with a madman in a time-travelling box

I am assuming by risking her entire family you mean she is willing to leave her family for the Doctor which is completely her choice. Why can't she choose to stay with the Doctor? Why is it assumed she has to stay forever with her family? 

I mean every companion he has ever had made the decision to travel with him and leave, albeit sometimes only temporarily, their life on Earth.

We see that Rose does absolutely loves her Mom (she goes back and visits all the time), but she loves the Doctor as well.  

&gt;She emotionally cripples Mickey

Rose didn't treat Mickey very well and that is a character flaw. She didn't know if she really wanted Mickey and yes it was selfish of her to put Mickey in that situation. But, on the other hand Mickey manipulated Rose's feelings and constantly guilt tripped her for caring about the Doctor &amp; wanting to travel with him instead of staying in London and resuming the life she was living before.

In the end, Mickey &amp; Rose weren't good to each other. They were young and were wanted different things out of life. 

This same flaw that Rose has can be applied to Amy as well when we first met her. She was getting married and yet she was trying to make out with the Doctor. Eventually, both women chose who they wanted and we saw their characters grow up.

&gt; Leaves her mother worried senseless.

Yes, her mother is worried about her when she is gone, but Rose regularly stops by and visits her Mom when she is traveling.

&gt; Sure, Mickey and Jackie eventually come around but not until they gave up ALL HOPE that they could ever have a life with Rose again.

~~I'm not sure what you mean by this. I assume that you mean Rose &amp; Mickey are upset that she is traveling with the Doctor and not at home safe with them.~~

~~If this is what you mean wouldn't this make Mickey &amp; Jackie selfish? They only want Rose for themselves and deny her choice to travel with the Doctor. I don't see how this is a fault of Rose.~~

Ok, you are referring to when Rose seemingly went missing for a year to Jackie &amp; Mickey. This you honestly can't blame on Rose. The Doctor told her she was only gone for only 12 hours when he actually landed a year off. 

Rose started bawling and apologizing when Jackie started questioning her. Rose didn't purposely go missing on them for a year.

&gt;Amy and Rory managed to have a life after the doctor, and Clara was even able to schedule time travelling in with taking care of the kids. Martha left with the ability to have an amazing career at UNIT, and Donna.....is pretty sad, but she at least had the support of Wilf to go out and see the stars because she had nothing on earth
&gt;&gt; My point is, is that while other companions made sure to keep a mind out for earth bound responsibilities, Rose drops everything because in the end she was an immature teenager, and even though she was safe and with her FATHER who DIED it still wasn't good enough.


Amy &amp; Rory didn't keep a mind out for earth bound responsibilities. When they had to leave the Doctor provided everything they needed for their life. I don't see how just by living life after they left meant they were minding their earth bound responsibilities. 

Donna was planning to stay with the Doctor for her entire life. She wasn't planning on living on Earth, but she unwillingly had to go back to her old life style. Yes, she had the support of Wilf, but again I don't know how that is a knock against Rose.

Martha is probably the only companion that willingly left the Doctor. But, Martha had a lot invested in a future life on Earth and she chose that life was more important than traveling with the Doctor.

Rose had a life after the Doctor left her in the parallel universe, she started working with Torchwood and she has her family to look after her too. Yes, she was safe with her father and could have had a life with him and decided to return to help the Doctor, but again why does she *have* to chose the life with her father. 

So, I'm not sure what you're referring to when you state she drops everything especially with the comparisons you listed to the other companions. 

&gt;Literally in order to satisfy Rose she needed her own doctor, and by golly that did in fact finally shut her up. 

I'm not sure what you mean by the clone being able to shut Rose up, but Rose *got* the Doctor, but then she also didn't get the Doctor. I think it would be safe to assume that her and the duplicate are going to have to get through some issues with the situation they ended up in. 

**TL;Dr** Yes, Rose is flawed, but I wouldn't say moreso than any other companion.

----------------------Lloris-----------------------
Walker-----Dawson-----Vertonghen-----Rose
-------------Sandro-------Paulinho-------------
Lamela-------------Eriksen--------------Holtby
---------------------Soldado---------------------

For me it's clear that since returning from injury, Sandro is our best defensive midfielder, he's so composed and seldom gives the ball away.  I also think that working alongside Paulinho will benefit both of them. On the left I would have Holtby because his ability to influence the game, and chip in with assists will be important against a side that historically are hard to break down.
Lamela would earn his place in the side because as someone else wrote earlier, he's a Rolls Royce if a footballer, whose work-rate is brilliant.
Finally, although Defoe has been outstanding in the cup games, I think the way in which we approach the league means the set up of the side is vital, and Soldado's willing to work spaces and come short for the ball opens up areas that just aren't there when JD is up top on his own.

Be cautious.  

You're the cannon-fodder which the government is using to try to keep the property bubble inflated.  There's plenty of movement at the top end of the market (e.g. due to foreign investment in London property) and that's dragging up everyone who's lower down the property ladder.  The problem is that there aren't enough people coming in at the bottom end of the market to keep it stable.  

So that's why the government are prepared to guarantee sub-prime mortgages (the very thing that caused the last economic collapse) to first time buyers - to keep the market moving.

That said, as long as you're careful then it's a good opportunity.

Make sure you can afford to pay your mortgage when the base rate is 8%.  It's almost certain that it'll rise to that level at some point (if not higher) over the lifetime of the mortgage.  Historically the base rate is around 5% so that's what you should budget for in the long term.  Do not be fooled by how insanely cheap a mortgage is the current rate of interest.  It could rise sharply next month, next year, or stay low for another 5 years.  But it will rise again.  There's no other direction it can go.

Alternately wait for the interest rate to start rising.  At that point the property bubble will most likely burst (or deflate sharply) and house prices will come down before the cycle repeats again.

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"In fairness, after all the games I've seen, I genuinely believe that we're creating enough chances to win games. Especially with Diouf and Byram fit enough to play and gaining match sharpness. For example, against Burnley, Varney had two chances in which he was attacking the ball unopposed, with only the 'keeper to beat, and failed with them both. That's not even counting Diouf's header (amazing save by Heaton) and Smith's goal.

We just need a striker whose main attribute is actually scoring goals. If you look at our current crop, they're all utility forwards:

- Varney and Hunt offer work rate, chasing balls down into channels and have some jumping ability.  
- McCormack offers unrivaled technical ability with the ball, setting up chances and generally being our only source of ingenuity.  
- Poleon frightens defences with his pace.  
- Smith wins most headers and is a reliable target man.

But none of them consistently score goals. McCormack has done so in the past, but even when he scored around 20 goals in a season, he had lengthy spells in which he just didn't score. However, most of them are conducive to setting up goals, so a proven goal scorer (like Becchio, thanks again Colin) would thrive in this Leeds United side right now.

The public road is not a race track. On race tracks there are no Armco barriers or other solid street furniture, there are no oil/diesel spills, there, track offers a much more controlled environment and so on. 

Doing double the speed limit is far from sensible. A roads are in many ways very dangerous. More so than motorways. On motorways, no learner drivers, adequate lighting and A roads are open to all road users including pedestrians. And mobility scooters, provided they're doing 8MPH and displaying a flashing amber beacon (bizarre).

i [beg to difffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage#History) that gay marriage is incredibly new. i'm not sure where this fiction of homosexuality being a modern occurrence came from, but it's patently false. we see a lot more of it today because a.) there are more people on earth now than there were in centuries past, b.) we live in a more-connected global community, c.) society has progressed in many ways from the days when your gender, your sexuality, your race, and more dictated whether you were a person or not (this is a step forward, and i challenge you to tell me a reason other than your personal feeling that this isn't), among others.

i am not against the qualities that make up gender roles. i think it's very good that people want to have children, stay home and take care of said children, keep a household, provide for their family, protect the people in their life, make something of their lives, accomplish lofty goals, display bravery, and any other ones you can think of. what i AM against is saying the first three are for xx women, and that the rest are for xy men. that's asinine. why do we want to limit WHO can take care of the children? you know what would make an even more stable unit to raise children? BOTH parents wanting to raise, nurture, care for, and share tender moments with their child. BOTH parents wanting to provide for their family financially. BOTH parents displaying bravery, courage, ambition and the like, setting a good standard for their child, regardless of what gender the parents and the child may be.

THAT'S what i'm fighting for when i rail against the rigid gender roles of modern society. i don't think we should toss out our children, leaving them to the wolves. i don't think we should leave children to raise themselves on tv, video games, movie, music, and pop culture. i don't think everyone should hole themselves up in a little hovel, providing no money for their family and trusting their love to sustain them forever. i just think the decision of which person that fills those roles shouldn't depend on which chromosomes you're born with. the person that decides they want to do it should be allowed to.",0,1380227628,null,0,false,0,ccfznsu,t3_1n0xxi,t1_ccfznsu,t1_ccfz2ue,null,1429332981,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Of course what happened was that as soon as the law was changed to only allow shops below a certain square footage to open all hours, then the supermarkets changed their strategy and started buying up smaller outlets and creating newer brands, like Tesco Express and Metro, Sainsbury's Local etc.  The law that was intended to help independent shops turn a profit at least, has been completely exploited by the big four, such that now pretty much the only place you can nip out for a pint of milk is either a (chain-owned) garage outlet or a tesco express.

So any small shop can open late, but now instead of competing with other small shops, and supporting a market where the slightly higher prices are justifiable as they are matched by convenience, increasingly the only small shops that benefit from this law are the bigger chains instead of the independents it was designed to protect.

Now, not content with cornering the smaller and smaller ends of the market, Tesco and others are designing their stores around retail ""villages"" and calling them town centres, where the store will open onto a square with a (chain) chip shop, a (chain) restaurant or two, a (chain) estate agents, a (chain) pharmacy - all of which Tesco will own shares in or wholly-owned - plus a few other odds and ends like a post box, some benches and a bit of civic art.  Except these are not public spaces or squares, but private land with private security, massive car parks, no planning controls and very little in terms of oversight.

And even if some did disagree with me on this, I am sure I could make my case to any scientist who wanted to hear it. 

If what men and women do in a society isn't part of the bedrock of that society, what is? I would say, before that is philosophy, but that includes how they see culture, god, work, men, women, children, and every other facet of a well-articulated cultural view.  Philosophy is important, and we've lost that too, in favor of pursuit of ""doing what you feel"".  Not in all facets of society, but it sure feels like it taking part in the world day to day.  No one seems to give a damn about the truth or objective standards, besides some Christians, and most of them are off their rocker, forcing beliefs down others' throats.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think one part that I haven't said yet, in response to your c.) point, is that I think civilization itself is an inherently masculine phenomenon (order from disorder, hierarchy, law, religion), and civilization is what has provided so many the ability to debate these issues based on the education and opportunities most of us have been provided.  

When I say it is masculine, I mean in a sort of philosophical sense, but I also do think that in the end, most of what we use day to day was also built by men.  Buildings, roads, bridges, computers, cars, and all the rest.  Not that women aren't capable of it, because many are, and a few do pursue blue collar professions, but women just aren't interested in that kind of work.  I think work in itself, where you exchange labor for pay in an impersonal environment contributing to a larger whole, is also a masculine phenomenon, and many women recently have convinced themselves that they want to play that game.  And so there are many jobs these days where women are just as suited for them as men, but in the end, they are alienating themselves from family, community, nature, and God, just so they can play the same game that men feel they need to do.  Men want to move up in the world, and now women do too.  That, I feel, is inherently masculine.

I don't think a ""feminine oriented civilization"" exists, women (or the feminine, to be more accomodating) do not usually attempt to create order from disorder, what they prefer to do is maintain the existing order.  Men are generally more revolutionary than women, with exceptions.  What I am saying is I think there are very subtle, but very real differences between the sexes, and so they cannot be the same (but they can of course be equal).  There is a place for both, but attempting to mash the two together confuses everyone.

So I think we have to keep all this in mind when we find the next step in our civilization.  There is no ideal female world, women are living in man's world, and while men are treating women decently (and women are treating men decently), it works out.  But when women are unhappy, everyone is unhappy, so we know something has to change.  But I don't see the dissolution of gender roles as the solution, only as a manifestation of the complaint.  Women are like the barometer of society, but that doesn't mean they hold the solution, because the very structure that they have a problem with, but also want it to stay (because the alternative is anarchy more or less), is one that is largely built by the masculine impulse.  

And I do think that everyone has masculine and feminine impulses, I am arguing based on a matter of degree, not kind.  My point is very subtle.  In the end, even though all people are a combination of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" impulses and attitudes, and so it's impossible to pin down everyone into neat categories, some semblance of gender roles are still important, because they provide structure, and standards for people to live up to.  Part of the assumption of this desire to remove gender roles is that people know exactly who they are and what to do with their lives, and we all know that's not true. Modern life is confusing.  In a world of confusion, it is helpful to provide direction and guidance, and that is a task for all of society.  That's all I'm saying in the end.

I think that responds to everything you just said, but I don't necessarily think it proves you wrong or anything, that's just where I am coming from.

do not get me wrong, i don't want to live in a ""female world"". i want to live in a world where what sex you were born doesn't pigeonhole you in to a societal role. that's far too limiting, and i think it may be the origin of the many psychological and emotional problems that men possess, overwhelmingly more so than women.

here's my big problem with what you've said; i've told you that i don't want the characteristics that make up gender roles to disappear from society. i want the desire and drive to take care of your family and to provide for your family to stay. i don't see a reason to limit that to a specific gender, however. and it seems as though you think stripping the gender away from the roles we've set up for them will mean no one strive for them, and instead will lapse in to nothingness with no drive to succeed at anything. that's a very, very, VERY bleak outlook on the human condition. i think human beings are better than that. i don't think a person needs a socially assigned gender role to prop themselves up against to succeed. instilling a child with the desire to be successful in what they attempt, the desire to do well by their fellow human, the idea of a community supporting the others that make it up, and the thought that they can succeed at whatever they want to accomplish should be enough. we don't have to tell a boy that they need to ""provide for their family"" for the boy to thrive. as a matter of fact, what if that boy doesn't WANT a family? or even worse, what if that boy would rather nurture and raise their children instead of provide for them financially? how is that boy supposed to succeed if the role has been preset for them to provide financially? that boy's never going to feel as successful as they would if they were able to stay at home and raise their family.

Smith should be able to bag goals, and is doing, but rarely plays.If we do get a Striker we have to take Poleon or Hunt or Smith off the bench. There's no way we can justify having more than two back up striker on the bench and the system we are currently playing there's going to be one of those four that doesn't even make the bench and the way Brian is setting up, it looks like it may be Poleon. We have too many strikers, whether they are 20 goal a season isn't the issue, we just have too many. We have SIX players that can play in that position and only 2 that can play on the wing. You might not see it as an issue, but if we had Snoddy and Gradel we'd be fucking ripping this league apart. They were two wingers who created everything for us, and dictated pace. We lack that, and obviously what's happening at the moment isn't working too well.

Simple fact is, if any Striker would get us 25 goals a season, they'd be long gone out of the free market and loan market. We won't get a striker who can do that, not without paying millions. Our best option is to get winger who take it to the line, and smash crosses into the box and hope Varney and Smith can get on the end of them with Ross in the role he has now.

So my accent has me representing unfriendly stupid people according to this article, wonderful.. just what we need, another 'DAE LE STUPID SCOUSERS' article that everybody outside Liverpool loves to circlejerk.

As a scouser who works in sales, I've mastered the art of 'cheeky scouse wit', I manage a team of 26 people, most of whom are scousers. Catchphrases such as 'your scouse mate' go down a treat with the rest of you non-scousers who secretly wish you were scouse. ;)

On holiday quite a few times we've bumped into another group of scouse lads, shouting 'SCOUSERR' to eachother and forming an instant bond in foreign lands, as together we stand (YNWA) is something you cannot get the full experience of unless you are a scouser.

As soon as you hear that familiar accent of the homeland, where the liverbird sits atop the city next to the mersey, you know you've already got so much in common and that that lad will have your back in an instant if need be.

This is something foreigners (in this case ppl outside Liverpool) can't get. It's why people all over the country and the world put their red shirt on and go out to watch the match. Because they know that for the next 90minutes they're connected through emotion to the city with THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. 

We give cockneys a run for their money on banter, the scots a run for their money on drinking, the jamaicans a run for their money on smoking weed, the americans a run for their money on filling awkward silences with irrelevant thoughts, and we make Southerners run away to keep their money in their pockets.

As much as a shit hole Liverpool is, it's our shit hole and if's the outgoing people with a sense of humour and togetherness what makes Liverpool great.

So the author of the article can swivel on that one like the stuck up prick I know he is. He'll never be able understand the togetherness thousands of people feel through only an accent.

At CM, I like Sandro &amp; Dembele for their ability to own the midfield and keep possession, at the cost of a little offense.

On the wings, I'd want one provider and one shooter, so either Townsend (RW) &amp; Chadli (LW), or Lamela (RW) &amp; Gylfi (LW).  Can't have both Gylfi and Townsend -- we'd end up with total congestion and 75 shots from outside the box.  All that said, sickgrof's notion of Townsend on the left and Lamela on the right is miiiighty interesting ...

Holtby's in great form, but I think I'd still go with Eriksen at CAM.  Though slotting in Holtby on the left with Townsend on the right could give Ivanovic a headache ...

Rose was in a run-down shop-job doing nothing with her life, and had no real desire to do anything for herself. Then she met The Doctor. She met danger, and oddity, and saw that she could do so much more. She fell for the man that helped her see her real potential. A sort of animal woke insider of her-- one that was willing to take action, to finally do something. She never really intended to be &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; Mickey, and most of the time that her mum worried, she shouldn't of because she knew she was with The Doctor (and if anything were to happen, he'd have told her about it). Donna was already grown and in a job (though she wasn't particularly happy either). Clara never really wanted to be expressly with The Doctor-- I suppose she took such an interest because he took such an interest in her. Martha, too, didn't seem to think she had a life with The Doctor seeing as she still had plans to become a doctor herself. Amy and Rory were looking forward to a life together regardless of The Doctor. 

What I'm trying to get at is that Rose didn't have anything to go back to, and I think Donna would've done the same given she wasn't forced to go back to normality. Frankly, she had no ""earth bound responsibilities"" to keep a mind on-- she lived in her mum's flat and worked a dead-end job, and spent her free time with a guy that liked her loads more than she liked him.

&gt; ""That only makes it worse. So where do you want to begin, with the transfers in the early 80s or the 90s?""

How about we start with some basic **reading comprehension**. From the original comment you were trying to respond to, I made it pretty **obvious** that I was talking about how Liverpool traditionally built up our sides. Hence the **unmissable** reference to ""mid 70s to mid 80s"". Should I have bolded that then, so you wouldn't have missed it?

&gt; ""Liverpool broke the british transfer record in 1995 with Stan Collymore - £8.5m.""

Yeah. Many years and 2 managers *AFTER* we lost our dominance, and we were desperately flailing about trying to recover it. Hence, departing from our ""tried and trusted"" ways of yesteryear. So how exactly does that argue against ""Liverpool traditionally were never the biggest spenders in the English game"". Because we weren't.

And please don't bother trying to lecture me on ""football economics"". To whit:

&gt; ""(Collymore) On a per revenue football inflation basis, that is much greater than the City transfers and today is about the equivalent of spending £100m on a player""
&gt; ""Dalglish was the equivalent of double Andy Carroll""

Somewhere along the line, you've getting all dazzled by numbers, and making 2 + 2 = 22. Not my problem, you deal with that on your own time. Suffice it to say, I don't need infantile attempts at teaching economics. Thanks all the same for trying to explain the concepts of inflation, time value of money, and how revenues have grown in football as TV income has gone through the roof, people go mad over buying over-priced official shirts and associated tittle-tattle, and fans get raped at the turnstiles (sorry, ticket office).

&gt; ""You can't grow a club any other way.""

False. Wrong. Incorrect. Its just that in your 5 minutes of watching footy, **YOU** haven't noticed it. The rest of us who saw Liverpool being built up, saw (just to take 1 example) Cloughie win cups, a league title and 2 European Cups. We know better. BECAUSE WE SAW IT HAPPEN.

Hint. Football did not start with the advent of the Premier League.

&gt; ""The Dalglish transfer (blah blah blah) ...""

Was NOT the normal way we did things. It was a big leap of faith, to replace one sharp tip with another (he was already a superstar with Celtic). 1 player. Look at the rest of the side. Paisley's first great team was inherited from Shanks. With the exception of McDermott (who we pinched from the Geordies after pinching the FA Cup from them!), and maybe Kennedy - I can't think of any other regular who we payed mega-bucks for (yes, by the standards of the time) who went straight into the team.

Liverpool were always setup differently to most other teams. New players would go straight into the reserves and you wouldn't hear from them for at least 6 months, while they learned ""The Liverpool Way"". Thats the way we did it. And even Kennedy needed some ""re-education"" as we changed his position from his Arsenal days.

And that was the group (76 to 81) with which Paisley won 3 League titles, 1 League Cup, 1 UEFA Cup, and 3 European Cups with, in 6 years.

During the 81 season, you could see that we were getting long in the tooth. Up for it in Cup games, but not for the League. And that stretched to the begining of the next season as well. But Paisley saw that. And did he spend megabucks to get the best players from around England and Europe? Remember, at that time, we were the GREATEST club in the world. Bar none. No dispute. We were IT. We could have gotten anybody we wanted.

No. He started bringing in youngsters like Whelan and Rushie (first saw them in the 81 League Cup final replay). And Skippy (he came to the fore from 82 onwards).

Now contrast that to how our rivals did their business in roughly the same period. Players like Francis (great) and Birtles (flop) were being bought and sold for sums **IN EXCESS OF A MILLION**. Barcelona were squandering massive sums.

We didn't. It was always of combination of promising youngsters who were schooled in the Liverpool system, with underperforming and underappreciated players from other clubs, interspersed with the odd big money signing.

Emphasis on ""odd"". As in, not the norm. For a club of our stature, we could have used our ""clout"" a lot more than we did. We didn't, because we had better ways of building a team.

And in the end, thats ALL I was saying.

If you want to rebut any of this, knock yourself out. But save yourself some time, and don't bother if you're just going to look it all up first. I can do clicky-clicky and read all about stuff via Google and Wikipedia myself, thanks very much - and I don't think I'll have the same difficulties with basic reading comprehension as you have demonstrated thus far.

What you have above are my 1st hand memories (as just one supporter, not an ""in the know"") of what happened, and how we did it.
