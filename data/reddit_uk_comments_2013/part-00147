true,hoosierstudent,null,null,"**DEF**: Aleks Kolarov: Pelle seems to favor Kolarov, and there is no cover at LB (if you've seen Lescott playing LB this preseason, you'd agree). I'd like for Kolarov to be replaced by a younger, quicker, cheaper option, but until such time, he stays.
 
Joleon Lescott: Lescott wants the surety of a place in the rotation, as this is a World Cup year, and also wants to extend his contract with only a year remaining. He won't be starting over Nastasic, but is excellent cover and still in his prime. 

Micah Richards: Micah is on the last year of his contract, and not in the starting 11, either at his preferred RB or CB. He is well-paid, and a new contract will not be cheap, but City will want to keep the last vestige of the old-era City Academy where he belongs. 

Verdict: All stay, Kolarov exits if a fullback is brought in. 

**CDM**: Gareth Barry: Barry is aging, and on the last year of his contract, but is excellent positionally and breaks up play well. Last year proved superior to Garcia in the holding role. Only downside I see:his playing time will cut into the development and minutes of Rodwell (altho they play different positions). There's also talk of Barry finishing his contract with City and becoming a foundation of NYCFC of the MLS. 

Javi Garcia: Garcia had a rough go of it last year, looking slow, hesitant to tackle, poor in attack and distribution, and just off the pace. Nonetheless he offers good versatility, able to play in midfield or slot into central defense. A 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1, more similar to what he played at Benfica, could see him improve. 

Verdict: Garcia stays, Barry stays unless a sizable (&gt;£4m) bid is made by a non-rival. 

**ATK**: Scott Sinclair: Sinclair needs to go, either on loan or otherwise. He's lost, and will offer nothing to next year's side. 

Samir Nasri: Navas and Jovetic both play in spots where Nasri can play, but I believe a fresh start, with a formation more suited to his style will see Nasri reach his potential. Valued at over £20m, if a club comes in with an inflated bid, MCFC mgmt would consider it. 

Verdict: Sinclair out, Nasri stays. 

**STR**: John Guidetti: I've seen lots of people decrying the two purchase of new strikers, ""Now Guidetti won't get into the team."" He still needs time, both to gain fitness and to prove he can play in the BPL. I'd foresee him staying with the team this fall, then going on loan to a needy PL team in January. 

Edin Dzeko: Same as above, lots of people saying Dzeko is on his way out. I don't see it. 4 quality strikers are needed to compete in 4 competitions, and Dzeko is clinical, powerful, good in the air, and now playing for a manager who can get a lot out of his players-- Roque Santa Cruz was scoring for Malaga in the Champion's League for god's sake. Look for him to compete for a starting place, and score 15+ goals in the BPL this year. 

Verdict: All stay. ",0,1374261487,null,0,false,0,cb65ayr,t3_1inchd,t1_cb65ayr,t3_1inchd,null,1430407628,18,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,18

true,lambcrash,hongkong,Hong Kong,"As someone who used to work as a civil servant some time ago, this was how it worked when I was there (DfT, Airports Policy, 1998 - 2002). I don't know how much has changed since then or whether it's noticeably different in other departments, but...I would doubt it.

When you write to a government department your correspondence is considered 'Treat Official' and will get a response from a civil servant, likely a low-grade one, based on 'lines to take', which are paragraphs that have been previously okayed by a grade 7 or above. This results in the worst type of response, little more than an acknowledgment and a brush off. This sounds like what you've been getting. There is a service level agreement specifying a timeframe for responses, so yes they are obliged to reply to you - but I can't remember how long it was, it may be something like up to 28 days from the date they receive the correspondence.

You can up your game by writing to your MP instead and getting them to write on your behalf to the relevant Minister asking for a 'substantive reply'. And that wording is key, by the way. This is Ministerial Correspondence (MSU was the acronym) and has stricter and shorter time-frames for reply and a greater demand of accuracy and actually answering specific questions. In practice, this will actually come to the same civil servants, only now they will write it on behalf of the Minister who will sign it and send it back to your MP. These are much better replies, however, once the government has decided to do something the sheer inertia of bureaucracy makes it unlikely you will affect any change unless they're actively seeking views, such as when a green paper is released.

So via your MP is your best bet for getting a good and timely response, but it really depends on how sympathetic your MP is to your cause. And don't email - write an actual letter.

Hope this helps!

It's terrific. The problem with fans is that they don't actually do anything to cool the room down; they just cool you down slightly if they're blowing air onto you that's below skin temperature, and that air just goes to heat the rest of your room up further. With those six 12v fans, they suck (relatively) cool in from outside, and are angled to blow it to the top of the room. It then sinks, creating a constant airflow through the room, and taking the temperature down with it. In terms of impact, within a few minutes of switching it on the room's temperature sank from 29.4c to 25.2c, which was enough to take it from 'unbearable' to 'alright'.

Or that Hazard dribbling through the middle would leave acres of space in front of the midfield if he were dispossessed. 

Player ratings in football are entirely subjective. I've thought that players have had terrible games when others have thought they were excellent. Also, you get an entirely different sense of a player's performance by watching live rather than on TV, or even from watching the game for different angles. Mourinho used to slate Joe Cole when fans thought he'd had a great game. 

Football's not like cricket where you finish with a particular score and can see from the scorecard how well someone has performed.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Blink was a great episode, but it doesn't really follow the typical format. It was sort of like a break to build up hype for the following episodes. If you start them with Blink they won't get a true grasp of the series.
I'd recommend one of the following:
**Father's Day** -Does a good job explaining why you don't mess with time and will help with explaining why there is still danger even though we've seen the future intact prior.
**Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead** - One of the best stories of NuWho in my opinion. Lot's of tense moments and eerie parts. Also, I think it's important to watch these episodes before any of River's episodes in 11's run.
**Waters of Mars** - Another good episode in explaining why you can't screw up time. Also does a good job in summing up some Time War/Last Time Lord bits. It also shows the Doctor can be wrong, which is a good thing to keep in mind when watching the series.
**The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood** - The Doctor has to deal with people. His companions are always at risk (Amy being sucked into the Earth/ Rory being erased) and he has to deal with people not listening to him. The Doctor is a benevolent alien trying to help out but humans are human and sometime they can act in the moment. Midnight also goes along these lines, but these episodes follow a more traditional layout.

I'm sure there are plenty of good one's you could use. Like byenameis said Empty Child is fantastic. I know lots of people like to recommend Vincent and the Doctor.

true,sprucay,null,null,"I never said firefighting was more difficult that being a soldier. But I will say that firefighters don't sit around watching TV. In the day, they train. In the evenings they'll probably train, but if not they might watch a bit of TV because that's what most people do in the evenings. It's true that fire fighters don't see as much fire as they used to, but that's partly down to community work they also do while you think they're watching TV. And if you watched the news this morning, you'll see that firefighters in London are currently fighting 20 grass fires a day. That's a lot of fire. As well as that, there's other dangers unrelated to fire. But if you want to make sweeping generalisations, I have a friend in Afghan at the moment, and he's in an FOB. He hasn't fired a shot, nor been shot at. He'll get back from his 6 months and then it'll be years before he goes on another one. They're not all rambo. 

That article has either been exaggerated, or was a rare case. I'm confident all the firefighters I know would have gone in to get him if it was ankle deep, but obviously a media outlet would never sensationalise a story would they? You realise they never say the actual depth of the water? Would you go in if it was waist deep? It was the 10th of March so likely cold. If its waist deep, there's a potential for early hypothermia of an untrained person going in, and then they need rescuing as well. What I'm not trying to say is it's not black and white. If it was ankle deep, then that's bad, but not all firefighters would be like that, and you can't judge the story unless you know the facts.

So, instead of comparing fire fighters to soldiers assuming they're lazy and incompetent based on a couple of articles, why not look at the strike reasons impartially and see how you'd feel in that situation?

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Alright dude, 5 hours will take you basically most places in England from London, except obviously the furthest places (Cornwall, Newcastle etc.). What I suggest you do is take a ride down south into Surrey, head towards Guildford/Cranleigh and cruise the roads round there heading south towards Midhurst. If you get to Midhurst, you're only ten minutes away from the beautiful south downs and only an hour from Brighton down on the sea-side where you could stay for the night in any number of the hotels.

The roads around Midhurst/West Sussex are absolutely gorgeous and perfect for biking - open 60MPH roads with long sweeping bends, tight twisty sections through lush forest and fast S bends up the hill to the top of the south-downs where there's an absolutely fantastic viewing spot you can chill at. The country-side round those parts is absolutely breathtaking this time of year - definitely a far cry from grimey London and only an hour and a half away from it too! 

The route you could take would be London down the A3 south to Guildford, come off at Guildford and take the back-roads to Cranleigh, then to Dunsfold (home of the Top Gear test track which you'll pass on the way), to Chiddingfold and then head towards Haslemere. From Haslemere you can simply follow the road all the way down to Midhurst where you could stop for lunch, then head to Petworth which is an ancient walled Castle-town (also pretty beautiful) and then down through Pulborough and Storrington ending up at Brighton where you can stay for the night. 

The whole journey would take roughly 4 hours or less depending on which route you take - but trust me if you take that exact route you're in for some really nice roads which I can personally verify are fucking serious biking fun. A very rural route mind - if you're more interested in monuments then you're better off staying in London, but it's a really gorgeous part of the country and very few police which is an added bonus if you want to test the bike out! If you don't fancy staying at the sea-side and want to be a touch closer to London, I'd like to recommend The Mulberry in Chiddingfold - huge, comfortable, tastefully furnished rooms for very reasonable prices and a decent restaurant attached although they're usually quite busy on the weekend. 

Although Brighton is only 50 miles away from London, that's only if you take the boring motorways - going this route will allow you to see the real England in the best possible way and trust me it's far enough of a journey to tire you out enough when you do get down to the sea-side. Brighton has some pretty decent clubs/nightlife if you're interested too, plus loads of great restaurants to eat at.

Doh, that seemed like a really good one too.

&gt;Thats her choice and I think it's unfair for you to assume that everyone should live with that same belief.

There are two problems - one, if you're going to put lives at risk to prove your point, you lose the moral high ground; two, you are not *required* to do this for a living - if you don't agree, walk away - that's what most folks do.

&gt;It's good to know that if the government decide to cut her wages remove her pension 

You're suggesting this hasn't already been happening to NHS workers for *years*? I worked for the NHS for ten, leaving because I realised that I'd never accept those wages (which got worse and worse) for life - but to use it as an example I didn't then sabotage equipment (say) just because I didn't agree with what they were doing in the name of tightening belts.

&gt;or make her shave her head

What? That's very close to Godwin's Law....

&gt;It seems you are very hostle towards the whole concept of the strikes and thats fine.

This is the moral high-ground bit. 'Any means necessary' isn't something anyone old enough to remember the winter of discontent is going to want to hear a lot of.

&gt;I hope if anything I have given you some insight into why

You have, even though I still do indeed disagree - but you have to realise that the putting-people-at-risk side of things means that a lot of people are going to feel the same way and you'll have lost some of the public's trust even further (""There's smoke - shall we call 999? Ah, better check they're not on strike first""), but worse the gov. remember the 70's too, and really don't like being held to ransom. They're not cutting services to win votes, they're doing it because they have no choice, crap as they are.

I'm also fully aware that I'm not in the position of no choice, and it's therefore much easer for me to say 'I'd never do X, it's immoral' - but then, I did that with the NHS and voted with my feet!",0,1374267002,null,0,false,0,cb67jw0,t3_1imi96,t1_cb67jw0,t1_cb60agu,null,1430406568,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

&gt;  in which he sought to con hard up students into having sex with him in return for falsely offering to pay their university fees

So it really wouldn't have been a problem except that he was entering into contracts but dishonestly with no intention of fulfilling them (paying the university fees).

&gt; She had hoped to control her involvement in the “scheme” but was overwhelmed by the IT expert’s personality and the momentum of the situation.

.. *cough* bullshit *cough* - she knew what she was getting into and anything that happened was clearly by her consent, and she felt ""awkward"" only afterwards and now re-tells the story differently.

&gt; Afterwards when she heard nothing the victim contacted Lancaster who told her she had been unsuccessful in her “application”. He refunded her a £60 postal order for her travel and invited her to apply again in the future.

So she had sex with him knowing it was just an auditioning process?

&gt; Lancaster organised a number of “assessment sessions” across London and the South East. As well as setting up the original site, he also created two fake “review” sites praising Sponsorascholar.co.uk and urging others to take up the offer of money in return for sex.

Well now if we're going to prosecute people for fake review sites then there's a whole marketing industry that takes money in return for putting keywords on many different sites just to increase your page ranking on Google. Are we going to start criminalising such behaviour?

&gt; Sarah Jennings, Crown Prosecution Service London reviewing lawyer, said: “Lancaster set up this elaborate scam with the sole purpose of sexually exploiting female students who found themselves in a vulnerable financial situation. This was a particularly nasty and degrading experience for the woman involved, which robbed her of valued privacy.”

I'm still uncomfortable with regarding the women as victims in all of this. The website was clear: sex for money. The students were prostitutes making active choices. The problem was simply that he was running a fraud - but let's be clear: the fact that sex was involved did not make this any ""dirtier"" a crime in the fact that the girls were perfectly happy to sell themselves.",0,1374269090,null,0,false,0,cb68c0r,t3_1inbo3,t1_cb68c0r,t3_1inbo3,null,1430406199,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

When you go outside with it, it'll be all water in about 15 minutes, but it'll be cool water. If you experience ANY of the following symptoms, you may be dehydrated.

Nausea
Dizziness
Headache
Stomach ache
Exhaustion
Yellow/dark yellow urine
Confusion
Lack of perspiration

If you find yourself dehydrated, DO NOT CHUG A BUNCH OF WATER! You'll end up spewing chunks everywhere and you'll end up back at square 1. Sip water slowly ever few seconds for as long as you need. Avoid salty and sugary foods. I'd also recommend avoiding spicy foods, but you don't have any ;D.

Good deal for Rafa and a good deal for Pepe; Rafa gets a quality keeper he can get the best out of and Pepe will have a greater chance of preserving Spanish national team football - if he would be fighting for his job at Liverpool his WC chances would surely diminish.

Not to sound glum, but in all honesty, this does not improve our squad and does not give us a great deal of money - we've still brought in an expensive keeper so our net spend in that position is up - and I at least felt comfortable before that if Mignolet struggled we had a world class backup (or vice versa).

Keeper was also not really a major area of concern for me going into the transfer season and now it seems like we've made a series of complicated transactions only to be essentially where we started (arguably a little better) It's been a bit of a time waster. All the while, we've missed out on a few big signings in more important areas of concern and seem to be spinning our wheels inquiring about availability and getting prices - it sends the wrong message to our most coveted targets when we are slow and try to be frugal around their career.

IMO, one of the reasons this past season has been so-so is due to the fact that the writers created a caricature of the Matt Smith from the last half of series 6 (""Let's Kill Hitler"", ""The God Complex"", ""Closing Time"", et al) when the show started getting really popular and he never developed much after that.

He became the quirky, throw-things-together-at-the-last-minute and act-like-a-perpetual-12-year-old doctor who never really seemed to understand what was going on and did things that did not have much logic to it.  He was complete type-cast and his character became boring to watch, imo.

If the Doctor became a woman, I think the writers would become so preoccupied at the wrinkle of a female doctor that she would become quickly type-cast and would turn into a broken record of running gags having everything to do with the fact that 'he was now a woman'

1. Fans are great. They do not exist in the UK in any useful form. Box fans? Apart from Amazon, I wouldn't know where to start. Even if I did want to buy a fan, they're all sold out at every place nearby.

2. The beautiful breeze tends to comes through the day, so either I leave my windows open (not recommended in central London) or I deal with the baking room in the evening. 

3. Wish I could do siestas. Similarly, central London. I can do the 1.5hr round trip each lunchtime (+siesta time), or I could stay working and leave 1.5hr earlier. 

4. It's rare to find blinds here. Blinds or curtains - never both. And like I said before, leaving windows open is not recommended.

5. Sadly, most public places don't have air con. A lot do - and trust me, I use those bad boys - but they're few and far between.

6. Iced tea? I love it, but frankly, apart from the few places that sell Liptons, that doesn't exist here.

While Suarez may not have the perfect style for a slow and measured build up, he is very different from any other player in the world. He plays a similar role to, dare I say, Messi at Barca, in terms of the freedom he has with his movement with and without the ball. I cannot think of any other player who dictates the positioning of the opposing defence and midfield like Suarez does. I guess the differences between him and Messi  are Suarez's higher work rate, possibly because Messi doesn't haven't to track back as much given a higher overall team quality. Oh, and Messi's greater precision in front of goal cannot be denied, but am I allowed to say that I rate Suarez higher for his street like relentlessness.

I'm quite positive about our depth up front this season. Without putting too much expectation on the newcomers, I think Aspas and Ibe will make a considerable difference over the season. Fresh legs, competition and pace will be the crucial difference.

true,Basmati_Rice,english,England,"&gt;that money is transferred to a private company, who supposedly will do a better job. 

Yeah that's your government doing that, not these private companies it's corporate welfare and nor did I say I agree with that.

Why would you want that same monopoly that taxes money away from everyone and gives it to these private companies every time they look like they're about to go tits up to be in charge of a service solely? At least with privatisation you get a choice.

There should be no corporate welfare, if your company doesn't work out that's probably because there is a lull in the need for the service or you provide a poor service.

&gt;So the taxes stay. How else do you think these companies were going to get paid? 

Companies get paid by having a service you want, and giving it to you at a competitive price so you keep coming back for more. They have a reason to treat their customers right. That's how companies get paid.

With the lack of any tax everyone would be richer, there would be more jobs seeing as how nobody is being taxed, more business because business owners aren't being made to hand over 40+% of their earnings (that could be spent creating more jobs/charity) to inefficient bureaucrats who do the same job but poorly and who have the power to put that same person in jail for not wanting to hand over their own money for a poor unwanted service,

&gt;And the reason so many people don't like privatisation, is because it usually means services get worse, not better. And guess what, the private companies get to make a large profit whilst our services get worse.

I really don't think that's true, like I said, you have the choice to go elsewhere and find a better service so they have reason to treat you right, unlike now where you have no choice and they know that.

true,jakal121,null,null,"Pepe has repeatedly said he will see out the entirety of his contract with Liverpool. I know if the club wanted to off load him they could, but would Pepe spring to be off loaded to any other team other than Barcelona FC?

Clearly some sort of confirmation from Barcelona may have come Liverpool's way stating that they were not in for him this transfer season. (Possibly in an attempt to pick him up on a free transfer next summer)

If the rumours are true that he would no longer be on contract next summer, and he was not willing to go to any other club at this point other then Barcelona FC, I don't see why this is seen as an illogical move on Liverpools behalf.

Reina is rumoured to be on a wage of 110K PW, that amounts to £5,720,000 being free'd from the wage bill. If we sold him to Barcelona right now, we would probably get around 10 million, why not claw back 50% of that through his wages by loaning him out?

If he wants Barcelona and is not willing to accept offers from any other team, then LFC have made a fantastic decision in loaning him out.

And who knows, this could be great for Reina, being with a GK coach who essentially made him the player he is and a manager who believes in him.

If Barcelona don't come in with an offer maybe we might re-sign him if needs be next year?

I also love that the argument descends into 'firemen do nothing for it anyway', which might be a decent argument if they bothered to stay true to it. The police deal with more calls in 1 day than the fire and rescue service do in a month, and yet these people still want to slash police pensions/pay etc, so they obviously don't care about work load.

I haven't got any experience with social anxiety etc and I'm not an expert on the subjects you've raised. But what I can share with you is that 2 years ago I was in a fucking shit place. I thought I'd fucked up my whole life (I'm 23 now), thought I had nowhere to go, was afraid of making any move and had no money. All I can say to you is - things get better. If you think you're at rock bottom - think of that as a good thing. You can only go up, and believe and have faith that you will get better, feel better and be happy again. My message to you is that there IS light at the end of the tunnel. 100%. Don't doubt it. It's there. It's always darkest before the dawn (yeah I know that's of no use and you don't want to hear it...but it's true). 

Try to make small, positive changes in your life. It doesn't matter how small, try something new. And don't kick yourself if you can't, or if you fail - because you're getting closer to success. See it as progress. I would recommend trying some volunteering - often places are happy to have helpers and you can do as much or as little as you like. It could be anything from an animal shelter to...goodness knows what. I think that would boost your morale and occupy your busy mind. You are obviously a very talented young man, so what you dropped out of uni twice - it's not for everyone. We all take our own paths in life, and they certainly aren't the same as each others. Fuck what everyone else thinks, it's your life. You are who you are. Don't be so hard on yourself!

I hope that others will come along with ideas for how to help with the social anxiety/suicidal thoughts side of things - sorry I don't have much to add on that. It's not my area and I wouldn't like to speak out of turn. I'm sure there are knowledgeable subreddits with info and who'll lend a friendly, insightful ear more than I can.

Chin up mate, the world can seem like a real cunt sometimes. Well, in fact it's always a cunt. But it's also the most magnificent place simultaneously. A lot of how we feel, I believe, is about perspective. The world is infinitely complex, and essentially all things at once. Be hopeful, and expect, that there's a better tomorrow coming for you. Try to make small positive changes and you'll get there. Believe it, it's true :)

Sorry for the rambling, selfrighetous, pseudo-management-speak. I was about to go to bed but was compelled to reply and electronically cheer you on and pat you on the back. You'll get there.

Think about things you might be able to do that are in your comfort zone and which could be turned into a business. If you are a decent photographer and have a proper camera, can you blag a wedding gig? Can you photo some friends' wedding for free and create a portfolio? 

If you think you could do web sites, you can make Wordpress sites using free themes, it's not too difficult. Do a few free ones for friends and family and then see if you can get some work - it's easy to research local businesses that have no website or really crappy ones and offer a cheap deal to get started.

I just don't know how people (the vast majority may I add - I'm talking 20-30+ vehicles, cars and lorries going way over 70) seem to have adopted some mental cavalier attitude / assumption that the cameras are dummies or inactive.

Oh boy, here we go!

&gt;which maybe people might be more inclined to give to seeing as how they wouldn't be getting a portion of their wages garnished by force.

Here's the thing: That doesn't happen.

No, let me repeat that: **Relying on charity does not work**. Even if we ignore the monkeysphere, if it did work we **wouldn't even be having this discussion in the first place**, since there wouldn't be companies with monstrous profits, CEOs with monstrous salaries, or really anything in the way of social inequality.

&gt;People would have the liberty to have access to the money they worked hard making without anyone dipping in.

People have the right to their money. However, society has a cost. It is because of society your parents could give birth to you without you or them starving to death or dying of some disease. It's because of society that we have roads, electricity available to all (if they pay privately for it, as you so have a hard-on for), why our water is safe to drink, why companies aren't allowed to put arsenic in our cereal and have to list their ingredients. Why we have emergency services who respond to calls regardless of how wealthy the one in need of help is. Why you could go to school and receive an education, the sum of which seems to be you going on the internet to bitch about how society is apparently bullshit and theft.

Do you want me to continue?

My approach is that I've got 20+ years to get it right, so I can play it safe the first year at least and invest in a tracker or fund-of-fund. From what I've seen, unless you're really sure you can increase value by selecting how you diversify, you're probably better entrusting that to a fund-of-fund manager. While the Vanguard LifeStrategy funds are appealing, they seem to not have historically performed that great above the FTSE, whereas the HL Multi-Manager Income &amp; Growth fund has (I think) and it looks like enough to justify the costs. By my crude calculations, only once I have £2k will the £2/mth platform fees for the indexs be cheaper than the HL MM annual % fees anyway, assuming they performed identically.

HL have a huge wealth of tools and info to get you excited - technically there's cheaper options out there but with less info available they only really provide value to seasoned investors. Again, my approach is that I've got my whole life to build a portfolio etc, and every time I've been conservative (and held off trying to manually spread my ~£1k investment rather than through a MM fund) I've always been so glad I did.

I'm very happy depositing £200/mth for the next couple of years to the HL MM income and growth fund because it's diversified enough, and I'm learning a lot. Once I have about £10k I may start looking into splitting it up myself but I'll know so much more by then, and funds like the Vanguard Life Strategy may be able to do it all for me anyway.

true,Basmati_Rice,english,England,"&gt;People have the right to their money. However, society has a cost. 

Yeah, your freedom.


&gt;It is because of society your parents could give birth to you without you or them starving to death or dying of some disease.

Just because something is, and has been one way, doesn't give you the knowledge that if things were done any differently it wouldn't work at all. You aren't a hypothetical psychic. That's how things are discovered. People doing things differently, seeing if it works. There is no way for you to say 100% something wouldn't work especially when it hasn't be tested.

Also if you haven't noticed. People are still dying. We haven't cured that one yet.

&gt;It's because of society that we have roads, 

Once again, because the government is now in charge of something and things are one way, it couldn't work any other way? That makes no sense. Do you really think if the government disappeared tomorrow we would somehow forget to build roads? Your local MP doesn't build shit. I bloke in a hard hat does that. They have a supply, we have a demand.

&gt;electricity available to all (if they pay privately for it, as you so have a hard-on for)

So the state discovered electricity and it's uses? Without the state we wouldn't have electricity? I don't get how you know this, you must be psychic.

&gt; why our water is safe to drink, why companies aren't allowed to put arsenic in our cereal 

Yes, because companies are immoral and have no need for customers crunching underfoot so we best kill the people paying our wages with their custom with arsenic in their coco pops (???). Do you know how hysterical that sounds? 

That's on par with the people who say bands put subliminal messages in their music telling people to kill themselves, because that's what bands want right? Their fans dead...

&gt;and have to list their ingredients. Why we have emergency services who respond to calls regardless of how wealthy the one in need of help is. 

Even if you were poor they would have reason to treat you, it's in the that specific hospitals' interests to have you treated at their hospital (not a competitors) so they would want to offer a deal where you paid later on when you had the means to.

&gt;Why you could go to school and receive an education, the sum of which seems to be you going on the internet to bitch about how society is apparently bullshit and theft.

No need to get personal just because I disagree with you. and tax is theft there's no apparent about it. 

I think you're simply to cozy with the status quo and anything that challenges that status quo could simply not happen at all simply because it hasn't. Which is kind of sad.

&gt;tl;dr: Everything being run by charity does not work, because people are people.

I don't see how it doesn't just because you said it doesn't without proof just assumption but... okay.

&gt;Also if you don't want to pay taxes for your society, why not move to somewhere like Somalia?

Somalia isn't free from statists, USA, EU, UN all have their hands all over Somalia and that country has been [torn apart by western intervention](http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/11/us-somalia-conflict-idUSTRE4B943G20081211?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews) for years. So no, how about I don't.

If you love the state so much, why not move to North Korea? They have ALOT of government, you seem to enjoy being unjustly governed.

&gt;Do you want me to continue?

Please do.

**tl;dr**: Just because we do things one way now doesn't mean things couldn't ever work out a different way.

I saw a kp one lunchtime clean out the deep fryer and once he had the massive stock pot full picked it up and he slipped and spilled it over his chest, not nice. The smell of pork fat sometimes makes me think of it.

One chef would drink 3 or 4 bottles of wine a night and then cycle the 20 miles home. 

I saw the Italian chef who threw a knife at me forget to turn the oven on and placed a rack of lamb in there to cook, it came out raw so he deep fried it.

I just wanted to add that one of the more common, and sometimes overlooked symptoms of heat exhaustion/stroke is the ""train"" feeling - you begin to hear a ""roaring"" in your ears, and will feel quite dizzy all of a sudden. If this happens - take it seriously. Find shade and drink water immediately. Oh, also, this is going to sound strange, but don't drink ice water. Try drinking it at room temperature, or just below. It will cool you down faster, and won't send your body into shock (so to speak). This is especially important if you're feeling the effects of heat exhaustion or stroke. Plus, if you're super dehydrated and you drink something really cold, you're pretty much guaranteeing yourself a massive headache if you drink it too fast. 

If you're feeling extra hot, take a cotton ball, dab it in rubbing alcohol, and run it across the back of your neck. I have no idea how or why this works - but it's a pretty quick method of cooling yourself down at least temporarily.

I think it's worth noting that in your original quote of the article, you cropped the quote for your own ends. You ended the quote on the 'half a boot deep' line, when you probably should have used the whole quote ""half a boot deep unless in a life critical situation"". The crews on scene decided that this was not a life critical situation, because he was already dead. Perhaps harshly. I don't know I wasn't there. A water rescue and a body recovery are two different incidents.

&gt;This is not an isolated incident...

It is not common. It's a lie to say otherwise.

&gt;I witnessed a car flip on its roof, the drivers wondow was open and his arm was trapped. The fire brigade was casual as fuck and walked at a glacial pace and just did not seem to give the slightest fuck. By the time they had got some wedges and and other shit me and a friend had dug the doil out and got his arm out, they reported us to the police.

That's an interesting anecdote. You watched a car flip. An ambulance was called, the ambulance attended, then they called the fire service? Then the fire service attended, what were you doing in all that time if you felt he needed dragging free? Filming for youtube? They rarely arrive the moment of collision. You had all that time and did nothing, yet when they arrive you decide you must suddenly act? Are you a paramedic and familiar with the injuries that were involved? Was it safe to move the casualty? Did they have neck injuries? ",0,1374283387,null,0,1374285241,0,cb6d2gb,t3_1imi96,t1_cb6d2gb,t1_cb6ai0b,null,1430403897,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

To give one example, I don't particularly like Facebook. I *could* switch to Myspace or Google Plus. *However* all my friends still use Facebook, and a social network is useless without people. As a result I'm either forced to try and convince all of my friends to switch over to google plus, or go back to Facebook. In *theory* I have a choice but *realistically* I don't.

And then there are situations where I literally do not have a choice. Water companies and public transport are two good examples where I'm forced to go with one particular company, and subsequently get charged up the arse for it. Granted, there are situations where competition has benefited me (insurance, supermarket prices), but I certainly wouldn't think that privatising *everything* is a good idea.

given a week they would have had advanced intensive training to be on par with prior fire staff. theyll maintain shift untill new recruits are found and sufficiently trained. 

anyone who enters the army as a soldier is more than capable of entering the fire service as a fireman. the military gets plenty of applicants. the fire service would still get plenty of high calibre applicants.

instead of paying a civ £21g during training and £28g on completion you can pay a civ £12g during training and £18g on completion. implement a pension scheme that is similar to the private sector instead of these bullshit final salary schemes the government hands out willey nilley then wonders 10 years down the line why its needing to make cutbacks and tax raises.

point being that firefighters and soldiers are the same calibers of people. also, minimum entry requirements arent going to change, the same type of people will be attracted to the position no matter what the pay/pension options were so the government might as well address this unnecessary expenditure.

Here ya go, yet another Texan here, it pains me that someone has never tried the magnificence of Sweet Tea

Directions: (Texas iced sweet tea)

Requires:

* A [Gallon pitcher](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/11373503532073520193?q=gallon+pitcher&amp;safe=off&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.eWU,pv.xjs.s.en_US.c75bKy5EQ0A.O&amp;biw=2133&amp;bih=1061&amp;tch=1&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=nAfqUan7H5P68QS8koHwDg.1374291854857.3&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rQfqUffyN5Ca9QT46oHwAw&amp;ved=0CHoQ8wIwAQ) (3.78541 litre)- typical, can use smaller but usually made in bulk and kept in fridge

* Tea bags

* Water

* Sugar


1. Get a pot/saucepan - Aprox. 2 litre
 
2. Add water (about 3/4's of pan)

3. Put 2 Tea bags in pot

4. Heat on stove ""hob?"" until boiling - medium heat bring it to a slow boil and let boil for about 5 minutes, not too long or the bags will burst.

5. Turn off heat, and let it sit for a few minutes, 5 to 10 should do  (failure to do this will result in bitter tea)

6. Pour the 2 litre sauce pan of Tea into big pitcher

7. Fill the rest of the pitcher with water

8. Add 1-2 cups (136 g - 272g) of sugar - stir

9. Served in a [tea glass](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Glass_of_Iced_Tea.jpg), Not sure if you guys have these, but a pint glass will suffice, most drink with ice but I actually prefer mine at room temp (I'm strange by Texan standards)

true,Sneezer,null,null,"I grew up in Aberdeen and London before my family moved back to the states. Of course that was many years ago and such heat waves were very few, if any. I live in the Dallas area now, and our last several summers have been rather brutal.

You might look into making something like this. I would guess that you should be able to find the parts locally at one of the DIY stores (I forget their name now, been a while I'm afraid).

[Homemade portable swamp cooler](http://eplaya.burningman.com/viewtopic.php?t=33842)

It probably wouldn't be too difficult to adapt components over there to make it work. I have run across similar ones that people have built - the seemed to do a good job for the tents that they were used in.

Are these available over there? [Cooldanna](http://www.zanheadgear.com/catalog/Family.aspx?CategoryID=160)

We use them in scouts during the summer - they do actually work to keep you cool. Helps to put a couple in a ziploc baggie and keep them in a cooler, and swap out as needed. They are quite cheap over here, maybe we could find a way to ship a bunch over. When dry they are flat, just like a folded necktie so we could put a bunch in a simple mailer.

On the subject of sleeping - having spent many nights tent camping in this heat, I find a small fan that blows over your head works wonders. When I car camp with my son, I'll bring a 12"" fan that runs off 12V, and place it so I have a breeze over my face. That is usually sufficient to allow me to fall asleep, and stay relatively comfortable throughout the night. The one I have will run off a car battery, or a 1amp 12V AC adapter.

true,hoosierstudent,null,null,"Re: midfielders. Milner and Garcia are versatile, and entering their primes. Garcia can slot into defense, Milner can play on either wing, and even cover as a fullback. Milner will struggle to get starts, but he's not one to hand in a transfer request. If one goes, it'll be Garcia, but I say he lasts at least one more season. Rodwell has great potential, and should be groomed to replace Fernandinho, as the pacey, attack-minded, deep-lying midfielder who can burst forward at any time. That leaves Barry, who very well could leave. 


Re: Strikers. Perhaps City will start in a ""4-2-3-1"", but rarely do I expect City to line up without 2 strikers. The formation will be very fluid, and will likely be more of a 4-2-2-2, like Pelle ran with Malaga and Villareal, as the team presses high up the pitch. Also, remember that management wants to install 4-3-3, which can allow for all sorts of variety-- targetman #9, winger out right, inverted forward out left, #10 in the hole... That 4-3-3 could see Aguero-Dzeko-Silva, with Jovetic in the hole. (Just an example). 

Long story short, Pelle and management expect to be challenging for 4 trophies every year, and this demands squad depth. 23 senior players is much smaller than Chelsea or United, and it's for that reason in particular that I doubt we'll see anyone go before (additional) replacements are brought in.

It's good that other clubs/businesses don't know exactly what we're doing.

It seems like the other signing or two will take a bit longer, maybe right up until the close of the window so we'll have to be patient.

But it's no secret that we're looking add more players and that another attacking player and a centre-back is what we're looking for. I would imagine that one way or another we'll have those two needs filled.

And it'll still be interesting to see who is shipped out of Liverpool as well. Guys like Spearing and Assaidi are surely on their way out. The fates of Downing, Skrtel and Coates may depend on who we get (or not as the case may be).

It perhaps slipped into your sub-conscience subconscious? ;-)

Second off, the reason that western corporations are able to exploit the urban poor and their offspring so assiduously and without great risk of nationalisation, unionisation or worker-takeover is because their they and their governments (particularly the US government) have been working hand in hand with some of the world's foulest dictators, malicious and grasping elites and corrupt governments to prepare the substrate, the international and national legal frameworks, ""free trade"" agreements, copyright/patent enforcement, the punishment taxes to force people to work, the enclosure movements and land seizures to prevent them from being self-sufficient, the elimination of traditional patterns of agriculture and working, and where necessary the elimination of leaders, trades unions, political parties, governments, and whole peoples who don't fit the modern corporate capitalist system.  Using Western taxpayers money I might add, and then using the opportunity thus presented to flee all the rules and regulations which make our lives in the West relatively comfortable, and go back to Victorian and even older and more vicious forms of capitalist exploitation elsewhere in the world.

Once you've done all that, you can find your dirt poor urban population and offer them sweatshop labour as the ""best"" alternative, because it may well be now!

Third off, I live in the developing world most of the year, so I don't speak idly.

I wasn't quite sure why the lack of a 'plan B' was such a problem for some people. To me, Rodgers was inheriting a team that wasn't quite *his* team yet. He was challenging a lot of players to play in a system that may have not been comfortable. Some stepped up to the challenge, some did not.

However, to me, with such a shift in playing philosophy, I think it's important to keep things a bit more simple. My feeling is, let's not worry about a 'plan B,' let's do our best to perfect 'plan A.'

It'll be really interesting to see what additional players we add this summer and how that affects our formation and tactics.

The brand is a little important, of course. Lipton tea is basically the Bud Light of tea. Pretty bad and tasteless. Get some nicer tea (other people are recommending types, they're all good).

BUT, this improvement is useless without proper preparation. This is what lets down nearly all American places -- even posher ones that stock good tea brands.

Here's the secret to good tea -- the water has to be *boiling* at the moment that it hits the tea. Not hot, and not 'recently' boiled. Actually *boiling*. At 100 degrees C, water scalds the leaves and adds the crucial flavour. So boil water in a pan or kettle (*not* a microwave, it doesn't heat properly), put a tea bag in a mug, and bring the mug (with teabag inside) to the kettle. When the water boils, quickly pour over the teabag. Brew for a minute or two (poke with a spoon if you like). Add milk and sugar to taste. 

This is why tea is so often terrible in America. Bringing out a pot of hot water and a separately packaged tea bag, which you then lower into the water (which is probably like 80 degrees by then), is guaranteed to make a cup of tea that tastes like dishwater.

true,rnicoll,null,null,"Yes, UK pay for coders is a lot less than the US. Long story short, most of the high-end software development industry is in the US. London and Cambridge are exceptions for the UK, but because pay is lower elsewhere, it's low there too. On the other hand, you're likely to have more free time; my job is genuinely 35 hours a week, and I get something crazy like 36 days holiday a year (which I am expected to take). That's the University of Edinburgh BTW, and we're hiring if you're interested.

Also, it's not just housing that's more expensive. Fuel, and technology are both significantly more expensive, and many things are slightly more expensive (I think healthcare and telecomms are about the only two notable exceptions).

Bottom line; developers here have a much lower standard of living. I'm not a great example because I'm in the middle of a career re-shuffle, but I'm certainly only able to buy a 3 bedroom flat due to early inheritance, and I'm taking a flatmate in to help with the rent.

So the question is, what are you wanting from this move? It's easy to go ""Wow, that's a really pretty city..."" and miss the huge costs in maintaining this much legacy infrastructure (which is less efficient in a variety of ways, compared to the US which is all much more recently built), which basically turn up in your cost of living.

Edit: I should say, I'm considering doing the opposite emigration myself, basically because the US pays much better and the money goes further. Your healthcare system scares me, though.

Some schools have to be draconian when it comes to behaviour, because once you start giving a little, then it can quickly spiral out of control. This may seem a small, petty thing to redditors, but there's a reason that the school has behaviour contracts when taking the kids out.

Reading their Ofsted report (and their results), shows there's recently been a massive turnaround in staff due to inadequate teaching. This leads me to suspect that there has also been a dip in behaviour which the headteacher has put her foot down on.

The girl in the article may well have been a little princess, but it cannot be one rule for one, another rule for others. She broke the rules that her mum agreed to, and she had to be sent home as the agreement stated.

The guy there wanted to reintroduce them as he'd been keeping them on his private land, it didn't officially happen and now a wildlife trust runs the site.

But in the years before the trust run the site who knows what happened as the owner was quite intent on getting beavers back into the wild and the precautions that are in place weren't there to the degree they are now.

OK. You've a partner who can just about cover the bills. You've some money in the bank, you're not thick and given you've an A level in art, you've certainly got more artistic skills than the dumb shit typing this who looks at a blank bit of paper and goes ""duuur"".

You say you'd be scared to set up a business but that's exactly what I'm going to suggest. Yeah its scary, really fucking scary when you put money in to get it going wondering if you'll see it again but when you do its the best thing ever. I am a believer that EVERYONE has something they can do which they can convince others to pay for and having artistic flair and the ability to use the tools for that puts you well ahead. You wouldn't believe the shit people will pay silly money for especially for what I'd consider dumb stuff such as customised doggie coats. All you need to do is work out what that is. My neighbour for example makes custom jewellery and now supplies several shops. My wife's friend set up doing custom nail art and there's not enough hours in the day for her now. 

&gt; So, with a low skillset, no experience, and pretty much constant depression: what can I do to get better? 

My wife left school with no qualifications. She got the chance to do some temporary work at a sign company for a few weeks doing nothing more than picking bits of vinyl from the middle of letters. That was in 1996. She now runs the company and does everything from design using Photoshop and other packages through to construction, application, sales...its possible.

Job wise, the best way to find work is through word of mouth. You'll find that there are jobs never advertised, people who were thinking about hiring someone but hadn't quite got round to it and because their friend or relation has suggested you by name, you're way in front of anyone else looking for a job. So you need to tell absolutely everyone you know. You need to tell your parents, aunts, uncles and get them to tell their friends you're looking for work. My son got his current temporary summer job through word of mouth through his friends. My wife was visiting a customer who has some fishing lakes who was talking about the trouble she was having with them and the fact they were managed by two old blokes who really didn't know what they should so wifey mentioned my son has just finished a high level course in fisheries management at one of the best agricultural colleges in the UK so the customer wants his CV.

Monthly income: 2500 (at £40k/year, after-tax and NI)   
Rent: 700 (one-bed flat in City centre)  
Bills: 200 (council tax, water, elec, gas)  
Food: 900 (450 per person, it should be more than enough if you cook at home and do not waste food, add a bit more if you takeaway)  
Clothes: 200 (100 per person)  
Fun: 400 (one dinner for 2 people and 5 pints of beer each, per week)
Remaining: 100

This is how you survive. Now, if you have children (you don't say) then things are a bit more complicated and something will have to give (most likely the food and the fun). Other tips:

1. You don't need a car if you do things right, the worse that may happen to you is to get a £60 bus pass (monthly). Also, commuting with bicycle is totally safe, good for your health and trendy  
2. If you have children:  
a. Count one more person for every child  
b. Count £100 more on rent for every extra bedroom  
c. Many of their expenses are tax-free (roughly 20% cheaper), through the childcare vouchers, if your employer provides them (small companies won't provide these, but its unlikely the would provide you with a visa either, so I'm assuming you will not work in a small company)  

3. If your wife works, even on a simple job, whatever she makes will be your savings towards a mortgage downpayment further down the line. Simple jobs are easy to find

Many people don't enjoy their jobs and would rather not work at all. For whatever reason though some just refuse to conform.

I don't think the solution here is punishment. I think what should be done is for jobs to be *made* more appealing and rewarding for people. Right now, there aren't many incentives to work a minimum-wage job with a boss who treats you like a worthless piece of shit, and customers who will also similarly look down on you.

In short, wage slavery sucks for everyone, so it's no surprise that some completely refuse to engage with something they experience as exploitative.

Either they fucked up, or they knew he was dead. Those are the options. Choose whichever one you believe and live with it. They made a miistake or they did not. The horrible thing is when firefighters make a mistake, sometimes people die because of the nature of the job. Personally I have only left a casualty in a danger area when ther corpse is fused to the floor from heat. 

With possible neck injuries it is not a good idea to go moving the car or casualty. But you know better, right? 

Your claim on exposure to risk is also unfair and unwarranted. There are some stations that do 1 or 2 calls per month. There are stations that do  300 calls per month (with London being amongst the busiest fire brigades in the world). There are police offers that deal with violence on a daily basis, there are police officers who walk ther beat and never get bothered. There are some firefighters who are bellends and posers, there are some police officers who are bellends and posers. Worth noting that ambulance technicians have a lower medical qualification that a fire service trauma carer.

I can see you have personal issues with the fire service, and thats sad. If you're ever in the East Midlands area, you're welcome to stop by my station and look around what we do and what kit we have to deal with the incident types you queried about.

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

When people think of the Doctor they think of a man. 50 years of consistency (or his entire life, which is at least a 1000 years) would agree with that. One line about someone OTHER than the Doctor doesn't outweigh that, especially since all the information we have on other Timelords and their incarnations supports the opposite notion, making the Corsair's situation rare at the very least. 

A case can be made for a female Doctor in relation to in-show canon, yes. But it can't be made for the identification for the role. Maybe you think it would be a cool idea to mess around with that, which is your right, but the James Bond analogy is not without merit. 

&gt;People are falsely equating an idealized, but human super spy

Doctor Who actually takes this concept into the utmost extreme. The Doctor is an idealized alien/demi-god so infatuated with humanity that he basically aspires to be one. Not only does everyone want to be like him or at the very least be around him, he himself is also a mechanism to flatter each and every one of us.

true,AlanCrowe,null,null,"&gt; We all want to enjoy the hot weather but, as in any professional organisation, staff need to dress appropriately.

I find that grossly offensive. It undermines the concept of ""professional"" by suggesting that ""professionalism"" is something that you can buy in a shop and slip off when it proves inconvenient.

We esteem the honourable members of professions, such as doctors and lawyers because they are exposing themselves to temptation and resisting it. They have specialised knowledge. If they profit at their clients' expense, prescribing costly, unnecessary treatments, or going to court when a negotiated settlement was possible, their client gets ripped off but cannot tell. The essence of professionalism is having high moral standards and refusing to take advantage of people who lack the specialised knowledge to tell whether they are being treated properly or not.

That high ideal applies to council staff. There are lots of rules and regulations. If the staff invent extra ones, ordinary people pretty much have to accept what they are told. If the staff ignore important ones, ordinary people don't actually know the rules and can be fobbed off with excuses.

We want council staff to be professional, but we mean something very different by that than ""we want council staff to wear closed shoes and have hot, sweaty feet during the summer.""

As you know, the fire and rescue service currently has a responsibility to attend and lead during incidents involving fire, road traffic collisions, water rescues, CCBRN attacks, animal rescue, environmental protection and technical rescues (people stuck in things or things stuck in people). That covers a very wide spectrum. Meaning there is a wide range of knowledge required. Fire behaviour, building construction, automobile contruction and systems, extrication techniques, electricity, gas, chemicals, radiological and nuclear, branch techniques, command structure, trauma care, hydrology, pumping calculations, blue light driving, specialist equipment use, tolerances of equipment, police tactics, etc. etc. etc.

I'm blowing our trumpet there, but you sort of asked for it.

We also attend incidents of flooding, but there is no responsibility to do so yet, which I find odd as for some reason the government have not added that to the list. It will not ever need adding, because we will always attend it, but with floods becoming more and more of a problem, it probably will be made a responsibility soon.

Some ambulance services have severe cutbacks and are removing ambulances. In these areas (Lincolnshire I believe is one, Hampshire too) fire is being asked to attend medical emergencies in the stead of or as a first attendance to a delayed ambulance. You can expect this being rolled out nationwide in the future as the NHS slowly cuts back. We're happy to do it, however I question the NHS decision to remove a fully stocked ambulance and send a team of 4 with a defib, trauma bag and burns kit. We would need more medical equipment than we currently have. But again, happy to do it and will have to a lot more in future.

A huge part is fire safety. We attend a lot of local events and functions to provide talks and information. Fit free smoke alarms if required. My brigade is not allowed to claim payment for this activity. We attend these events on a voluntary basis and enjoy it.

Obviously all this has to be balanced against training, testing equipment, assessments, cleaning the station and equipment, and fitness training, which is done daily. Sometimes multiple times daily as when we use a piece of kit it will need cleaning, and testing after use. With a helmet for example, that's not a problem, with a pump and hose it can be a fairly long job, with life threatening consequences if done incorrectly.

We also inspect 'high risk' properties in the station area, so as to map and plan for incidents there, which is usually followed up with training exercises there. If you recall the four firefighters who died in Warwickshire some years ago, the brigade in question was slammed for not knowing the building inside and out prior to attendance. Some of the watch managers (including the father of one of the lads who died) were arrested in that instance.

It's not fair to call someone picky for wanting to go to the best school they can if they have the ability. And subsiding school travel for that seems sensible. And again, I'm pretty sure this free school travel isn't locally available. Even on that site it says that everything written there is subject to local rules. ie, it's not nation wide.

&gt;All kids get half price, but that's for general bus travel, not school travel.

Yes, but at least here, to get a concessionary price (even if you're clearly under 16) you need a pass that has to be applied for. 

&gt;It's a national scheme

Already addressed 

&gt;and the safegaurds are there to protect it against lazy kids who want to get a bus instead of cycle 10 minutes

...? You'd prefer that under 16s cycle in busy, dangerous, urban roads than just get a free pass on a bus (plus likely 15 minutes of walking)? Your viewpoint just seems entirely alien. To be honest, I doubt any person who lives only 10 minutes from school would get a bus anyway; what with waiting for a bus, the slow speed they travel and the amount of times they stop it's likely walking would be quicker.

true,The_Awkward_Guy,eng-lestershire,Leicestershire/Rutland,"You can still find some holiday areas that are perfect little villages though. For example,

I visit a village every year near Gt. Yarmouth in Norfolk Called Hopton-On-Sea, or just Hopton for short, it's a small town, or a large village if you want, right next to the ocean with a really nice beach.

The thing that has saved the village from becoming a tourist hell is the fact that they built a 'Haven' park there. You know Haven, the company with those annoying adverts of overly excited kids making shitty powerpoints about Circular waterslides? yeah, that company. Basically the Hopton park is a massive site with hundreds of caravans that you can occupy for a weekend or a week, giving you access to the arcades on the site, (there are 2) and giving you full access to the restaurants and everything. The beach is also on site, but you don't need a pass to access that, if you did, you know, villagers would be pissed. 

The reason this works so well, is it bundles up the tourists all in one massive park, leaving them free to mingle about the site, having fun with everything they ever need for a good holiday being on site, and if they want to, they can venture out to the surrounding towns of Great Yarmouth, or Lowestoft.

true,fietsvrouw,null,null,"One thing that is a problem in areas that don't usually see a lot of heat is that people believe that opening a window cools things. It matters when you open the window. In some cases, keeping the windows closed is better.

If it cools down at night, you open all the windows up. The box fan helps force the cooler outside air into the house. When you get up, you close up the house and lower the blinds to reflect the sun and keep the house cool as it heats up outside. You only open the windows during the day if the house is as warm inside as it is outside, because cross breeze can help. If you do this every day, and if it is cooling off outside, forcing cooler air in and closing off the heat eventually means your house is cooler than outside most or all the time. If it doesn't cool off at night, or if you forget and leave the windows open during the day, the house will end up hotter than outside at the start of the day.

Putting fans in the window when it is as hot outside or hotter only sucks hot air in. When that is the case, you leave the fans out of the window and direct them at people (fans cool people, not rooms, unless they are drawing in cool air...) and that is when wetting your hair, your shirt, she sheet really, really helps.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; Why should the paying customer suffer the burden when the companies are the major contributor to the problem?

I don't see that you can separate the problem like that.

If we found a public official taking bribes, we wouldn't hold only him accountable for the crime - I hope we'd arrest the person(s) bribing him, too.

In a competitive market, companies are going to try and produce fuel as cheaply as possible and they have an incentive to sell as much as possible.

I know it's not possible to have a fully free market when it comes to things like gas, but we try our best. Meanwhile selling as much as possible is against the public good.

&gt; Where is the extra income low income families have to install solar panels?

I would hope these taxes might be ringfenced for just these kinds of subsidies.

That's probably rather optimistic, but I do know that free cavity- and loft-insulation is available free to people on low incomes now.

&gt; Why not wait until they are affordable?

Because we can't wait - if we wait long enough then, for all we know, the south east will be arid and our children will be paying twice as much for their food imports.

Meanwhile, all the time we wait, the Chinese are burning coal in their power-stations and saying ""well, you westerners aren't cutting your carbon emissions, why should we?"" It's only by doing our bit that we gain the moral authority to pressure developing countries. 

This problem is our own fault - or at least that of our parents and grandparents - and we have waited decades already, not doing anything about it.

I don't know enough about Icke to say if there's any relation to the triune brain - I'd guess not, but I could be wrong. Conspiracy theorists tend to take everything and contort it to suit.

My thoughts are elsewhere in the thread, so I'll put it differently. In short I don't think there is a conspiracy, or an overarching theme. I think our government is in two parts. One part is the tory party company - which has replaced the political party with a company designed to get elected and re-elected. The spin doctors, think tanks etc. The other is the individual MPs who are in it for a career, and many line their own pockets with directorships or other forms of corruption. They are effectively employees of the tory company, and until they reach minister level are pretty much restricted to towing the party line to avoid deselection and trying for petty gains - but mainly concerned with continuing their existence as an MP.

true,westyfield,eng-wessex,Bath/Southampton,"Not sure where you hail from so this'll be a fairly general set of recommendations.

For widely-available mid-range tea you can't go wrong with Yorkshire Tea (or Yorkshire Gold if you feel like splashing out without paying loads). It's available in pretty much all British supermarkets/corner shops and is likely stocked in some American/Canadian shops as well. I'm sure you can order it online easily as well, it's pretty common so shouldn't cost too much. You can buy this as loose leaves or teabags; I encourage you to drink loose-leaf wherever possible.

For something a little fancier I have to recommend [Gillards](http://www.gillards.co.uk/index.asp) (I drink their [Guv'nors Blend](http://www.gillards.co.uk/Guv-nors-Blend-Tea-52.asp) an awful lot) or the [Tea House Emporium](http://teahouseemporium.co.uk/) - these are the two local shops I get my tea from. You can order online from both, though the Emporium doesn't deliver outside of the UK. /u/TastyFace recommended Peet's [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1in1pl/howdy_uk_referred_from_rworldnews_a_texan/cb6n24l). I've never tried their tea before but it looks like they know what they're talking about, and US or Canadian delivery from them would almost certainly be cheaper than Gillards.

Looking at those sites you'll quickly see that there are loads of different varieties. Assam, Ceylon (or Sri Lanka), and Darjeeling are the most popular over here. A lot of teas are blends of different leaves - Assam, Ceylon, and Kenya is a common blend and will stand you in good stead (this is what teas billed as English Breakfast Tea are normally made from). Earl Grey is also a popular choice. Made from black tea leaves with bergamot oil, it can be taken with or without milk (whereas most plain black teas are quite bitter and astringent without milk).

In terms of [grading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_leaf_grading), here's a [handy picture](http://www.sofasl.org/images/tea_grades_01.jpg) that shows what some different grades look like. Higher grades have intact leaves and are picked very carefully, whereas lower grades will be more granular or even dusty for very low grades.

true,epemberton,yorkshire,People's Republic of South Yorkshire,"I think it's a little more involved than that.  Whilst they're not trying to 'crush' the poor, its clear that their employing some fairly simplistic,  A-level standard economic orthodoxy to try and improve the supply-side of the economy.  By forcing more people into competition for the limited number of jobs available, wages will be driven down and the national productivity will increase.  This is terrible for people at the bottom, but may help drive up the 'big numbers' like GDP and employment rate that look good for the government come election time.

Of course, the people who expound such theories are typically those from the right wing think tanks like Institute for Government and Institute of Economic Affairs, who are shadily funded by corporate interests and have an agenda to make things that are good for their paymasters look good for the country.  The Tories are always going to be biased towards pro-business explanations for economic policy, so take all these onboard no questions asked.  So whilst I believe the Tories are doing what they are doing out of a genuine belief that it will help the country, a key factor in that is lumping a great deal more privation and suffering on those at the bottom to make us all more competitive in 'The Global Race' (to the bottom).

The collusion of the BBC is a little more complicated, but I guess it's driven by their fear that if they step out of line from the Tory government (by, say, giving more air time to the huge numbers of serious economists who  actually disagree with such policies), they would be likely to find themselves on some pretty shaky ground come license fee renewal time.  In that sense, if the BBC are colluding with the Tories it is only because they've got a knife pressed to their throat.  I do think people sometime overblow BBC conspiracy theories though, and the simplest way to prove this is to look at who tend to complain about the BBC being biased - everyone!  You'd find plenty on the right who view the BBC as a bastion of socialist insurrection, so I'm sure they must be doing something right to keep both sides in balance!

The above article is certainly somewhat hysterical though, and ignores the fact that whilst the BBC pumps out populist tosh like 'We Pay Your Benefits', the last year has also seen the excellent [Poor Children](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BN7ml6b-e4) documentary, which was a far more well made and objective look at the reality of life on benefits / low wages.",0,1374337375,null,0,false,0,cb6odv0,t3_1iox45,t1_cb6odv0,t1_cb6mt2j,null,1430398494,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I am broadly in agreement with you though. I'm unsure that the BBC are running scared of the government - but you've clearly stated it's a guess and you may be right on it.

The problem isn't that the economics are wrong - they're quite simply correct - it's that the government is trying to go too far too fast. We are very fucked thanks to labour not dealing with problems (many of which  the Thatcher years set into motion), and the simple thing that neither the tories or labour will say is that things are bad and it will take a long time to get it right if we're going to do it properly.

You can't feed someone so much that they're bed bound and need life support machines to survive... and then unplug them. 

The underlying truth of economic development across the globe is that when the poorest are free to be economically productive, then standards of living for everyone improve. The truth isn't the conservative ideology of protecting what you have, nor is it the socialist one of taking from the rich.

I think we're seeing a global rebalancing which, whilst it may make things more equitable across the world, means that the west will have to relinquish many of the luxuries it has come to expect.  As much as it pains me, one of those luxuries would appear to be a truly universal and reliable welfare state.  Whilst economic development may benefit those in the developing countries of the world, you can bet that the West is going to fight and scrap to hold on to what it's come to see as its birthright.  As such, I don't know whether the truly liberating effects of economic growth are going to be allowed to be spread around the worlds population.

I'm interested in your definition of the liberal ideology as being one of 'stopping exploitation'.  I'm no dyed in the wool Marxist, but to me it seems like the capitalist mode of production is entirely dependant on 'exploitation'.  How you load that word is up to you, but for the neo-liberal model of economics to function, the capitalist is required to 'exploit' both labour and capital to make a profit.  As much as you can hope for real equality of opportunity, this will not come about unless there is some mechanism in place to redistribute the gains of production amongst those who aren't in control of capital.

Everyone knows that Roman Abramovich is a ticking time bomb, the only people who seem to avoid and not acknowledge that fact are Chelsea fans.

Also the whole assets argument is incredibly bad, Chelsea FC do not make their own assets, they buy them in, this doesn't create profit, rather loses money, because (if) Chelsea hold onto their players and don't sell them for more money than they bought them for they're losing money, and example of that is the most Chelsea have ever sold a player for is £30 million (Robben) and 2nd after that is £15 million, on the other hand, all of Chelsea's top 25 most expensive transfers range from £16 million to £50 million, with the top 2 (Torres £50mil and Shevshenko £40mil) having basically no resale value after how badly they flopped at Chelsea. That is not a 'financially neutral club' that is a club that are incredibly bad at business.

Arsenal on the other hand have never spent over £16 million on a transfer (Cazorla) and have continued to compete (albeit after 2005 not incredibly strongly) in the Champions league and for top spots in the league, that is an incredibly admirable achievement. Even more admirable is how Arsenal FC build their own assets, Cesc Fabregas cost AFC no money, he was sold on for £30 million, Robin Van Persie cost £2.75 million, he was sold on for £24 million at the age of 29, Adebayor was bought for £3 million, he was sold on for £25 million. That is an example of fantastic business, and what it's resulted in is Arsenal football club now being able to compete in the transfer market for the first time since the Emirates Stadium was built using purely THEIR OWN money which has been payed back into the club, and in modern football that is an incredible achievement, with all the Manchester Citys, Chelseas and PSGs in football these days.",0,1374342307,null,0,false,0,cb6puyp,t3_1inhti,t1_cb6puyp,t1_cb6nvpc,null,1430397799,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

He often travels with companions, who are usually female humans, as he goes across the universe. The Doctor has a habit of getting himself caught up in all sorts of trouble and uses his intellect to save races and get himself back to his ship in one piece. Despite his youthful appearance, the Doctor is hundreds of years old. When dying, he is able to regenerate, granting him a new appearance and personality with a new lease of life. Unfortunately, due to being almost immortal, he always ends up losing those who are close to him.

true,DrCrazyFishMan1,1905,Hazard,"i think you struggle with footballing economics.

Chelsea ARE a financially neutral club! if we hadn't had such a disastrous CL run last year we would have made a profit for the second year in a row! 

What you seemingly fail to understand is that in 2003, when Roman bought the club, hundreds of millions of pounds was needed to be injected into the club in order to catch up with the big clubs at the time. so yes, between 2003 and 2011, we were not financially neutral! but what happened by bringing in such high profile players for huge amounts of money, is that a ""brand"" was built! Expenditure and Income are very closely linked in football, but the Income happens at a delay to the expenditure. 

As more and more money was pumped into the club, the success of the club grew. as the success grew, so did the revenue from merchandise, tickets, broadcasting, and most importantly, sponsorship! that is the reason that the Manchester City shirt sponsorship deal is worth £400m where as yours is only worth £150m (Chelsea's is soon to be renewed so will catch up with the modern deals that Arsenal, City, Utd have). that is why Chelsea have a far more lucrative Kit sponsorship deal than Arsenal (£20m vs £13m). 

One of the reasons people complain so much at the likes of Chelsea, City, PSG and Monaco is because they firstly don't understand the principles i have just discussed, and secondly because they forget that Sides like Arsenal and United have ""always"" had large sponsorship deals. this is because they were able to grow into these massively successful football clubs before it became so expensive to do so. so they for years have been able to fund their sides on existing sponsorship deals without needing to inject the cash to break into the market!

do you know that your beloved and frugal Arsenal have broken the British transfer record more times than any other club? (joint with united) well of course not, because that all happened before anybody cared! THAT'S MY POINT!! you grew and spent before anybody cared about football financing, so you never had to spend big to break into ""the game""

Now all you guys do is wank yourselves off over how good you are with your finances, ignoring your own past! yeah you made some good purchases and sold players for a lot of money. 

do you want to know how you did that???

you sold all of your best players at the peak of their abilities, which resulted in you going 10 years without winning a single domestic or european trophy! ",0,1374344943,null,0,false,0,cb6qn19,t3_1inhti,t1_cb6qn19,t1_cb6puyp,null,1430397432,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"&gt; There are comparable cities with low immigration levels with strong community spirit though

OK, let's take the definition of a ""comparable city"" as being an equivalent World Cities. According to the GawC study [used by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city) this planet has only two Alpha++ cities -- London and New York. So really that's the only proper comparison you can make. And I don't think anyone would argue NYC has low immigration levels.

The next tier down are the Alpha+ cities: Hong Kong, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo, Shanghai, Chicago, Dubai, Sydney. Only one of those is European and we've already covered the situation there. Of the others, five are Asian and therefore have vastly different cultural and lifestyle expectations, not to mention very different histories.

So that just leaves Chicago and Sydney, both of which also have high levels of immigration. I don't know either city well enough to know if they have a ""community spirit"", but my point is that there really isn't anywhere that you *can* compare with London. It's a unique thing on the face of this planet, and while you rail against immigration forcing wages down and destroying communities it's impossible to argue with the fact that not only does London pay by far the highest wages in the country, but the fact that immigrants (and non-Londoner Brits) continue to be attracted here means that it must have something special on offer.

Capitalism is just a mechanism that should be understood and allowed to work as needed. Like the carbon cycle, photosynthesis or compound interest.

For me liberal means a controlled but relatively free market, an abundance of personal freedoms and a government which works for the people.

The problem we have now is corruption, not capitalism.

I am not a neo-liberal - to me that's a conservative with a mask on. I'm not a libertarian, to me that's a reactionary with a mask on.

I describe myself as either a liberal or a radical centrist. The only radical PM we've ever had in the UK is Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a Liberal.

Radical centrist means I'm content to have radical solutions to problems, rather than the status quo. However I'm not from either the radical left or right. 

For example I believe that our political system needs a significant shake up to beat corruption. I believe we need to help systemic unemployment by intervention rather than shoving money (or beating with a stick). I want extremely heavily enforced laws, but I want a whole lot less of them.

My point about 'community spirit' is that if it is being broken down at the micro level by immigration surely it must be being broken down at the macro level? I have family in the working class who say that foreigners coming into their community are not integrating and are causing huge tensions.

Firstly, regardless of if any of the women knew what they were getting into or not, it is perfectly possible and reasonable to assume someone might feel fine with the idea but then when they turn up they ""want out"", only to feel intimidated and in over their head, feeling like they can't back out. This is **not** consent.

Also, the website might have been clear. Sex for money. So sure most of the students signing up would know what they were going into. However he was saying they would get upwards of £15k. That sort of sum is enough to tempt a lot more people than just the measly £60 for travel. There will be a lot of people who would never consider something  like this, but the thoughts of £15k of debt being written off for something as simple as sleeping with someone...sure...I can bet that would be tempting to a few people.

&gt;to keep up the book value of land means a deliberate refusal to build, for fear of exposing their assets' true worth. This zombie dysfunction needs firm government action, forcing them to sell if they won't build.

So basically all of these evil firms aren't willing to build on the land because the margin is too thin.  Why would that be the case when house prices are at record highs?  If we are in this terrible recession where joblessness is massive, and people are desperate for work, wouldn't it make sense to build the new houses now on the land?  But maybe hold of selling them?  Or is it simply too hard to raise the capital.

I'd suggest that in fact the quote means they are looking to build fewer, higher quality houses.  Being Polly, it is of course hard to attribute the quote, but assuming she means this end of year report (http://plc.taylorwimpey.co.uk/Resources/Documents/InvestorRelations/2011-01-18%20Trading%20Statement%20-%20FINAL%20(2).pdf) it isn't in my interpretation saying they want to build fewer uk homes, but that they wanted to address their perilous financial situation, in fact a quick shifty at their inventory book shows they've sold assets.  Whilst I don't have the specifics I'd imagine that would be anything they thought too low margin.

But lets not let pesky things like facts get in the way of a good rant hey!  So why aren't they making a massive profit building these houses?  Because they've been building in places which aren't profitable?

I'm not suggesting we don't have a problem with the supply, quite the opposite, but often its due to planning rules and regulations preventing new buildings, or for instance encouraging the shitty terrace conversions we see all over London, rather than tearing down the terraced house and building something purpose built.  Plenty of people, myself included would be very happy to borrow money from the bank to build a new home or two, the profit potential would be huge.  Until that land has planning permission, then the margin is tiny.  If we want more houses, we need to address the planning situation, which is more than just saying Yes, it involves massive infrastructure spending too.

okay, nobody will doubt that Arsenal are basically the kings of buying cheap and selling high, but at what cost??? NOT BLOODY WINNING ANYTHING! the reason players are demanding such ""crazy"" wages is because there is now so much money in football. if the club is making a profit, the players are not overpaid. it's simple as that! 

if you have a TV show which is making £1,000,000 a week profit, then regardless of how much the people involved in making the show are paid, they are not overpaid! it's only when the wages are accounting to the club making a loss that they become overpaid (and even then it isn't that simple because of the delay between expenditure and re-coopering of the initial expenditure).

you cannot say ""this player is not ""worth"" £X"" because value is so complex! Essien clearly was worth £33m to Chelsea at the time; as i said, it's about developing a brand!

yes we are financially neutral! the debt is irrelevant! for the past 2 years we have been as good as neutral (total loss of just under £3m - which is nothing!)!

your argument saying that you did all of your extravagant buying before prices got super high just shows your ignorance on the matter! you were still willing to spend more than any club in the country!!! it's all relevant you see! 
furthermore you're just exemplifying my point, you did it BEFORE!!!! you had already bought your way to the top!! getting to the top is the expensive bit, staying there is easy due to the sponsorship!! 

you just bought your way to the top before anybody cared and you have been riding the sponsorship money ever since then, complaining when other clubs try to do the exact same thing you did 20 years ago! yeah, the amount is different, but it's all relative!!

Though to be honest guys, I don't even think Arsenal are worthy to be talked about by us right now. They can't shut up about us in threads on other subs and on top of that they come raiding this place twice a week, post ""master trole"" threads and think we are taking the piss out of them because they are our competition.

We have bigger fish to fry this season and lets focus on them before classenal. I'm guilty of this too as the banner is my idea but a couple of days ago the difference between their sub and our sub was that ours was focused on our own transfers, news and players while theirs was talking mostly about transfers of their ex-players, competition, moaning about other teams, comparing fans at the airport in Asia with other teams etcetera. On top of that they cant even get along with each other let alone other teams. This week a lot of us contributed to the piss taking and lets not give them this much attention because at the end of the day we don't even want their name to be listed under that Chelsea name up top.

As an example go read some main discussion threads where they argue, fight and actually down vote each other worse than /r/Soccer simply for having opinions. This has caused them to get further divided into /r/Gunners, /r/truegunners , /r/Gooners , /r/ArsenalFC and /r/Arsenal (I might be missing a few still). 

Lets not give them what they want anymore and go back to taking the piss out of them every once in a while but not give them as much attention as they are getting from us right now. That is their job as that is their primary discussion point, to talk about others.

Edit : Thanks to the Gunners for coming here and further proving my point. Please keep leaving the downvotes as well because they only back me up. Though to be honest I was making the points in a Chelsea community and asking them to stop talking about you lot because it is rare having these 2-3 threads about you here and I really don't want us to waste our time on you and turn our sub into yours. 

To those who are explaining to me how those other subs were formed, I have been contacted by their mods in the past on my sub and I know exactly where the majority of them stand. How do you think I know they exist in the first place? 

It is also hilarious to see how you lot come here on any opportunity even if you are not mentioned (this I at least understand). If you were to peruse every club who made fun of you **on their subreddits** and would like to vote brigade them then I am offering you a 1 time free deal on designing and creating /r/ShitOtherClubsSayAboutArsenal for you where you can undertake this vital mission for shutting up every sub for talking negatively about you (decreasing your class).

You can't play favourites with schoolchildren. And you know what? You sometimes have to be hardline about it, which is exactly*why* I referred to the school's Ofsted report and Performance Tables. As you can see there was a whole period around 2011 where there was a massive dip in KS2 results. Related to the massive turnaround of staff due to inadequate teaching. Which, also has the result of *poor behaviour*.

I know many schools have come down hard with the rules, just to drag the school back up to the standard it should be.

&gt;There may have been some issues within the past in regards to bad behavior

Yes, and obviously there has been something, otherwise there would not be such a rule. It might have been a rule dictated by the hotel themselves.

&gt;You've chosen to focus yourself primarily on them though, maybe because it makes you feel safer to do so.

Safer? I'm providing a context to the school (i.e. Ofsted and Performance Tables) which no one else in this thread had looked at first.

There are many schools of thought when it comes to schooling and teaching. Through some of my experience I can provide a context as to why this school has become so strict.

However, I do think the place has a few flaws as a business - they aim to attract hardcore crowds but don't have the setups to support many players, and they don't have much to support casual players. Mario Kart and/or Smash Bros setups in a corner with a sofa or some such would go some way to remedying that latter point - as would more recognisable drinks names, since all they have atm are drinks named for Street Fighter (definitely the most accessible names), SC2, LoL and pro players.  
It's like they're aiming to draw in a crowd that simply isn't big enough to frequently justify such a venue yet - the eSports spectator. I would definitely suggest they broaden their appeal if they want business to pick up. Get some everyman games in there, or at least more than just two setups that are free to use outside of tourneys (my more casual mates didn't get to have a go on Street Fighter 4 even once, and even if they had, they'd have been up against genuine hardcore players - not an inclusive environment!), and try to save up and spring for being able to put 10 PC setups out at once for actual LoL+DotA2 competitions.",0,1374356475,null,0,false,0,cb6tz4r,t3_1inp0b,t1_cb6tz4r,t1_cb6te8x,null,1430395786,2,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,2

true,DrPubertybeard,null,null,"When can the police enter and search

Police can only enter premises without a warrant if a serious or dangerous incident has taken place.

Situations in which the police can enter premises without a warrant include when they want to: deal with a breach of the peace or prevent it; enforce an arrest warrant; arrest a person in connection with certain offences; recapture someone who has escaped from custody; save life or prevent serious damage to property.


Apart from when they are preventing serious injury to life or property, the police must have reasonable grounds for believing that the person they are looking for is on the premises.

If the police do arrest you, they can also enter and search any premises where you were during or immediately before the arrest. They can search only for evidence relating to the offence for which you have been arrested, and they must have reasonable grounds for believing there is evidence there. They can also search any premises occupied by someone who is under arrest for certain serious offences. Again, the police officer who carries out the search must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is evidence on the premises relating to the offence or a similar offence.

In other circumstances, the police must have a search warrant before they can enter the premises. They should enter property at a reasonable hour unless this would frustrate their search. When the occupier is present, the police must ask for permission to search the property – again, unless it would frustrate the search to do this.

When they are carrying out a search police officers must:

identify themselves and - if they are not in uniform - show their warrant card, and
explain why they want to search, the rights of the occupier and whether the search is made with a search warrant or not.
If the police have a warrant, they can force entry if:

the occupier has refused entry, or

it is impossible to communicate with the occupier, or

the occupier is absent, or

the premises are unoccupied, or

they have reasonable grounds for believing that if they do not force entry it would hinder the search, or someone would be placed in danger.

true,scg_30,1953,Frank Lampard,"Is anyone else disappointed to learn that it looks like Marco van Ginkel is the only central midfielder that the club is going to add to the squad this summer? Of the players Mourinho mentions in the article:

* Essien - his knees could go at any moment. we all know the quality Michael has, even after the damage his knees have suffered. But we also know he is not the player that he once was, and just how injury prone he has been. I'm not sure i'm comfortable relying on him to get through the season unscathed.

* Lampard - great, but more of a creative force than a defensive one. Also 35 yrs old, and while he still has a lot to offer the squad he can't perform to his highest level every three days anymore.

* Mikel - is he capable of becoming world class? I have doubts. He is a quality squad player and Mourinho knows him very well, but he's hardly in the top tier of holding midfielders currently playing in European 1st divisions.

* Ramires - A valuable squad member, but is best utilized in more of a free role running box to box for 90min, than as a defensive holder or deep-lying playmaker.

* van Ginkel - looks a terrific prospect, but is only 20 yrs old and has only ever played in Eredivisie. Don't get me wrong I think he has real potential, but I hardly expect him to make a title-winning contribution to the squad in his first season.

 Tell me my right-wing friend, have you ever dismissed a source because of your values? I think you may have. I do so here because I have a tendency to not give credence to people *scientifically* shown to have no wish to entertain facts and are frankly a waste of time. My values here are that this person has shown they have no credibility as a resource on the matter.

I'm sure someone smarter will pull the article apart, but it will be a tedious job entering the novella range. It's a pattern in having to deal with swivel eyed climate 'skeptics'.

-Jose seems confident that Essien can contribute, otherwise he wouldn't have taken him on loan at Madrid and given him playing time. Anything approaching his past form would do a lot to bring balance the midfield. 

-I agree about Lampard completely...he can still contribute, but as a squad player

-Mikel is hard to judge and divides opinion thoroughly; personally, I think he has what it takes to be a starting holding midfielder at a club of Chelsea's stature

-Ramires has already been a great player for us, and I expect under Jose he will truly blossom. Players of his profile are always extremely important in Jose's teams.

-Agree again on Van Ginkel

In important games when more than 1 holding midfielders is necessary, I think that any starting combination of Essien, Ramires, and Mikel (depending on the formation) should suffice.  For example, in a 4231 any combination of 2 of those guys. In a 433, you could use just 1 or all 3. In less important games (or maybe just less often) you could change out some of those names for Lampard, Van Ginkel, Luiz, Chalobah, etc. Given these options, there's enough flexibility and talent for a skilled manager to use in a team worthy of winning titles. Signing a new holding mid simplifies the equation by giving someone who could be called upon to start nearly all the games in his position, with trade-offs like transfer fees, wages, limiting younger players' opportunities, etc. If what Chelsea has now isn't enough (which is quite possible), at least the current players should be enough to hold us over to the next transfer window, where hopefully the club would stop making the same mistake.",0,1374362483,null,0,false,0,cb6vnuv,t3_1ipvyd,t1_cb6vnuv,t1_cb6uufi,null,1430394992,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Don't worry about the gym. Trust me on this when I say that no one at a gym really gives a shit about any other guys (it's sadly different for women, they'll get harassed a lot) there beyond looking out to make sure someone is not going to injure themselves. I've been going for a few weeks now as a slightly overweight and unfit guy and no one has said anything to be me beyond one nice guy correcting my weightlifting form; everyone's just there to focus on improving themselves. 

If you're REALLY worried, go during the day. It'll usually be really quiet.

As for volunteering I know of a couple of websites, www.do-it.org.uk and www.vinspired.com although they can be very hit and miss. 

The council thing sounds like a good idea but remember not to be disheartened if they say no, local governments can be a massive pain in the arse.

Also about your apprenticeships, you're probably being rejected immediately because the ones you're applying for sound like the ones intended for 16-18 year olds. Anyone older applying is usually discounted immediately because the company can't fully receive funding; so don't be disheartened about that!

I will second as well that the cumulative effects of small, positive changes will make a big difference to your life.

Don't be afraid as well of temporarily postponing your dreams and aspirations until you feel ready to pursue them. You've got to be pragmatic, it sounds like you're in no position to open a B&amp;B. There's no shame in doing that in a few years.

Edit: Those aren't naff subjects in your A-Levels by the way. Have you considered a school leaver work program if you could find one that interests you?

As others have said the only thing you can do is pad it out with as much as possible. Most of my sheet is filled with 'Checked this website, checked that website' every day, followed by whatever job is actually available that I stand a hope in hell at getting. 

But it is a nerve wracking moment when someone actually does check the sheet and all you can think of is 'How the fuck will I feed my family if they decide I did it wrong?' 

Went to a Work programme group session a few weeks ago, and the woman running it pretty much said 'There's around 100 people applying for each job, it's not your skills that will get you the job it's pure luck. Don't hold out much hope.'

Word on the street is that the Axces is the bargain of the century as you get all the benefits of an Arai without the obscene price-tag - the best fit, better safety and overall build quality Arai are famous for (it's no an understatement when people say you're not buying a helmet, you're buying an Arai). Shark helmets are pretty decent, but they're no-where near the proven quality of Shoei/Arai, so check out the Axces II and the XR1100 as that's a proven workhorse of many a rider and I've yet to hear anyone complain about them.

The jacket and trousers look great for summer, but when it gets a bit cooler over winter you'll wish you'd bought something a bit more hardy - what I'd say is have a good set of all-weather gear as your every-day stuff and then buy summer ventilated stuff extraneously as/when you need it. I like leathers but they're not waterproof so you may want textiles - Hein Gericke do some great all-weather gear, just pick the gear which fits your budget. 

Boots look good but for that price you could also get a pair of Sidi's - I have the Black Rain Evos and they are by far the comfiest boots I've ever worn and they're waterproof to boot (haha) - can't recommend them highly enough. 

Gloves look good, waterproofing is obviously a must in British weather so you got that right. 

Have you thought about leathers? I like textiles, but find sometimes they're less comfortable for longer rides than my leathers are - mostly because the leathers warm and mold to fit you and provide great protection from the wind/cold.

While in a 4-3-3 scenario, you would have a *first choice (back-up)* CM trio of **Lampard (van Ginkel)**, **Ramires (Essien)**, and **De Rossi (Mikel)**.

The real difference is that Jose appears to be putting his faith in Essien and/or Mikel as his first choice starter in defensive midfield, rather than as squad players in the midfield area to cover for a more genuine-article type player at that position such as De Rossi. 

I have faith in Jose's plans, and with Essien, Lampard, Mikel, Ramires, and van Ginkel we still easily have one of the best midfields in the premiership.

The level of service I'm getting from Virgin has steadily gone downhill over the last few years from overselling, It's a damned shame as they used to be quite good. I hope that BT has enough dough to keep expanding their network as they may run into the exact same issues. 

Before the Virgin network got a very large uptake of new subscribers the level of service was pretty much the same as what BT are now offering barring the specifics of speed. 

Then the network slowly got clogged and degenerated to what at the moment can be a bit shit in my area. This was a direct result of huge overselling and a lack of infrastructure funding. The only reason they introduced a fair usage policy earlier in the year was in an attempt to correct the fuck up. Many of the older users in real terms have had service levels reduced even though they've been given ""increased speeds"" which are all smoke and mirrors. It's all very well and good but when you can't even watch 1 complete netflix movie without getting whammied then what's the point of all those extra sodding megabytes they giving out?

true,ChivalrousWombat,null,null,"I see your idea and I think that, while it's good on paper, it just wouldn't be feasible. Six players for two positions--I think we'll be lining up 4-**2**-3-1 most of the time, is an extreme excess, in my opinion.

There's at least 3 players who are getting way too much bench time or must be happy with getting the group stage Cup games.

Someone won't be happy. Not to mention, Van Ginkel, one of the hottest, young midfield properties in club football, is as at a pivotal moment in his career. He's chosen to join us, having faith that we can further his development, and competing with five established, world class midfielders is not going to do that.

Too many times Chelsea are accused of 'ruining' talent, I'd hate to see van Ginkel added to the list of evidence. But I digress.

I think your idea could work, but with one less player. If De Rossi were to come in--I'm all for it by the way, the man is top tier, I think someone has to go. Either Mikel or Essie

Mikel, he's great at his job, he retains possession and breaks up play really well, but his lack of forward play would make him my choice to leave, were this to happen.

Essien, like you've mentioned, his questionable state of fitness puts a big red dot by his name, but the man is loved by Mou, the club and the fans. His experience is really valuable to the younger players, and when he plays, I'm sure he could more than offer something. So while it would make sense to move Essien on, I wouldn't support it. It'd be like kicking Ferreira out two years ago.

So again, if de Rossi were to come in, I'd prefer to see one player go. That way, van Ginkel gets more playing time, and even younger players like McEachran, Chalohbah, Ake and Loftus-Cheek have a little less competition in the Cup games.",0,1374371267,null,0,false,0,cb6y19r,t3_1ipvyd,t1_cb6y19r,t1_cb6wufp,null,1430393873,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"I concede the Arai doesn't look as interesting, but looks are probably my lowest priority when it comes to helmets. There's a difference between Arai and Shark definitely, you say it's pretty basic but it's anything other than that. Basically Arai's are hand-built in Japan by a family who have been doing it for generations, they have the stiffest shells in the industry with perforation cover (meaning no sharp impacts will hit your skull), a special inner lining that's designed to mold to your head and fit supremely well - ever watch MotoGP? Wonder why everyone wears Arai? They're the ultimate in helmet tech - with their race helmets the standard for most racers - i'll concede this may make no difference on the street but IMO if you're going to spend that much money, I'd go for the helmet which the racers don't mind crashing in so when I inevitably take a tumble at 40mph on a country road I know my nonce will be safe. Arai's also have emergence removable cheek liner tabs for emergency services to safely remove your helmet in the event on a crash - so including the stiffer shell and more ergonomic fit, there's also that much added safety. Checkout Revzilla comparison's on Youtube, they do a load of comparisons of absolutely masses of gear - the Arai Axces II is called the Vector II in the U.S so search that and listen to the specs. 

If you prefer the profile of the Shark, why not the XR1100 Shoei? It's a more standard bike-helmet shape and it's a proven design which everyone seemingly loves? 

Usually ventilated stuff isn't the best for wet weather but I see there are removable linings which are apparently waterproof so maybe it's good I haven't had any experience with it so I can't really tell you. All I know is that generally waterproof + mesh doesn't really hold true, but I may be wrong. RST is generally considered a decent brand, so I doubt it's all lies!

Go try on some leathers and go try on some textiles - one thing about textiles which I hated was getting my neck rubbed raw from the material whenever I did a shoulder-check. A minor thing, but something which pissed me off enough to never wear my textiles unless it was raining - plus there's something really plush feeling when wearing full leathers on a cold day whilst you're riding and being all warm and insulated but still supple and flexible, I can't really describe it but I like it all the same. I have a two piece set of Hein Gericke Pro Sports jacket with Richa Street trousers I got second hand off Ebay for 70 odd quid and I love them to pieces!

I'd buy Sidi just for the comfort really, but it's worth trying a couple on before you jump ship either way as they may fit you differently. Sidi are well known for their comfort/protection but racers do swear by Alpinestars, so either is completely suitable. Mind, Sidi only produce boots/shoes, so that's kinda their sole expertise coming in handy whereas Alpinestars do loads of different gear/clothing - not that that makes much difference in terms of R&amp;D but worth keeping in mind.

- Scan for malware/viruses, etc.

We even had the engineer out to fix something related to our phoneline. We paid extra for him to look at and fix if necessary the wall socket connection. He re-wired it, checked the cables outside and checked the green cabinet. Everything working.

Internet speed still the same. The reason is that fibre goes to the cabinet and then it is copper from the cabinet to your house. This results in a massive drop off in speed and unreliable connection that gets worse at peak times.

There was a honeymoon period of a couple of weeks at 30-40mb/s then it dropped off dramatically to barely reaching 16mb most days even in the early hours.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"This whole rhetoric from the government about this has got me a bit worried. 

If you tried to search for indecent images for children on the internet, through something like google, you wouldn't be able to find anything, because google do a hell of a lot of work to stop people accessing this stuff, which is really good. 

However, the government keep coming out with statements like this, making it sound like there is a lot of these indecent images about, and that websites like Google are doing nothing about it. This is spreading this idea to the public, who will in turn think these things (we've seen the same with benefits, and foreigners). 

&gt;The prime minister has warned companies they need to act to block access to child abuse images on the internet** or face legal controls**.

This is the most worrying thing. How far do these companies have to go to stop the government adding 'legal control'. Personally, I don't think they can do anything. The government want more control over what we view on the internet, and while I'm fine if that's something as disgusting as child porn, I'm worrying they will extend this to things like 'The Pirate Bay'. They are probing now to see if there is any major opposition (which there won't be), and then they'll add more controls under the guise of stopping paedophiles and terrorists, whereas what they really want is more control over what we view (and to win voters for fixing a problem which wasn't there, or pretending to fix a problem that is).

And of course, we can't talk out against it, because then they would say we're supporting paedophiles and terrorists. 

&gt;Cameron - ""There are rules about what films you can see in a cinema, what age you have to be to buy alcohol or cigarettes.

&gt;""But on the internet, there aren't those rules, so we need to help parents with control,"" he said.

Except there are loads of problems, many offered by internet providers, which allow parents to control what their children see on the internet. And, as quoted in the article, experts are a lot of this child porn on the internet is well hidden away, so it's not like your child will randomly stumble upon it.

tl;dr government trying to get more controls over what we see on the internet under the guise of stopping paedophiles and terrorists. ",0,1374375247,null,0,false,1,cb6z51w,t3_1iqb0z,t1_cb6z51w,t3_1iqb0z,null,1430393281,49,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,49

I was talking about 'safer' in regards to people like you's relationship with rules and authority. Here they should have employed critical thinking to conjure up a punishment more fitting to the crime. This might need an element of 'freethinking' though (but that might take some imagination which you're probably not so used to being an alien concept and all). Hence the whole needing to feel 'safer' when looking to rules to guide you and your weak sense of self.

As for Downing, I think he was bought at a time when Liverpool had zero creativity on the wing and he at the time was a good crosser of the ball (not sure what else he did bc i never really watched him play much).
