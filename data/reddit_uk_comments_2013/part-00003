true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;There are reasons why only very tiny countries become tax havens I'm sure.

Whilst it's true that tiny countries tend to become tax havens (you can pull *a lot* more money in from having 100,000 registered international companies in a few square miles), check for example some of the larger US states.  Alaska is, by any stretch of the imagination, a tax haven.

&gt;If you piss everyone else off it's going to be difficult to get trade deals to support our very large economy.

I don't see why.  Still part of the single market.  Still world leading finance centre.  Still world leading high end manufacturer.  Still a major innovator with an infrastructure.  Still lots of contacts in the world.  Why on earth would anybody not enter into a trade deal just because they have a lower tax rate?  It's nothing personal.  It's just business and if it makes good business sense to trade, then they will.

Like you'll say later, 

             *""They aren't going to miss out on such a 
               good market. And if they did leave another 
               business (a competitor) would take their place 
               anyway.""*

&gt;We can't just tell every other developed country to fuck off and expect there to be no retaliation trade-wise.

Hang on.  There are EU countries alone that have around half the corporation tax rate of the UK and have had for some time, more so in Europe, so they really don't have much ground to stand on in complaining if the situation were reversed and the UK dropped down to a minimal 5% corporation tax rate.

Let's face it: France just jacked up their own rates and did it to themselves!

&gt;We are of course in the EU but they are hardly going to like a country abolishing corporate tax, who knows whether it's even allowed or not.

Plenty of tax havens already in the EU, and I know whether it is allowed or not.  It is.  Some indices put four of the world's top five tax havens  as being in the EU, with a fifth at the geographic heart of it in Switzerland.

Put it this way; what law prevents them?

There are even countries with zero capital gains and the UK is at 27%.  People aren't mad at Hungary or Ireland or Liechtenstein.  They're mad at the companies that use them as a refuge, and they should be mad at the system that allows them to use them.

&gt;Corporation tax is about 8% of the money the government receives, that's not a small amount.. The annual deficit would increase by 50% from the year previous easily if you scrapped it.

No economist could ever say that without looking into in far greater detail.  Even speculation would have to take into account the extra revenue it would also create, or how by using a more efficient/elective tax in the absence of corporation tax could be used.

&gt;That being said given how globalised the world is becoming corporate tax rates will probably continue falling. But just dropping it to nothing overnight would be stupid and irresponsible.

I'm pretty sure we'd be announcing such a thing in a Chancellor's Budget for the following financial year, much as Osborne announced this year's changes last March. 

&gt;What we should be doing is getting rid of loopholes

Watch this space.  This coming March/April may be a good month for you if that's on your bucket list, namely the up and coming 2013 Finance Bill.   There's not much it can do to fix the egregious usage of the four freedoms when it comes to tax bed hopping, but then there's not much anything could do.  Should put a stop to the likes of the K2 schemes though.

&gt;the fact is corporate tax is a tax on profit and so as long as it's profitable to set up businesses in this country, companies like starbucks will always be here. 

That's the whole point, they're purposely registering losses or breaking even in the UK and paying royalties instead through Liechenstein legally at only 2.5% - or have been doing.

It's not so much a loophole.  It's pretty much called the Single Market!

I'm not saying the Single Market is bad.  I rather like it.

I've never really understood why the Americans even bother taking British sitcoms and adapting them.  They even tried to do an American version of Coupling, which *already existed* in Friends...

Personally I think the worst adaptation is The Inbetweeners USA.  They've tried to transplant the British characters and jokes in there but it just doesn't work; what's sad is that you can tell if they just tool the *idea* and name behind it and ran with that it could be brilliant (I presume the USA education system also has its version of 'the inbetweener').",0,1357420045,null,0,false,0,c7rmusd,t3_1600nw,t1_c7rmusd,t1_c7rj05e,null,1430866479,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"Your assessment is correct, but I disagree that it's a terrible idea. You can't hide land from HMRC so LVT is near impossible to avoid. An LVT would encourage companies to move to (and thus provide employment in) cheaper areas, it would reduce the number of people (especially foreigners) buying up residential housing as a safe haven or speculative asset, it would provide some extra stability in the housing market (the more expensive houses get, the more tax that is due on them, theoretically reducing demand), and it would mean that local communities would benefit directly from any improvements made to the area. 

It works well if you see land as a social asset owned by the country as a whole rather than by individuals. Also, the introduction of an LVT should be accompanied by large reductions in income and corporation taxes, to encourage productive work over rentierism.

Granted, it's no panacea. I imagine it will not be kind on the rental market so we would probably need to build more state owned/council housing.",0,1357420712,null,0,false,0,c7rn1d5,t3_15zcki,t1_c7rn1d5,t1_c7rhydd,null,1430866644,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

While I'd love to see Mikel score, he should never be in a position to have to make that run, it isn't his job. But more to the point, Torres simply hasn't made a run like the one Ba made for his second EVER in a Blue shirt as far as I can remember. The movement Ba had all match was fantastic. Look where he is on all the goals other than the penalty.

1) Sure it was a tap in, but he made sure there wasn't going to be the unlikely event of a goal-line clearance.

2) He is lurking at the back post, and had Moses pulled his wonderful half-volley outside the post, Ba would have had a decent chance to put it in.

3) He is right behind Ivanovic, sure he may not have won the resultant header, but at least he was there, and he made sure he was in the air and in position should Iva have missed.

4) He created the run that gave Hazard a pass, and one-timed it into the corner.

Tell me you've seen Torres do that in the past 2 years.

EDIT: Listen, I understand that there are always going to be Torres supporters, and that's great, that's your prerogative. The thing you need to understand as Torres supporters is that Chelsea Football Club is about the CLUB more than ANY player. We have supported him long and hard, but he simply hasn't given the Club a return on the investment, whether it be through scoring goals or just general attitude. He always acts the victim, and frankly, most of us are sick of it. Now we have what could be a quality striker that can get the CLUB back on track, and that is exciting.

Hell, maybe Torres will learn a thing or two, or get a fire lit under his sulking ass and we can start to REALLY challenge for some trophies.

""campy"" (my friend's term)... as other episodes in 9&amp;10's run, so they don't get discouraged before they get to enjoy. Since there was such a huge style change between 9&amp;10 and 11 I think if I were to change this procedure and try and start someone with 11 I'd just start them with The Eleventh Hour.

The one good thing that I will say about series 5 is that it had absolutely amazing concepts, Amy's choice in particular being my favorite. 

That being said, I feel that series 5 is the weakest series of revived Who. They did not get the execution of the concepts correct in my opinion. I find most episodes of series 5 boring and slow paced.

I think the final two episodes of the series were good but nothing spectacular.  

Season 6 was much much better and had some cracking episodes. 

Series 4 is my favorite, I like how Davies left subtle clues throughout the season like the bee's disappearing and all the missing planets.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; very few would be paying the 22% corporation tax on those profits

I run a company so I have experience of this. You can be sure every company offsets costs against corp tax but that's the way it's supposed to be. For example I pay about £1000 a year in accountancy costs, that comes out of the pool *before* profit based tax comes out, it's a genuine cost of doing business. 

It makes a lot of sense the more you think about it. That money went to another UK business for which they will paying tax on any profit they make, and so-on down the line until you get to the lady that's paid to water the plants. If every level were fully taxed before profit the overall taxation rate would be insane. 

HMRC are old-hands in this and they know full-well what is valid and what is not. Big problem just now is that there's nothing stopping a single ""company"" operating as a collection of companies, each overcharging the other. Similar to what Starbucks were doing but not as profitable because more tax will be paid overall (as it doesn't end in a tax haven). Ultimately there simply isn't an authority that can determine ""widget XYZ""'s real cost. HMRC can deal with this situation but it's very labour intensive to investigate the ownership &amp; background of every part of the scam.

"" Chronic antagonism was therefore built into the Six Counties state. The Protestants repressed the Catholics, organising a special sectarian part - time wing of the police, the B-Specials, to do so.

They built a solid Protestant bloc, involving all classes from slum Protestants to horse Protestants, against the Catholic minority. Partly for political reasons, but also because there was great scarcity and poverty, they systematically discriminated against Catholics.

More Catholics were unemployed than Protestants; run - down areas where unemployment never dropped below the Great Depression level, even during the years of the boom in the '40s, '50s and '60s, tended to be Catholic areas. Politics was largely communal - sectarian politics - Catholic against Protestant. Catholics were cheated of local democracy: the system long discarded in Britain of giving business people one vote for every business premises continued in Northern Ireland where it hit the poorer Catholic community. Areas with big Catholic majorities - Derry City for example - were blatantly gerrymandered to give the Protestant/ Unionist minority control of the local council. Because votes went with houses, Catholic housing was among the worst in Western Europe.

There was systematic anti - Catholic discrimination in employment. The Harland and Wolff shipyard, and the big engineering works, employed practically no Catholics. The Sirocco Engineering Works in East Belfast, standing in the Catholic enclave of the Short Strand where there was 70% unemployment, had four Catholics out of 600 workers in the mid - '70s. As a direct consequence of this, the composition of the trade unions was titled heavily against the Catholics.

The unions remained united on day - to - day trade unionism, on a basis of tacit acceptance of these discriminatory practices and agreement not to raise political questions concerning the Six Counties' constitution. Trade union unity was unity of the privileged with the oppressed living on the terms laid down by the privileged - 
..The situation was the same with the political labour movement. In the '60s the Northern Ireland Labour Party had a socialist left-wing in Derry and Belfast. But it was a Unionist, that is a fundamentally Protestant, party. Time and again, throughout its history......
.....The Protestant workers were a privileged layer. Their privileges were marginal - but nevertheless big privileges. Leon Trotsky once remarked that the greatest possible privilege is to have a crust of bread when everybody else is starving. To have, as part of the Protestant ruling block, a considerably better chance of a job amongst mass unemployment, was no small privilege.""

The original Tumblr post that started it all is [here.](http://transcendantalismsm.tumblr.com/post/32477207252/rose-went-away-so-the-doctor-is-blue-ask-donna)

/u/Spectacularity is the person who made it into the pretty image seen in this thread.

I'm not surprised or upset that the credit to the original creator (me) has been lost along the way over the last few months: existence on the internet over time tends to do that to things; it's pretty much unavoidable. 
It doesn't help that I now have a different Reddit username than the one I was using back when this first made its way here (I didn't post it here, but someone else did) and I confirmed it to be my work. 

Couple things, since y'all seem to be doing quite a bit of talking about this:

1.) I am (and was at the time) very much aware that the reason the Tardis is blue is because police phone boxes were blue, and the Chameleon Circuit was broken, thus keeping it in the shape of the familiar box. I chose to kind of gloss over this, because a) regardless of the actual reason for its color, the whole blue = sad thing is a pretty easy connection for a poet to make and for the reader to understand, and b) IIRC, the Doctor knows how to fix the Chameleon Circuit and chooses not to, for unspecified sentimental reasons. I figured they might as well by *my* unspecified reasons, in this particular case. I know very well that the TARDIS's color was not meant to have any symbolic meaning; I was merely making the statement that the color is very fitting given the circumstances.

2.) A lot of people have commented on my omission of earlier companions; this was not meant to belittle their contributions to the show and/or the Doctor's character. I just didn't know enough about them, and wanted to keep the poem short. I was aiming for an ""Ouch, right in the feels"" kind of thing, not a completely accurate tribute to the show. 
As for the Doctor's entire species (and, specifically, his family) being a huge source of his pain, too: Yes, that was left out, because that's a bit of a different animal. The guilt of being the last surviving Timelord and the destroyer of his own kind are the things that haunt him constantly, and the presence of his companions is the only thing that helps alleviate that pain. But he always loses them, one way or another. 

3.) I didn't originally post this to Reddit back when I first wrote it, because I didn't really feel like it was Reddit's ""speed"". That is to say, that it wasn't good enough for Reddit's more discerning eye. It was just something I did for fun in between classes, and it kind of blew up around me. 
Also! Um, forgive anything else that exists on my Tumblr, if you happen peruse it. Almost all of it is, ah, not very good. 

Hope this clears some things up.

The British identity didn't emerge as an ethnicity, but largely replaced and formed new cultures. We haven't invaded anywhere for hundreds of years and, in the places that we did, they explicitly separated and rejected their British identity.

Americans would be insulted or offended if they were referred to as British. This is the problem with your idea. 

Ethnicities, such as they are, survive because the incumbent population absorbs the settlers. Take the 'Irish Americans' who arrived as a result of the potato famines. They were absorbed into the American system. 

Britain conquered places, destroying the native society or dominating it. Thus they became the population.

The nearest thing we have to 'ethnic British' are the ex-pats. People living on the Costa del Sol, working as TEFL teachers or whatever. The parents will have British passports and be British. The kids, are probably a new 'ethnic British'.

We also have islanders (Falkland island inhabitants) but whether they are 'British', 'Falkland islanders' or 'ethnic British' is anyone's guess.

TLDR: Yes, we conquered places, replacing the 'natives'. 'Ethnic' communities are formed when places aren't conquered, but the incoming people are absorbed into the existing society. There's very few examples of that and no real 'ethnic British'.",0,1357429442,null,0,false,0,c7rpisr,t3_14jksv,t1_c7rpisr,t3_14jksv,null,1430867810,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

&gt;There was systematic anti - Catholic discrimination in employment
Yet the piece provides no evidence of this 'systematic' discrimination. Discrimination in jobs has happened to both communities and will continue to do so as a fact of life in a divided society. There are cases on both sides going back in time to prove this. Conor Murphy proves it is still ongoing.

The gerrymandering I pointed out, and also the fact that it never actually meant much. A lot like whether the flag flies on City Hall 365 or not. The system of voting favoured wealthy vs the poor and as such was equally discriminatory to poor Protestants. I note the 'author' of that piece neglects to mention them of course. Well, until he contradicts himself with 'marginal but big privileges' spoofing:

&gt;In the '60s the Northern Ireland Labour Party had a socialist left-wing in Derry and Belfast. But it was a Unionist, that is a fundamentally Protestant, party. Time and again, throughout its history...... .....The Protestant workers were a privileged layer. Their privileges were marginal - but nevertheless big privileges. Leon Trotsky once remarked that the greatest possible privilege is to have a crust of bread when everybody else is starving.

Comedy gold. Does he/she do stand up? This piece reeks of anything that is not of an Irish nationalist hue must immediately be classified Protestant.

God knows what you're quoting from. If that actually found a publishing house I think it emphasises my original point to Ulysses1978:

&gt;there are a lot of people who make it their business to disinform in order to serve their political 'goals'.

true,veridical,num2,,"Thanks for that. To be honest I'm not necessarily advocating for us to buy him - he was just the first name I thought of for an alternative.


I have indeed watched a few Sporting matches recently - a friend of mine is something of a fan - and he does look really pretty good. He's not a like-for-like alternative to Damiao though. He's the same height (6'1"") but not as strong or bulky, so he hasn't got the same target-man nature. He is an excellent finisher though, as you said, and has the agility and positioning to lead the line well. He seems to be a poacher at heart, but not as extremely or narrow-mindedly as JD Trouble. Apparently he's played in midfield on occasion, so he can certainly contribute something on that front. He's got 5 goals in 12 appearances so far this season, and got 14 from 25 in the last.


He's Dutch, so his English is likely to be excellent, and I hear he's the kind of person 'Arry would call a ""top lad"". Sporting are doing crap this season (bottom half of the table), so there are noises being made about him wanting to leave - there are rumours that Fiorentina are looking to buy him. Transfermarkt reckon he'd go for about £10m, which is a lot less than we'd pay for Damiao.

The more I write this stuff the more I'm persuaded we should buy him. I see his as essentially a compromise between JD and Ade - better finisher than Ade (at least this season), and better at passing and holding than Jermaine.

Make sure you buy an unmodified car, with low milage, and low engine size.

I like the fact he is versatile as well, but uncertain whether he'd have the strength to lead the line in the EPL, but as a third choice striker he might be able to create and impact off the bench. I'm not even sure Damiao could lead the line, either (I'm reserved about him, seems overrated to me).

As per him being unlike either JD or Ade, I think that is a good thing. What we lack sometimes is someone who can come on in a close game and add a different dimension to our play up front. Whether he is the one to do that, I'm not so sure. In any case, we really need another striker, and preferably one that threatens both JD and Ade's place/s in the starting XI. Getting a little tired of being linked with every available midfielder.

Look, I think I may be overly harsh on the guy, as he is a proven goal scorer, but he wastes sooo many damn chances because he has to pop off a shot. (my opinion of course).

I'd rather have an Ade any day of the year when we have players like Bale, Lennon, Siggy, Dempsey, Dembele and even Sandro all rushing in and around the box.  With Defoe all you get is long shots, or one on ones, Ade wants to play cute one twos to cut apart defenders.  I appreciate that a lot more than 1 shot going in for 10 shots rebounding off defenders or going wide.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; it is interesting that Davies considers Tennant as space jesus.

Oh, well, I don't know if Davies has said as much in interviews. There's just a lot of little things peppered through the series. Maybe it's something only an atheist picks up on.

For example, in Gridlock, the masses sit in their cars going around in circles, singing The Old Rugged Cross (a religious hymn) at the same time every day and hoping for a better future that's never going to come by way of their praying/singing/hoping. 

Along comes the Doctor who actually does something to improve their situation -- which is a 'thing' with atheists who view prayer as useless, wishing people would instead turn their grief into productive action. And then in the most dire of moments, seconds away from death, Martha says, ""You've got your faith. You've got your songs and your hymns. And I've got the Doctor.""

In Sound of the Drums/Last of the Time Lords, the entire population of the planet chants (prays) the Doctor's name (some even closing their eyes as they do so), causing him to be reborn (sort of), rising in the air with his arms out (like Jesus on the cross) and then when the Doctor could vanquish his enemy, he instead says, ""I forgive you."" That's very Space Jesus of him. Davies presents a savior who ostensibly isn't magical, but instead saves people using his brain and science (albeit wacky science, but in the Who universe it's presented as plausible).

Moffat has continued this perspective on religion a little bit. In The God Complex (the hotel episode where the beast preys on peoples' fears) the Doctor realizes faith is essential to their fear (a very atheistic idea) and the beast preys on their faith. The Doctor says Amy and Rory are both ""secular,"" which usually means atheistic. 

Rory is immune to the beast, but Amy is susceptible because she has faith in the Doctor. Rory, being an atheist, was shown the door out of their plight, but Amy, the faithful person, was trapped because she was waiting for the Doctor to save her instead of her saving herself (again, a very atheistic perspective).",0,1357440885,null,0,false,0,c7rspum,t3_16113l,t1_c7rspum,t1_c7rrut4,null,1430869348,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,CrazyCatLady108,null,null,"the hymn in the gridlock i saw as more of a faith in the state/government. kind of like brainwashing citizens to obey a certain way. but it does make sense since you are always trying to move up and closer to the way out. but if you move down you get torn apart by those crab looking things, which could be considered hell. 

with martha, she is my favorite companion, i think she is very much in love with the doctor. more so than any of the other companions. she will sacrifice everything for him. not even to say she will die for him but she will sacrifice her family and fight to the death to save him. at the time when the two met he technically swept her off her feet. i mean i could not imagine a more romantic encounter. charming, silly, smart, and a hero that saves the day sacrificing himself for humanity that he is not part of. she spends the rest of her companionship trying to fall out of love with him. (when she gets trapped in the capsule heading for the sun and her desperate knocking on the window with such fear in her eyes. the doctor will save her. he has to. he is the doctor. and the doctor's fear that he will fail to save her.) 

with the sound of drums, ugh i still get chills from that. it is quite religious to chant doctor's name and the whole power of faith. and doctor's sacrifice is very jesus like, however. i see the doctor always blaming himself for everything that goes wrong. the reason he always tries to save people is because he feels all the bad happens because people have come in contact with him. after all the master only took over earth because doctor vowed to protect it. so while his sacrifice seems jesus like one could also claim he feels it is his fault and thus must take the brunt of punishment. and the reason he forgives master is because he realizes the man is sick/broken. towards the end of 'he will knock four times' we see that master has been driven insane and it is not really his fault. also with the 10th doctor being a pessimist one could say it is quite out of character to just pull the trigger on master. (even if he had killed plenty by other's hands)

now with amy and rory, i will say from the beginning i do not like amy. she is so flat and blah, i rather see more of river than amy. but i do have to agree with you that she is more likely to sit back and let doctor fix everything. but i dont think its a religious faith more of a parental one, considering she first met him when she was a child. she seems the type to just sit back and let the doctor fix everything, because you know he is the doctor. bah i think i just generally dislike her i much rather have rory as the companion &gt;&lt; 

and i am an atheist leaning agnostic so i dont think one has to be religious or non religious to catch on some religion topics in the show. i just don't see the doctor as jesus, even if he gets to be reborn. i see him more of a man without a home that carries a lot of pain, and feels he must atone for his sins. and that makes his story tragic.

true,strolls,null,null,"Whilst I can't say I've read studies on this, I'm inclined to the view that gambling is a form of escapism, at least to many of the poor.

I've known fairly well-off, successful people who will say that they'll spend only £25 at a casino (this was over a decade ago now, so maybe £50 allowing for inflation) and regard it as a fair price for an evening's entertainment. That's quite a different matter. 

Even whilst they know, academically and ""in theory"", that the odds are against them, I still think poor people see gambling as the only way they can possibly get rich.

""Yes, I know I won't win, but what if I do"" - they're never going to have £1,000,000 by any other means, so they might as well buy a lottery ticket. The dream of what they might do with the winnings becomes a dream to tide them over until they can next afford a lottery ticket.

A Tory MP interviewed in this article talks of the merits of his constituents who ""work hard"" for their living. That's all very well if you live in the nicer parts of Hampshire or Surrey, but if you're born in some of our shittier council housing estates then the best that ""working hard"" can get you is a minimum wage job in Tescos. I don't see how that's a satisfying achievement. 

If you're born the son of an MP or if your dad is a CEO (or even if he has his own modest business) then you have the positive role models to show you that you can do literally anything you like with your life. In fact this probably applies to most of us on this site - most of our parents probably had at least reasonably satisfying jobs, and by working they were able to achieve a decent home and afford to go on holiday, enjoy hobbies and buy decent presents for the kids at Christmas. 

You simply can't say that about those born on our nation's council estates - many of them see no means of escape, and statistically they're right. The majority of them will die in the same poverty to which they were born. ",0,1357442942,null,0,false,0,c7rtanl,t3_15zzev,t1_c7rtanl,t1_c7rfd4t,null,1430869587,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"microbreweries don't equal pubs. The beer duty escalator and business rate increases for establishments selling alcohol savaged freeholds, as did the increased corporatisation of pub leases. I worked in 2 pubs, both of which closed before 2010.

Nobody has put an exact figure on how many pubs closed under Labour from 97 until 2010, but in the last 2 years of Labour government alone they were closing at the rate of well over 2,000 a year. Even prior to that they were closing at a not unsteady rate.

There were factors such as the recession (obviously), and that's a tangent there's no value in following. But government policy was what made the pips squeak, including introducing the beer escalator as the recession hit. Large brewers were putting pressure on their leaseholders because government taxation on beer collected 50 times more revenue per pint than they did. Profits of only 0.7p were being made on each pint. Also pressure from supermarkets meant that government tax on alcohol bought from shops for home consumption is half what it is in pubs, meaning they couldn't compete. So pubs were competing not only with shrinking demand due to the economy, but a handicap on tax. Large chains like Wetherspoons and Nicholsons also realised the only way to get customers in and spending money on high-value, wide-margin opportunities (food mainly) was by operating as a loss-leader- selling beer at a loss, taking the tax hit, to maximise footfall and spending.

What's amazing is that the SIBA report has been used to support Labour regarding the closure of pubs. Did nobody read pages 4-20?

But seriously our strikers job is to put the ball in the back of the net, we've already got a team full of player who can create chances. I'll take  a striker who takes 15 shots a game to convert 2 over someone who only seems to shoot as a last resort.

In all honesty I never wanted Adebayor, (and said so during the last window) he's not a dependable goal scorer, and certainly doesn't have the reputation of being a dependable teammate.

Rule out all financial compensation because of an accident unless the victim has opted to take out a second private policy of their own free will.  Call it health insurance.  If somebody else gets whiplash, there's the NHS.  If they need time off work, there's the GP and sick slip and protected worker rights.  No more cash payouts.  

No more lawyers if they're all on the same 3rd party scheme.  The person to blame is simply identified and the relevant payout made.

Remove the uninsured and the US ambulance-chasing, litigious culture that's crept in.

What I would say is, if you're going down the kitcar route, ask yourself if you're practical enough to take a passing interest in maintenance and tinkering, because unless you go to a car that's been built by a top garage you will spend x amount of your time with your head either under the bonnet or under the kitcar.  They're synonymous.  Good, but synonymous.  If you like playing with cars, tinkering, and getting some oil under your nails, then you'll love it - but they're not something you want to get into with your eyes shut.

If you're 18 and a student then my tip, and this is the depths of uncool and possibly the furthest you can get from a passion-wagon, is become a Man With A Van.  

There is always part time work and one day hire jobs for a man that comes with his own van.  And you'll be able to charge far more for a day's work as a driver, a lifter, a courier, a mover, and general chuckerinner/bloke-for-hire, than you would earn say after a weekend of pub work.  Put yourself out there as a part time business because they're cheap enough to run, and cheap to insure.  People hire vans all the time to ferry something about and when moving flats and the like, and then they have to pay for insurance, drive, load, and unload, everything themselves too.   Even if you only do it on a casual basis the van should be able to pay for itself and the running costs.

Like I said, not sexy wheels and you'll score no points picking a date up unless you paint it like the Mystery Machine, but if it's just about transport and money, a spare bit of cash/van work might come in handy.

Rose was there for a few minutes (seriously, about five). Mickey was trapped down there all afternoon (it's around morning when he's abducted and is ""late night"" when he's rescued). During that time he was handcuffed (handcuffs hurt, by the way) in a scary basement while a hellish scary alien vat of magmatic plastic frothed at his feet.

I'm not saying one had it worse, but it's pretty clear by Mickey's reaction that the experience was *very* traumatic for him. And that's really the point. A IED could go off on two soldiers and while one may walk away relatively unharmed mentally, that does not diminish or invalidate the PTSD of the other.

Yeah, as I said she left to go see her dead dad. When it was all of space she didn't really have much motive to leave, but when it came down to time travel it was irresistible for her (not that I blame her, but the motive was self-serving).

&gt; And it wasn't like she planned to use the time travel to visit her dad (she and 9 had this discussion/shout match in Father's Day).

The Unquiet Dead kind of implies that she at least had it in her mind. It was something she wanted to do, and made time travel important to her. She may have denied it to the Doctor (and hey, I can even believe that it wasn't her sole motive) but it clearly played a big role in her choice to go with him.

Additionally, she was given no ""I can bring you back from the moment you left"" assurance that Amy got, so she had no guarantee that leaving with the Doctor would ever result in her returning home.

But once again I'm (lightly) playing devil's advocate. I don't think Rose is heartless, but she's definitely made some less-than-saintly choices in her tenure, particularly early on.",0,1357459276,null,0,false,0,c7rxe1v,t3_161tit,t1_c7rxe1v,t1_c7rxa8b,null,1430872392,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Yeah, I can see someone in control initiating the hymn as an automated process for broadcast to help control the people trapped underground, but it's still a Christian hymn. I don't think the cross refers to anything in government.

&gt;i dont think its a religious faith more of a parental one

Oh, definitely, but my point is that Moffat cast faith in a negative light, even if Amy's faith is non-religious. I think the 'complex' in 'The God Complex' title refers to both the physical complex (the hotel) and a mental condition. 

The mental condition is the victims being trapped by their belief in gods. 

And more cynically, the physical complex is a god complex because the beast represents each victim's god. Again, I'm letting my atheism paint my interpretation. I view most of the gods worshiped throughout history, including today, to be heavily evil, heavily immoral by contemporary standards, which is why I can see the beast as a god figure rather than a devil figure.

As a percentage of GDP why would a small country need to spend less than a large country? Surely you still need the same number of tanks/planes/army per population as any other country?

If anything, small purchases means more expensive in military affairs as a small market cannot support a home-grown defence industry and ends up reliant on imports.

I suspect Scotland would have a smaller army due to the SNP's current political position about it - but that is a political decision, not one based on the principle that smaller countries can spend less as a percentage of GDP on a military.

true,AtomicBreweries,null,null,"A few comments in no particular order.

(1) Pack as light as possible, clothes, soap, toothbrush, (cheap) camera, raincoat. Don't bring a computer, it's useful for looking things up but a real liability when hosteling. A pair of walking shoes and some flips flops or something. You will undoubtedly acquire a large plastic bag full of assorted food and shampoo and stuff when you get here, but there is very little sense in flying with it.

(2) fish and chip shops can be highly variable, especially in London. As a general rule if it does kebabs it may be best avoided.

(3) The Peak District is worth a visit if you can fit it in. 

(4) Advance tickets on the trains can be very good value if you get them like 3 months in advance. By the same token they are very expensive on the day. You normally have no recourse but to buy an (expensive) full fare if you miss an advance ticket.

(5) Warwick castle is really good.

(6) If you want to do a longer distance trip such as London-&gt;Glasgow flying with easyjet or something might be more economical and a little faster (although that's debatable and the train is prettier)

(7) If you fly into heathrow take the tube into London, not the heathrow express.

(8) If you plan to spend more than a day or so in London you can get an Oyster card  for £5. This will probably save you money over the day travelcards unless you use them a lot...

(9) Planning things is good. While it may be appealing to have a spontaneous trip often these end with you lying in bed for half the morning and then doing some half baked activity in the afternoon because you didn't look up what was good. Have one 'must do' activity for the day and a few secondary ones if you have time.

* Castle = Google Windsor, Edinburgh or Warwick Castles. Check out the National Trust and independently run Stately Homes. 
* Pub = No need to worry about this. At least one in every village. Be careful as some are rough. You should Google CAMRA to find those with Real ale and food. 
* Lake District = Stay in Cockermouth or Keswick, go for a walk &amp; climb Scafell Pike.
* Platform 3/4 = It's there but it's not really a landmark, you'll see it when you're commuting. Stick with Harry Potter Studios.
* Fish &amp; Chips = Like pubs these are everywhere but get them when you're at the seaside. Some are ropey. 
* Budget = should be okay. London will be the most expensive but it'll get cheaper further up North.
* Timeframe = totally doable with a bit of planning.
* Accommodation = get a Lonely Planet 'On a Shoestring' guide or check out hostel bookers. 
* Transport = Go with the BritPass. National Rail is a mess. Lots of different operators and fares are more expensive when you buy them at the station. Check out thetrainline.co.uk for booking in advance and saving money (just make sure you get the exact time train). But personally I'd recommend hiring a car as it'll some of those villages are well out of the way. 
* Food = You need to get an Indian. These are amazing. Chicken Tikka Masala is a must. Check out Brick Lane.   
* Luggage = Pack extremely light. You can always pick up stuff cheap at Primark etc.

Add experienced drivers (parents, etc) on as additional drivers. They never actually have to drive the car but it can decrease the costs significantly

Play around with your job title. Often it doesn't have an exact match so you're told to pick the closest, but sometimes you can make savings by picking something different (as long as it's not totally dissimilar to what you actually do). A quote I was doing a couple of years ago had a saving of over £200 for switching between 'cafe worker' to 'waitress' (or visa versa)

Make sure to look at different types of cover. Fully comp can actually be cheaper than 3rd party only for some reason

Winston Churchill recognised this over 80 years ago, which is why roads are now funded from general taxation.  Oh and BTW, motorists pay less into the pot than they receive.

* A 50L backpack is getting quite big, if you are willing to travel light, a 30L will do easily and is much easier to carry around.
* Don't forget to bring a US-UK plug adaptor for any electronics.


Here is my suggestion for an kind of intinerary of the North:

* **York** is highly recommended if you are interested in history. After sightseeing there, you can make it to the Yorkshire Dales National Park where you could, for example, spend a day doing a trail up one of the peaks or exploring some villages.
* York can be reached in approx 2. hours by train from London.
* From York make your way to **Whitby** or **Scarborough** by bus, preferably. Whitby in particular is famed for it's **Fish and Chips**. Both are seaside towns: if you can't see the sea, you shouldn't be eating fish and chips. (I see someone else has also recommended this). Whitby: quaint, cobbled streets. You would love it.
* From York you can make your way to **Edinburgh** via **Durham**, another cathedral city. Again 2-3 hours by train on the East Coast Mainline.
* **Glasgow** or the rest of Scotland could be done here.
* Best way to the Lake District is probably by train to **Oxenholme** Lake District railway station, on the West Coast Mainline, or via Carlisle from Scotland.
* I like Conniston, Scafell .... too many peaks and villages to choose from. Windermere and Ambleside are complete tourists traps. Avoid (at least for extended periods). Americans love those places, though.
* Go back down South, but not before visiting one of **Manchester** or **Liverpool**.

And if it is not a valid activity - it is even less possible to imagine just some random sysadmin parsing their logged customer's database to sell these addresses. It is just bad risk/profit ratio. 

Hosting companies, on other hand, usually don't have such strict policies and getting several dozens/hundreds of addresses from each account give that rogue sysadmin a much better ratio. Also, these addresses would be ""proven"", and cost more.

true,muoncat,null,null,"I graduated in June and was lucky enough to get a place on a graduate scheme quite recently, so I think I can offer some advice.

First of all, you should apply for jobs **directly** through the company website if possible and not through an agency. I signed up with grb.uk.com and spent a month receiving unsolicited phone calls from them without any results. They wouldn't even tell me who the employer was most of the time, the process was incredibly opaque. First job where I applied directly for the position directly however, I got an interview.

So, research the field you're looking to go into and find out who's who in that field, then look on their websites to see if they run a graduate scheme. Good resources for job postings and general research include Prospects, Milkround, TargetJobs, WikiJob, thejobcrowd, InsideBuzz and Glassdoor. Unfortunately a lot of the schemes I was looking at/applied to closed around Christmas, but it probably varies depending on what you're looking to do. Some companies recruit all year round and there will be opportunities with smaller companies in particular, for those I think websites like www.reed.co.uk and www.gradcracker.com are better.

Remember that given the ridiculous ratios of applicants to places it is a total lottery, even if you do everything right you can still be rejected for arbitrary reasons. Once you get through to the interview stage your chances become a lot more realistic, just google and prepare for competency-based questions (e.g. 'Tell me about a time when you did blah blah blah') and any technical questions to do with the role as well. Make sure you can talk about anything on your CV too.

Based on what I've read online and my own experiences, I think companies in the UK have much more realistic expectations of graduates than companies in the US, so don't be put off by the doom and gloom on sites like reddit. I was applying mostly for jobs in Software Engineering mind you, so experiences may vary.

Finally, **BE AMBITIOUS!** I graduated with a marginal 2:1 and fuck all work experience and thought I was going to be living with my parents on the dole forever, but I managed to get interviews anyway and eventually got a job I never even imagined would be possible. I applied for it anyway though, and that's the most important thing.

Good luck! PM me if you want to ask anything. ",0,1357472616,null,0,1357473354,0,c7rz7en,t3_160tma,t1_c7rz7en,t3_160tma,null,1430873344,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,benchowd,pakistan,پاکستان,"I believe it's mainly because of your mouth and because of the people of Norwich. So blame the people of Norwich, well their ancestors anyway. 

The -wich (or -wic, -wick etc) endings denote a habitated place and while we know that Norwich was originally called Northwich, so we can see where the name of the place comes from. 

Nobody knows for sure where the Ips comes from for Ipswich, but that doesn't really matter. 

So now onto why I think this happens. If you think about the accent of people from Norwich, saying Northwic doesn't quite flow off the tongue (the th and the w together is a pain) like it does in other accents from around the country. So over centuries the people there have (quite naturally) made the word easier for them to pronounce with their accent. The mouth likes things to be easy, so it will cause us to change how we pronounce words, it just takes time. 

At some point in history the amount of people saying ""I'm from Nor-ich"" is going to have influenced the way the rest of us say it too, so everyone was calling it Nor-ich, because who are we to disagree with the people who live there when it comes to how the name of their town is pronounced? 

Ipswich actually sounds and feels natural in the mouth to a lot of people, despite three consonants together. 

-wic, -wich,  -wick etc were important identifiers to types of settlement, so there's no way any scholars from the time were going to remove that and call the place Norich, so the w became silent but continued to be written. 

You have to think that we're talking a LONG time ago and there are so many factors that come into it, mainly the way our mouths like to pronounce words (that comes from our formative years, it's hard to naturally be able to learn to pronounce new sounds or combinations when you are older), the accent of people and time. We are one of the most developed countries in the world however when things like placenames etc were evolving, all of that was happening a very long time ago and there was no way of telling the country 'You must pronounce Norwich as Nor-wich, because that will make us consistent', nobody gave a shit about consistency at the time and I don't blame them. The placenames of our old towns and cities come mainly from the origin of the words themselves and have since been changed over time by regional accents and dialects, the spelling hasn't kept up with that.

true,benchowd,pakistan,پاکستان,"It's down to history and the various influences on our language over the years. 

There's also a third example that can be different too, depending upon how you speak. 

Photograph - some people use a long-a, whereas some use the short-a. That's down to how it sounds in our regional dialects. 
Photographic - everyone uses the short-a.
Photography - here all of the vowels change. 

That's a combination of where the word comes from (it's a compound or two words that come from ancient Greek), how we put stress on the vowels in English and the number of syllables in the word. 

Photograph is a word that came into our language, it's one of a fuckton of words that aren't natural to 'English' and as such when we adapt them to fit into our language, sometimes via others, things become a rather complicated. 

So...

Photo - comes from ancient greek. 

-graph - comes from Ancient greek. 

-graphic - graph comes from Ancient Greek, the -ic ending comes from French, Latin etc. 

-graphy - comes from Ancient Greek for the graph bit, but the -y ending is a French construction. 


All of these change which vowels we put the stress on. 


So we have the same two root words (photo and graph) but because of the different constructions we use, the stress on the syllables changes. If we'd had our own language and developed it ourselves (impossible considering all the invasions etc), we probably would have something more phonetic and consistent.

Personally most of the time the Westminster government doesn't really care for what never mind us Scots, but the Welsh and Northern Irish really want. For example, this retarded UK EU referendum, one sure fire way to get us to vote yes on independence would be to successfully win that EU referendum. Scotland is very pro EU and the UK leaving would force is to vote yes on independence and rejoin the EU (granted there's going to be a couple of years of negotiating involved with that). Sorry i seem to of got a bit sidetracked, anyway England (Westminster) wants that EU referendum, not Scotland, not sure what the Welsh or Northern Irish think about it.

That and Scotland and England are two different countries these days, someone already mentioned Scotland is more left leaning than the rightward England and because England has the population us lefty Scots have to suffer with the Tories when our votes don't count for shit in Westminster.

Here's an interesting spin on this, say Scotland was the main player in the UK, had the population and the power. Meaning a left of centre government would ultimately control rightward leaning England from Holyrood.

First thing to do is figure out what you want your blog to be about. It can be about one specific thing, or a variety. The best tip I can offer is to write about what you're interested, and passionate about.

Personally my blog [[Link, for those interested](http://www.michaeltalbot.info)] typically consists of book and movie reviews, as well as my bike training [Which was supposed to resume Friday, however a cold has put paid to that for a few days.]. I picked those main areas for my focus, as they're the things that interest me - I like reading books, and watching films. So for me it makes sense for my blog to focus on those specific areas.

The term ""Blog"" is a catch-all for a variety of different things. My blog looks more like a website than some, due to the theme I use, and the customisation. But generally speaking a blog - the abbreviated form of ""web blog"" is a web based resource where a person writes a blog.

Platform wise, there are a variety of different choices. Mine uses **Wordpress**, which is considered by some to be difficult to set-up - if you look at mine, it took me about an hour on a lazy afternoon to get it looking the way it does [minus, of course, the content.]. 

Before using Wordpress I was a **tumblr** user, having used that service to blog from the beginning of May 2009. Both services - along with the likes of LiveJournal, Blogspot and others, have their distinct advantages and disadvantages.

As for finding good quality blogs to follow? The best way is to navigate through the tags in each service. So say you're interested in Jack Daniel's? [Strange example, but it's on my mind at the moment.] - you'd search through http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/jack%20daniels to find blogs that interest you.

It's a similar system on Wordpress - navigate through the tags for content you enjoy.

As for following people? Different services use different methods. With tumblr you have a ""Dashboard"" - similar to your Reddit homepage, that contains posts from users you follow. It would resemble this:

http://i.imgur.com/FhM7l.jpg

A lot of blogs don't have ""visible"" RSS feeds, however you can typically follow / subscribe to their content by just dropping the URL into an RSS reader.

true,missyb,null,null,"&gt; And please answer my question of why would Scotland want to secede? I of course understand that the relationship between people from England and Scotland can sometimes be 'turbulent' but putting the past aside, I think Scotland seceding wouldn't be a very good idea.

Okay, I'll answer this question from the viewpoint of someone who is half Scottish. My mum is from the Highlands, and it's a very different culture to the rest of the UK. Her identity as a 'highlander' is very important to her, and she really drilled it into me growing up that I was half highlander. It's not even really Scottish so much as it is being from the Highlands; she thinks people from the Lowlands aren't 'properly' Scottish. If you think of Scottish stereotypes, all the old things eg. pipes, tartan, the clan system, were dominant in the Highlands. Things like deep-fried marsbars have literally nothing to do with that culture. Her family were still Gaelic speakers, my mum grew up hearing Gaelic spoken in the house although she can only speak it poorly. They were just totally isolated from the rest of the world, in a mountainous area where there is basically no ethnic or cultural diversity, except which clan you're from. 

You say 'putting the past aside.' Okay, but they *cannot* put the past aside. They're living with the results of an attempted cultural genocide. Their entire culture was deliberately targeted for destruction, they were seen as sub-human animals who needed to be cultured, even their frigging clothes were outlawed. The clan system was poisoned and weakened to the point where the people who *should* have been looking out for them decided to sell them out. Read about the Highland Clearances. People were turfed out of their homes, literally left standing there with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. If they didn't leave, they would burn to death. They could get a ride to another country or they tried to eke out an existence on the shoreline, trying to see what was edible. And this is NOT just the past. The effects of this are still seen today: the population of the highlands is comparatively tiny, because so many of the inhabitants were driven away. Most of the land doesn't belong to the people that live there, it belongs to rich English people and the locals can either 'hire' the land and work on it until they get too sick and then kicked off (what happened to my grandparents), or they can move somewhere else. Young people can't get jobs because there's no sustainable industries and they can't buy houses because English people pay stupid amounts of money for them as second homes. Obviously this fuels resentment. When you're driving around the Highlands and you see one little tiny cottage broken down and no life around anywhere, you think 'oh how picturesque.' But that's actually the reminder of the Clearances and how the people were driven off the land and the ones that remain stay in these little tumbledown cottages, unable to afford proper heating, until they give up and sell the land to English people and their kids will have to move elsewhere.

This is my attempt to answer one of your questions. I think that asking a Scottish person 'why would anyone want to secede? without mentioning the past' is like asking an Irish person 'so why do you people have such a grudge? without mentioning the past!' There are very real economic and social problems that exist *now* that result from the extremely inhumane things that happened in the past. People don't just forget that when they're still dealing with these problems. That's one reason why a Scottish person might want to secede.",0,1357479595,null,0,false,0,c7rzygv,t3_161rhb,t1_c7rzygv,t3_161rhb,null,1430873676,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This course is taken after Undergraduate study and will generally involve placements in high school.

You can read more about it here: http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/education/postgraduate/pgde/secondary

I don't know if History is a subject that is currently ""in demand"" or not, but another good resource is the online forums of the Times Educational Suppliment: http://www.tes.co.uk/forums.aspx

He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's always her.

Oh, yes, and:

And now they've taken a child. The child of your best friends. And they're going to turn her into a weapon, just to bring you down. And all this, my love... in fear of you.

Can anyone help convince me that he is the kind of striker who could hit the ground running in the EPL? He's young, so that is a plus, but I'm concerned we are going to struggle without a solid goalscorer upfront. 

Defoe appears to have entered his annual drought, sadly, and Ade is struggling so badly to find form it might do him good to go to the ACN. By the end of the window, if we don't find a striker as cover for Defoe the following months might be disappointing. It's lucky we have a couple of goal scoring midfielders, but is that enough?

Where I live at least they've only touched the towns and cities and even there the coverage is not amazing.

Their network is extremely flaky - two very major national outages in the space of a few months last year, plus loads of smaller ones. Giffgaff itself appears to keep having problems relating to adding topups/bundles, services going down and so on. No other network seems to be so bad.

When I have problems that I cannot solve myself I'd rather speak to someone rather than go on a forum full of people peddling their SIM cards (for which they get money) and basically posting ""contact an agent"" rather than answering the question.

If you don't need unlimited data then you can do better for a similar price, unfortunately people are drawn in to the hype.

There are 52 weeks in a year.

Take 2 weeks off for Christmas / New Year special programming.

Take 2 weeks off for Easter seasonal programming (such as the upcoming Jonathan Creek).

You're left with 48 weeks. Which means that for each available timeslot, you commission 8 6-part shows per year.

This is a nice number. Why not 12? 18? The answer lies not with the BBC or the licence fee, but with ITV in the 60s, 70s and 80s.

The norm in the 60s was for 30 episodes plus per series on BBC - Series 1 of Doctor Who was something like 44 episodes or something. Lew Grade at ATV was making TV for his ITV franchise with an eye to the US market - Thunderbirds, The Prisoner, The Saint etc.

What happens is that ITV (consisting of seperate companies) was locked in a battle with the BBC, but also each individual ITV licencee was competing with each other for network broadcast. In order to be able to react quickly, they reduced the number of episodes.

Not to mention that US shows are written by a large team of writers (20-30). Often a UK show is written by just one person (or a writing duo).",0,1357486103,null,0,false,0,c7s0z16,t3_15xwu2,t1_c7s0z16,t3_15xwu2,null,1430874199,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

However, after re-watching the first two seasons I realized that the reason why I liked Rose so much was probably because she was the first companion, and she was a good match with 8. 

Especially in episodes like The Impossible Planet, she just seems dopey and kinda... well, dumb at times. It annoys me, but then again this doesn't happen in every episode so I shouldn't say she's always this way. She has her moments of cleverness and courage and I love them as much as the next fan. It's just those small things, you know?

I didn't like her character progression as much as the Ponds or Donna Noble, but it was a good introduction to the series. As sad as I was seeing her go, I felt like her run was indeed over.

I'm a life-long Who fan. I have watched the entire run multiple times, even the reconstructed eps that are, for me, difficult to get through. Out of 11 incarnations Smith is my least favorite. It might have to do with his age—he is by far the youngest, perhaps I just like my men all grown up, or it might be the writing staff trying to be clever. They do a good job, mostly, when it works it's fantastic, but when it fails, it fails hard.  

Speaking of cleverness, I especially dislike the baby talk. Tenet pulled off wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey thing but, that was because he was actively searching for an explanation. Smith hasn't been so great at it, and in TDTM I wanted to curl into a ball at *explody-wody* grrr, that grates my nerves, and I might be misremembering this, I think he also said *kissy-wissy*? That makes me wanna go ahead and end it.  

I hope the next Doctor, or 11 if he sticks around for a while, has a few more years on him and a more nuanced approach.

I hope I didn't offend too many 11 fans. I've been keeping this to myself because I know there's a bunch of you out there. I like him well enough, but I think the show runners are trying to appeal to a younger hipper audience.

False in my experience. My brother was given ridiculous prices like this when he was still learning. When he had passed, the prices dropped to around half that with shopping around. He passed his test 2 years ago, so it should still be a recent thing.


Don't bother just using price comparison sites though, they'll always be more than if you go direct. Good for getting a general idea though. Always check all three insurance options as well. I've had mates get lucky and find insurance was cheaper fully comp than 3rd party fire &amp; theft. 

Also, my Dad was always a named second driver on my insurance, helped bring the rates down a little as well as making sure I was building my no-claims bonus straight away. Although got a bit extra off as my for some reason my Dad was originally listed as my spouse on the insurance forms. Got it changed, but it kept the lower rate. Saved a couple of hundred quid with that mistake.

As for slightly illegal ways, if you live in another town for uni, check the insurance prices for both the uni town and your home town. It could be cheaper to have your car insured at your home address. I did it and the only problem arose when my car was knicked and burnt out. Didn't bother with a claim, just informed the company the car was taken. They still tried to jack up my rates when I tried insuring with them again with a new car (just another 1.2 Corsa, but a year younger).

They were shot on SD video as HD only came in at Planet of the Dead. We here shoot/edit/broadcast our SD in a slightly higher res than you Americans do (ie. 576 rather than 480)...so it makes it plausible to upscale it to 720 to provide a better resolution that you guys can play but it doesn't make it worth going through the effort and investment doing. The change vs the cost would be minimal. The Next Doctor was only upscaled to fit in with the rest of the 2009 Specials.

My advice? If quality concerns you that much, hop onto eBay UK (or Amazon if they're still selling these) and get the Vanilla UK releases. They're the best quality out there. Modern day DVD plays and computers should be multi-region by now.

I'm 22, four years passed, my insurance would be around £3k if I drove my own car, but I use one in my holidays which my mum drives so it's £900. This is fine to insure it this way if you live with your parents and don't take your car away to university or whatever.

It's because of the EU, as someone else explained, and males can't be charged more, despite us getting in a lot more accidents:

* 20% of drivers crash within their first year
* 33% of male drivers crash within two years of passing (aged 17-20)
* An 18-year-old is three times more likely to crash than a 48 year old.
* In the UK only one in eight driver licence holders is aged 25 or under, yet one in three drivers who die is under 25. 

This is why it costs so much money, and it's fair enough. They aren't to know who's a safe driver on an individual basis, so they should be allowed to break it into as many sub-categories as possible, but Bruxelles  decided otherwise.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"The PM has, and when people express how they'd like the UK to be in the EU and taking a positive role in its direction: *this is it!*

This *is* the positive direction as they see it,  

The EU can't go strong arming whole countries into irreversible steps in response to a current crisis caused by being on the end of a long line of previously irreversible and rash steps.  Like forcing ascension states into the single currency, or worse, cutting corners to let others join (and that's not just Greece but Italy) or turning a blind eye when existing holders don't stay within the ERM2 parameters (France &amp; Germany, with admittedly the UK's consent).  Or selectively allowing obligated states not to join the currency (Sweden - seriously don't blame them, I even commend them for standing their ground) and then not allowing other obligated states the same choice even though it's not in their interest (Poland is still committed but keeps having to find reasons, understandably, not to).  Like rewriting the Constitution after it fails a referendum into a treaty, which effectively says and intends to provide the *exact same thing* but avoids all but one referendum in one member state - and when that referendum goes badly forcing them to have it again (Republic of Ireland).  Like expanding far too quickly.  Like not at least signing off on accounts before asking for more (one of UKIPs prominent MEPs, Marta Andreasen, is a Spanish former head accountant for the EU who was fired after turning whistleblower on being unable to sign off EC accounts, and after going up the chain of command reporting the same concerns, citing she could only verify 5% of EC accounts in 2001 - and the accounts have not been signed off since).

The positive direction is to realise that multiple tiers already exist on a number of levels, from North to South, from West to East, from fiscal to economical, from a range of broadly different goals and economies, and to cater for it.  Not with a rigid iron metre-stick, but with tailored flexibility.

People need to stop pretending that what the UK is doing is all anti-EU.  The PM and the coalition, certainly the cabinet, is not anti-EU, but continuously treating it in such binary terms is certainly driving the UK public that way.  This is the reform they, the government, consider as needed - and let's not forget even the opposition government that signed Lisbon recently attacked and voted against them for not being harsh enough!  

People need to stop pretending that renegotiation of terms means having to choose between existing options and the status quo.

They also have to realise that whilst this might be the majority position in the UK, it's also a significant minority across Europe, and a significant minority across a population of 500 million is still millions of people who you're effectively disenfranchising,  pulling their countries and potentially their national identities/soveriegnty from under them, with talk about federalisation and then trying to avoid or even overturn referendums.  That the UK in speaking out in such a way is actually representing quite a significant minority in Europe that otherwise might have their voices drowned out, and the over-riding response to this is not to listen but seems to say, 'our way or out!'   There is a history of what sowing such fields, ignoring what could quickly become a large and destabilising unrepresented minority, leads to; it's called  Balkanisation: political extremism, regional hostility and fracture, potentially, ultimately, historically, even ethnic cleansing.    

They can't sulk and try to retract previously agreed opt outs and vetoes when member states, having already secured these rights, then go on to practice them. At *least* not without offering something quantifiable and additional in return.

The argument of reducing the current negotiations into either an in-or-out is entirely disingenuous.

...and please, people, stop making out that trade is in jeopardy whichever way things go.  Nobody is going to willingly pull business or deprive trade agreements, shooting everybody in the room in the foot, only out of spite or a sense of taking their ball home.  Nobody.

Or making out that the anti-EU vote is harkening back to days of empire.  That's just silly.

Or that an anti-EU or sceptical opinion is by default xenophobic.  That's just weak.

There is no point to a discussion if people in general are dishonest....which means sorting all that out first ^ ^ ^

""Cheers m8"" come on. It's not difficult to type with a keyboard...

Theres a Bittorrent tracker called ""Pirates of the UK"" which is mostly British people. The vast majority of people post like that.

Another thing I've noticed, is that people seem to have an inability to set up things properly. Like britfa.gs IRC has no hostname and no services running..They're not difficult to set up but it seems as soon as a Brit is doing something he finished with ""heh, that'll do""

There used to be quite a large cable/sat hacking scene. There was even a British made Linux distro for the Drambox. It seemed though that the vast majority of people were totally technically illiterate. NTL used to get their services stolen by a lot of people. To combat this they would change the codes used when signing the cards.

The cable hacking forums would blow up everytime this would happen with people wanting hand holding on how to fix it instead of going out learning for themselves..

Definitely agree with you though about how it's much harder to be a team player when you're playing 1 in every 10 games or so.

The 12m was only overpriced by maybe a few million, and that too more because of Sturridge's situation (few unwanted players still command a 10m+ fee) - nothing like the Henderson, Downing &amp; Carroll deals.

I wanna see him combine with Suarez, especially since we're all curious to see how Rodgers uses Suarez when Sturridge is the (nominal) centre-forward

Input from over my shoulder; Canterbury is a gorgeous place to go if you enjoy cobblestone streets and friendly Brits - if you decide to go and need a couch you can have mine or my boyfriends. 

It'll probably surprise you how close-together places in Britain are. Canterbury is only an hour away from Kings Cross St. Pancras, so it's worth a night away, and you should visit the seaside around here too.

re 9) Don't plan to do something every single day. You'll end up burning yourself out. Make sure you have a few quiet days just for meandering and finding surprise things.

re 8) If you have a Britpass, I'm not sure if it's valid on the tube, but using an Oyster card will NEVER cost you more per day than buying a day pass, so it's not a question of 'how much you use the day card'. The Oyster system is designed to always be better than paper tickets.

2. If I remember correctly, Henry's handball came in the injury time of a WC qualifying match, where France had to win to qualify. Back to my OP. We're playing Mansfield, it was the 60th min or so, we were leading.

In the France-Ireland match, it was clearly advantageous for Henry to cheat -- it brought them to the WC Finals. In this case, I think that it would have been more beneficial for Suarez and the team if he had protested to the referee about the wrong call. As brenthathon mentioned, the ref would have given the goal anyway, and Suarez would have gained some much-needed positive PR.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think it's mostly because people aren't all that aware of what FGM actually entails.  I think that a lot of people genuinely believe that it is a similar procedure to male circumcision, with a similar impact on the lives of the victims.  And it's very common that if somebody already has an idea about something, they won't go and look up information to check the accuracy of that idea.  We're all prone to jumping to conclusions and then refusing to change our minds.

And when you take into account how little progress seems to be made on the issue of male circumcision, and the frustration that can cause among its opponents (and I certainly count myself one of them), it's perfectly understandable why those people might not take kindly to FGM being emphasised.  Also people have a general tendency to see things as zero-sum, especially regarding in/out groups.  '*Their* issue is being looked into, so *my* issue is being ignored'.

All in all, it's a very human response.  I think that if more people realised what FGM really was, they (or I think many) wouldn't be so fast to complain every time it took precedence over male circumcision.  Even speaking as somebody who is vehemently opposed to non-medical circumcision in minors, it's clear to me that FGM is a far more serious issue.

--edit--

Just to be clear, I'm not arguing against you at all.  It's just that your comments prodded me in the direction of wanting to make sure that we don't over-react against people who do bring up male circumcision.  They're not necessarily the sexist trolls that SRS would make them out to be.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"It's a terribly pragmatic *long* term solution.  

The short term thinking is in rushing through permanent changes because of an ongoing crisis and ignoring the seeds of resentment you'll be sowing once the crisis has passed but there's now no going back.  

Remember they passed ERM1 and it went disastrously wrong for all of Europe, Britain being the first to fall despite Germany also inflating like crazy at a similar pace, and, when not receiving help, the UK had to drop out of the exchange rate mechanism, costing the UK tens of billions (approx £30bn by the end) that other ERM states had pledged to support which could have prevented the majority of loss before speculators (especially privates like Soros from the US) moved in, in all likeliness  - and this is when there were some very pro EU/EC Conservatives in the cabinet and at the fore.  

Regardless they introduced ERM2 and before everyone knew it a single currency was on the scene.  At that time the EU itself was warned by the UK, which opted out of the currency and said it would not adopt ERM2, that it would not work if a fiscal compact was not already in place, but they went ahead anyway.  Fast forward a decade and now they've finally pushed through a fiscal compact (with two states, one being the UK, legally opting out) at the worst possible time when negotiation and open discussion couldn't prosper.

Similar things have happened outside the currency too.  In 1992 Maastricht was written up and the UK successfully argued for opt outs and vetoes, not only for themselves but for others too, that prevented a runaway carriage of powers going from countries directly to what would be the EU without proper checks and balances.  And by doing it properly and not trying to force issues, from out if it the EEA was able to be created in 1994.  (For my money the establishment of the EEA, and in securing the single market and the 4 freedoms for those even outside the EU as well as in, being the EU's greatest legacy to date.)

So, when they then decided on the next stage of development, the constitution, checks and balances were in place - and it was the *French* that voted it down, as per checks and balances.  Yet the EU went away and wrote the Lisbon Treaty which did virtually everything the failed Constitution wanted, plus ratcheting powers, but because it was a treaty it circumvented the checks and balances that had stopped the constitution from being passed.  A treaty that effectually rode roughshod over all the checks and balances that had been put in place by Maastricht in 1992.  

This time the UK managed to secure opt outs and vetoes for itself and was able to pass a Parliamentary and Referendum Law for itself, to prevent ratcheting of powers and to preserve values which it had been arguing since 1992.  The EU agreed as they had with Maastricht, but now when the UK is trying to protect the same values that it has all along, values which even the French themselves had voted to retain by rejecting the constitution, suddenly it's is being framed that it is the UK's position that has changed and not the EU's.

So when you say the UK isn't playing nice for its international partners, from the UK's perspective they are.  They're issuing the same warning again that if you're scared and having to circumvent referendums, even if it's a general third of the EU population dissatisfied whereas it's approximately a two third majority in the UK, you are setting yourself up for a lot of blowback in the future.

2014 when the voting reform kicks in is when the next big thing will hit.  That's when required unanimous voting becomes majority voting, and whereas the UK has issue on several grounds lots of individual countries have their own individual gripes, but individual gripes you'll now start seeing getting passed regardless - and there is going to be a lot of resentment from a lot of different countries on lots of different grounds.

-------------

*Now, all the UK is proposing is that rather than standing in the way of federalism, those countries that both want and need to go down that route should be allowed to, but those that do not shouldn't have to.  As long as a country continues contributing to the single market, and in the case of the UK a major net contributor in both development and the single market, why should being part of CAP, or CFP, or foreign policy, be mandatory if they don't vote on matters pertaining to it when they arise, nor do they take money away from it?  Or for any country, for that matter.*  

*That such a system doesn't exist already isn't an argument.  The only argument has to be WHY it can't exist.  Perhaps somebody can explain to me why the UK couldn't in the future pull out of the CAP, and not contribute to it, nor take subsidies from it, and no longer vote on it, but still remain in the single market, contributing over the odds to it and more, and retain a vote on Common Market but not Common Agricultural matters?*

I've no doubt that in your head you really are thinking you'd take on anything - but you're giving everyone else too much rope to play with.

You need to provide (at least) your background information (education and work history) as well as current location (roughly), whether you drive, what minimum salary you'd accept (saying you want a job is one thing, but if someone finds you a £5,000 a year job - will you turn up your nose? yes? then what salary are you looking for?)... as well as any other criteria or information that may be relevant to you finding work. 

For example, you may have neglected to mention you have pretty good skills with digital photo editing packages and there might be someone on here who could actually use such a skill. If you don't mind it - that person will probably walk right on by. 

As with VisibleNinja - I don't mean to be patronising here. But you need to provide more information in order to help yourself.

Also AVB will have worked with inside forwards or a different continental style of wingers all his life - it's a different role to traditional Harry Redknapp style right-mids and I'm sure he had some instructions that helped Lennon up his game.

Brave words except that's not how upvotes/downvotes are supposed to work on non-circlejerk subreddits. You should only downvote an opinion if you feel it's trolling/offtopic, not just because you're a nationalist and that other guy's a unionists. 

I don't equate flag protests to loyalism. I'm saying there are too many on this subreddit who do so precisely because they want to tar a people with one big fuck off brush. That quote you used supports this viewpoint rather than contradicts it - note I use quotes because I'm lifting those bits from other redditors language and not my own.

&gt;I also note you haven't attempted to defend the flag protests.

I fail to see the relevance of that statement with what we are discussing.

Undoubtedly you'd find plenty of reports, and they'd probably all be referencing the same single source of info (again testament to the overreaction on here and mainstream media). The fact traders are blaming *every single party on Belfast City Council* over this wasn't reported anywhere near as much though. Doesn't quite fit in with the narrative certain elements want to push.

Anyway, you've missed my point regarding economic issues. Where was the economic uproar when murder returned at the end of October? That made worldwide headlines. That would have an obvious negative impact on the marketability of NI abroad. Didn't see the same redditors on here up in arms about isolated street level violence complain about the damage being done to NI's reputation then?

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; I kind of agree with on your first couple of points but I think it's dangerous blaming the officials for every single thing. Sometimes you want to see a bit of sportsmanship and honesty from players. Just because you are a professional doesn't mean you should somehow be exempt from the basics of what sports is about. I'm sorry but I don't think blaming the officials is the right thing to do in this situation.

It's a respectable sentiment, but in the last few years there's only been one incident of a player going up to a referee and saying ""I handballed that, it wasn't a goal"", and that was Klose; Peter Crouch did it recently and was praised by Tony Pulis for getting away with it, while there's probably been a decent smattering of occasions where teams haven't admitted to handballs in the buildup to goals. **So all I'm saying is, if in every other occasion the focus is on the referees, rightly or wrongly, why is Suarez's case being treated differently?**

As for 'blaming the officials', I have sympathy for them because they're in a tough spot - there's video evidence available to all and sundry *except* them. **Also, I don't think they can even overturn goals once awarded if a player comes up and says ""that was a handball by me, oops"" (I'm not fully clear on what happened in the Klose situation).** They have to make an irreversible and significant decision in a small amount of time. If you don't want technology in the game, fine; have an additional assistant ref for each penalty area, as happened in the Euros; they would've flagged Suarez's handball, we'd be free of a controversy.

I guess it's a case of blaming the current state of refereeing rather than the officials specifically - having said that, in this case I still think the linesman/ref were pretty poor throughout today.",0,1357498644,null,0,false,0,c7s45z1,t3_162hch,t1_c7s45z1,t1_c7s3vhs,null,1430875701,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I take massive issue with this though. Have you watched 90s game shows lately? They're amazing. Supermarket motherfucking Sweep will blow your mind. And I watched Big Break last night.

I have no problem with this if they expressed similarly reasonable views when presented with other, non-'protestant' sources of inanity. It's not like there's a shortage of it about from whatever side of the fence. But that is simply not happening. So we get the subreddit frontpage filling up with the latest non-story/witticism about a riot up a street while when something else bad happens (murder, murder attempts, playpark murderers) it gets either minimal treatment (one submission, unionist-tinged comments downvoted out of view over time) or none at all (eg officer found bomb under his family's car).

To make it clear, I'm not asking for this to turn into a submission war. I simply want redditors to respect how a neutral sub is meant to function and when posting on say the trouble in a part of east Belfast, keep it to a single submission and post all the shit on 'red faced loyalists' or whatever else in there.

but the minimum wage exists to explicitly dictate the exact minimum that people *are* worth. If people were worth £20,000 a year and the minimum wage became £20,000 per year, would you be saying exactly the same thing? 

&gt; people should not fit jobs, jobs should fit people (if at all).

Yes, which is what proper jobs are. Menial jobs are the sort of jobs that people do when they have no skills, when the value they provide is the value everyone has: their able bodied person. If you don't want to be working a menial job then you acquire skills... the fact that you can get paid £14,000 per year just because you were born of sound mind and body sounds pretty fucking great to me.

I have a very good job that I choose to do, I am not at the mercy of my employer and they offer a fantastic salary and fantastic benefits to me which I chose to take, they don't own me and I could quit if I wanted to. I'm in this position because I have skills, yes in an ideal world every single person would be in the position where they were desired by employers and employment was a 2 sided transaction where both parties got everything they wanted, but if you don't have skills how can you expect that to be the case in the *real world*? 

&gt; What happens, like we have seen recently with the hike in education fees, is that the state decides there aren't enough people to do the menial shit in the economy that no one wants to do, then they go about socially engineering the desired society.

oh please, is that a joke? Unemployment rates are rising aren't they? There are millions of unemployed people that would do menial jobs if they existed, but in many areas in the country there is not an abundance of available menial jobs, is that the governments creation too? Are you genuinely suggesting that there is some sort of co-ordinated effort to reduce the number of smart people? Maybe you're living in a different England to me, but there are many many university graduates that are jobless... which wouldn't be the case in an England where the government was trying to force more people into menial jobs.

But you see, there's a bit of a difference there. Yes, Black's murder was bad for our image. If investors read about it, sure, they'd be concerned, but you could easily explain to them that this is a very rare occurrence, an act of terrorism, and that the province has really moved on and safe. 

But these protests and riots are an entirely different beast. They're blocking roads, damaging property and threatening police and even civilians. And this is happening *every week now for two whole months*, with little to show of it dying down. Not to mention the reasoning behind the protests/riots is completely retarded. If you tried explaining what has happening right now to an investor, they would just look at you with a blank face. When the police officer was murdered, people of Northern Ireland didn't think ""Well, I'm not going to Belfast or XYZ, it's clearly not safe there"".

It tells us Rory is practically her opposite, wants a quiet life, wants kids, enjoys himself as long as he's with Amy and as such is willing to follow her to the ends of the earth and do whatever it takes to be with her (Setting us up for Rory waiting for her for 2000 YEARS OUTSIDE OF A GIANT BOX!) and it shows us the deep fear, self loathing and anger that the Doctor has suppressed deep in his mind (Something that was established in old who but not so much in new who before this episode).

American culture just doesnt gel with me - its never nitty gritty that you can relate to.

You could argue that Americans are lapping up Brit culture - a better more nuanced view would be the ideas were good and they could work in that country. Plus hollywood remakes everything regardless of what culture. How many japanese movies have they ruined by remaking? If Ireland tomorrow started writing and producing  the same amount of movies hollywood pumped out to the same standard we would all be lapping up irish culture?- or enjoying high quality production movies in a language we understand.

But i have a feeling the reason some brits are funny around americans because when portrayed in their media and movies we're always the silly little people who all live in Castles.

People are worth more than wages. Is that better?

&gt; I'm in this position because I have skills, yes in an ideal world every single person would be in the position where they were desired by employers and employment was a 2 sided transaction where both parties got everything they wanted, but if you don't have skills how can you expect that to be the case in the real world?

This is an ideal that doesn't scale and is exclusive to about 10% of society. Why is it that employers are the ones that are allowed to dictate the bulk of social relationships? Why do we have to insist on this two tier model? In the real world people are actively denied skills. There are only so many graduate placements that lead to interesting places. The medical profession and dentistry are prime examples—places are limited to ensure that the job market never gets saturated and leads to a dilution of leverage. That's definitely the case in America, but probably the case for the UK as well.

&gt; There are millions of unemployed people that would do menial jobs if they existed, but in many areas in the country there is not an abundance of available menial jobs, is that the governments creation too?

Employers like high unemployment because it suppresses employee costs.

&gt; Are you genuinely suggesting that there is some sort of co-ordinated effort to reduce the number of smart people?

Yes and no. It's more like JEEP: just enough education to perform. If you haven't noticed the economic shocks have lead people into taking 2.70 p/h jobs that go nowhere. Meanwhile corporate profits and the super rich are greater than ever.

&gt; Maybe you're living in a different England to me, but there are many many university graduates that are jobless... which wouldn't be the case in an England where the government was trying to force more people into menial jobs.

The system got the graduates to saddle them selves with debt for a career path that was never going to exist, and yes after the tuition fee hike (and don't forget the EMA got scrapped) fewer people have gone into further education. The system is so fucked graduates are grateful for the job stacking shelves at Tescos. Yes, workfare is a government scheme, they know exactly what is happening.

&gt; but to me it sounds like you're ever so slightly crazy.

Maybe I'm the wrong person to be discussing this then, because I have 3 GCSEs and have completed no further education than high school (which I didn't really complete properly...) and I have many skills (that afford me the ability to be in the top few percent of earners)

&gt; fewer people have gone into further education.

This is just the system correcting itself. The problem is (in my experience of going to a school where about 50% of my class mates went on to uni and only about 10% are doing things that have a job at the end of it) so many people just thought ""oh I have to go to university because that's how I get a good job"" and have gone for pointless degrees (like travel and tourism, what sort of degree is that?) and now there are many people graduating with degrees in totally worthless things.

The problem with the system is the opposite of what you suggest: too many people went on to do degrees in totally pointless things... yes as many people should go to university as possible, but for degrees that have jobs available at the end of it...

The problem with season 6 was it just had some of the worst episodes I've ever seen of doctor who, the curse of the black spot was tedious, silly, badly written, had a stupid pay off and an even stupider solution, and Closing Time was an insulting excuse of an adventure, Craig deserved better damnit! Equally the solution to the season long problem was a massive cop out, and the entire other universe where all history happened at once thing was maybe worth a chuckle but was ultimately irrelevant to the actual story and just an excuse to reuse a bunch of characters and props from earlier in the series. I kind of liked how the flesh story ended with the doctor using what he'd learnt to find out that Amy was a clone but the story itself was such a muddle of messages and poor characters that that ending is the only thing worth remembering about it, as well as the murdering policeman from Psychoville dying at the end. Ultimately the characters were pretty much entirely un changed by the end of the season, we'd learnt nothing new about them as people (I know we learnt that River is Amy and Rory's daughter and she's in the astronaut suit, but that doesn't tell us anything about her as a person, that just tells us about her terribly convoluted past). That's why I like 5 more, we see the characters grow and develop and they genuinely seem in danger, in season 6 everything seems dandy, except in The Doctor's Wife, The God Complex and The Girl Who Waited, and maybe A Good Man Goes to War.

I once witnessed the Isle of Man ""national team"" (Sunday leaguers to a man) playing Bolton Wanderers in a pre-pre-season warmup and the gulf in class was just ridiculous, even though BW didn't play most of their first team. They played mostly second-string in the first half, and it was 8-0 at half-time. They dropped to their 3rd or 4th string in the second half (11 subs at half-time) and the IoM only conceded two goals that half, giving a respectable 10-0 scoreline. The IoM barely touched the ball throughout the entire game, and the Wanderers players were doing flicks and backheels all over the place and just generally stroking it around. If they were actually trying I think it'd probably have been a goal every 3-4 minutes.

If you look at the number of leagues between the Blue Square Premier and the regional Sunday leagues, it's a hell of a lot more than the number between it and the Prem. My point is that Mansfield players really aren't that shoddy at all tbh, even if they do earn far less and aren't household names, and although expectations are always huge for the premier league sides to destroy these smaller teams, in actual fact giant-killings are just as common as huge scorelines against them, ie. fairly rare. Most prem sides are very happy to win by a one or two goal margin, particularly when they put out a second string team.

Curse of the Black spot is a marmite episode. A lot of people like it, a lot of people don't. 

Apart from that, all episodes were top notch. We got to see how River first met the doctor which reveals that their relationship is not entirely reversed. 

We also got to see that Amy and Rory got to grow up alongside her Daughter, actually Mels is probably a big part of the reason why they ended up together. 

Also, the titles have got absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the episode. All friends episodes start with ""The one where/with"". Repetitiveness is not always a bad thing anyway.

Not intentional, no. It would be foolish to believe ""the system"" doesn't have problems; however I do not believe those problems are the intentional result of any upper-society (rich people, government, monarchy) trying to ""keep the little people down"" nor do I believe anyone has been exploited.

The world works under the idea that we provide each other value, value used for financial gain. If someone has no skills and no ability to utilise value others create, then they will become the ""bottom"" and be compensated as such. If you want to make more / have more control you move up the chain, that isn't the result of exploitation... you can choose to acquire skills and move up the chain. 

&gt; to fund the further oppression by the monarchy and the crown.

I read your comment history and it seems you just have a problem with the monarchy. Yes, the world has problems and yes this country has problems, but the monarchy is so totally meaningless nowadays that for them to be the controllers of the exploitation of the people is quite implausible. The queen has no real power (and any attempts to use the powers she does have wouldn't go down well) and they have no real wealth.

I can assure you the nationwide police vehicle checkpoints are not 'one off events'. You're right, there is a difference in scale here but it's not what you're attempting to say. Targeted checkpoints have been running continuously for over a decade now all over the country. 

That is simply economic disruption on a much larger scale. Yet again I have to ask you, where's the ridiculing of the bone-headed republicans? You can't even admit they're an economic problem!

http://www.stagecoachbus.com/PdfUploads/Timetable_22527_319.pdf

Direct buses from Barnstaple railway station leave at 13:04, 16:33, 16:39 and 17:24. The bus takes just over an hour to reach Clovelly.

For your return journey, there is one bus per day leaving at 07:36  (07:46 on Saturdays).

There is no Sunday bus service.

Most British towns start to close at around 17:00 - 18:00, so unless you've got company you're going to be staring into the bottom of a pint glass for a lot of the evening.

Clovelly's a gorgeous place - but honestly, I wouldn't even contemplate going there without a car. Not worth the hassle. It'd make far more sense for you to take the train as far as Bristol - or even Taunton, for that matter - hire a car (there's an Avis Car Hire just outside the train station in Taunton), drive to somewhere like Barnstaple and explore North Devon that way.

Stuff only gets hidden when it's in negative downvote land.

&gt;This flag debate has been one of the biggest political happenings in the last few years.

Are you insane? Maybe in Father Dougal Maguire land it is.

&gt;People expect to be kept informed of developments which is why 9/10 of the last submissions touch upon this post.

Informed of developments? Oh yeah because being the butt of a Frankie Boyle joke is an unmissable political dynamic. Or the No Surrender woman meme, an insight into the darkest recesses of our peoples...

&gt;Its blatantly obvious you are attempting to defend unionism and loyalism to the death in every thread

Lol. In the same way each thread is attempting to ridicule unionism and loyalism (and protestants) to the death? Oh wait, I forgot, all those posts and topics *on the same issue* are entirely relevant and level-headed.

&gt;because the majority of the posts and those in the news are showing just how childish and absurd this fleg protest has become on a national and international scale, both politically and economically.

And yet there is no equivalent outrage over the childish and absurd events I've pointed out that have also happened over the past 6 months and their economic &amp; political impact. The reason? 'This stuffs more important'. Why? 'Just because'. 

Clear nationalist bias.

&gt;You can attack ""the other side"" by all means, please do.

Irony bypass alert.

&gt;Thats how politics in this shithole of an excuse for a country works

That's some hatred you've got welled up inside. Let it all out.

&gt;is it any wonder they get made fun off?

And here we are again: I guess those adults who consented to naming a kid's play park are obviously a studious collection of amateur poets and noble scholars? Likewise the Lurgan republicans who are still gloriously fighting on in honour of 1916 when no one else gives a fuck? Or the Ardoyne rioter who didn't actually live in Belfast and was only out to fetch a pint of milk your honour? Hmm. Yeah no wonder...

It's possible if there isn't a plurality of operators then the classic line fare will likely increase as it does now and gain the new **NOT HIGH SPEED** routeing with HS2 tickets as **ANY PERMITTED** at higher cost. The off peak fare from Birmingham to London is relatively cheap because of competition from Chiltern and London Midland so I can see Birmingham doing reasonably well out of HS2 and competitive Advance fares available on some of the quieter HS2 services, especially at first to entice people to try it.

For a few years Lennon has been playing below himself, not just under Redknapp but Ramos and maybe even before then. For a long time he wouldn't even make a run behind the defence, he'd get the ball in front of a defender pass it back but not move. The Lennon of old would have turned it into a 1-2 and left the defender in his wake.

I remember what it was like when Lennon was out injured in the early days, people were basically resigned to losing unless he played. While that was a bit extreme, he was such a big threat that it wasn't such an exaggeration. People suggested the same thing when Bale was injured/suspended but I don't think we missed him as much. Part of that is down to how balanced the team is now but it's also the case that we can afford to lose Bale for a bit.

Such a channel wouldn't really be watched by current day kids either. Not all programmes work these days, and those that do (mainly animations) won't ever pull in a huge audience of today's kids. I remember my dad showing me a tape of 'Watch With Mother' programmes... they're as far back from my childhood as Bagpuss is from now. 

Also remember that repeats aren't free... an archive kids channel would have to pay for all the royalties for the programme so it has to make enough back to make that worthwhile.

But, Liverpool had very [hard times in the late 70's and early 80's](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-16355281) and gained a reputation for lawlessness and poverty that lasted far longer than was justified and scousers have carried that reputation with them, also without justification. In the nineteenth century there was a lot of immigration form Ireland to Liverpool, this being a time when the Irish (and Catholics more generally) were viewed with suspicion by many English people and there's some of that too. “Scouse” is shorthand for a certain kind of cheeky, loveable rogue (but maybe with a murky past) sort of character.

Pretty much at the other end of the scale, Etonians are men who were educated at Eton College, an expensive, exclusive and very, very posh school founded by King Henry VI in the fifteenth century and closely associated with the ruling classes every since. [Many Prime Ministers](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8622933.stm) and [other leading politicians](http://blogs.channel4.com/gary-gibbon-on-politics/the-old-etonians-who-still-run-britain/14474) went there. There is a strong suspicion amongst many people in Britain that privileged parents buy a continuation of that privilege for their sons by sending them to Eton to rub shoulders with the sons of aristocracy, wealth, and power. Etonians tend to be rich, charming, well-connected and in the case of King's Scholars very clever.

true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"Hundreds of years ago, pronunciation of words used to change all the time.  And spellings would actually change to reflect the different sounds.  So, if you took the same word 50 years apart, the chances are the common way of spelling it may be different.  There may even be different spellings in different regions based on accent/dialect.  This was largely because texts were all hand-written and there was a limited degree of freedom left to the individual writer to determine how best to record the correct sound of a word (within reason). 

With the advent of the printing press, all this changed.  For the first time, documents could be mass produced which led to a standardisation of spellings for most words because everyone was reading the same published materials.  But the changes in pronunciation *didn't stop* and continued to diversify.  This is why we have words with, for example, ough components like though, trough, thought where the same letters are entirely differently pronounced.  It's the result of the written words being fixed, but the natural progression of the spoken word continuing to evolve.  This, to a degree, explains why two words with seemingly similar spellings have entirely different ways of being pronounced.

There is an altogether different reason in some cases, which is more closely connected to vocal dexterity (e.g. why most people pronounce ""handbag"" as ""hambag"" when speaking quickly -try it and see- because positioning your lips and tongue to produce the adjacent consonant sounds is simply too difficult to easily do at speed) but which may also be relevant in this example.",0,1357519834,null,0,1357520107,0,c7sb5y0,t3_161sig,t1_c7sb5y0,t3_161sig,null,1430879084,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also he has said about financially he doesn't want to have to worry about me and my brothers having to care for him or paying to do so. Which I found quite noble in a way. I know it's odd.  

The only thing that is unfortunate is that we lost our mother at a younger age to cancer and one of my brothers has autism. He's older than me and doesn't like me telling him what to do.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"When you think about it, VDV wouldn't really fit well in our current system with AVB. Don't get me wrong, VDV is one of my favorite players ever and he's immense, but think about it.

* Tottenham's counter attacking play wouldn't suit him, he's not one who bounds up and down the field with the pace of Lennon, Bale, Defoe or even Dempsey or Adebayor. Yes, Dempsey definitely covers more ground than him in a game and is quicker as well, VDV wasn't known for his pace.

* As a playmaker, we need someone who is quick as well, earlier VDV was good because he would thread balls through to Ade and would play a little bit on the edge of the box and take a shot, but we already have Dempsey who is linking up well and doing something similar, even if it's not with the same class.

* He doesn't help out defensively, and damn do we always need midfielders who are willing to help out defensively. Lennon, Bale definitely put in a shift coming back and covering for full backs, Dembele and Sandro are of course always absolutely top, Dempsey checks back to win balls and provide passing support in midfield often and Adebayor is really useful for clearing corners, free kicks and he often tracks back to battle for the ball. Defensively VDV was fairly weak, would be a big problem for us.

* All things said and done, if VDV were to come back to Spurs, he'd probably be another one on the bench who'd come in 70 minutes into the game for some stability and drive if required. Would be a waste for a player like him and I doubt he'd like it.

Thanks for all the times Rafa, you're a star for us, always will be but it's good that he's seeking play time elsewhere, he fits in the Dutch squad and being on the bench for Spurs won't do much to keep him in it.

2. Geoffrey is Donna's dad who.passed away. The doctor borrowed the money for the winning lottery ticket from him since he never carries money of his own.

3. I'm pretty sure the master isn't dead, just time locked on Gallifrey

4. Sarah Jane isn't dead, in fact at that point she had her own spin off show called the Sarah Jane adventures. The doctor knew he was dying and wanted to say goodbye and do one last good thing for the people who meant so much to him.

5. The ood knew the doctor was dying as they had foreseen it in the end of time part 1, I personally think the.ood wanted to be there for the doctor as he had saved them previously. The story ending but the song living on is a reference to the end of this incarnation of the doctor but the doctor carrying on in a new regeneration.

Hope this is some help :)

Better. Had they said ""Between 11 and 10, which is the ***better*** Doctor"" it would be obvious what they meant.

But they said **best**, as in above all else. I don't think that either Eleven nor Ten is best, so I said so. (I personally feel Tennant to have given the superior performance, if I'm to chose which is better).

It's like saying ""What is the best Zelda game, Skyward Sword or Ocarina of Time?"". It's presuming that the title of ""best"" is between those two when there are many other Zelda games to choose from.

I know it's a bit pedantic, but the idea that the feud between Smith and Tennant by the fans is the end-all-be-all for best Doctor is a highly pervasive and equally annoying sentiment that overlooks a great many years-long performances others have dedicated.",0,1357525665,null,0,false,0,c7scxg7,t3_1638xr,t1_c7scxg7,t1_c7scmjr,null,1430879913,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

i still have to say that being an atheist does not make one actively seek out religious undertones in television. i think if you are looking for it you will find it and if not it will escape your attention. my main focus in the show is the torture of the doctor that he himself inflicts on himself and how others around him do not see the pain. a man that can go anywhere in space and time and who is forever alone no matter what he does. and the deification of him by those who have come in contact with him makes the burden of loneliness that much more difficult.

It's not about being brave or cowardly, it's about whether or not you want to face losing your dignity for no reason. She was alive, but she wasn't there anymore. We weren't ""spending time with our loved one"", we were just keeping her vacant body alive for the sake of it. 

She always said that if she ever ended up in a care home, we should ""get the vet to shoot her"", and while her method would be a bit messy, I would have preferred to see her exit as the graceful woman she was, rather than the husk she became.

I think if some guy in the prime of his life swallows a tenners worth of Tesco's own ibuprofen, then that's awful. He's leaving behind responsibilities and a devastated family.

I think Coates &amp; Carragher's lack of pace/mobility discouraged them from pressing - hanging at the edge of the box and defending reactively is far more suited to their games, and as you said, to the styles of Benitez or especially Houllier.

In terms of goals expected, the author predicts that Sturridge will contribute more goals simply because Sturridge has scored x number of goals in y number of games, etc. And that this will be an improvement over Downing, Sterling, Suso, et al. Ok, but that's not a fair comparison as these players have different qualities and therefore their inclusion in the team would not necessarily be to score goals, and to judge them on this alone is short-sighted.

Finally the author mentions Sturridge's lack of tackling and creation of chances as being something to worry about, but then goes on to say that this doesn't matter in light of his ability to score goals. Ok, yes, of course.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I posted elsewhere on this thread, but my grandmother had motor neurons disease and starved (and thirsted) herself to death as the only legal means of euthanasia in the UK. Suicide voids almost all life insurance policies and can cause huge legal ramifications for doctors and family (because my granny had expressed her desire to be euthanised to us, we could then be investigated and possibly charged with assisting suicide). 

The day she was diagnosed, my granny applied to go to Switzerland but by the time the paperwork was done, she wouldn't have been able to swallow the barbiturates. Instead she simply refused to let doctors insert a food tube or drip. This counted as ""not sustaining life"" instead of ending it (much like turning off life support) and that meant it was totally legal and doctors were even legally able to help by making sure she was in as little pain as possible.

That she had to do that was horrible, but she was glad that she was able to do it in a legal manner that didn't put our family or their doctor in harm's way legally. 

If anyone here is making contingency plans, remember that you have to physically be able to pick up the cup and swallow the barbiturates if you go to a country that allows euthanasia - meaning it's not possible if you're fully paralised or have lost fine motor control, or maybe even if you have throat cancer. Same with committing suicide - you have to physically be able to carry out the act, or whoever is helping you could go to jail. I've you're trying to ward against dementia or Alzheimer's, write up a document (maybe with a lawyer or doctor) stating what you no longer count as you (is it when you forget your family's names, 95% of the time? Or is it when you think dead parents/spouses/close family are alive? Think about it), and stating that when it gets to that stage, you want to undergo whatever process is legal at that time to be euthanised or institutionalised.

I am basing my knowledge on English people i have met while living in the UK for most of my life, plus English people I have met overseas in various countries over the last 10 years. I would have thought that would make me as qualified as anyone (perhaps even more so) to comment on how English people think. As much as anyone comments without actually getting in their head of course.

&gt; Another glance at your history tells me you seem to be a Scottish Nationalist who is more worried about England than the future of Scotland... Not sure Salmond would approve of that...

I am a Pro-Independence supporter that's right, but if you read my blog you'd know that I have only been in support of an Independent Scotland for about 3 years, before that I was (and maybe somewhere deep in my heart still am) a Unionist. Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that the UK union doesn't exist, hence the infographic I made. I'm not quite sure why you'd think I am more worried about England, perhaps you can reply and let me know what I wrote that led you to this conclusion...

Thanks for your comment.

Lampard would need to take a massively significant paycut to remain at Chelsea, which he is not willing to do.

I've said this countless times on this board before and it partly about money and partly what each party wants out of the contract.

Frank and Ash both want to be regular starters. Frank even came out recently and said he isn't and can't be a person who sits on the bench. Frank has shown that he's lacking fitness, endurance and the ability to recover from injuries. Most of this isn't applicable to Ash, but will slowly become more relevant in the next couple of years.

Chelsea I'm sure want to keep both players around HOWEVER, they do not see them as regular starters. And in all reality, they shouldn't be. We've got an abundance of youth that deserve a start and are our future. With the FFP in place, we can only afford to pay players based on their worth. Due to both Frank and Ash only having a limited role within the club they're wages need to be in line with their playing time.

There's more to being a leader and a player than just being on the field. Look at Paulo and everything he's done for the club. We can give Frank side money for coaching, but he has to realize, he can't and shouldn't play every game. Giggs and Scholes realize this, it's just a shame he can't.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"Center back is the position that requires the most amount of experience for a player to be effective. There is a reason why the best center backs are all in their late 20s and early 30s, it is much rarer to find a good solid centerback who is early into their career.

Being a good center back is about anticipation and positioning. My favorite anecdote is that of Paolo Maldini, when asked about statistics and the number of tackles he makes said that it is an inaccurate measure of the capabilities of a center back, since if you are having to make a tackle it means you have already made a mistake. Maldini aimed for a single tackle over an entire season (meaning one mistake), he finished his career with an average of 0.5 tackles per season over his last 4 seasons.

Coates needs a hundred or so top-flight games where he starts each game, gets a full 90 minutes and can work on his intelligence. This means playing against all different styles of play, different types of strikers, and working out how to react to different tactics, being pressed, being outpaced, being turned, being muscled off the ball, getting your body between the attacking player and the ball and the goal, etc.

He won't be able to get this at Liverpool as a fourth-choice centerback. We need to send him out on loan, and we should have done it last season if not at the beginning of this season. There were two occasions in yesterdays game where he was easily turned. A typical A-B-C football play: the target man is around 25-30 yards away from goal with his back turned to his goal, he receives a ball at his feet and Coates pushes up against his back. When Skrtel was in this situation against Fletcher in the Sunderland game, he put his arm on Fletcher's shoulder and each time he either fouled (which isn't ideal), or kept him blocked from making the turn. In the Coates case the attacker simply peeled the ball around with the outside of his foot, whereupon Coates took a step backwards, giving the #10 a yard of space in which to turn, go around Coates to find himself in yards of space within which to receive the ball back from the wide player. Meanwhile Coates has twisted, has lost his footing and is struggling to pick himself up again - while the attacker is now 4-5 yards infront of him, at full stride, has the ball at his feet and is only facing 3 Liverpool players while he has 3 of his own players at either side of him and yards of space and options.

Remember what Torres would do to Vidic - same thing, he would purposely back up into Vidic when receiving the ball. He scored 3 goals in this way against Vidic at both Anfield and Old Trafford, it took a couple of seasons for Vidic to adjust to this but watching him now is a complete pleasure - the right positioning, anticipation and rarely stretched out making the last minute diving tackles.

To add to that, Coates not only needs to become a top-form centerback in regards to defending, but also needs to gain confidence on the ball. He is a very long way from having even a fraction of the capability a player such as Piquet or even Agger have with the ball at their feet. Centerbacks in the modern game need to be able to stop, lift their head up and get a measure of the positioning, taking a couple of steps forward and then finding either the first pass to midfield or a penetrating pass forward. Coates is at the stage of just rushing and clearing.

The problem is that a full EPL and Cup campaign requires 5 center backs, usually. We have 4. If Coates goes out on loan we need a centerback with a bit of experience who can step in. I don't think Rodgers has that faith in Coates yet - at least not in the same way he has shown faith in Suso, Sterling, Kelly, Wisdom, Shelvey. There have been moments in this campaign where resting or dropping Agger or Skrtel would have made sense, but we simply didn't have that option available to shuffle each of the centerbacks up a position.

I am mixed on what Rodgers will do with Coates. If he was going to mould him into a future starting centerback that process would have started already either via more starts and more appearances or via a loan out - the same as with Suso, Sterling, Shelvey, etc. I still have a feeling that Rodgers is looking to move him on and will bring in other options. I would probably still give Coates a chance, but just going from the indicators from Rodgers I am leaning towards Rodgers wanting to replace him.

In terms of other options, I thought Chico Flores was having a great season up until his shocker against Arsenal yesterday (it wasn't *that* bad, but bad in the context of the season he was having). I think Stefan Savic will eventually be a great centerback and will eventually find his way back to a big club, but he only just moved to Fiorentina and isn't at the right stage of development (he will only get more expensive as he gets better), his CB partner Rodriguez also look good. Regardless of what happens with Coates, we will need to bring somebody in.

Frank has undoubtedly scored some vital goals. However, watch him play and he gets caught out of position (he's only been used in the double pivot) because he doesn't have the pace to get back and late in the game he is just too buggered to play in a position that requires box to box coverage. I don't know why everyone has a fascination of using goals scored as a indication of how a CDM plays. 

&gt;Can you please source where he has demanded to be on the starting XI? From what I've heard, he's willing to take a 100k pay cut just to stay with the club.

You know those ""100k Pay cuts"" articles pushed out by the news ""sources"" have no quotes whatsoever? Regarding the Lampard situation, they've used ""sources"" who quote his agent where his agent has come out and denied saying anything.

Don't believe anything you read without it coming from a player, their agent, the team or another representative of the player/club.

Also, I'm not too sure where you pulled the word ""demanded"" out of anything I said, but here are the quotes Frank said regarding his playing time.
&gt;""I'm not the kind of player to just see out my time and sit on the bench. I want to be involved,""

Then he randomly met a spunky shop girl who happened to save his life, and he felt kind of obligated to take her somewhere nice as thanks. 

As they journey together, he realizes just how lonely he has been, and grows attached. They end up bonding in a way that he hasn't been able to for a long time. When 9 regenerates and Rose becomes ""the first face [10's] face sees"", as 11 puts it, it just strengthens the bond. In the end, the doctor ends up loving Rose because she was in the right place at the right time. 

Honestly, I think that by the time of Journey's End, the Doctor had developed other support networks and grown out of his Rose phase.

Gervais by comparison is a little bit of an egomaniac.

Given Ade's recent form, I'm not surprised. He was quite bad against Coventry yesterday and if he does go for the ACN then there's no doubt that we definitely need a striker, and besides, we do need one, we just have 2 at the moment really.

Here's what Damiao would bring to the squad:

 * Strengths: Excellent on the ball, full of tricks, very quick and good finisher, makes very good runs. He fits the counter-attacking style of play and would be a 100% through and through Spurs player.

 * Weakness: Can be a ball hog and sometimes tries a trick where you don't need one.

With Defoe already in the side being a ball-hog, I just hope we don't end up with two strikers who hate passing to the other. But then of course, we have AVB. Defoe's started to pass the ball around a lot more now, more than in the first few weeks at least, so it could be pretty great.


On the other hand, we have Moutinho. Box to box midfielder pretty much, someone who can bound up and down, here's what HE would bring to the squad:

* Strengths: Moutinho will for sure bring what Modric used to bring to Spurs, pin point passing, good distribution accurate shots at goal. Him and Dembele together would be beyond fantastic. Two such players together in a squad will provide excellent distribution to all the players in the squad.

* Weaknesses: He's not pacy. He's not strong. He's easily shoved off the ball and in a midfield like the Premier League, he might find it hard. But then again, Modric wasn't Captain America either. Dembele should be able to cover up that part of the game easily. He doesn't have the pace to provide the counter-attacking that Bale and Lennon would be able to with the likes of Defoe, but he would definitely be a fantastic ""release-man"".

With all that in mind, and with the 100% signing of Holtby, I think at the moment we need a player like Damiao in the squad given that Holtby covers up 85% of the avenues of Moutinho. He probably lacks the ability to absolutely open up a defence like Moutinho does (Holtby does too, just not as good as Moutinho) and Holtby's quicker, so I'd pick Damiao.

However, I wouldn't absolutely rule out Damiao coming in January and Moutinho coming in the summer. I really wouldn't. What would I like our squad to look like then? :D This is juicy.

GK: Lloris
CB: Vertonghen
CB: Kaboul
RB: Walker
LB: BAE
LW: Bale
RW: Lennon
CM: Dembele
CM: Moutinho
AM: Holtby
ST: Damiao

While that's juicy, that's unrealistic. Where would all the recent signings of Dempsey, Sigurdsson and Adebayor go? I don't see Moutinho coming in, I think Levy foresaw this, the fee/wages for Moutinho were probably way too high and therefore Holtby was signed. Damiao would be a fantastic signing, but we'll have to go back to 4-5-1 for that, which would mean benchtime for Defoe and Ade. Which would probably mean one of them being let go of, and I think it'll probably be Ade.",0,1357544910,null,0,false,0,c7si8mh,t3_162dsp,t1_c7si8mh,t3_162dsp,null,1430882487,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Also, we have Kelly and Wisdom, who both are able to cover at CB if needed.

Then, spend the money on an experienced backup LB. I wish we never got rid of Riise and Warnock. The two alone would have eliminated the need for any new LB until we got Jose Enrique last season, and JAR could probably fill in as backup now.
