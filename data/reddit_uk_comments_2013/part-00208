true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"""Dear Mr Dacre,
 
My name is Mehdi Hasan and I’m the New Statesman’s senior political editor. My good friend Peter Oborne suggested I drop you a line as I’m very keen to write for the Daily Mail.
 
Although I am on the left of the political spectrum, and disagree with the Mail’s editorial line on a range of issues, I have always admired the paper’s passion, rigour, boldness and, of course, news values. I believe the Mail has a vitally important role to play in the national debate, and I admire your relentless focus on the need for integrity and morality in public life, and your outspoken defence of faith, and Christian culture, in the face of attacks from militant atheists and secularists. I also believe – as does Peter – that I could be a fresh and passionate, not to mention polemical and contrarian, voice on the comment and feature pages of your award-winning newspaper.
 
For the record, I am not a Labour tribalist and am often ultra-critical of the left – especially on social and moral issues, where my fellow leftists and liberals have lost touch with their own traditions and with the great British public. In my column in this week’s issue of the New Statesman, for example, I offered a critique of the five Labour leadership candidates, and their various inadequacies, accusing them all of lacking what George Bush Snr once called “the vision thing”.
 
I could therefore write pieces for the Mail critical of Labour and the left, from “inside” Labour and the left (as the senior political editor at the New Statesman).
 
I am also attracted by the Mail’s social conservatism on issues like marriage, the family, abortion and teenage pregnancies. I’d like to write a piece for the Mailmaking the left-wing case against abortion, or a piece on why marriage should be a Labour value, and not just a Conservative one. My own unabashed social conservatism on such issues derives from my Islamic faith. But as a British Muslim, I have also upset some of my more hardline co-religionists in the past by arguing, in print, for a change in Islam’s draconian apostasy laws to allow Muslims to convert to other faiths (like Christianity). Here is a New Statesman column I wrote on the subject in April.
 
In addition, I wrote a column last year condemning suicide bombings, from an Islamic and moral perspective, in which I also castigated Muslims for failing to unequivocally condemn such acts of terror wherever in the world they occur.
 
And, earlier this year, I wrote a piece for the Guardian belittling Muslim extremist Anjum Choudary and his crude, headline-grabbing attempt to carry “coffins” through Wootton Bassett.
 
A bit of background: I am 31, and was born and brought up in the United Kingdom, the son of Indian immigrants (an engineer and a doctor) who came here in the 1960s. I am an Oxfordgraduate. Prior to joining the New Statesman in June 2009, I spent a decade working in television as a news-and-current-affairs producer at ITN, the BBC, Sky News and Channel 4.
 
I do hope you’ll consider me for future columns and features in the Daily Mail on political, social, moral and/or religious issues. I believe you once told sports columnist Des Kelly that he should “make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry”. That’s something I believe I could do for you, and for your readers, on the pages of the Mail.
 
Thank you very much for your time.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mehdi Hasan

but because of his outspoken support for marxism, not because of his jewishness. 

&gt; I honestly don't think they would have made as much of a fuss if Ed's dad had been a Marxist from an Anglican family with an English name from the Home Counties.

I think they would. the alternative is to say that there would be no way the Mail could legitimately write an article attacking the views of Ralph Miliband without it being anti-semitic. is that what you're saying? 

&gt; And perhaps this is really pushing it, but I also have a suspicion that asking a one Geoffrey Levy to write the article may have been a precautionary measure on Dacre's part.

true,Shrub_Rocketeer,eu,Wales,"&gt;the alternative is to say that there would be no way the Mail could legitimately write an article attacking the views of Ralph Miliband without it being anti-semitic. is that what you're saying?

No.  The thing is though, they weren't just attacking his 'views' (read: uninformed knee-jerk interpretation of his views, possibly made after a cursory glance at his wiki page).  They were presenting him as somehow 'worse' because he was a foreigner, not letting the reader forget that he was an immigrant, and a bloody ungrateful one at that (stopping just short of calling him 'uppity').  There are clearly echoes of anti-semitism here: the Jew as ungrateful, alien, subversive etc.  In the subsequent editorial the *Mail* put out, we also find this passage: 

&gt;We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father’s teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different

My knowledge of the Bible isn't great, but Judaism was often portrayed in Christendom as vengeful, compared Christianity which has a strong emphasis on forgiveness.  It could be a coincidence, but the reference really stuck out for me when I first read the editorial.  Also, Jonathan Freedland talks about it [here.](http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/111995/was-daily-mail-piece-antisemitic)

true,honestchristian,cnty-england,Manchester,"&gt; They were presenting him as somehow 'worse' because he was a foreigner

again I don't understand the distinction. The Mail can hardly not mention the fact he was a foreigner - is it impossible to then attack the views of a foreigner (a jew) without it being anti-semitic? 

&gt; There are clearly echoes of anti-semitism here: the Jew as ungrateful, alien, subversive etc. 

there are only echos if you invent them. you're aligning two things but failing to show any actual connection. again it's the projection of meanings onto the text which are not actually present. 

&gt; My knowledge of the Bible isn't great, but Judaism was often portrayed in Christendom as vengeful, compared Christianity which has a strong emphasis on forgiveness. It could be a coincidence, but the reference really stuck out for me when I first read the editorial. Also, Jonathan Freedland talks about it here.

I agree that choice of quote is strange, but I don't think it's in any way anti-semitic, just a bad choice of analogy. it would be insulting to a practicing Jew (And christian) alike. 

&gt; Dacre has a lot of Jewish friends, then. But that doesn't make someone immune to anti-semitism.

of course not. Just saying you're conspiracy theory that he covered his back by getting a Jew to write it doesn't exactly stand up to scrutiny. He has so many Jewish writers for the Mail (And takes such a strong pro-Israel stance) that claims of anti-semitism would have to be better backed up than 'it kind of seems a bit anti-semitic if you're already a Jew-hater'",0,1380911200,null,0,false,0,ccl2kre,t3_1npsxg,t1_ccl2kre,t1_ccl28dx,null,1429244968,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If they had wanted to make a reasoned critique of his views and evaluation of his influence (or lack thereof) on his son, they did not have to repeatedly refer - directly or indirectly - to the fact that he was an immigrant.  Perhaps the first article was not overtly anti-semitic; at the very least it was certainly quite xenophobic (but that's standard for the *Mail*), but the anti-semitic echoes are impossible to miss if you are aware of the typical anti-semitic tropes I mentioned.  I won't deny that it could just be a coincidence, but reference to Deuteronomy makes me more suspicious. 

&gt; Just saying you're conspiracy theory that he covered his back by getting a Jew to write it doesn't exactly stand up to scrutiny. 

It's not a conspiracy theory, just a suspicion.  The *Mail* under Paul Dacre is a very cynical newspaper, so I wouldn't put it past him.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"The purpose of this scheme isn't to help increase the supply of housing.  Nor is the underlying intent to drive up house prices, although that will certainly be a side-effect.

The real purpose is to increase the supply of ~~cannon-fodder~~ first-time buyers who can ""afford"" to buy houses at the lower end of the market.  There are plenty of people buying houses at the high end of the market (mostly foreign investors buying property in London) and that's pulling house prices up in top-down fashion.  Anyone who already has a property is being pulled up the property ladder.

The problem is that as house prices rise, the cheapest houses eventually get priced out of the budget of first-time buyers.  If there isn't a steady supply of first-time buyers stepping on the bottom rungs of the ladder then those already on the ladder can't climb higher (someone needs to buy the small flat off the people who want to move to a semi, so the people living there can move to a detached house and so on).

Rather than letting house prices deflate to the point where first-time buyers could afford property, the government are using tax-payer's money to guarantee sub-prime mortgages.  I suspect this is because so much of the banks' debt (aka ""wealth"") is based on over-inflated property values. 

This is all fine and dandy until the property investment market collapses.  Unlike people who live in their houses and can't just sell them whenever they like (because they need somewhere to live), foreign investors can dump their properties on the market at the first hint of trouble.  I don't *think* property prices will (or could) fall-off-a-cliff collapse in the way that the stock market does from time to time.  In the end, it takes a lot more time to sell a property (months) than it does to sell stocks and shares (microseconds) so I suspect that it will be a moderating effect.  But it could certainly be very bad.

In the end nothing will change.  Boom and bust.  We'll probably be having the same conversation 20 years from now.

Disclaimer: I am not an expert and I can't predict the future.  Don't buy or sell a house based on what some random bloke said on the internet.

I don't assume he's hiding his conservative views; he's written about them often enough.

Rules should be justifiable, not nonsensical. There's no rule against having shaved hair in the adult world. Why should the school get away with making up arbitrary and unjustifiable dress code standards?

&gt;They don't get to question the system and they need to learn that breaking rules has consequences. 

Everyone does get to question the system and if they can't there is a deficit of free speech.

&gt;As for the reason for the policy - probably because shaved heads are generally perceived as thuggish and belonging to stupid people, and it's a bad representation of the school. 

So the school has an institutional policy that entrenches bigotry towards people with shaved hair, effectively likening them to skinheads. I bet any parent with shaved hair sure feels accepted and welcomed by the school. Does such a requirement stand for teachers as well? How 'shaved' must it not be to be acceptable?

&gt;School uniforms or a unified school appearance help with cohesion, behaviour (by stamping out some rebellious individuality) and also reduces bullying (kids who can't afford designer clothes, the ones who don't dress cool, the goths/punks/whatevers.

This has to be a joke. You sound like a crypto-fascist. ""Stamping out some rebellious individuality"". What is ""rebellious"" about having shaved hair? You speak of the prospect of differing fashion styles also causing bullying towards those in minority fashions.

&gt;The following is an account of the events at the LSE Fresher's Fair on October 
3rd
  
  
&gt;On Thursday 3rd
 of October, we (Abishek Phadnis and Chris Moos) were at 
the LSESU Freshers’ Fair, manning  the stall of the LSESU Atheist, Secularist and 
Humanist Society to  meet  other non-believing students. At around noon, we were 
approached by LSESU Community and Welfare Officer Anneessa Mahmood, Anti-
Racism Officer Rayhan  Uddin,  and Deputy Chief Executive Jarlath O'Hara and 
several others who identified as LSESU staff.  
 
&gt;Without explanation, Anneessa Mahmood started removing material from the 
stall. When challenged, she claimed that it was ""offensive"". In addition, the LSESU 
staff members demanded that we remove our t-shirts. We were told that should we not 
comply we would be physically removed from the premises. When we asked for the 
reason for this request, the LSESU officers stated that  several students had 
complained about our t-shirts. When we asked what rules or regulations we were in 
breach of, they told us that they did not need to give reasons for removing students, 
and we would be  informed at a later point in time. As we refused to take off our  t-
shirts or leave without appropriate explanation, we were told that LSE security would 
be called to physically remove us from the building. We came to the Freshers’ Fair to 
promote our society to new students. Our ability to do that was heavily curtailed by 
the actions of the LSESU staff. We especially  felt that the abrasive behaviour of the 
LSESU staff was not aimed at protecting other students from harm, but  rather an 
attempt humiliate us in front of dozens of students.  
 
&gt;When the LSE security arrived, we were asked to cover our t-shirts or leave 
LSE premises. When we asked for the rules and regulations we were in breach of, we 
were told that the LSE was being consulted about how to proceed. After a period of 
consultation,  Kevin Haynes (LSE  Legal and Compliance Team) and 
Paul Thornbury (LSE Head of Security) explained to us that we were not behaving in 
an  “orderly and responsible  manner”, and that the wearing of the t-shirt could be 
considered  “harassment”, as it could  “offend others”  by creating  an “offensive 
environment”. We asked what exactly was “offensive” about the t-shirts, and how the 
display of a non-violent and non-racist comic strip could be considered “harassment” 
of other students. Paul Thornbury told us that it was “clearly deceitful” of us to say 
that we had not intended to cause offence and that we did not feel that we had 
behaved inappropriately or harassed other students.  This  unreasonable behaviour of 
the LSE and LSESU staff caused us  serious distress, particularly  the allegations  that 
our motives were to “offend” others.     
 
&gt;At the end of  this conversation, five security guards started to position 
themselves around our stall. We felt this was a tactic to intimidate us. We were giving 
an ultimatum that should we not comply immediately, we would be physically 
removed from LSE property. We made it clear that we disagreed strongly with this 
interpretation of the rules, but that we would comply by covering the t-shirts. When 
we covered our t-shirts with jackets, the head of LSE security told us that  “this was 
not enough”, and that we had to zip up the jackets. When we zipped up the jackets, 
we were told that this was still not enough, as the word “prophet” was still visible at 
the top. After that, the head of LSE security told us that as he believed that we might 
open the jackets again when was going to leave, two security guards were going to stay in the room to monitor our behaviour. These two security guards were following 
us closely when we went in and out of the room. We felt that this highly unnecessary 
and geared at intimidating and humiliating us in front of others. 
 
&gt;We reject in the strongest possible terms that by wearing a  non-violent, non-
racist t-shirt we would harass other students or create an “offensive environment”. We 
reject completely that we were not behaving in an “orderly or responsible manner”. In 
fact, when  faced with the entirely unreasonable request to change or cover up our 
clothing, we remained calm and asked for clarification on what rules or regulations 
we were alleged to be in breach of. Even though we completely disagreed with the 
instructions of the LSE, we still complied, making clear that we would challenge this 
decision through the appropriate procedures.  
  
&gt;As much as we respect and defend the rights of others to wear whatever they 
choose to wear, we claim this right for ourselves. Our right to free expression and 
participation in the LSE student community is being curtailed for no other reason than 
that  we are expressing views that are not shared by others. As  visible from the 
pictures (attached), the t-shirts are harmless satirical depictions of fictitious religious 
figures  and certainly cannot be considered intimidating, hostile, degrading, 
humiliating or offensive to anyone by even the most stringent standards. 
  
&gt;We will be at tomorrow’s fresher’s fair to continue promoting our society to 
new members. In the meantime, we have asked Professor Paul Kelly (Pro-Director for 
Teaching and Learning) to clarify to us what exact LSE rules and regulations we are 
alleged to have breached.

LSE SU response:

&gt;Joint statement from LSE and LSE SU

&gt;At the LSE Students’ Union Fresher’s Fair on Thursday 3 October two students from the LSE SU Atheist Secularist and Humanist Society (ASH) wore t-shirts that were clearly designed to depict Mohammed and Jesus in a provocative manner.

&gt;The Students’ Union, which runs the event, received a number of complaints from other students.

&gt;The SU asked the students to cover the t-shirts in the interests of good campus relations. The society remained free to share their literature and views.

&gt;One member of the society declined to do this. The student was attended by a cameraman and it was feared that his behaviour would disrupt the event.

&gt;The SU referred the matter to the School. Representatives of the School in attendance agreed that the matter was a cause for concern and that the presence of the t-shirts was in danger of eroding good campus relations and disrupting efforts to run a Fresher’s Fair designed to welcome all new students.

&gt;LSE is committed to promoting freedom of expression and is known for its public events and wide range of speakers. In this instance, it was judged that the actions of the students were undermining what should have been a welcoming and inclusive event.

LSE SU General Secretary

And that's fine to focus on doing.

But unfortunately for these people, a life of just ""getting food on the table"" is not that straightforward as it seems to appear, especially in the UK as it requires a lot of background processes which maybe they have not factored in before.

A lot of the background processes to get ""food on the table"" have become ""dangerous"" (akin to ""the boiling frog"" story) due to some of the revelations and laws of the UK.

""All eat and no play make UK citizens dull to be around"".  
UK citizens are humans and aspire to many other things which are not eating for a functional life. Again, due to the revelations, the other functions which they aspire to do may also damage them later on in life if the current ""internet environment"" continues.

It would be of prudence to stop ""the spread"" of a situation which would harm a lot of people now than in the future as ""prevention is better than cure"".

That is what the Open Rights Group, EFF, ACLU and many more groups and representatives are trying to help prevent.

true,gomez12,null,null,"&gt;Rules should be justifiable, not nonsensical. There's no rule against having shaved hair in the adult world. Why should the school get away with making up arbitrary and unjustifiable dress code standards?

Because they are children. They don't get to decide shit. They aren't precious unique little snowflakes free to 'express themselves'. They are at school to learn and develop into adults.

&gt;Everyone does get to question the system and if they can't there is a deficit of free speech.

Children don't. They aren't adults.

&gt;So the school has an institutional policy that entrenches bigotry towards people with shaved hair, effectively likening them to skinheads. I bet any parent with shaved hair sure feels accepted and welcomed by the school. Does such a requirement stand for teachers as well? How 'shaved' must it not be to be acceptable?

Bigotry, really? You're going to throw that out there? Again - I feel like I need to point out that they are children, not capable of making their own decisions. Parents have the ability to style their hair however they want. Children don't have that right yet. And their parents know the rules of the school.

&gt;This has to be a joke. You sound like a crypto-fascist. ""Stamping out some rebellious individuality"". What is ""rebellious"" about having shaved hair? You speak of the prospect of differing fashion styles also causing bullying towards those in minority fashions. Does this mean you think that long hair and other styles related to hair associated with specific subgenres should also be banished?

Not a joke at all, though it was a crude way of putting it. But you know exactly what I mean. The kid who shaves a design into his head to be cool, or shaves a piece out of one eyebrown, or gets highlights. They're trying to stand out and be different and get attention, and school isn't the time of place for that. I'm not saying to raise little drones, but if you don't give boundaries to children they grow up to be total shitheads who go through life thinking they can do whatever they want.

&gt; It's not eroding all individuality. It's giving children a proper place.

What is this ""proper place"", exactly?

&gt;A school uniform and a dress code while you are a child is not a huge amount to ask.

We're not talking about the school uniform or even a smart casual hypothetical dress code. We're talking about the fact that the school is indirectly enforcing how the students must look outside of school hours by restricting perfectly ordinary haircuts.

I'm not going to go over the GK situation, it's been discussed to death. TL;DR Pants is solid but unspectacular, Joe can be the hero and villian in the same game.

Defence

Clichy can have an off day, but I don't know who I'd swap in for him. Otherwise that's our best defense.

Midfield

I'm including Silva here, and he looked decent enough against Bayern. But Nasri has been working harder and should start. I think Milner in place of Navas against a hardworking Everton would be effective. Then bring on Navas for the last 20 minutes to run the legs off them.
Also think Fernandinho is more effective as holding/defensive mid, letting Yaya get forward.

Forwards

Negredo and Aguero. They are both hard working, track back and score goals from nothing. Both are in form. Dzeko looks lazy and ineffective, Jovetic just has to wait his turn.

Subs

So fucking what? Is there something worse about having shaved hair as a child than having shaved hair as an adult? The school is sending an incorrect and ultimately harmful message: that shaved hair is socially unacceptable, undesirable when it isn't. It is complete nonsense.

&gt;They aren't precious unique little snowflakes free to 'express themselves'. They are at school to learn and develop into adults.

Are adults prevented from having shaved hair? Do we discriminate against people in professions that have shaved hair?

&gt;Children don't. They aren't adults.

That's your system, not mine. Anyone should be free to question anything if they think they have good reason to.

&gt;Bigotry, really? You're going to throw that out there? 

Yes, I am. What exactly is wrong about shaved hair? What possible reason other than thinking them akin to being thuggish and the refuge of racist skinheads could the school have for this petty policy?

&gt;Again - I feel like I need to point out that they are children, not capable of making their own decisions. Parents have the ability to style their hair however they want. Children don't have that right yet. And their parents know the rules of the school.

Uh, this rather depends on the parents. I suspect many parents allow their children (within reason) to choose how they want to style their hair. Is it a problem that some might choose to shave it? Does it impact on anything?

&gt;Not a joke at all, though it was a crude way of putting it. But you know exactly what I mean.

No, I don't.

&gt;The kid who shaves a design into his head to be cool, or shaves a piece out of one eyebrown, or gets highlights.

We're not talking about people who shave designs in their hair, or get highlights, or shave 1/4 of their eyebrow (though that is so insignificant I don't know why that should matter). We're talking about just vanilla shaved hair.

&gt;They're trying to stand out and be different and get attention, and school isn't the time of place for that.

So anyone who decides to shave their hair is just trying to ""stand out and be different and get attention"".

I had no idea.

&gt;I'm not saying to raise little drones, but if you don't give boundaries to children they grow up to be total shitheads who go through life thinking they can do whatever they want. 

Seriously, talk about hyperbole. Out of context no-one would think you're seriously railing against the injustice of allowing children to shave their hair.

&gt;We can teach them to think independently while still following basic rules and codes of conduct, much like society.

Yup, because having shaved hair is illegal and it is in the basic basic code of conduct(tm) of the universe to isolate anyone with shaved hair.

true,ASKSABOUTPENISSIZE,logo,,"Not sure why Kolarov wasn't included in their subs list, but I would have him start over Clichy. In all honesty I would have Kompany and Lescott in the middle of defence this game as Lukaku is a physical monster that perhaps Nastasic may not be able to cope with (This would also be Nasty's 3rd game in 7 days so maybe it's time for a rest). Zaba on the right of defence, no questions there. 

In midfield I would have Yaya, Ferna, Milner and Silva. We need Milner on the pitch for his defensive work rates against the likes of Mirallas (and possibly Delofeu). When Silva came on against Bayern he looked quite sharp so I think it's time for him to get back in the team, and there really isn't another pairing for CM other than Yaya and Ferna (Garcia is out of the question in my opinion). 

For the forwards I would have Negredo and Jovetic. I realize he has a slight problem but Manuel didn't seem to think it was something to worry about judging from what he said in the press conference. Perhaps Jovetic could play 60-70 minutes with either Aguero or Dzeko coming on for him. I feel like he has yet to get a real chance in the team and I think this is the perfect opportunity for him to show his worth with both Aguero and Dzeko having lacklustre performances against Bayern. I don't think much needs to be said of why I would include Negredo. He's determined and always works for the team which is something we need right now from our strikers. 

As for the keeper, this is a tricky one. I'm still going to go with Hart, although I would not be surprised if Pantillimon got the nod. Hart is our number 1. and I think he knows he needs to improve and he will do everything he can to show that. With that being said I have full confidence in Pantillimon if he started.

The school doesn't want their pupils to look like that. It was clearly communicated in school rules. Kid disobeys rules, gets punished. It's pretty simple. Whether he did it for charity or to look cool is completely irrelevant to the fact that he broke the rules. And nobody gives a shit if you disagree with the rules. They are what they are, and parents who send children there know it fine well.

It's not ""training drones"" or any of far-fetched bollocks like that. There are simple rules to follow, and children need to learn to follow them. If you let them get away with breaking the rules, they turn into right little entitled cunts who think they can do whatever they want.

&gt;So anyone who decides to shave their hair is just trying to ""stand out and be different and get attention"".

In a school which expressedly forbids it, yes.

&gt;Uh, this rather depends on the parents. I suspect many parents allow their children (within reason) to choose how they want to style their hair. Is it a problem that some might choose to shave it? Does it impact on anything?

And those people are bigots, frankly. In employment if you were to discriminate in such a way you would not get away with it. The school is overexerting itself here in a big way and not teaching any kind of life message beyond reinforcing bigotry against people who shave their hair.

Especially as many people shave their hair when they start balding. Are they thuggish? Are they scum?

&gt;The school doesn't want their pupils to look like that.

Clearly, and they are wrong for imposing themselves on students in such a way.

&gt;It was clearly communicated in school rules. Kid disobeys rules, gets punished. It's pretty simple. Whether he did it for charity or to look cool is completely irrelevant to the fact that he broke the rules.

You keep repeating the schools rules as if that makes them immune from criticism. It does not.

&gt;And nobody gives a shit if you disagree with the rules. They are what they are, and parents who send children there know it fine well.

What a great message to send to children. Rules should not be questioned. No-one gives a fuck if you disagree. Keep your opinions to yourself. All these messages in a democracy as well, brilliant!

&gt;It's not ""training drones"" or any of far-fetched bollocks like that. There are simple rules to follow, and children need to learn to follow them.

You keep conflating the school forbidding children to shave their hair as the same thing as some kind of unquestionable simple rule that all children should observe to be functional members of society. This is disingenuous. They are not the same.

&gt;If you let them get away with breaking the rules, they turn into right little entitled cunts who think they can do whatever they want.

Rules that are not justifiable are not worth following.

&gt;In a school which expressedly forbids it, yes.

Uh, no. There's just no way that you can know this.

&gt;Doesn't matter. School says it isn't allowed. If parents let the kid do it anyway, they are just as much to blame and also need to learn to stfu, read and follow basic instructions.

Because parents should have no input whatsoever on how their local school runs things. The school can do what they want, how they want and to whom they want and the parents should just stfu and follow their instructions.

I mean fuck me, you talk endlessly about the importance of following rules but have no qualms whatsoever about allowing schools impose what they like for whatever reason (or indeed, no reason).

I'd like to say another clean sheet, but, West Hams play focuses on the whole ""target man"" mentality and hold up play.

Thankfully Lloris is excellent at the sweeper role but he is a very high risk high reward keeper, sooner or later we will concede at some point because of this, it is inevitable.

When I was about 7, my parents got me an electronics kit. It could make hundreds of things- a tone generator, a torch shooty game, a binary counter, but by far the most exciting schematics were for radios. AM radio is very easy to receive, all you need is a resonant circuit and something that distorts non-linearly. This can be achieved with as few as five components.

I can remember clearly putting the parts together and listening to the earpiece while turning the tuning knob. The wonder! That these simple components could make a device capable of hearing transmissions from miles and miles away.

I graduated from university a few years ago with a degree in control engineering (electronics and software). 

Digital radio is perhaps technically superior, but it's a shame that in order to build a digital radio you need to build an MPEG audio decoder, which requires knowledge of filter banks and frequency domain analysis to even look at the [150 page standard document](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22412) (which will also cost you 150 quid to get a copy of), and then you have to write to the spec in C or assembler, write the compiled code to a controller, supply it with power, accurate clock etc etc.

It's light years from my first crystal radio.

I was buying a [new hoover \(ok ok a vacuum cleaner\)](http://www.brighthouse.co.uk/upright-vacuums/vax-air3-bagless-upright-vacuum/) and was looking for reviews or other info on it. I ended up at the Brighthouse page for it but I noticed that they were charging way over full retail before they put their own interest charges on it. So rather than the discounted price - £89.99 before delivery that I paid for a new one.. they charge you £396.98 before they add on interest which takes it to £624.00 over the period.

They claim a representative rate of 64.7% - but that's a lie.

If you paid the John Lewis full retail price it's £299.99. I admit I got mine for a good price, but that (now discontinued model in the range) sold regularly for about £180.

So what's the real APR.

On the RRP - 123.5% (This is the lowest APR they could claim without being dirty fucking liars)

On the usual price (that the manufacturer sold it direct or available if you shopped around briefly) - 371.5%

On the price I paid - 1989.5% APR

What's the root problem? A company that retails a product, and also provides the finance is able to lie about the cost of the finance. The finance industry is extremely strictly regulated and must use APRs, however this is a way around it and leads to Brighthouse being able to scam people in this way.

Solutions? Two possible. First of all unlink finance from retail sales. This is a big anti-business move. But it would fuck over scumbags like Brighthouse. It might also unlink mobile phones from mobile phone contracts, which is a big deal two.

The other is simply to say that any company that is not charging a reasonable retail price for the product being financed is being fraudulent.

If you sent your child to a school that forbids children from wearing bracelets, and had that in the rules prior to you enrolling the kid, then your child is not allowed to wear bracelets and can be punished for wearing bracelets. Even if its not YOUR fault that they put on bracelets as soon as they leave your house, it is still fully acceptable to exclude, suspend or isolate them for breaking the rules. 

It is the schools decision to enforce those rules and seeing as it is the provider and you are purely there by their choice and their good will for letting you in, you have to accept their conditions, you have no say over this except for your participation in school meetings, which you are usually entitled to do. If there is an outcry about letting children wear bracelets at school by parents, then maybe the school will change its policy, but until then, your child follows their rules.

Schools usually enforce a no gum in class rule, is it illegal to chew gum, no, is it a choice made by the parent that their child should chew gum in class, no, can the student be punished for this transgression if he undertakes it himself independent of his parents, yes.

Your argument has literally no foundation besides ""children should be allowed to do whatever the fuck they want at school regardless of the rules enforced, because technically they didnt choose the school themselves""

26 	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
27 	Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.""

true,[deleted],null,null,"As my Dad always told me: Be sceptical about jobs that ask you to pay upfront for anything other than travel to interview.

The idea is that you're gaining employment to earn money. Not spending money to *potentially* gain employment. 

Of course there are exceptions. A decent suit/basic equipment, travel to and from the interview, and maybe a quick phone call to confirm an interview. The Jobcentre can help with all three of these costs as they are barriers to workplace entry. Suit/Travel can be paid. Phones are provided in the jobcentre. 

However, as a jobseeker, if you're spending upfront then be sceptical. If you're on the phone past 10 minutes, and they haven't called you, then explain the problem and cut off. Give them an e-mail address to send correspondence. If you have no computer go to a local library and set up a free Gmail or Hotmail/Office365 account. Write it down, remember it, and inform employers. 

Most telephone interviews for example will be arranged and the employer will call you. Not the other way around. 

If you're ringing for advice to a random company or mentor cap yourself at 5 minutes (or the money you can afford). Arrange a discussion in person if you can walk there.

Essentially benefiting from selling what a reasonable person would assume is an identical product without having the marketing (or R&amp;D) spend.

&gt;""The kuffar, the disbelievers, the atheists who remain deaf and stubborn to the teachings of Islam, the rational message of the Koran; they are described in the Koran as “a people of no intelligence”  Allah describes them as not of no morality, not as people of no belief – people of “no intelligence” – because they’re incapable of the intellectual effort it requires to shake off those blind prejudices, to shake off those easy assumptions about this world, about the existence of God. In this respect, the Koran describes the atheists as “cattle”, as cattle of those who grow the crops and do not stop and wonder about this world.""

He's insulting the intelligence of atheists and likening them to sheep (or 'cattle' in this case).  No, this is not aimed at 'everyone, ESPECIALLY Muslims'.  It's his attempt to belittle atheists.

There will be some (immature) folk of course, but it's worth noting that the student group being discussed here is the Atheist &amp; Humanist Society. Many others around the country aren't exclusively atheist groups, but often include the terms ""Agnostic"" and/or ""Secular"". Such groups - particularly the secular ones - are effectively for anyone to join, even the religious (most religious people in the UK agree with secular principles, after all). However, unfortunately, the groups are often referred to as ""the Atheist society"" but that really doesn't do them justice considering the amount of activities the students engage in, be it campaigning or their monthly (or whatever) discussions and meetings. In my experience these were normally focussed around philosophy, ethics or moral issues, though most people who didn't know much about the group just assumed it was 'teenagers' sitting in a pub saying ""I think religion is shit!"" ""Yeah!"" ""Fuck god, right?!"" A tad insulting really.

Personally I'm going to wait a bit and read more statements from the parties involved, before I draw any conclusions. Mind you given that the LSE group has been running a while, and the people behind the table were most probably elected officers, I doubt they were random atheists looking to piss people off without having a 'good reason'.

His game is by no stretch of the imagination anywhere near polished. Yes, he is brave and bold and looks to be able to create a lot out of nothing. But there are mistakes sprinkled in his game. I was there on Monday night. Both he and Lukaku were our best players in the first half. Come the second half their performances dropped and both players made mistakes. I distinctly remember Ross making a costly one too. 

It's the trouble with young English talent that seemingly bursts on to the scene. Like Wayne before him, Ross is certainly an out and out talent who has all the potential to develop in to a truly great player. But the media frenzy has already began to snowball. 

I don't know if you read the dailymail article that was recently posted here. In it they describe an almost fairy tale rise from schoolboy to England international and describe his input in the upcoming 'crucial' qualifying game as important. It's a boy done good story that inspires people to believe and is guaranteed to sell papers. I'm sure he can handle the added pressure because he seems very grounded, but it's unwarranted and not very fair. 

England fans especially need hope, and the English media are happy to peddle any old rhetoric about the new Gazza/Gerrard/Lampard because our youth development is languishing in comparison to our European neighbours to the east and south.

Communities would be perfectly able to determine in a radically democratic fashion that behaviour which was dangerous to their survival, harmful to individuals within it, antisocial or oppressive, and could respond appropriately in a self-defensive, bottom up fashion.  No need for a top down hierarchical system of capitalist laws: ""We know what they are, and what they are worth! They are spider webs for the rich and mighty, steel chains for the poor and weak, fishing nets in the hands of government.""

&gt; The rich will buy armies and kill the poor who will try and take their stuff.

How will they do this?  If there is no State to enforce private property, they only have the wealth contained within their own personal properties which gives them much less leverage to raise private armies, and why would people choose to be in their private armies when they could be wealthier outside of them?  Consider, if they did begin to defend private property in the name of their ""liege lord"", at any time, under anarchism they could merely turn around and settle it, farm it, run it in the case of factory plant or machinery, use it, and profit from it in their own name as they would have usufructuary rights to it.

 Nestor Makhno used this method to great effect during his time fighting in Free Ukraine.

Let's say that you arrive from the US, somewhere in the Schengen area - let's say Italy.

While in Italy, you think to yourself ""I really want to go to Nice"", and so you hop into a hire car and head off down the road. You approach the border with France, to find that it looks rather like [this](http://goo.gl/maps/qOaoy). You just drive through, nobody stops you.

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"Couple of things to clear up on this one - firstly, there's two proposals being put forward here, firstly, the blanket 1% pay increase (will be the first flat pay rise in 3 years when it kicks in) is a national increase. For me (as an NHS employee) it isn't actually such a big deal financially if it was decided to be withheld. Again. Although I do find it quite insulting that considering everything the NHS has been put through in the last years 'we' aren't even worth that minuscule amount to the government. And it is minuscule in the grand scheme of things to the whole NHS budget, no matter how much noise is made about taking money away from 'front line' care.

How do you value staff morale's impact on care? As it's just about the lowest I've seen in my 10 years at the moment.

The second proposal, the removal of annual performance linked pay increases would have a much larger impact. The system is based on something called Agenda for Change and is a 'ladder' style system, with a cap and collar.  You can see ladders at http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/working-in-the-nhs/pay-and-benefits/agenda-for-change-pay-rates/

Now, a nurse starts at in the band 5 ladder, the lowest point of which is £21,388. I'm an ex nurse, now doing clinical service development (ie mostly management, with 6 days a month in the community) and on the band 6 ladder. Each role in the NHS has a band attached and every year, you should be assessed for a one point move up the ladder, within your band, if whatever process your NHS organisation has for performance management is met.

When I was working in a clinical setting, this was assessed on a mixture of what learning you've successfully undertaken in the last year, sickness record, ward performance and an evaluation by your line manager. Thankfully I was always awarded them - but the process and awards are very much a local organisation thing, and it is not a sure thing that everyone will get a point on the ladder every year.

I've not done a management one yet - the organisation was new this year and does not have a process in place yet. So this year, no one was assessed and no one saw any pay increase. Which wasn't heartening, but the NHS has been in such upheaval for the last 2 years, we understood.

Once you reach the final point on the ladder, there are no further options for a pay rise beyond moving up a whole band into a new role. I believe the ladders are also designed to reduce the % pay increases the further up the bands/ladders you go. So it's weighted towards the lowest paid already in percentage terms. And yes, the %increases are generally quite a bit larger than the proposed 1% national increase (which is why I, at the lower end of my band would be more concerned about changes to this system!).

I would imagine that the people on the final rung of the ladder will be much more peeved about the 1% than I am as they have nothing coming to them. So the rhetoric saying that we all get performs  related pay increases as well as the proposed 1% is not always true.

The system is generally pretty good - it seems to encourage people to progress through the NHS - once you max your band out (which will take years), it's assumed that the experience you've accumulated is enough for you to get a new job at a higher band, and the lack of any further pay increase is an incentive to take that leap. Doesn't always work out like that - some people just can't make any further leaps, some love their current job, some can't find another NHS job that interests them. It's this group that the 1% removal really punishes.

BrightHouse are a rip off. Most of the finance we offered was over three years, so at the representative 64.7% APR (Annual Percentage Rate) you'd be paying 194.1% interest on the product over the course of your repayments. Yes, that's three times the value! And this doesn't include the insurances, which we as employees were encouraged to sell as they were the company's ""most profitable product.""

Most of our customers were either unemployed or on a low income and not many of them got refused for credit. Some were paying over a hundred pounds a week on their repayments, some could afford it and others were clearly struggling, and if you missed payments you would be charged extra. That said, the blame cannot be placed squarely with the company. We were required by law to read through the contract with the customer, explaining the cost of the products, the insurances, the amount of interest, the total amount to repay, the amount the weekly payments would come to and the charges for missed payments. It was our job to make sure they fully understood what they were getting into before they signed, if you shop there and they don't do this then you should report them.

The level of after-sales service I saw was pretty terrible. If people came in with an issue then I would help them the best I could, I sorted out a few customers' laptops in the time I was there. But lets say your washing machine broke and you didn't take out Damage Liability Cover, well then tough, you'd be stuck with a broken washing machine that you still need to pay for. I understand that this likely goes against the sale of goods act, but frankly, most of the customers weren't that switched on. And even if you did have insurance, you'd be lucky to get the issue resolved in a timely fashion. The amount of complaints we received was shocking.

I would definitely not recommend BrightHouse unless you have no other option. If you do need a washing machine or a fridge, then it is an option if you don't have the cash up-front to buy it, so long as you read the contract fully so you know what you're getting in to and make sure you can afford it. But I would also shop around, you will likely find a rental company which will offer a better service for what you need.

Depends how you implement it. It could be more a requirement for transparency than an anti-business move. Same goes for mobile phone contracts. 

I've heard people argue that it should be up to the customer to do their own homework, but these days many services are priced in an extremely complex manner and I don't think that's realistic any more. A free market can't work with asymmetric information.

&gt;The other is simply to say that any company that is not charging a reasonable retail price for the product being financed is being fraudulent. This is a more easily implemented change - but a rather arbitrary one.

By completely free it means literally that -- it is no more allowed for there to be any kind of inspection of anybody or anything crossing the border than if you were just driving from one town to the next in the same country.

Separately from that, the EU requires that member states allow citizens of any other member states to be able to live and work in that country without hindrance.

Do you see the difference? One is to do with crossing the borders, the other is to do with what you can do once you're inside the country.

So for example Britain is part of the EU, but not a signatory to Schengen. So an Italian would need to present a passport and pass through full immigration control when he entered the UK, and the UK reserves the right to refuse entry to ""undesirable"" foreigners including non-British EU citizens. Once in the UK however our hypothetical Italian would have the same rights with regard to finding work, a place to live etc as any British citizen.

Conversely Norway is a signatory to Schengen, but not in the EU. So our Italian, who's now on holiday in Scandinavia, could drive across the border from Sweden to Norway without having to show his passport or any other documents. In fact if he wasn't paying attention and didn't notice the small sign saying ""NORGE"" he probably wouldn't even realise he'd moved from one country to another. However once in Norway, which remember isn't part of the EU, he wouldn't necessarily have the right to live and work there.

It was puerile and stupid here, and it's the same at LSE. Deliberately stirring up a fuss at a student union function is likely against union policy - it doesn't help anyone. Unfortunately I have yet to encounter an atheist/humanist student society which's activities don't more or less wholly consist of trying to annoy religious students.

Freshers fairs are put on by Student Unions to provide a welcoming atmosphere to all new students. If this bunch can't turn up to it without annoying or upsetting new students then they don't belong at the event. And before you start the 'free speech' stuff, FF is a private event put on LSESU and it's well within their rights to eject societies from it.

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"I've worked for 3 organisations in the last 2 years, having to reapply for a reducing number of jobs with each stage of the NHS reorganisation - I'm one of the lucky ones who survived each phase of the governments changes. Each time, my immediate colleagues changed, management changed and we had to work out how to do the (slightly different each time) job all over again within a new framework. Every few months, having to relearn how to do your job and who you need to work with just gets... Worrying, seeing work get dropped each time and wasting time that should be spent on improving the quality of services spent instead on repeating work.

From Primary Care Trusts (approx 200 staff) to Cluster PCTs (merger of 3 PCTs, approx 400 staff, ie 200 lost) to CCGs (back to PCT area coverage, ours has 21 people, ie 10% of that 2 years ago).

Each time people left, taking knowledge with them and leaving those remaining to pick up any slack (and don't get me wrong - there was slack in the system). All the time being blasted in the media for being uncaring or that we were all useless management (even though the majority of my original team were active or ex clinicians).

The sheer quantity of knowledge and decent, working processes that have been broken or lost in the last few years is terrifying. For a timely example - children's safeguarding. In the 'old days', you used to have a relatively solid tri-party agreement between the local authority (social services), PCT (NHS) and police with established agreements and ways of working in place.

Now we have CCGs (NHS hospitals, mental health and community services), NHS England (NHS GPs, specialist services, forensic mental health), local authorities (public health and social services) and the police involved.  Barring the police, all the other teams are 'new' and do not have established working processes in place currently (yes, even social services, which have undergone their own upheaval with significant cuts in the last couple of years). NHS England have not sent a representative to any of our local safeguarding panels this year so far due to being understaffed and the rest of us are frantically running around trying to rewrite all the vital working processes and build relationships with a whole new set of people. We do the best we can, but with a gaping hole in the safeguarding team and less people having to do more work, it's just a mess at the moment.

I know some industry can thrive on chaos and unpredictability - but the NHS is not one of them, you can't run a health system safely in that environment. Safeguarding in particular is based on knowing who to turn to when you suspect a problem and having organisations with strong processes in place to investigate and cross organisation communication and working.

A lesser example is the rollout of a new NHS finance system. Everyone knows the NHS sucks at IT anyway, but we should now be reporting a month 6 financial position - which if you've ever worked with finance, you'll know is pretty vital in order to start planning the following years budget on. However, due to the split of responsibilities for services across the host of new organisations - and the dodgy new accounting system, it's currently broken. There is no accurate record in the NHS of where money has been spent, by who. We deal with it, by informed guesses and struggling to contact new people, in new organisations to negotiate payments and recharges on a case by case basis - but it's yet more work, with less people, taking more time to resolve each and every time in comparison to the working system of 2 years ago. At this rate, it's not just this years finances that are a mess, it's going to impact on next year as well, since we can't accurately plan currently.

The money doesn't bother me particularly, it's the job I love, and it just hurts to see what a mess we walk into every day at the moment. Never mind that when something goes wrong in the NHS, it goes very wrong - constant worry about whether services and our care is safe is also a strong concern.",0,1380967847,null,0,false,0,cclh2ff,t3_1nqpy8,t1_cclh2ff,t1_cclgqcj,null,1429238137,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

What I believe we need to do is move all the party's away from following consumerist/profit based politics toward a philosophy that benefits the majority of the population as a whole and doesn't shit either on those who thrive and those who don't or can't.   

At over the last 30 years - since my middle teens, I have sent time living in all the economic bands.  Being long term unemployed in the late 80's and early 90's was fairly shit (but better I guess than now), earning 100k a year in the late 90's and early 2000's was fairly shit compared to some other other parts of the world (but hurt way much less than the dole - it just felt like you lost a hell of a lot to tax but got fuck all back for it, especially when it ended up being sold off by the government anyway) and earning 30k for the last few years is still fairly shit and getting increasingly painful again.  We have (had?) some great stuff in this country that belongs to everyone - welfare, education, transport, health etc.  As an idea, why don't we improve these things rather than get rid of them?  Maybe then, if we are taxed to death we might see something beneficial for our salary deductions and if we need help or encouragement to get back into a taxable position, we might get it.

In the last 30 years I have seen the Right and the Left systematically dismantle these things.  Dismantling puts us down in the same bracket as the States which although is good for ""Opportunity"" and a few at the top,  isn't so good if you don't have the opportunity's accessible to you and not so good for those who struggle.

I know exactly what type of person you are by your overall manner, you arent clever, you barely win arguments, and you know this, so instead of actually arguing the point, you argue syntax and grammar like somehow missing a comma out derails an entire argument. 

You then start two sentences without capital letters and call ME the hypocrite for calling you out, believe it or not, one can have utterly logical ideas about the world, and not remember to put an apostrophe in ""can't"", hell Albert Eintein had dyslexia, i'd sure like you to criticise him for bot being able to understand logic. 

Of course this fact displeases you because your sole point from those 5 that actually makes ANY sense in this scenario is the human rights one which again is very very flimsy. Ill type that in caps so that you can respond. 

TO reply to your other 4 points so that im not sharpshooting. 

1: Isn't a point, is solely there to make it look like you've wrote a lot?

2. Its not condescending to offer a comparison against other appearance based rules that schools enforce. What type of person are you that takes offence at such minutiae of arguments, it genuinely puzzles me.

3. They chose not to shave, an easy and often expected thing in western society, especially in the last 40 years.

4. Yes I used the word illegal, but if you actually read my point you'd CLEARLY see I was saying its NOT illegal, by way of impressing on you that you can be punished by non judicial groups for ""crimes"" that aren't against the law in your country.

5. IT IS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION THAT HAS THE OPTION TO ALLOW IN WHOMSOEVER THEY CHOOSE BASED ON CONDITIONS THAT THEY DON'T DO CERTAIN THINGS. IT IS AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS TO STICK YOUR HAND IN A PERSONS MOUTH AND TAKE OUT CHEWING GUM, THAT DOESN'T NOT MEAN THAT CHEWING GUM CAN'T BE PUNISHABLE.


I have to warn you now, I'm not going to reply to any points you make, frankly you are in my opinion utterly devoid of any serious intellect, masquerading behind this 21st century internet idea that grammar and syntax are the be all and end all  of arguments. However please, if you are willing to address that point, I will read it, in the hope you ahve something worthwhile to say.

No mentions of grammar, or syntax, or spelling. Not even in reference to our sidetracked argument. Just address the point in caps, reiterated below

By joining a private institution, you are making a choice to follow their rules, and if you do not, then it is their choice to punish you. Beards do grow naturally, and so does hair, but we expect men in most schools to keep hair to a certain length. Least of all in private institutions where they are particularly rigid about such appearances.

true,refugeerights,null,null,"I work with refugees to advise them through the asylum seeking process and also campaign for awareness around refugee rights and some on the misinformation in this thread is shocking. 

Firstly, the idea that we are being flooded with refugees in this country is simply false. Refugees make up less than 1 per cent of the population and we take in far less applications every year than countries such as France, the US and Sweden. Also every year there are around 7 times more immigrants coming to the UK than refugees. Most refugees flee to neighbouring countries when they are being persecuted. Currently, however, Syrians who flee to their neighbouring countries are facing discrimination and massively overcrowded and unsanitary camps. It seems obvious why they want to look further to a stable democracy where they would be truly safe. 

The idea that refugees come to the UK looking for for 'free homes, generous benefits, and shit like that...' is also bullshit. Many refugees who you speak to when they first arrive to the country are actually unaware of the benefits system. They also receive very little during the asylum seeking process. They get around £5 a day to live off. The housing provided is very unsafe. One in five women who seek asylum in the UK are sexually assaulted once they get here. They can be detained at any time for any reason, even a number of children each year are detained (i.e. imprisoned) for no given reason. Imagine constantly worrying that you could be taken to prison with no justification whatsoever. The whole process of asylum seeking is also set up to make them feel criminalised - it's actually quite horrible to get people through the process and many of the people I've worked with have spoke of suicide. Once their application is denied, refused asylum seekers loose all support whatsoever and often live in destitution, even though 26% of appeals are successful - meaning legally they have the right to live here.

I don't know why these particular people don't want to stay in France. From my experience I would guess that it's due to the even harsher process in France and also due to the general racism towards Arabs that can be experienced there. 

It's fair enough wondering why they would want to come specifically to the UK, or not being sympathetic to their persecution. But educate yourself on the actual facts of the asylum seeking process before damning these people and regurgitating Daily Mail sound bites.

Since we were people living in the forrest, we've worked hard, invented ways to kill wooly mammoths, created technology, mastered our environments, farmed the land through back breaking work to feed our families, gone to war with neighbouring tribes who try to take whats ours. Those who didn't fight for our tribe, didn't work hard, these are those who are the ones that are now signing on for years and years, thinking the working man owes them a living. 

Now you can argue that in those times you'd go out, farm the land or hunt some animals and the work was there for you, so in that regard it was easier. But people signing on for 2, 3 or 4 years are not people actively looking for a job, that's obvious. They need to be forced out of the house into meetings to talk with people who can help them back into work.

Whilst I agree there's more of a perception of integration and Westernisation with say the British Caribbean population, and more reason for some to misunderstand or mistrust Islam because of geopolitics, I would have thought the Indian or Sikh community would be perceived as most integrated of all.  Call it the Freddie Mercury or Monty Panesar phenomenon, perhaps, but I'd argue they're among the best integrated and as such people struggle to see differences.

I'm not worried so much about the PM question results.  If you were to ask a similar gender question for party leaders I definitely wouldn't want a female Conservative leader because there's only Theresa May in the running.  In a poll that would make me look a misogynist.  If you were to ask me the same about Labour then I'm a bit of a Yvette Cooper fan - I think she'd be a complete breath of fresh air and much better than either Ed.  I'd back a female leading Labour 100% (after the Burnham scandal) and the same poll would make me look a feminist.  Neither misogynist or feminist epithets are true, I prefer genderless and quota-less merit.  Same goes with ethnic minorities.

None in my opinion are yet ready to lead even their own parties, let alone PM.  In this sense the poll is meaningless because there simply isn't anybody for the public to realistically see in that position at the moment.

Bad news:

1) Whatever job you did in the states, you will make less money doing the same thing here 

2) However you lived in the states, that lifestyle will be more expensive here.   Yes, even more than NYC or SF

3) While income tax is about the same, all other kinds of tax are much higher, and there are more of them

4) Productivity and efficiency are not on anyone's to do list.  You'll take your business elsewhere?   Good riddance, less work for me.  (The less personally you can take this, the happier you will be) 

The good news:

1) The weather is lovely.   Fuck what everyone says about rain, Manchester gets about as much rain as my home town in Ohio.  Summers are warm but not hot, winters are cool but not cold.  You don't have to worry about sweat or frostbite.  Be it daybreak on Christmas day, or noon on the 4th of July, the temp is always perfect for a stroll. 

2) Speaking of strolls, it is beautiful here.  There are massive public parks with duck ponds and gardens, well maintained bike trails, quaint villages, ruined abbeys, breathtaking vistas, all just around the corner from wherever you happen to end up.  In the States, every city is an island, and unless you live in Colorado or Amish country, the countryside doesn't have a lot to offer.  Britain is more like a spider Web, dotted with something captivating every half mile for the whole length and breadth of the island. 

3) No one expects you to hustle unless you are getting on or off a train.  You want to sit at your local pub for Sunday lunch and read for 6 hours? More power to you.  You want to take a vacation incommunicado 3 weeks before a large project is due for a major client?  Sure, why not?  Feeling restless/bored in the middle of a task?  Tea break! (repeat 20x a day)

4) Pie.   Not fruit pie, meat pie.  Cheese and onion pie.  Fish pie.  Game and ale pie.  SERIOUSLY AMERICA GET ON THE PIE TRAIN.

The problem is posts like this seem to encourage moaning and saying we shouldn't have let him go on loan. It's going to be a long season if that continues as he will score 20+ in the league.

My other problem being the people moaning are usually the ones saying he wasn't good enough to start, but are now saying he should have started and kept him. Stuff like that couldn't be any more plastic if I hit someone around my head with my credit card.

As I said in my oringial post hindsight is a wonderful thing. I said at the start of the season he should be starting upfront as I knew what he was capable of. We didn't, we wouldn't even if he didnt loan him and he wouldn't have progressed as much as he will on loan. Next season he's without a doubt our first choice striker. For now he's an Everton player and I wish him the absolute best. He had valid reasons fr wanting to leave.

Also the way some here talk about him you think we'd fucking sold him. Right I'm done. Rant over.

Having a stand at FF obligates you, under the conditions, to behave yourself and respect other societies whether you agree with them or not. Labour would probably have been kicked out if they wore t shirts which annoyed the Tories and vice versa, this is a uniform standard which ASH didn't fulfil and got kicked out as a consequence after being given opportunities to conceal the problematic material.

Which they can do, just not at an LSESU event pitched at primarily non-ASH members. In the same way the religous groups don't wear 'homosexuality is a sin' t shirts or distribute material of that sort. They can do that at their own functions

Absolutely. What I can't understand is why you pick on the two AHS societies in the country which are notoriously provocative and try to hold them up as typical. The CU at my university got in trouble for telling someone they couldn't be president because they were gay but I'm sure most CUs get along nicely with the LGBT crew, as it would seem they do at Reading.

&gt;  Having a stand at FF obligates you, under the conditions, to behave yourself and respect other societies whether you agree with them or not.

Again, you make circular arguments. ""LSE AHS shouldn't offend Muslims because that's LSESU policy."" AHS are vying for a change of policy because they recognise how dangerous it is (I refer you back to BNP &amp; immigration debate).

&gt; Which they can do, just not at an LSESU event pitched at primarily non-ASH members. In the same way the religous groups don't wear 'homosexuality is a sin' t shirts or distribute material of that sort. They can do that at their own functions

Wrong. All societies must adhere to union rules at all times, which includes stuff on diversity.

Mixed-Race People Perceived as 'More Attractive,' UK Study Finds  
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100414092523.htm


&gt; In the largest study of its kind Dr Michael Lewis of Cardiff University's School of Psychology, collected a random sample of 1205 black, white, and mixed-race faces.

&gt; Each face was then rated for their perceived attractiveness to others -- with mixed-race faces, on average, being perceived as being more attractive.

... and at the end it mentions,

&gt; Dr Lewis added: ""The results appear to confirm that people whose genetic backgrounds are more diverse are, on average, perceived as more attractive than those whose backgrounds are less diverse. This can be taken as evidence for heterosis among human population groups.

&gt; ""There is evidence, albeit anecdotal, that the impact of heterosis goes beyond just attractiveness. This comes from the observation that, although mixed-race people make up a small proportion of the population, they are over-represented at the top level of a number of meritocratic professions like acting with Halle Berry, Formula 1 racing with Lewis Hamilton; and, of course, politics with Barack Obama.""",0,1380979514,null,0,false,0,cclig0o,t3_1nry77,t1_cclig0o,t1_cclhrkd,null,1429237437,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

I see. Hyperbole when it's the left, damage control when it's the right. At least try to be consistent when you're asking for consistency.

&gt;Secondly, they made the decision to politicise a man's father who recently died when the person in question had no real political role in an attempt to hurt the standing of a politician, which is what they criticise the Mail. 

That's an interesting way to look at it. They were criticising the fact that David Cameron could be so damning in his criticisms of Jimmy Carr and other offenders, whilst Mr. Cameron's entire family fortune has been filtered through off-shore tax havens. That's very relevant, and Mr. Ian Cameron's actions had a very ""real political role"" in that. Hardly the same as claiming he ""hated Britain"" and bringing up *actual* slanderous irrelevancies though, is it?

Absolute false equivalence.

&gt;This criticism of the Mail might be legitimate, but it remains hypocritical, for which the majority of people on the left are willing to give them a pass for or defend because they see it as being 'their team'.

Just as the majority of the people on the right are willing to give the Cameron's a free pass on their hypocrisy. It's like a never-ending circle when your ideology is completely blinded by fervency.

The ref had no control of the game today. Something like 8 or 9 yellow cards was there?

So you falsely accused the Guardian of slander. Glad we've settled that then.

&gt;I would argue that the defamation laws currently in place would apply to this individual instance, but I am not a lawyer. However, if the Guardian's actions were not libel, then neither were the Mail's in this instance.

Elaborate on which Guardian article you believe contained libel, please. I'm delighted to hear that you're not a lawyer, although unsurprised and incredibly amused by you throwing around wildly inaccurate accusations to defend ""the right,"" while at the same time acting as if that behaviour's beneath you (but only when it comes from the left - again, another point you're trying to make to score one ""for the right."")

The Guardian stated facts in their articles, [plain as day](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens). Ian Cameron engaged in tax avoidance by funneling his fortune through off-shore tax havens. This is not libel.

Turns out, character assassinations on dead people are fine as long as there is a small amount of evidence that you can use to prove it, which the Mail had, or if it was reasonable to believe it given your journalistic standpoint, which the mail could justify.

After a cagey start, Joe Hart did well to stop all chances and looked confident when handling crosses/corners (the few that we conceded, anyway), which in the past he hasn't looked great with.

Losing Kompany early on after already conceding was a scare, but I think Nastasic and Lescott did enough, especially with Kolarov bombing forward all game (and very well, creating a lot of great chances) and Everton looking dangerous on the counter. I just hope Kompany can recover quickly, and the injury is not too bad.

Negredo's goal was brilliant, from the run behind the play and the perfect pass after holding up the ball, putting through the Everton Defenders legs, from Yaya. Aguero missed a lot of chances I expected to end in the back of the net, but he redeemed himself with a fantastic far post finish after an incredible ball by David Silva.

A controversial penalty decision, but it was a penalty. Zab may have gone down easily, but it's hard to find a player who wouldn't in this day and age.

If you're going to London, then the Museum of London is superb. As a WW2 buff, you'd probably like the Imperial War Museum.

Not far from Cambridge is Bletchley Park, where the first real computer was built (I don't count Konrad Zuse), and where WW2 was won.

If you took the whole weekend, then I recommend a small section of the South Downs Way - start in Lewes, walk across the hills through Alfriston to Foxholes camping barn, next day walk along the cliffs to Eastbourne, where you can get a train back home. On the way you'll go over Iron Age hill forts, Lewes' mediaeval castle and priory, the WW2 fortifications around Cuckmere Haven (if the Nazis had invaded this would have been their Omaha Beach, and it wouldn't have gone well for them), you will pass 1950's nuclear bunkers without seeing them (e.g. at Belle Tout). All in all, you'd be covering land that's been continually fortified since before the Romans.

It's very well signposted, and it's an easy walk. the campsite is very basic and only costs about £10. You can easily get a very cheap tent and sleeping bag for under £60.

David Silva was superb, really fantastic passing and vision as weve come to expect, instrumental in attack and very fluid in play.

 Fernandinho put in a great shift as CDM and put a really sweet challenge on an everton player (sorry cant remember) who was breaking down the Left wing with Zabaleta off to grab some clean trousers, vital tackle.

 Yaya made the Everton defence his 'lil-bitch' pushing them around great passing and great assist under pressure (had about 4 defenders on him but kept composure) 

Hart was unlucky got a hand to it , but not his fault lescott fell asleep there. 

Milner was the physical presence the team needed today.

Nottingham seems to have a lot more charm than Derby and Leicester. The city square area is good and certainly worth maintaining.

Leicester does have some very charming parts, and I like the area around the cathedral and the old castle area. That area is magic at night time.

The river side both in Leicester and Derby could do with some gentrifying. Water, shops, cafes and houses can really create a people magnet for city centres. They're doing that and I'm sure they'll get there. I went through Lincoln a while ago, and the river side area felt alive and vibrant.  

I find the drive into Leicester a very depressing experience. The buildings look shocking and run down. Derby isn't so bad because the streets seem wider than Leicester. e.g. London road

My joke when I first saw Leicester was ""why didn't they rebuild it after it was bombed?""

I'm just trying to work out which false accusation you're making now. One minute it's slander, the next it's libel - all of which brought up by you, not me. Again, just trying to get what you're saying straight, not ""trying to feel smart"" at all.

Please do. I'll take responsibility for the site hits, don't worry.

&gt;Irrespective of your condescending tone, I am not your bitch and don't have to do what you want.

My tone is condescending because you refuse to acknowledge when you are plainly wrong. You apply the exact same hypocritical arguments that you're pretend to be annoyed by when they come from ""the left.""

So just to sum up: you cannot provide any evidence to back up any of the things you've just said, and your argument is now that ""you're not my bitch"" and [you do what you want](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZLVi4v7lSM)?

true,tmbyfc,null,null,"That's pretty disingenuous. During the period that tax affairs of politicians and celebrities were being widely discussed, Cameron took it upon himself to single out Jimmy Carr for his ""morally wrong... dodgy tax avoiding schemes"". He was also at the time talking about bringing in tougher measures on companies who use offshore tax schemes to legally avoid paying UK tax.

At this point the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens) reported that Cameron's father had set up and run at least one offshore scheme that had been explicitly created to avoid paying UK tax. Part of his father's income from this passed to Cameron as inheritance. Cameron had therefore directly benefited from the very schemes he was professing to find morally repugnant and claiming he wanted to clamp down upon. So there is clearly a strong relevance and justification for printing such an article. 

It's not a character assassination at all. The tone of the article is very straightforward and businesslike - facts are reported, direct quotes are given, there is no editorialising or comment. They weren't dragging Cameron's father's name through the mud, distorting facts, or writing opinion that questioned his character or morality. And as far as I know, there was no complaint from Downing St about the article.

Publicly I certainly agree, though she's allegedly made disparaging comments in private.

&gt;the acceptance of the labour party at its birth by the monarchy, which showed that the monarchy does not pursue a conservative/right wing agenda, even if as an institution it may be likely to be biased in that direction.

But again, to reiterate, no genuinely left wing position could tolerate a monarchy.  It was a question of compromise.  Sadly the establishment ""left"" has always compromised, to the point where it is indistinguishable from the right.  Left wing = anti-hierarchy.  Monarchy = hierarchy.  Fundamental incompatibility there.  If you think I'm being difficult, consider where the terms left wing and right wing come from...

Shelthorpe is an eyesore entrance to the town, but so is my end of the town - The Ashby road council estate. 

One of the things that was mentioned to me recently was a surprising lack of trees on the housing estates, Shelthorpe road was at one time in the distant past lined with them.  

They are doing the improvement works in the old town near St.Marys/Churchgate, but I think the eyesore that is the dole office and Social services offices should go. Beacon Bingo is...garish. The market place just feels too empty on non-market days, and bedford square isn't great. There are some very old buildings there, but opposite them is just a horrendous piece of road system.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"A Tory MP has requested a freedom of information pass on Andy Burnham.  Burnham had said that there'd been no influence on NHS reports before the Commons whilst he was health secretary.  For his part, he denies taking part of a cover-up.

Emails do show that he was complicit, and involved, to some extent.  How much is for others to decide.

There's a lie that's been told, but the extent of the lie and its effects before a General Election is obviously open to debate.  It remains that a Tory MP has enacted a Freedom of Information clause and is now using it as an argument for why he should resign.

Whilst I'm not a Labour party supporter I am generally a Burnham advocate.  I don't agree with many of his policies but I do trust him in that I think he's generally genuine, but it does seem that he lied to the Commons in trying to suppress a report coming out before the election, although the question is to the extent.  

For me personally that's enough to put my support behind Yvette Cooper.  Burnham wasn't an especially strong candidate but he was likable.  For me it's now a little too tarnished along with the past - not to say he won't be my favourite for Labour in the future.  I think Labour's missing a trick in not bringing Cooper to the fore.

Articulated buses, popularly called bendy buses, were introduced to London in June 2002[citation needed] when the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, introduced new Mercedes-Benz Citaros to Red Arrow commuter services 507 and 521. While articulated bus operation had been standard in several other countries, the UK had only sparingly tried their use[citation needed], so their introduction in London caused a lot of press attention.[1][2]
In 2007, as part of his 2008 Mayoral campaign, Boris Johnson had pledged to withdraw bendy buses on the grounds that they were unsuitable for London, and to introduce a modern replacement of the Routemaster bus.[3] The withdrawal began in 2009, when bendy buses on three routes were replaced with conventional low-floor single and double decker buses, and a prototype for a New Routemaster was promised to be on the streets by 2012.[4] [5] The withdrawal of all bendy buses was completed by the end of 2011.

Back to Sterling though, at the moment I feel for him.  He really doesn't fit into what Rodgers is trying to do all that well.  At the start of last year, we had such limited attacking players he not only got a chance but had room in and around the box.  Now when he comes forward, there are players in advance of him and in the role he played today, especially so.

* We won
* We scored 3, carrying that form from the Sunderland game.
* Hendo played really well in that formation, and he proved that he's not a right midfielder.
* Suarez was outstanding
* Sturridge was immense, as usual
* Enrique did well for 90% of the game, he had a period of about 10 minutes where he wasn't focused, but besides that he did well.
* Sakho has become more comfortable in the team now, and besides *that moment*, he was great.
* Our passing was good (for the most part)
* We're top of the league
* Stevie's almost at 100 BPL goals.

**Negatives:**

* We had a sloppy second half

* We didn't create many clear cut chances, besides the goals

* Our corners weren't effective, something that we *really* need to work on now.

true,junnies,null,null,"Even after this game, there will still be fans slagging Henderson because he doesn't do ""special"" things. He doesn't thread surgical through balls, he doesn't score magnificent goals, he doesn't play flashy hollywood balls.

What they don't appreciate is that he is so incredibly well-rounded.

He's fast, strong, and his workrate is incredible. This means that he can cover the entire pitch, he can break up play quickly and high up the pitch - something gerrard/lucas cannot because they are too slow - which helps us regain possession far more easily, and he's always there whenever we attack or defend which helps us tremendously on both sides of the pitch.

Defensively, he's extremely intelligent. He tackles well, knows when and how to pressure the opponent into making mistakes, giving them little time and space to play, and he very rarely gives away fouls - something lucas/gerrard have been guilty of and which has cost us quite a few goals from set pieces.

Offensively, he doesn't provide the ""magical"" touch but he does everything else. He keeps the ball well, has a decent repertoire of passes, and helps us move the ball up the pitch in a consistently reliable fashion. He has the workrate, willingness, and ability to make runs into the box to draw defenders away or get to the end of those passes across the box.

The female line in my family carries a genetic disorder for muscular dystrophy (leukodystrophy, Lorzeno's Oil, etc). I am male, so I had a 50% chance of inheriting it but I didn't. If I had of, I would be dead by now (I'm 40years old).

When I got tested for the disease, I was about 10 years old and they took skin and blood samples. I still have the scar on my arm. That was the ""state of the art"" in genetic testing back in the 1980s.

Imagine a disease which starts at your toes and legs and gradually works its way up your body until you can't breath any more.  It's not pleasant and my whole family watched my uncle die of it.

ALL the women in my family are carriers, and all their female children are carriers. Even the women can exhibit signs of the disease later in life, but it's nowhere near as bad as what the men will experience.

These days they can test for the disease invitro. I know someone who chose to terminate because her foetus was a carrier but she finally had a healthy baby boy.

My whole family would give anything to not pass it on, but what can you do? They still want to have a family and their hope was that it can be cured before their children (3 girls in total) have to make the choice to pass it on.

There's no reason this should be any more controversial than an organ transplant or a blood infusion. 

What's more our mitochondrial DNA, present in all of us, probably doesn't even have the same origin as our Nucleic DNA! Early eukaryotic cells seem to have combined with bacteria and turned these bacteria into mitochondria (the 'batteries' of cells) so taking a healthy version from one human and putting it in to a human egg isn't such a big deal when you consider they come from a separate life-form in the first place!

On the other study - Fidelity Investments is hardly a neutral or academic source, and - in any event - it actually says 86% 'didn't consider themselves wealthy growing up', which is not the same as not having inherited wealth.  Almost every wealthy person claims they are 'self-made', but few are when you dispassionately analyse their life story...  there have been much more rigorous studies of the richest men/women in the US and the captains of industry in the Fortune 500 which have come up with very different figures.  I'll look them out for you in due course if I have time, but certainly a majority inherited their wealth.

Summary - Medical school costs of around £186,900, NHS pays for materials, infrastructure and medical teaching time on top of that.  The estimate of between £200k - £250k per student - as quoted in [Hansard](http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo001117/text/01117w09.htm) during a debate in 2000 is almost certainly higher these days.

A year of 100 students will cost at least £2 million (expanding 5 years worth of students as per the shorter medical course will cost £10 million per year, whereas it is undoubtedly cheaper to poach them from abroad, especially in fixed term and non-training jobs.

Edit - also - we're getting to a point now of teaching hospital and DGH teaching saturation.

It's ridiculous, civil enforcement officers in most counties can't issue any fines for someone being parked on the pavement unless they're adjacent yellow lines because the council won't let them and police can't do anything unless they sit there all day until the driver comes back which they just won't do.

true,Limited_By_Anxiety,null,null," I've done this for a good many years, £400 a week is cheap. To support a person with Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome 24/7 365 days a year in a residential provision is more like £2 000 to £4 000 a week depending on needs. 

This will not cover medication (unless someone has messed up) but the support of this young man, caring for someone with learning disabilities is exhausting. I'm proud to say I was very good at my job and enjoyed it but I would never want to do it 24/7 as many people do.

I do not know this man but have work with someone with  Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome recently so I'll give you a break down of the level of support they need, lets call them Mike. 

Mike is an adult within a purpose built residential provision for adults with learning disabilities. Mike is unable to walk but can crawl, he is unable to feed himself and is at a high risk of chocking so needs specially prepared food, he requires medication four times a day as well as some invasive medical treatments, he can not dress or bath himself and is incontinent. Mike is unable to speak , sign or use symbols to communicate but can display emotions and affection.  

The funds that have gone are those that go to support people within day services and respite care which means that now this elderly parent will now have to provided support for their adult child 24/7 until they die.   

Presently the government is doing this to a lot of families. These people have saved us all billions in tax by caring for a family member with disabilities or taken in a relative after the family home has broken down. 

Child services funds have a higher degree of protection so adult services for people with disabilities are cut deep.

I hate this whole scheme. Over the past 30 years car technology has increased so much. Disc brakes all around rather than drum brakes, improved tyre technology, bonnets that protect pedestrians and we're even seeing the introduction of radar that brakes for you in an emergency.

For London Boroughs, Labour and Liberal Democrat boroughs received a 7% average cut, while Conservatives received 6.6% average.

For Manchester and Merseyside Boroughs, Labour councils received an average 6.7% cut, while the one Conservative Borough (Trafford) was cut 7.3%.

For other Metropolitan Boroughs, Labour councils received an average 6.5% cut, while the one Conservative Borough (Solihull) was cut 6.7%.

For non-Metropolitan districts, Labour councils received an average 9.9% cut while Conservative councils were cut an average of 10.2%. Liberal Democrats were cut 10% on average. However, the Conservatives hold the vast majority of non-Metropolitan districts, so again, this affects the numbers.

Her counter point was that if someone's child needs a new pair of shoes because they've outgrown their current ones, and they have no money until their next (modest) paycheque, borrowing £20 at 100% APR for two weeks should be a viable option.  The APR keeps the loaner in business because of the high rate of defaulting, and that in turn allows them to offer loans to people who are desperate.

Now that's a specific example that serves to support her point, but was apparently not untypical.  Yes, there are people who use services like this in irresponsible ways, but there is (unfortunately) a need.  Any predatory practices should be abolished and legislated away, however.

The real problem is that we have people living below the poverty line, both in work and out of it.

&gt; Are you blind, or purposefully idiotic?

I might ask the same of you. You seem willing to dismiss someone without bothering to read their posts. The smarter move would be to not have commented at all. 

&gt; It's a free country. Political speech is not restrained. I can't imagine why you would think it correct to stop someone for hosting a media network.

Do you oppose our governments efforts to take down things like the Al Qaeda newsletter and websites and other extremist sites which promote using violence against various governments? How about those which contain genuine instructions on how to make bombs and best maximise civilian deaths?

Note I'm not indicating my own stance on the limits of free speech, I'm just probing where you stand. Barada TV has been broadcasting a call to arms in Syria since 2006, their main focus has been on using the falsified stories from the British SOHR to outrage the Syrian population into a violent uprising. They aren't calling for ""peaceful protests"" etc. I just wonder how you feel when you are the victim of such political speech. 

&gt;  Are you suggesting we ignore them?

That's not really a valid question. America, Turkey and Britain have been deeply involved in promoting a Syrian insurgency *since before the protests started*. We could *start* to ignore them I guess.

&gt; beyond a few half baked conspiracy theories

[Leaked official US state department memos covered in the WP](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-17/world/35262231_1_syrian-opposition-diplomatic-cables-syrian-authorities) are ""half baked conspiracy theories""? The US funding for ""democracy programs"" in Syria [is on their official budget books](http://2002-2009-mepi.state.gov/61533.htm). The only question is how deeply the UK government is involved, we are far more secretive about these things than the Americans. Hosting the bulk of the rebels media arm ""strongly hints"" towards us being heavily involved  in something we have considerable experience and past-form in. 

Frankly the only ""conspiracy theory"" here is the collective denial that our government does this exact sort of thing routinely. Just how many ""regimes"" have we ""changed"" in the last ten years?

God, dozens of movies, during that period ""modern architecture"" was the cheap go-to for movie makers unwilling to build huge sets. Here's a quick list off the top of my head:

* [A Clockwork Orange](https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/tag/a-clockwork-orange/) (probably the best example)
* [Soylent Green](https://lh3.ggpht.com/_s_30zQFJp4g/TNTVqM6ye_I/AAAAAAAAm7s/xFthjhq-eQc/s400/Soylent+Green+350.jpg)

* [Brazil](http://andrewsidea.wordpress.com/2008/07/11/a-sentence-on-brazil/)
* [Robocop](http://forum.dallasmetropolis.com/showthread.php/2918-Robocop-Dallas?p=324465&amp;viewfull=1#post324465)

They'd swap it about a bit, sometimes the older terrace houses represent the ""old world"" with modern buildings being ""the future"" e.g. Soylent Green.

It's the planning and layout. The modernist architects had all sorts of nice ideas about what made community happen,  but they were not based on empirical evidence. For example they designed lots of walkways leading to dead ends with little micro parks, which turned into muggers' paradise. Plot crimes against the number of endpoints of the paths and walkways and you get some very stark unambiguous results.

Better to teach children, in literature or English, that all text is biased. At least that is what I was taught at school - and it allows me to analyse any prose for the author's motivations. As every adult *should* be equipped to do.

I think it is sad that The Guardian has published this story almost as if it should be shoved down the throats of children instead. No. The Guardian, The BBC, The Daily Mail, or The Sun, it doesn't matter the source, even if it is a McDonalds advertisement! Children need to dig into the motivation behind the communication to get a better understanding of why they are being told what they are being told.

I weep for any person that takes The Guardian as gospel instead of being highly suspicious of its motivations. Just as I weep for any person that takes The Daily Mail as gospel instead of being highly suspicious of its motivations.

Ideally this means Sterling should be at his best for a good 3-4 years more than some other players which means it makes sense to develop him. He could be a key player for a number of years but right now he's still learning. What I will say is we don't even have to look outside the club for examples of young players who have had poor starts to their Liverpool careers and blossomed a couple of years later.

But yes, as above, I'd also have Skrtel centre and Sahko left, with Agger on the bench.  It's hard to know who to play if all on on best form really, as the current back three do seem to compliment each other.  Skrtel doesn't get enough credit for his ball playing ability, but I'd probably go with Agger as the central of the three if all were at their finest.

Also, I'd still go for Lucas over Henderson in the centre, but that is the hardest decision I feel -- leaving Henderson out.  
What I'm loving, actually, is that we have the choice between two players who play that role to such a high standard.  As above too, that we have a problem trying to pick our best bench-- now that's a problem we haven't had in a long time...  

I think our first 11 is as strong really as anyone's.  The only people I'd switch if I were able to pick, say, from the rest of the premier league (and keeping that formation) would be Baines at LWB, Dembele for Lucas (I think Dembele is highly underrated, he's an absolute monster in CM (although having Ya Ya would be a delight - If Gerrard wasn't Gerrard I'd go for a midfield of Dembele and Ya Ya)), and, as much as he is beautiful and exciting and cool and deserving of the fanfare, I'd probably still have either Mata, Silva or Ozil ahead of Coutinho.  They just have the extra experience, extra consistency.  Saying that of course, give Cutie 3 more years and we could have one of the best 10's in the world.  Again, at a push, I'd pick Mata of the aforemention alternatives: he offers the greatest all round threat I think.  
And, maybe Kompany instead of Toure, if he'd stop getting injured.  But then Kolo is Kolo, so you know.. And, although a fully firing RVP is the most machine like thing you can have as a goal-scorer, I think Daniel, at his best, offers just as much in his own way, so I'd keep Dan up top.  So, what's that, 3-4 players who have better alternatives in their positions in the league?  Not too shabby.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"Well, I'm no expert, but these are the two main points that people bring up are:

* Cost - The EU costs Britain something like £50m per day (according to UKIP, pinch of salt and all that), and some people view this as far too much. However, this does not take into account things like increased trade, which is much more difficult to quantify. So, I think this one is a bit of a poor point.

* Independence - This is the main reason that people thing we should leave the EU. They claim that being members of the EU, we have a lot less control over the laws we make in certain areas, like in justice, or foreign trade. Also, there are a lot of unelected people within EU bureaucracy who hold influential positions. They say that the British people, or perhaps more importantly, British politicians, should have the final say over what happens in this country, not foreigners. 

  I'm not really fussed over this point. In my eyes, it seems the only people who will benefit from having more power is the politicians, not the people, and where they have clashed with things with the EU (such as Human Rights, I know not technically the EU, but they tend to get lumped together by anti-EU groups), I tend to side with the EU over our government. I don't think it matters whether a British person or a French person decides some of my laws, as long as they are elected by the people who will come under the effect of those laws. This is one area where I do have problems with the EU, but I don't think this is a reason for leaving completely, rather reforms within the EU.

Well this should be interesting, the event is in Old Market which is also an area where there are a lot of gay venues. It's not an area where fascists are likely to be very welcome.

I think the EDL (the asshole one) might meet more resistance than they expect. This is a pretty open minded city in many respects and has two universities with students just back, I think once word gets around there are going to be some crowds that night.

&gt;The figures are the first to confirm that Labour councils are making bigger cuts and appear to bolster claims by David Cameron and Nick Clegg that Labour councils are cutting and then blaming the coalition for ""politically motivated"" reasons. However, the Guardian's analysis also reveals that Labour authorities are suffering the worst budget cuts, with a 7% reduction in ""spending power"" on average, compared with 5% in Tory areas and 6% in Lib Dem areas.

Both of these arguments have pretty good responses too.

Nobody wants to pay import duties in the UK and then again if they want to go over to France.

The problem with this is that it means that we won't have a say in how Europe is run, but we'll *still* be bound by it (if we have a treaty with Europe over import duties, they'll set the limits and we have way too much to lose (50% of our exports are in the EU + people will only trade with us if we have free movement of goods with the EU) to try and negotiate).",0,1381022572,null,0,false,0,ccluolc,t3_1nt6h8,t1_ccluolc,t3_1nt6h8,null,1429231643,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;The vast majority of buses have disabled access.

Yeah great, except there are very good reasons why the very disabled don't take buses, here are a few off the top of my head:
 
* Buses are loud, busy environments, which are extremely difficult for anyone on the Autism spectrum or with similar mental impairments. 

* Increased risk of being the victim of crime. You'd be amazed how many people are simply grade A shitbags and have no sympathy for the disabled.

* The additional time required can potentially hold up the bus, increasing the risk of abuse and other crimes (people are bloody impatient).

* Buses don't always go exactly where you have to go. People with physical disabilities cannot necessarily walk between their home + destination and the nearest bus stops. 

&gt;And forgive me for being blunt but it's not like the disabled have anywhere to get in a hurry.

Well apart from myriad medical appointments and having to turn up to the Job Centre to confirm that yes, they do still suffer from severe disabilities. ",0,1381022875,null,0,false,0,cclurs9,t3_1ns1lt,t1_cclurs9,t1_cclm2xo,null,1429231601,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Aside from that it's nice that we're winning but we could have asked for more from this game. The first half wasn't really acceptable. Assou-Ekotto looked uninterested the entire game and ran only as much as he absolutely had to. Kranjcar wasn't exactly inspiring either.

So far we've only really played teams we should be beating. And it's good that we are, but we haven't been *really* tested yet. That's coming up when we go to Burnley, which isn't far away now.

If they are so intent on seeking out safety and freedom in the UK, why do we hear reports of them failing to integrate with UK life, the invariable Criminals that slip into the UK under the guise of Asylum, the criminals abusing the HRA to stay in this country despite not caring about its laws or accepting responsility od being a 'good citizen'?

Surely immigration should be a concern when you find areas of towns turn into 'Little Poland' etc or (in the case of Slough) whole neighbourhoods being turned into Slum properties with overcrowding and people living in sheds with limited facilities?

Surely there must be a limit where we go 'Hold on, we genuinely can't handle more people in the UK, limited housing, education places, GPs can't cope with the increase in population.

I get it is all well trying to do good by everyone else seeking help and assistance, but when it is to the detriment of native citizens, surely we have to look at the bigger picture?
