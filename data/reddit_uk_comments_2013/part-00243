true,tidder-wave,null,null,"This minisode possibly plants the seed for what Moffat has hinted at: writing away the ""13 regenerations"" limit. Here's how the theory goes.

The planet that the [8th Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Doctor), played by [Paul McGann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGann) (whose birthday is today), crashed into is Karn, which is home to the Sisterhood of Karn, the ladies in the red dresses. 

The Sisterhood of Karn are related to the story of [Morbius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbius_%28Doctor_Who%29#Morbius), a renegade Time Lord, and first appeared in [*The Brain of Morbius*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brain_of_Morbius), featuring the 4th Doctor. However, the 8th Doctor had two audio play episodes, produced by Big Finish, that featured the Sisterhood as well: *Sisters of the Flame* and [*Vengeance of Morbius*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vengeance_of_Morbius). Everybody is now saying that the reappearance of the Sisterhood, plus the mention of many of the 8th Doctor's companions in the Big Finish, has made the Big Finish stories canon.

This [io9 article](http://observationdeck.io9.com/does-night-of-the-doctor-feature-the-strangest-return-i-1463641343) explains why the Sisterhood of Karn is significant. Basically, they have something called the Elixir of Life, which helps to ease a Time Lord through a particularly stressful regeneration. I think that, in the minisode, they've been portrayed to have knowledge superseding Time Lord science, and there are claims that they have eternal life, so this may be the game changer that'd allow the writers to write off, or at least bend, the 13 regenerations limit imposed on The Doctor by the Time Lords a long long time ago.",0,1384450087,null,0,1384450453,0,cdea17j,t3_1qmi82,t1_cdea17j,t3_1qmi82,null,1428660921,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

secondly, these sort of questions are really difficult to answer.  it can be quite dangerous to offer advice or opinions to someone without knowing a lot more information.  i am an investment professional, and if i suggested you invest in company X and you invest your student loan and get kicked out of uni when company x goes bust, then i could get fucked for leading you down that road. i would guess that doesn't describe you, but i don't know what does.

the key questions you need to ask yourself are:

* what am i trying to achieve by investing (or saving) this money? do you think you might like to build up a house deposit or something?

* what would happen if i don't achieve the above? what would happen/how would i feel if the investments don't work out and i lose the money?

That was really the ""problem"" with it. 

The movie was pretty much tailor-made for Doctor Who fans. People who watch it today, after becoming fans of the new show and possibly familiarizing themselves with the classics, look a lot more favorably on it than how it was received back then.

The production however intended the movie to act as a pilot for a potential new TV show, and then decided not to do the show when a made-for-fans movie failed to attract a new audience. The failure wasn't so much in the movie itself, but more so in the disconnect between its business purpose and its creative purpose.",0,1384450576,null,0,false,0,cdea952,t3_1qlyhw,t1_cdea952,t1_cde8drx,null,1428660818,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Go ahead and watch the new stuff first, you'll probably realize that each Doctor is sorta independent of each other. There are connections between them of course. But the writers make it a point to reintroduce things with every new Doctor (Or companion). And the classic series is much the same. 

As for what Classic Who to watch. I'll warn you, there are 97 missing episodes from the first two Doctors. Which causes some problems for people thinking they will just start from the beginning. Starting with the third Doctor (Also the transition to color TV) Every episode exists, so many people start Classic Who with him. 

However, most fans think of the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) to be THE Doctor. And it's not to hard to see why. The show really hit a creative stride in it's fourteenth season. (Think about that for a second, what shows get fourteen seasons of ups and downs before hitting their all time best?) So others recommend to start there. I recommend that you get a look at 7 of the Classic Doctors, find the ones you like most, and start with them.

(PS. The biggest issue most people have with Classic Who is pacing. 4-6 20 minute episodes instead of 1 40 minute one does drag things down a bit. But that's 1960/70's television for you.

Check the trade-in price checker on game.co.uk and then again on cex's webuy.com. If the prices are higher on cex's website, show the prices to game and they will beat them by Â£1 in credit. That way you get the better trade prices and game's better selection on games.

So, investing with HL is nice and simple, and can be fun watching things change. Here's my ""advice"" from some mistakes I made:

* Look out for initial charges
* Some things have a different buy and sell price, this means as soon as you buy you've lost value and have to gain it again.
* Look out for platform charges

Grab this list: http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/index-tracker-funds/view-index-tracker-funds and go for something that looks interesting with low fees.

Also consider starting a pension. Although you've not paid tax, you can still get tax relief on up to Â£3600 (if you invest 2880 the government will top it up to 3600).

So there are two (well, really three) jumping-on points for McGann's audios:

- For Charley (the 4-ep serials), start with *Storm Warning* and work your way forward in release order.

(You can also start with *Mary's Story* from *The Company of Friends*, then *The Silver Turk*, *The Witch from the Well* and *Army of Death* before moving on to *Storm Warning*, since Mary's stuff technically takes place before *Storm Warning* even though it came out after Charley's last Eighth Doctor audio. This is the ""third"" jumping-on point. These can be listened to whenever, though.)

- For Lucie (the ""modern"" style), start with *Blood of the Daleks*. These are actually structured like seasons.

Yeah, it'll be paid by the consumer. But it won't make up a huge proportion of the cost of power - perhaps a couple of pounds per MWh. Modern LWRs should be much easier to decommission than 1950s style magnox reactors, and produce vastly more energy over their lifetimes as well.

&gt;And as for my calculation, the British coastline is about 3000km long. So if we're aiming for about 50GW of nuclear then I think a plant every 50-100km isn't too bad of a first order guess. Sizewell B gives out, what, 1.2GW? 3000/50 = 1 every 60km, but obviously numbers will change a bit.

We wouldn't need that many. Most sites in France have four reactors, several across the world have six plus. You could reasonably fit three or four large LWRs at each of Sizewell, Hinkley Point, Wylfa, Oldbury, Sellafield, Heysham, Hartlepool and Bradwell. Hunterston and Torness are excellent sites if the Scots don't split. Somewhere in the region of Dungeness and Winfrith would also probably work. That's 12 existing coastal sites that have or have had nuclear power stations at some point, and could each host 4GW+ quite comfortably - most have new grid connection agreements for somewhat less than that already.",0,1384455313,null,0,false,0,cdecc25,t3_1qlvci,t1_cdecc25,t1_cde7rd1,null,1428659848,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

MLK was a minister who drew upon his Christian beliefs to motivate himself and those around him, his speeches were filled with references to his (and his followers) beliefs. You cannot study MLK as a man and not discuss how his religion affected him without either changing history or taking an incredibly narrow view.

Likewise Ghandi was heavily influenced by religion, drawing upon Jainism as inspiration for his policy of non-violent protest.

To get a job in the UK, an employer needs to advertise the position to *everyone* in the UK and the EU first. And even so, the border agency only gives out 20,000 VIAS's per year, and prioritise jobs that are on the [shortage occupation list](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/business-sponsors/points/sponsoringmigrants/employingmigrants/shortageoccupationlist/).

Either that, or you need to get a job with a US firm which has a UK office, and apply for a transfer. The company will have to sponsor you, but it is a lot easier than getting in the former way. 

Theres simply no other way to work in the UK. If you come over on a holiday VISA (a working-holiday VISA is not available to US citizens) you **are not permitted to work**, and if you do and are caught you are deported and banned from entering the UK for ten years. Even on this VISA, you need to absolutely prove to the UK Border Agency you have enough savings to support yourself, and can only stay here for a few months.  

If you have UK citizenship through a parent, then moving is a lot easier. But without it, your chances are slim-to-none. ",0,1384455395,null,0,1384455914,0,cdecd9r,t3_1qmqky,t1_cdecd9r,t3_1qmqky,null,1428659832,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

The way it works is every single unit of electricity that is used by a person who's supply comes from a 100% green tarriff, the company has to prove to Ofgem that they have generated and/or purchased that from an entirely renewable source.

The UK brags of being the centre of finance and that's suggested as HMRC's response to Bitcoin! Seems unlikely that will be the end of it. There's no reason they couldn't oblige businesses to charge VAT for good, as now.

If we had a productive economy, perhaps they would be more keen to see Bitcoin adopted for the speed of money that would encourage.

[The Eighth Doctor.](http://www.david-tennant-news.com/wp-content/uploads/images/easyblog_images/63/PaulMcGann_20130831-121004_1.jpg)

Paul McGann played the [Eighth Doctor](http://www.bbcamerica.com/doctor-who/wp-content/blogs.dir/18/files/2013/07/doctor-who-photos-eighth-doctor-01.jpg) in the 1996 TV movie, which was an attempt at re-launching the show. It performed poorly in the US (it was a US/UK co-production) and had poor reviews, so the proposed series starring McGann as the Doctor didn't materialize.

We never actually saw McGann regenerate into Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor - this minisode finally depicts McGann's regeneration, and explains why we didn't see him regenerate into Eccleston.

&gt; **Why is everyone talking about a Big Finish?**

Big Finish Productions produces dramatic audio. Like radio shows, but mostly they're released as digital downloads and on CD.

Before the series came back in 2005, Big Finish Productions was given license by the BBC to produce audio dramas featuring classic Doctors. In 1999 they released their first one, *The Sirens of Time*, featuring the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors. Big Finish's audios are performed by a full cast, including the original actors for the Doctors and companions. Tom Baker (the Fourth) refused to participate until a couple years ago.

In 2001, Big Finish began a continuation from the TV movie with *Storm Warning*, the first one to feature Paul McGann's return as the Eighth Doctor, and it introduced his ""first"" companion, Charley Pollard. These adventures were essentially *the* current *Doctor Who* until 2005. McGann still, to this day, plays the Eighth Doctor in ongoing audio adventures, bridging the gap between the 1996 TV movie and the 2005 revival.

&gt; **Who are the names he listed?**

The names are the Eighth Doctor's companions from his Big Finish audio adventures - Charley Pollard, C'rizz, Lucie Miller, Tamsin Drew, and Molly O'Sullivan, who is his ""current"" companion in the audios, from *Dark Eyes: The Great War* onward.

There are three audio companions not mentioned - Mary Shelley (yes, *that* Mary Shelley) and Samson &amp; Gemma Griffin. The latter two were depicted as being ""forgotten"" companions in a way, and never had an actual story while they were companions, so that's why they aren't mentioned. Why he didn't mention Mary is beyond me - maybe because the Mary audios reference Eight's companions from the novels and comics.

He also neglected to mention Grace Holloway, his ""companion"" from the 1996 TV movie, but as she declined his offer to travel with him and we never heard from her again, I don't really consider her a companion anyway.

&gt; **So, what's the significance?**

The significance of all this is that it essentially canonizes the audio adventures, which had always been on murky ground as far as whether or not they ""count."" Of course, *Doctor who* doesn't have official canon, but this is as close as it gets.

That, and it proves that John Hurt's ""Warrior"" is an incarnation between McGann's Eighth Doctor and Eccleston's Ninth Doctor.",0,1384457881,null,0,1384458755,0,cdedh7i,t3_1qm5z0,t1_cdedh7i,t3_1qm5z0,null,1428659314,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

That's good, a lot of people invest money they can't really afford to lose. Not willing to is fine, but you should never invest money that you need for, say, rent as *any* investment can fail.

&gt; Sorry can you elaborate more about the tax relief part?

So if you're a basic rate taxpayer, you get 25% added on to whatever you put inside a SIPP pension. If you're not a basic rate taxpayer then you get this anyway but you're limited to putting in Â£2800 (resulting in Â£3600 being added to your pension). You are free to invest this as you like, and you can have more than one pension. If you're a higher rate tax payer, you can claim back even more (so that a Â£10k investment costs you Â£6k)

The complicating factor is that you already have a pension so may have used some of this allowance already.

Defensively, he's solid and rarely gets beat one on one and he can run all day. Having him and GJ playing well in our 3-5-2 will be scary for anyone we're up against, and I think they're the perfect players for the system.


The problem with Jose is his consistency. At times he can be the most frustrating player on the pitch, constantly losing possession and playing poor passes. Also his crossing can leave a lot to be desired, but thats okay because crosses into the box are not an important part of our game plan and we don't have strikers who thrive off aerial challenges and attacking balls into the box. If he can figure how to consistently play on a high level for a whole season, he'll be up there with the likes of Baines and Evra as the best LB in the league.

He is a first rate tackler. He's got the strength and the speed to win most balls that come his way. Everytime a winger is trying to run onto a pass on the left, I'm always EXTREMELY confident that he will shield them out and win the ball. Its seriously almost a given. I can't remember the last time he lost a shoulder to shoulder battle. He also is great against opponents with the ball. Just a good tackler all around. BUT defending is more than tackling. Tactically he is lacking, that shows in his attacking and his positioning. Sometimes he will be out of place on the sidelines. It doesn't happen often, but when it does it usually requires lucas to come in and help out or Agger to help out which usually means enrique has to shift into the box. His biggest problem is when he is in the box. both Him and Johnson have TERRIBLE awareness and reactions in the box. Both of them lose their man in the box and just have all around terrible positioning. Usually these mistakes end in conceding goals. This isn't TOO big of an issue because usually the fullbacks aren't in the box. Typically we only see these problems when we're pinned on the counter or against set pieces. 

Attacking wise, he seems to only know how to lob the ball. Most of the times, this is frustrating, but we've already seen a few moments where it comes off and resulted in goals. 

I rate him well. I think he's an above average fullback. Maybe cissokhos recent performances have to do with that. I think his defensive displays out wide make up for his lack of attacking sense and even for his huge errors in the box. He's a confident person, and thats a good trait to have in any side.

This is what Steven Moffat was hinting at when he said there was something we missed in the old episodes. I have come to this conclusion: During the same serial, the Doctor is revealed to have had 8 incarnations BEFORE William Hartnell, meaning Tom Baker was actually his 12th regeneration. He was fatally wounded, and the Sisters gave him a dose of the Elixir of Life, which allows for healing and regeneration BEYOND TIME LORD LAWS.

Take a look at your previous salary and look across your outgoings so you can figure out what you require (don't forget the benefits from your previous role) once you have figured out your salary figure out the net salary (many websites online do this) there is no point working out your salary to find out you can't pay your bills after being paid.

Most of the world accepts the gay lifestyle as much as the straight lifestyle so this shouldn't be weird or strange.  Perhaps you are more used to modern day US tv that doesn't show this as much.   If so that is understandable.  However the are countless shows NOT from the US that show gay characters, gay relationships and gay actors and it isn't the least bit strange or ruins a show at all.  I imagine RTD had a hand in this when rebooting the series and for that, as a straight white american male, AM GRATEFUL.  It isn't something to hide behind or think is weird, gratuitous or ruins a show.  You need to step outside more often.

Also if you are here to blame girls, or any sort of trendy pop culture as the reason you think the show is in decline, then you really have no idea who the people are behind this show  and who writes it.  They wouldn't give one. single. shit. about a trendy popular series of books or movies in the US and have it affect their show.  Everything you have said in your post, spirit and mystery aside are when you break it down, ignorant.

edit: I'd also like to add that most of hollywood is gay, so having straight actors play gay characters and gay actors play straight actors is the definition of norm since the invention of film and tv - the fact that you see this on screen and it bothers you speaks more about you than it does a television show.",0,1384464038,null,0,false,0,cdegadh,t3_1qn4ym,t1_cdegadh,t3_1qn4ym,null,1428657932,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Rollovers result in surges of ticket sales and keep interest in the lotteries going long term. This in turn generates more money for charities. If you skim money off of winnings everytime there's a big event or an especially good cause, eventually people will stop thinking the lottery is worth playing and sales will fall off.

Plus, donating that prize money is almost certainly illegal. When people bought their tickets, they bought it under the condition that a certain portion went to charity and a certain portion goes to the prize fund.

I enjoyed most of them apart from *The Catcher in the Rye.* From that list/graphic/thing I'd recommend *Watership Down*, but also another book by Richard Adams called *The Plague Dogs*. Its about two dogs that manage to escape from an animal testing facility in the north of England and have to live wild out on the moors, meeting various other animals. Its easily as good as *Watership Down* methinks, and equally sad.

Currently I'm reading *Prince Rupert: The Last Cavalier*; a biography of Prince Rupert (nephew to King Charles I of England and cousin to King Charles II) a German prince who fought in the English Civil War and did loads of other interesting pirate type stuff in the West Indies and Africa in the 2nd half of the 17th Century. 

It's by Charles Spencer, brother of Princess Diana. 

Edit: i had no idea what *Dominion* was, but clicked your linky and it sounds awesome; there's another book set in alternative history Britain called [*48*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'48) by James Herbert you might want to check out once you finish that monster of a book.

true,saitir,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"You have to be realistic about canon and non-canon issues with any franchise.

The first issue is that licensing doesn't make something canon.  It just makes it 'legal'.

Secondly, when there are Film/TV sources the consideration behind script decisions is much bigger than those around novels/plays.  There is a much higher level of scrutiny, and typically much less 'fangasm' bleed through.  Thus extremely fan-cool things can happen in novels that would never be allowed on TV - not just because of budgets, but because while cool, they're kind of cheesey.

Finally, as twcsata says above, there are always levels of canon.  Ultimately the franchise owner might state some lower level is canon, but that doesn't mean that they are obliged to tip-toe around things set up in those lower levels of canon.  Lame example: If novel A establishes that the TARDIS dies if a Timelord doesn't enter it for a year and a day, that will not stop an episode of the TV series showing the Doctor unearthing the TARDIS after it has been buried for 10,000 years and finding it in perfect working order.

This doesn't mean that anything in novels or big finish isn't canon, it just means that canon-until-proven-otherwise is an absolute essential part of any layered canon system.

Although, many of the novel writers have of course worked on the TV show at various points, so there's going to be plenty of respect.

Is Enrique a liability?  Not really.  He is prone to mental lapses, and I don't think he plays using a footballing mind--he is pure instinct.  This shows more often on offense, though, for me.  He tends to get too far forward when it isn't prudent and tries to make a decisive pass when he can't.

Overall, he is a good option for us, and probably the highest caliber FB we can attract at this point without taking a serious gamble.  He is proven in the EPL and he works hard.

However, because they had essentially become obsolete at that point and the court found that the general public associated the blue box with the TARDIS rather than the real police box, they ruled in favour of the BBC, gave them the trademark and fined the police Â£800+costs! So now the BBC owns the police box and I'm pretty certain that Stef Coburn can piss off.

The general consensus about the show is this: the writers are awful. Episodes often repeat the same plot in disguise, there is little to no character development, and the [status quo](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod) is upheld seemingly at all costs. (Warning: TV Tropes.) Also, the season 5 series finale was awful and rushed.

That being said, it's still my favorite show. The actors/actresses are all incredible and have amazing chemistry together (Colin/Bradley and Colin/Katie especially). Just wait till the drama starts and you see them dealing with the heavy scenes. (eg. Arthur in S2E08 and Gwen in S4E09). Plus, there's always the sweet, sweet drug of fanfiction when you finish the whole thing.

As for your questions:

1) Because Merlin has no where else to go. At least in Camelot, he can get guidance with his magic from Gaius.

2) Eh, no idea. I always thought it was a bit ridiculous that he even trusted the dragon in the first place. But that is a rant best saved for another time.

3) Destiny? Seriously though, this is one example of how the writers are lacking. Because it's his capital-d **Destiny** to protect Arthur, and he just accepts it. Also, even though he has to keep it hidden, Merlin *has* been using magic his whole life. He has practice with being subtle. (A bit debatable, but eh, whatever.)

4) Just his general personality.

The spoiler hounds - which were the ones who knew about McGann's minisode - have said that Hurt is partially there because Moffat wants to address the regeneration limit.  Hence: Hurt is the 9th incarnation, Eccleston is the 10th incarnation, Tennant is both the 11th and 12th - Journey's End counts as another regen, Smith is 13th.  Xmas Special is all about the Doctor realizing he's at his last incarnation.  Apparently, Smith's death will be of similar circumstance to Hartnell's reason for death. So, when Smith actually Regens - it will be explosive - as the spoilierhounds have said - because he is breaking through the regeneration limit barrier.

 &gt;70% of trips in London are under 5 miles; 42% are under 2 miles. So clearly, a large majority of trips in London are â in principle â cycleable. Indeed, around 50% of all London trips are between 1 and 5 miles long, the kind of trip length ideally suited to the bike, rather than walking or driving.

&gt; We also know â from Transport for Londonâs own data â that a huge proportion of car trips in London are exceptionally short.

&gt; **67% of all car journeys by Londoners are under 5km (3 miles)**. Despite Londonâs size, car trips remain, for the most part, very short. Again, these are trips of a length that can â and undoubtedly should â be cycled, or walked, if conditions are attractive.

Yet it's still the cars that are given priority over people.

If our roads are so narrow and tight, it's about time we removed the largest things from them that are often making unessential trips.  Removal of lanes, more one way systems and more smaller roads closed off for cars.

&gt; This is a city run by the Green Party and it can't get good cycle lanes in place.

That says a lot more about the party than it does the ability to build good infrastructure.

Ultimately we can make a lot of our roads safer and faster for everyone.  It involves stopping pandering to slow dangerous cars and start giving more of the room to people and bicycles.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUE1ajizdEI

I see a lot of two lanes roads there, plus lots of space given for parked cars.  Remove twin lanes, remove parking.  Increase cycle lanes and pedestrian areas.  Get those hundreds of cars clogging the road, slowing people down and polluting the place off the road.

Especially since its hardly likely to be useful for the next 20 years at least when the few that decide go in to politics, and then the few of them that become leaders. Why bother monitoring them in any special way, it isn't pragmatic, it isn't rational, it certainly isn't cheap. The intelligence agencies have their jobs to do and with cuts, I doubt they are overly funded. 

Aggregate data is relatively cheap if you can acquire it because you don't have to have anyone sifting through it. It just takes up storage space. Targeted close surveillance on potential future leaders at Oxford and Cambridge would be unbelievably costly. The difference between stretching a net across a river and trying to catch one specific individual fish. And things which are unbelievably costly, have to get signed off. No one would ever sign that off because it isn't useful. It provides nothing, it provides no security immediately or long term, it may not even provide anything to ""blackmail"" with, and even in the lose chance that it does, that wouldn't be useful within the next 20 years and the spy agencies can manipulate politicians just as easily enough with scare tactics. 

Imagine someone at GCHQ going to their boss and saying, right I know we've had our budgets cut, and I know you're a bit worried about the rise of China and Russia, especially their digital powers, as well as domestic and international terrorism, but what we really need is to put millions of pounds towards gathering intelligence on some PPE students at Oxbridge, because a few of them have a slim chance of one day being in politics, and maybe a couple of them might become leaders, so its certainly worth getting their emails so we can bring up the 2/10 they shagged on saturday if they don't do exactly what we want in 2033. 

Or, would said man who works at GCHQ put those resources towards other ends, and lets say GCHQ were in the habbit of trying to manipulate our leaders to their wicked dastardly ends because they are evil illuminati geniuses twiddling their fingers with glee sitting on bean bags with 'taxpayers property' written on the outside filled with crisp twenty pound notes. Lets say that was the case; wouldn't it be a lot easier, effective and cheaper to do their actual job until 2033, and then in 2033, when they are trying to nudge politicians to do what they want to do, over-exaggerate any threats at that time to an extent where an politician has no choice.

The idea they would specifically target oxbridge is a complete guess, based on practically nothing. ",0,1384469301,null,0,false,0,cdeinc5,t3_1qm379,t1_cdeinc5,t1_cdeeqa7,null,1428656831,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; All Commonwealth soldiers with at least four years service can apply to the Home Office for the right to remain in the UK within 28 days of leaving the army. However, Mr Lacanivalu had mistakenly assumed he automatically qualified for residency when he left.
He claims that it was several months later that he received from the Army information about the need to apply for permission to remain.

So leaves the Army in 2010, they tell him the important information *months* later but it's summer of **2013** before he tries sorting it out, at which point immigration tell him to sling his hook. Few months later he pops up on their radar again so they take him into custody.

I don't see how being a soldier gets you out of sorting your shit out the same way anyone else wanting into the country has to. You get guaranteed citizenship after you leave the army (if you file in 28 days), they fucked that up and he didn't get it for months but surely if he filed then it would have all been fine. He didn't though, he spent a year not doing anything about it and missed his window... so tough shit? 

Also the emotional 'hero' plea shite at the end rubs me up the wrong way. *""He got shot at, he saw people die!""*... what the fuck do you expect when you join the army? Shouldn't give you a get out of jail free card for the rest of your bloody life especially when the reason you're in jail is because you can't be arsed to file the paperwork to get the citizenship you now claim is so bloody important to you.

Can't stand 'special case' pleads like this where what's being dragged in has fuck all to do with the matter at hand. It's not like the reason he missed the deadline was because he was *in* Afghanistan, or in a hospital bed recovering from a wound he got fighting. He spent a year just being a bloke in Birmingham not doing what he should be doing. His fault.

**EDIT** Also, the jingoistic jizzfest in the comments absolutely boggles my mind. *""Fuck the government, it lets Polish wasters in but not WAR HERO'S, where is the compassion?*"". 

Note how compassion only applies to people who willingly become paid weaponry *for the government* and not for the Polish immigrant who more than likely cleans the fucking bogs for a pittance, without complaint.

When those women revived him, I assume he was no longer capable of regenerating on his own anymore since he had technically died. He was only going to be alive for 4 minutes in order to take the elixir which I think was Timelord ""technology"".

Think of it like vampirism where they drink vampire blood, die with it in their system, then they revive with hunger and have to either drink blood to complete the transformation or to not drink and die.

true,SmartLX,null,null,"At the very beginning of the revived series in 2005, Eccleston's Doctor was fresh from the Time War where he saved the universe by wiping out both the Daleks and the Time Lords (nearly, in both cases).  Since the last Doctor we'd seen was #8, Paul McGann in the 1996 TV movie, as far as we knew it was either McGann's Doctor or Eccleston's Doctor who did this awful deed.

Now the picture is a lot clearer.  McGann's Doctor was a conscientious objector to the war right up until this event, when he chose to regenerate into the kind of man who would fight: John Hurt's ""War Doctor"".  David Tennant's and Matt Smith's Doctors may well be rediscovering this part of their own history in the upcoming special, or at least reluctantly reliving it while Clara and Rose discover it anew.

The biggest impact on the overall lore is that #9 wasn't Eccleston, it was John Hurt.  That makes Eccleston #10, Tennant #11, Smith #12 (and a big fat liar, but then, rule #1: the Doctor lies) and Peter Capaldi about to be #13.  According to decades-old canon he''ll be all out of regenerations then, but the fact that the Time Lords controlled this limitation may allow him more.

1.  It's probably best to buy Apple kit from an Apple store (online or retail) as they are big ticket electronic items and relatively easy to scam people with.  This applies equally to anything else small and easily returned (mobile phones, etc.) and just avoid ebay altogether especially if someone is selling a retina iPad for Â£100... it's a brick in a box (figuratively or literally).

2. If you must by a big ticket item in a supermarket then no matter who the damn widget is a gift for OPEN THE BOX.  Make sure everything that is supposed to be in there is present and accounted for whilst you are still in the store and thus being recorded on the stores CCTV system.  That way if something is missing they can't accuse YOU of pulling a fast one.

3.  If when the shop assistant returns with your merch and the factory seals are broken and you were buying a brand new item, ask for another one. Tesco will not replace the factory seals when restocking a returned item, although a factory refurbished unit will have replacement seals.

Edit:  Even buying Apple kit at an Apple store they won't break the seals on the box to do setup (if you want them to) until you've inspected the box and told them you're happy it's a new unit.

Edit 2: And once again Reddit shows its true idiocy.  Fuck checking shit just buy the shiny, so don't come crying to me when you end up with a P-p-p-p-p-powerbook or Claypad.

It is a chance to grill and test you in the best way possible. If there is anything in your personal statement that they are curious about, they may ask about that. In other words, BS on your PS, like most of the students I interviewed with, but make sure that you have read, and understood, everything you say you did by the time the interview comes around.

Aside from the chance to establish that your Personal Statement wasn't lies, it is also a chance to see how you learn. They don't care about what you know. They will teach that. I was taking multivariable calculus last year, and now I am studying how to take basic derivatives along with everybody else. What matters is how you learn. Their goal in the interviews is to push you until you break, and then see what happens. How do you respond when you are in a high stress situation and this is one of the most important moments of your life to date and you can't tell them the answer?

That is what they care about. They want to see if you are someone that they want to teach. Demonstrate passion, demonstrate knowledge, but above all demonstrate desire and ability to learn.",0,1384474000,null,0,false,0,cdekmqi,t3_1qcp76,t1_cdekmqi,t1_cddcj6p,null,1428655906,1,false,oxforduni,t5_2s4rg,1

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"This is probably going to come across as utterly retarded and only showcase my lack of knowledge of economics, but...

I share the idea that in the future, not only is 100% employment unnecessary, but probably completely impossible in a truly global, highly automated economy, esp. as automated computer systems become more sophisticated and start to do away with the stereotypical office job, call centers, paper pushers, etc.

And the crazy idea that pops into my head is this; obviously a guaranteed minimum income has all sorts of negative implications, perhaps primary of which is inflation, so....

To have a guaranteed minimum income that avoids or at least somewhat offsets inflation: could we not create a purely digital currency that is **time limited**, ie: 

You get Â£60 a week, but the currency is purely digital, you don't get the option to exchange it into notes or any other currency, and every penny of that Â£60 has it's own unique ID or hash, or whatever, and the sum payment is issued as a stack of IDs/hashes that expire in sequence as an exponential curve over time - you hold it too long and it all just disappears very suddenly at the end of it's limited lifespan, and whenever you make a transaction you always pay with the portion of the stack that will expire earliest, at which point the stack is refreshed and it's limited lifetime is reset, BUT with a slightly reduced lifespan that maps inflation of the currency. In other words, you or anyone or any company that holds that money is forced to spend it within a certain timeframe or be left holding nothing, it only exists as long as it's moved around, and even if it's moved around long enough it gradually loses it's value in order to offset inflation and encourage reinvestment.

Now I'm not completely retarded and I can think of at least three maybe four ways in which this idea is obviously massively flawed, not least of which is what happens to the poor bastard at the bottom of the supply chain holding a currency with an extremely limited lifespan.

But seriously; for millennia we've been dealing with currency made out of precious metals, or paper that represents precious metals, and now we have currency that represents 90%+ nothing but digital data, surely theres some way we can just skip over the fantasy that modern day currencies represent actual resources and just use modern digital technology to create one that actually does represent actual real resources and maps their availability, at least partially for all involved?

Now, I've no problem with a basic, mandatory, livable income paid to every man or woman of working age in the UK if they are not currently working.  It's a good theory and we as a society should more fully investigate the socio-economic ramifications for doing this.

My wife and I just happened to watch the '96 movie again last night. I could not have been more thrilled when I got home from work to see Paul MGann on-screen as The Doctor again...and then suddenly he was gone again. Bummer. 

Anyway...If you want to take a leap of continuity faith -and I don't really, in this case, BUT, here it is for the sake of argument- in the movie, the Seventh Doctor is killed by (sort-of companion/girlfriend) Grace Halloway when she administers some sort of sedative to him in order to perform surgery Seven's bullet-riddled body. The Doctor DIES, is placed in a morgue fridge, and left to chill. Only then does the regeneration take place (which, had it been a 2005 series-style regen and taken place when he was shot, or before being put under, could have essentially solved or prevented like 90% of the rest of the events in the movie).

Heâs the same Time Lord, the same being as the Doctors either side of him, but heâs the one who says, âIâm not the Doctor.â So the Eleventh Doctor is still the Eleventh Doctor, the Tenth Doctor is still the Tenthâ¦ âTechnically, if you really counted it, the David Tennant Doctor is two Doctors, on account of the Meta-Crisis Doctorâ¦ Itâs not a matter of counting the regenerations, but of counting the faces of the Time Lord that calls himself the Doctor. Thereâs an anomaly Doctor slotted in somewhere, thatâs all. In the script to The Day of the Doctor, Mattâs Doctor was called the Eleventh, and Davidâs was called the Tenth, so the numbering stays exactly the same â and we call Peter Capaldi the Twelfth Doctor.â",0,1384477858,null,0,false,0,cdem5hp,t3_1qm6k1,t1_cdem5hp,t3_1qm6k1,null,1428655196,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

No.  Steam engines arrived before standardisation really took off, so a bolt for a Watts Engine wouldn't fit anyone elses.  Once this changed and the mystery of high pressure steam was understood (and metallurgy caught up) things took off.  However, there is an upper limit to just how big a steam engine can be, too big and it expends most of its power just trying to move the piston.   You also have the problem of running multiple engines in parallel, synchronizing them and so on.

Which isn't an issue for computers.  If one core can't cope add more.  If that multi-core'd CPU can't cope add another multi-core CPU beside it.  We're already starting to make serious headway on natural voice recognition to the point where cell phones are doing it (Siri and the Android version thereof).  

If computers had evolved at the same speed as the steam engine, we'd only just of started 'the clone wars', so think decade or less rather than a century or more for the bite to hit.

We're very nearly at the stage where I can yell at my computer and a Roomba delivers me a coffee.

The default sort method there for the monthly range shows them in the order they were released. I believe all of Eight's were released in chronological order until The Girl Who Never Was, and the EDAs start after that one, followed by the first Dark Eyes boxset. The few monthly stories since then are more or less standalones which I believe technically occur much earlier in Eight's timeline than even Storm Warning, and involve him travelling with Mary Shelley, the writer of Frankenstein. If you'd prefer to listen to those first and follow Eight's story in his own chronological order, you'd start with The Silver Turk (on that Wiki page, you can sort the monthlies by 'Series Sorted' and scroll down to the 8th Doctor).

But what happened after that?  Does the car industry still need all those workers on the production lines?  No.  It replaced large numbers of them with robots.  So those workers went off to work in another area.  Then automation started appearing in that area.

The prognosis, for the ordinary man in the street with a  Barclays customer account. They will bleed them dry, of every penny in their account, wallet or purse. 

What you will see, the closing of numerous urban and rural branches, doubling of existing fees. To compensate for branch closures, a larger number of ATM's, will be installed. 

In addition, a new advertising campaign extolling the virtues of EFTPOS in the UK supermarket chains. This campaign, will be structured to avoid the true fee costs except at the terminal end.

Given Barclays, is no longer the bank for the man in the street, with fees climbing off the scale annually.  Barclays Bank, will continue to post big losses on the failing bad high risk low yield corporate development lending side, for the next fifty years minimum.

true,DrProfCapt,null,null,"I've been thinking about this for a while, to help some of my friends who are trying to get into the show. Here's what I've come up with so far (Note: The rating I give each episode afterward is not my opinion on the episode, but how necessary I feel it actually is):

**Season 1**
**Rose**- Surprisingly not *that* important, despite being the first episode. They just kind of throw you into the world and expect you to keep up. Still, this is the ""proper"" introduction to the series. 3/5

**Dalek**- One of my all time favourite episodes, and the series' formal introduction of the Daleks. If you don't watch this, however, you'll likely pick up on them later. 2.5/5

**The Empty Child/ The Doctor Dances**- Not too important plotwise, especially if you're just getting ready for the fiftieth, but it introduces Jack Harkness and is just damn good. 2/5

**Bad Wolf/ The Parting of Ways**- The first regeneration of the new series, and the introduction of Tennant. If you're not gonna find yourself asking ""where's the Doctor? And who's this new guy?"" afterwards, you could skip it and not miss out on too much. But if you missed ""Dalek"", this is another good chance to get acquainted. 3.5/5

**Season 2**
**The Christmas Invasion**- Not a particularly good episode, but if you want a formal introduction to Tennant, this is probably your best bet. 1.5/5
*The Rise of the Cybermen/ The Age of Steel**- The first appearance of the Cybermen (one of the three main antagonists of the fiftieth, along with the Daleks and the Zygons). I don't know what else to say. Is good. 3/5

**Army of Ghosts/ Doomsday**- Without getting into spoilers, there's no way in hell Rose is reappearing without them referencing these episodes. 4.5/5

**Season 3**
**Smith and Jones**- Important to the series, but likely not relevant to the special. 1/5

**Blink**- Not technically important to the plot at all, but I just though I'd throw it in, because if you ever find yourself in a situation where you're talking to a Whovian but don't know what to say,you can just quote this episode and they'll take over the conversation. 0.5/5

**Utopia/The Sound of Drums/ Last of the Time Lords**- There are a lot of things from these episodes that COULD come up again, but haven't been confirmed. At the very least, you might want to go into ""the End of Time"" knowing who the Master is. 2/5

**Season 3** 
**Partners in Crime**- It's pretty unlikely we'll see Martha again, but if they mention her, now you'll know who she is. 1/5

**Silence in the Library/ Forest of the Dead**- Just trust me, you'll want to know who this ""River"" chick is for later. 4.5/5

**The Stolen Earth/ The Journey's End**- These episode don't do much more than set up what you'll watch immediately after, but they do a damn good job of that. 1.5/5

**The End of Time**- If you're going to watch ONE (admittedly two-part) episode before the special, make it this one. Super important plot stuff happens. 5/5

**The Eleventh Hour** Not too important for much more than introducing characters, plus I'm just not a fan of it, so it's by no means a ""must-watch"". 1.5/5

**The Pandorica Opens/ The Big Bang**- Honestly, season 5 was pretty forgettable in my eyes, but I'm sure something important happened here. I mean, it's the season finale. 1/5 (maybe)

**Season 6**
**The Impossible Astronaut/ Day of the Moon**- Sets off a series of important things. 3.5/5

**The Rebel Flesh/ The Almost People**- Introduces an interesting concept that will come up again later. 2/5

**A Good Man Goes to War**- Character introductions, plot development, etc. 2/5

**The Wedding of River Song**- 3/5

**Asylum of the Daleks**- Introduces an import an plot line that will be reintroduced later, but it might help to be on top of it from the start. 1/5

**The Angels Take Manhattan**- If you've been watching any of Matt Smiths episodes, you'll need to see this. Otherwise, you'll have some questions going into the special. 3.5/5

**The Bells of Saint John**- Stuff happens. 2.5/5

**The Name of the Doctor**- Obviously. 5/5

TL;DR: Most of what I said is just ""watch the first and last episode of every season."" I wasted a lot of time writing this. Oh well. Hope it helped.

true,bzva74,null,null,"Reddit is designed to share content. There are two ways to share content: through a link post or a text post. A link sends you toward an article, web page, or image that enhances your title or explains it in some way. A text post is more pedestrian. I fail to see how the link that he posted enhances the content. /r/pics had this controversy recently: lots of pictures were being posted that couldn't stand alone as content. 

I think this post is similar. You have a title that is, as you say, an amusing bit of trivia. It is accompanied by content in the form of a link. Except the link doesn't add anything. We can all agree on that bit. So why did he add the link? What was his motivation? after all, it is an extra step to put the photo on imgur, then post the link in the reddit post. So either he is crazy for doing the extra work for no reason, or he was trying to turn this self-post into a link post, thus opening himself up for the link karma. 

It is about more than just the content. I'm arguing against his motivation. If he just wanted to share the info, he could have done it with a self post. It would have been easier and he would have communicated the same info. Instead, he made it a link post and didn't add any extra content. So for us it is the same- no better than the self post. But for him it is entirely different. It becomes a question of what motivates people to post here. Did he read it and say, ""hmm, this is an awesome bit of trivia, let me tell /r/coys about this!"" or did he say, ""this is kind of mundane but the last shitty post about chiriches birthday got a ton of upvotes, so those sheep will probably upvote this as well.""

Frankly, it is kind of disrespectful to the subreddit to think in terms of that. It underestimates us. The fact that you didn't catch onto it- and the fact that the post has so many upvotes in the first place- validates his point. We are sheep who will simply upvote a shiny picture of Jan or Vlad or AVB without concern for content. Look at our front page right now. The top 5 posts, in order, are this livermore/chiriches post, the desktop wallpaper image, the chiriches image, analysis from windycoys, and then the question about the away kit. This post+the chiriches bday image combined have about 10x the upvotes of the other 3 posts. I thought the desktop was clever and I like the motifs of /r/soccercirclejerk so I thought it was funny and threw him an upvote so I will leave that alone. What have we got left? We are rewarding this kind of garbage content at a rate of 10:1 in relation to real content. Even genuine discussion like the January potential signings, end of season prediction, etc aren't getting a fraction of what this garbage gets in upvotes. My complaint comes down to prioritizing what we value in this subreddit. We can all agree that we prefer genuine content to these tacky karma-whoring attempts. Just look at our top posts of the week and month. They tend to be links to real content or good discussions. We aren't a subreddit that wants to get hijacked by clowns vying for karma through lame images and infographics and memes. We value genuine content. That is why I- and a few other posters in the comments here- am so hostile toward this post and all the upvotes it received. The post is representative toward what we dislike on this subreddit. OP's motivations are out of wack and I'm sure he's going to play all innocent and say ""no idgaf about karma"" but it is pretty obvious to anyone who knows the effort that goes into making an imgur link post that it takes a solid 30 seconds to a minute. So unless he really WANTED to make it a link post, he wasn't gonna do it. He clearly gaf about the karma. And you are rewarding and defending the karma whore behavior. I'm not admonishing the post itself, I am just strongly opposed to the motivation behind it and the reception of it. The trivia is fine, but it isn't good enough content for him to get karma for it.

It's going to basically be impossible for any youngster to make an impact with us at striker right now obviously.  All the time that Sterling, Suso, Wisdom, etc got last year makes it an easy case when trying to snatch up players like Will Hughes but honestly we have a lot of really quality youngsters that just have no chance of making it through, especially up top.

On the topic of Morgan, it's not to say that Fabio Borini is a world-beater but he's a known player with some international experience that came from a big club and he's out on loan: it's not fair to expect Morgan to come in and make more of an impact than that.

I think it's a bit sad and maybe a bit concerning that such an incredibly brilliant actor and presumably overall great guy would take issue with the way such an incredibly brilliant and certainly overall great show is being run. It makes my immense respect for his run as the Doctor eat away at me a little bit, knowing that despite himself being one of the best things ever to happen to the show, he apparently stands against the show as it exists. I really do wish I knew more so that I could reach a good conclusion and not be left wondering whether anyone is at fault, or who.

**EDIT 2** - Thanks for reminding me to think about this whole thing, I just remembered the conclusion I reached a while ago that it was BBC network execs he disliked and the creatives involved with the show probably saw pretty eye-to-eye with him.

But on the flip side, I am VERY happy that people truly are starting to see Ramires' worth this season. It is not very long since people started grunting at the thought of Ramires playing. A lot of people needed a lot of time to see his contributions simply because he wasn't as technical or charismatic as certain other midfielders we have. But the value of hard work is finally being recognised and I hope he will continue to charge across the midfield of Stamford Bridge for many many more years.

Edit: Seeing people constantly mentioning the Barcelona chip when talking about him also pisses me off, it really gives the air of that they don't really look at what he truly does for a team.

We have tried Defoe paired with Soldado in a few 20 min increments against Arsenal, Newcastle, and a few others, and they haven't been effective together. Vucinic is a bit more of a passer, but shoots the ball really well too. Perhaps like a more advanced Harry Kane style player.

Most student nurses work part time on inpatient units as ""bank"" (as and when) health care assistants or support workers. The money for this can be pretty good especially if you pick up night, weekend or bank holiday shifts and it helps your chances of getting a good position when you qualify as you'll already have made a good impression and can get good references. 

I qualified as a Mental Health Nurse a few years ago and spent some time working on an acute mental health unit for children and teenagers where individual and group counselling was a large part of my role. I now work as a Nurse Therapist with kids in the community, specialising in crisis work and suicide prevention. Previously counselling was seen as the remit of Psychologists but now Mental Health Nurses are expected to be proficient in delivering talking therapies and I've been able to access training in various approaches such CBT, DBT, Solution Focused Therapy and Behavioural Family Therapy funded by my employer.

Actually that's the point.  It did!  It had to of done because the farm hands weren't required in those numbers anymore; thus they lost their job.

What you and others are missing is that when these things happened not everywhere was heavily mechanised or automated.  So all of the farm hands were capable of going elsewhere. 

What you're also missing is that in those days it wasn't quite as much a global economy, those farm hands couldn't be offshored for example and nor could the positions they ended up getting when they weren't needed to be farm hands.  

Now put that in to modern times and you can see that our finesse with mechanisation and automation is vastly superior to the days when traction engines first rolled up to a farm.  You don't even necessarily have a traction engine mechanic any more you have an automated traction engine repair bay you just shove it in to and it reappears fully functional again.

These new industries you and other people are pinning your hopes on aren't going to appear here's why:  services are not that location specific.  The new industry of monitoring office automation doesn't have to be in the UK or even this continent. 

That isn't a ""they're taking our jorbs"" cliche it's the truth; computers don't care where the person monitoring them is located so you might as well go cheap; the only local based people you need is a repair engineer and 1 of those can have a patch that's most of the south coast. 

The math just does not work anymore and your rhetoric of ""it was fine then, it'll be fine now"" doesn't take into account that the slack in the system has been removed. 

&gt;Although we may well see a decline in living standards until the economy rebalances.

Banks for instance are quite strict due to the need to comply with anti-money laundering regulations and typically require a passport or driving licence to open an account.

In fact, I believe he's actively working to make it harder for the people at the bottom to improve their living standards. The actions this government has taken have had the worst effect on the most vulnerable amongst us - the poor, the disabled, the unemployed. And I don't believe he's done this because he thinks it'll somehow inspire them to stop being poor and change their lives. I believe he's done it because this is what makes his friends richer. The government doesn't care about the poor. They're just starting to think about the next election so they're saying things that will win them some votes.

Finally, the victim mentality has been reinforced by the cuts. I've tried motivating people to improve their situation, to demand more, but so often they use the excuse that ""times are tough"" as a reason to *not* expect better. The mentality seems to be that you should just accept your minimum wage job (which you're lucky to have), accept you're going to have a zero hours contract, don't ask to be paid for your overtime, don't expect a pay rise which covers your cost of living increase.

Between the classic series ending and the TV movie in 96 there were two book ranges, the New Adventures (NA) and Missing Adventures (MA) both published by Virgin Books. The NAs continued from the 7th Doctor and Ace and got quite dark and disturbing but had some good stories. There were a few story arcs, some of which are indicated in the titles (eg TimeWyrm) and the story was open ended, companions leaving and joining.

The MAs are novels featuring the other Doctors and are generally lighter in tone. Also they are slotted between TV adventures so don't need to be read in any particular order.

After 96, BBC books took over with the 8th Doctor Adventures (EDAs) and Past Doctor Adventures (PDAs), these followed the same pattern as the Virgin books.

Finding these books will be your biggest challenge, my brother spent years on eBay and eventually got them all but some are very rare.

Here are Wikpedia articles with lists. [NAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures), [MAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Missing_Adventures), [EDAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Doctor_Adventures), and [PDAs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past_Doctor_Adventures).

I happen to think he's pretty decent in the final third too, not the best but certainly looks more threatening than Cissokho. Once he gets in and around the opponents box he is quite capable of a decent cross or pull back to find one of our players in the box.

I think the main weakness to his game comes when in the center of the pitch. His pass selection and his one-footedness is very frustrating to watch. When a simple pass is there to team mate with his right foot, he takes the long way round to play it with his left and our attack loses its pace.

All these costs are passed onto the person buying the JCB's + profit and it is still cheaper for them to buy that then have 20-40 unskilled workers. That's money that can be invested elsewhere which can potentially benefit everyone. This is where the government *should* step in with min. wage, tax incentives on re- investment vs bonuses etc. to make sure any abnormal profits aren't wasted.

*Edit- or create an environment where there are 5-15 competing factories so they don't have an opportunity to make abnormal profits. This is balance of capitalism and regulation we are supposed to have and this is how it's supposed to work.*

Engineering graduates are expecting more jobs to be created in their fields because the number of graduates likely outnumber those retiring. So now we have an opportunity cost of the surplus you noticed and the surplus that might otherwise occur in another field.

Money doesn't disappear or get created (apart from in the banking sector). The concern is wage inequality/unemployment; the introduction of technology can cause it but it could have the opposite effect or just be neutral.

&gt;The same pattern repeats wherever you look, we always end up with a surplus of people.

You know we also have a deficit of workers in many skilled fields. And we have looked abroad. That's jobs that our unskilled workers cannot do because the education system is not producing what we need. Recently we apparently had a shortage of unskilled workers and looked to migrants. The problem is it's easy to attract unskilled workers but once we have a surplus you can't just kick them out.  

The pattern you described has been greatly simplified. The problem isn't technology, the problem is the government planning for the future with fiscal policy and education. Also note that if the factory a British firm uses to buy JCB's is abroad then that's job's that we are losing in Britain and others are gaining abroad.

Plenty to see and do, both for the kids and for my wife and I. The Castle, of course, which the kids love. There's also the World of Illusion and the National Museum of Scotland, with both have lots of hands on activities (the younger kids might not fully grasp the displays, but it'll still be fun for them to play). Haven't been to the Botanical Gardens, but I'm told it's really nice and fun for the kids. Lots of day trips available, too, even moreso if you have a car (which we don't, but even the trains have been a fun experience for our kids).

We have yet to go anywhere we felt unsafe, although most of our nights are pretty early with the kids, so not out late or anywhere that isn't pretty busy. The Royal Mile, Princes Street, shopping at St. Andrews mall or going to catch a movie at the Omni complex, all are perfectly safe. Public transportation has been safe and very efficient as well, and I see lots of mums and dads with strollers.

One pleasant surprise, the parents at our kids' school were quick to invite us for playdates. We had expected a warm reception, because people say Edinburghers are very friendly (and it's true). But the open arms were very welcome after living in a city on the East Coast of the US where breaking into the mommy groups felt like trying to join the royals.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Doesn't it still depend on a huge number of other factors though? Like if you grow up in an community where education is not prioritized, or is even shunned, and access to resources is poor, there's far less of an incentive to study hard.  Even if you work your arse off in those areas, it's incredibly hard not to be influenced by those around you. For example there are areas where joining a gang is probably a safer bet that not joining one, and there's all kinds of shit that people can't really avoid and get caught up in. There can also be a huge number of reasons why parents can't or don't get their kids to study hard; troubled domestic life, mental illness, addiction etc. and all these issues are compounded when living in a lower income area. I don't think we're talking just about someone being richer than you, and the point is that there are people who aren't living comfortably.

Some people in lower income areas may rise up out of it, but even within those areas some people are at an advantage to others. Some have a natural drive and will exceed whatever their circumstances, but that's not exactly the norm and depending where you live it's incredibly easy to get caught up in stuff that prevents you from excelling. School's free and uni fees don't have to be paid back until you can afford it, but if the schooling's not effective people feel left out or alienated. I know there was a lot of scorn for the rioters, and there were many people just taking advantage of the situation to steal stuff, but there were stories in there of people who have been continually let down, who had tried handing out CV's again and again to no avail, who had stuff like EMA cut and were growing up in single parent households that were struggling to get by. I mean I know people who had trouble getting jobs in the suburbs despite qualifications and despite handing out resume's all day, and in inner city and lower income areas it's often far worse. 

That's not saying people shouldn't take responsibility or whatever, but there's so many factors that influence how effective schooling is, how motivated someone is to study (if you see high unemployment and people around you being continually let down, that's not exactly going to motivate you), and other socio-economic factors.",0,1384514850,null,0,1384527697,0,cdevvqz,t3_1qoije,t1_cdevvqz,t1_cdevifq,null,1428650573,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Ah, the answer of someone who thinks there is been but can't actually decide what. 

War criminals (although nobody has been brought in front of the Hague so no they're not) at the heart of the govt does not undermine our civil liberties.

I have noticed absolutely zero impact on any of my civil liberties for donkeys years. In fact with the IRA cessation of their campaign there was actually an increase in civil liberties as security was lowered allowing a lot more freer travel in Northern Ireland.

What civil liberty do you think has been destroyed and how is not releasing these communications affecting your life?

Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, the government in response to A's case passed this allows the Home Secretary to impose control orders on any British citizen.

Terrorism Act 2006, following the bombings in London on the 7th of July, this legislation allows for people suspected of terrorist offences to be detained without charge for up to 28 days.

Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, in response to the destruction of the NYC World Trade Center on 9/11, the government passed legislation allowing indefinite detention without trial for non-British nationals suspected of committing terrorist offences, but without enough evidence for an actual trial

Civil Contingencies Act 2004, allows the government, for an ""emergency"", to deploy armed forces anywhere in the country during peace time

* They pay business rates based on the size and location of the premises they rent.
 * Unrelated to turnover, you can turnover millions and work in a shed or go for grandour on little turnover (to impress prospective clients)
* They pay their staff and related NI contributions
 * Again unrelated to turnover, you can employ staff on borrowed money for a few years.
* They pay electricity based on the amount of electricity they use.
 * Unrelated to turnover once more
* They pay for internet, telephone, post, etc
 * Unrelated to turnover once more
* They pay bank interest on the funding they have secured (if they assume they are going to run at a loss when starting)
 * Unrelated to turnover once more

&gt; A turnover tax would be just another fee. It would probably be scaled based on turnover anyway, so that small businesses pay less.

It would have to be very high to avoid killing off upstarts. You might even have to start at Â£1 billion, since the tax is meant to focus on multinationals.

Rather than put any thought into the question of why poverty and low social mobility exists - which might uncover some uncomfortable truths about what the last generations have done to pull the ladder up after themselves - it's easier to blame it somehow on the poor and move on. The well off can do that after all; it's a theoretical argument, a tabloid headline to be commented on rather than a daily reality.

It's funny you should bring up grammar schools as an example in this, because they weren't without their problems. As much as they gave a step up for the less well off kids that got in, the entrance exam became a gate that would slam in the faces of the kids that didn't for whatever reason and once it was shut, it was pretty much shut for good.

The employer is following a process, the purpose of which is to allow it to dismiss the employee while minimising the risk of an employment claim. The form of the process is driven by employment law.

Employers are allowed to dismiss someone immediately for serious misconduct. This is rare-the more usual situation is to issue one or more written warnings and set out a performance plan.

As I said, the purpose of this is not to help the employee but to comply with employment law. In most cases the employer will have already made up its mind to dismiss the employee and is simply going through the formalities.

In such a situation, there is nothing that the employee can do, except comply with all work rules to the letter. Otherwise, they can dismiss him immediately.

If the exchange rates are equal it costs less to use lbc or bb and is faster (half hour as opposed to days)

Personally I only use exchanges to bank fiat if I think my BTC exposure is high or the rate gets choppy. I have a few vendors that do cash transactions at mtgox rates so I only use them. Its a hell of a way to bitcoin

These individuals can afford to go without the fee as they wouldn't be getting it on mtgox anyway. lbc is also less dynamic than the exchanges and if the exchange jumps up lbc will not reflect that immediately. You still need someone to sell so your never gonna get more than a few % cheaper but its something

&gt; I guess if you want peace of mind - buy on the exchange

Well lots of mtgox customers who had their accounts majorly backlogged and of course the order system shutting down and actually causing one of the last major BTC crashes.

Many discussions on social mobility only offer 'treatments' for the 'symptoms'. The discussions rarely address the cause that is private banks creating 97% of our new money in the form of loans. These private institutions are also responsible for deciding how this new money is put to use in the economy. On top of these two points, they can charge interest on these debts created from nothing.

This form of loaning should not be confused with lending. Banks are not required to produce loans from lending out depositors money and have no limits as to how much money they can issue as debt.

- Very little to do in the evening other than visit the pub, which combined with the (then) lack of public transportation can lead to boredom depending on what you enjoy doing.

They end up being admitted and then stay for weeks because of the care and company they are receiving. They will be doing fine and then the moment you mention discharge their symptoms will suddenly get worse again, they really do not want to go back home. It can be very frustrating because you know and they know that there is little need for them to be in hospital, but at the same time you do feel a lot of sympathy for them. They're typically widowed, living alone, with impaired mobility which restricts their ability to go out and about. The only social company they get is when a carer comes round perhaps twice a week for half an hour to help them with household tasks. And that can go on for years on end, being trapped in their home with nothing but the TV for company. The family don't visit, the neighbours aren't interested, it's a thoroughly depressing existence. 

There are services and community schemes which aim to get people out and about, but unfortunately many are being slashed and burnt by councils due to funding cuts so the problem is still increasing at the moment.

15/11/2013, 12:10 PM clock | FUSSBALL.DE


Hey people,

Here once again is Lewis Holtby . After many weeks of English Premier League, Europa League and League Cup I've seen during the international break time once again to announce me to you. The season has now arrived in the hot phase, we have direct contact with the Spurs to the top and for me personally a real childhood dream has been fulfilled in the meantime.

But first things first: I approach me after my long injury lay closer to the team struggled and could accumulate at least three times in the last games from the start. So for me, it really is running better and better here. Unfortunately we have for our very good start to the season but lost a bit of the thread and are home to the bitter failures against West Ham (0-3) and Newcastle (0-1) slipped to seventh.

Nothing is impossible
Nevertheless, we have to be leaders and city rivals Arsenal five points distance - so it's still all in there. We could, however, also without problems are much higher up. Blessing in disguise, but still very annoying.

It runs really well, however the Europa League. Here we have already qualified ahead of the next round after four wins in four games and can already look forward to the draw for us. Maybe we'll meet in the round of yes to a German opponent. That would be a real highlight for me.

A dream come true
One of the emotional highlights of my career, however, is already behind me: On 10 Day we have in fact played against my favorite team of former days, and the heart of my Dads Club: Everton. I watched as a child almost all the games of toffees and was really what you call a real fan.

Meanwhile, as a professional, it is of course difficult to be followers of another team. Since I always identify myself 100 percent with my club, of course, nothing is currently over Tottenham. My father, however, was in a real quandary. He was sitting in the stands at Everton jersey and ultimately mitgezittert with both teams. Two hearts beating in his chest, one for Everton, one for me. For him, so it was perfect that the game ended 0-0. I would of course have preferred to win.

But even so, it was a unique experience. When I called at Goodison Park, I had goose bumps and was actually close to tears. I have followed all my life and suddenly you're playing against Everton that. In these moments I always knew that I had actually done it and live my dream.

Steffen and Lewis vs.. England
Another dream of mine is of course the national team. Therefore, it is also a matter of honor that I'll be looking at the upcoming internationals against Italy and England. The big battle at Wembley I'll even be live on site and the guys fingers crossed. You can imagine that the taunts in training are getting more for several days. The snack between England and Germany always provides plenty to talk about - even in our team.

I'm always glad then that Coach Steffen Freund is with us. It is 1996 in London became European champion and therefore knows how to win in England. If he says something, the others are always fast, quite humbly. I therefore hope that we clean the Three Lions and Steffen and I have something to laugh right after the workout. I will also tell about it!


See you soon! 
your Lewis

If a guy doesn't act like a sexist fucknugget I'd say his life is largely going to be unaffected by this. It's very easy to dismiss a stigma of being a sexists asshole by not acting like one. If you are facing having to act that way to fit with a group then it's clearly not worth it but more than that it's also *not* an excuse. It does not matter to the victims of this kind of abuse that the guy doesn't really mean it all that matters is that he didn't have the balls to stand up for his convictions if he happened to have any. 

People ""joking"" with a girl that they are going to rape them is fucking abhorrent and this idea that it matters if a guy honestly thinks these things and hates women or is just doing it to fit in is splitting hairs. It ignoring the concepts of the banalities of evil that have allowed things like sexism to cling on far longer than they should. It is, of course, worth thinking about when trying to find ways to *address* the issue but it makes no bones, what so ever, to what is making it an issue in the first place.

He's looked quite strong in the games he's played with the only exception being his very first match, in which he was played out of position and looked a bit over eager.  Since then he's put in a string of very good performances in the 3-5-2 and was one of the only players who really looked decent against Arsenal in spite of playing out of position at LB for the second half.

from watching each game this season I think you're being very harsh on him, he hasn't really put a foot wrong following his first game for us.  He's obviously far better than Cissokho and performed to a much higher standard to the point where he even kept Agger out of the side for a couple of matches. I know stats don't tell the whole story but [he's our only CB with 0 errors so far this season and he has the highest tackle success rate by a huge margin](http://cdn.eplindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rodgers-Centre-Backs.png).  I've been delighted to watch him play and I think he's an extremely powerful and solid option at the back for us.  He can play with the ball at his feet and he's built like a brick wall.  He goes in a bit hard and it can look reckless, but his overwhelming success rate in doing it shows that there's at least some level of good calculation and decision making going on when he decides to do it. 

You're also being kind to Cissokho.  He's been a calamity of errors from laziness, lack of awareness and sloppy play both defending and attacking.

So the best indicator of a country's rank on these measures of general well-being is not the difference in wealth between them, but the difference in wealth within them.

&gt;Joke or not, isn't that what equality is all about? Recognizing everyone gets affected - not just one group?

No. Well at least not in this sense. Equal rights is making sure that every one can unquestionably be expect to be treated the same as every one else regardless of who they are. That it. This includes the ability for their problems to be *their* problems and not to have them co-opted by others. Ironically this means, for those of us more privileged (yes I used the word, it's useful :P), having to learn that not everything *also* has to be about us. 

&gt;That's my explanation for my motives, at any rate...

I get where you are coming from but we don't live equal world and it can be galling for people to find when they are trying to talk about theirs struggles they also always find people who, if not demand, expect that ours are talk about as well. 

I think the issue you raise are worth talking about when dealing with how we fix the problem but they are not really relevant to *why* this is a problem.   

&gt;If University climate gets so sensitive to a man speaking up against a woman - not in a sexist way - but in debate, conversation or any other manner where they do not agree - that that man goes on to be 'branded' and harassed as sexist, then things will have gone to far. A University local to me has already shown some signs of this, with more militant feminists doggedly going after comments made by male students that (if the genders were reversed) would have been overlooked.

I can't get drawn in to talking about things I don't know about and this is a trick and complex thing that I don't feel qualified to anyway. I'll be more likely to cause a misunderstanding than anything else.  What I can say is that I'll happily admit that there are people who take that kind of thing way to far. The issue here is that it has nothing to do with what is being discussed and I highly doubt men are simply having to accept that abuse will be likely hurled at them for being men if they go out in public in the same way women are facing with this ""lad"" culture crap. 

&gt;I don't get the impression it's that easy when it comes to sports teams etc. University is what you make if it and sporting societies can be a big thing to be involved in and very rewarding - but having been around such things - there can be a culture of 'the team' and comradeship and if you don't fit in and buy in to that, you may miss out.

If you can't be involved with out being sexist then *you are being sexist*. At which point you are putting your need to have a laugh as part of the team ahead of being a descent person. It's a bit hard for me to feel sorry for them. More so when what they are doing seems to being just accepted. 

&gt;That shouldn't be enough to justify sexism, banter or lad culture, but should go some way to explaining how a normally well meaning male might find themselves in that kind of climate. That needs to be understood if a solution is to be found.

I agree with you that this is important when looking for a solution but that wasn't what your post was address was it? You wanted us to take in to account how this rising perception of some guy at uni as being sexists was going to be an stigma for other men. 

&gt;Hard to say - the article itself points out that a student union officer was present but left just as it all started â but it then goes on to call that person out for not trying to stop it.
&gt;Does that mean itâs not enough just to not be a part of these things in any way â to be considered anything but âin with themâ you have to actively go against them there and then?

I'll be honest I likely wouldn't have tried to stop it if I'd been on the bus. I'd be afraid of having the shit kicked out of me. I, however, was not a student union officer who knew the people involved and has some level of authority backing me up. We can't know why he didn't do anything to stop it but by not trying it gives the impression of permission for those actions.

Naturally the Scouser wants to test him out a bit.

The Scouser is very impressed with the old guy and vows to look him up again one day.

He decides to go over and see if the Great Memory Man remembers him.  Of course the Scouser is a little more worldy wise now, and decides to great the guy in a more traditional manner.

Watching people try to push Enrique off the ball (and failing every single time) is one of my favorite ""small moments"" about watching football.  I love it.  Every single time.

I did want to tack on a note about his positioning.  As you mentioned, it is terrible.  I just don't think he is that great a reader of the game.  He relies on his pace to bail him out.  Which it typically does, but on set-play situations he can be a bit of a liability.  Unfortunately, at 26(27?), he probably won't develop much more mentally as a player.  He is what he is.  And, one day, that pace will be gone.  He just won't be fast enough, but it will take 1/3 a season or so to figure it out.

I love Enrique as a player, but I think LWB is our weakest position atm.",0,1384529029,null,0,false,0,cdez205,t3_1qmxv4,t1_cdez205,t1_cdeerx1,null,1428649092,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Combine this with (I admit it's anecdotal experience) that the majority of infant and primary teachers are women, they are going to be better at interacting with girls.  They may even believe that girls need extra help.

Add in a dash that at a young age boys are nearly incapable of sitting still and paying attention so tend in some regards to be treated as naughty girls who won't behave properly.

Throw it all in a blender and leave to simmer for a few decades and you get quite a vicious feedback loop in that boys are trained from an early age they'll be ignored, so they don't put the effort in thus they are ignored.

There is a strong argument that during early education the two sexes should be segregated so that each group can not only get the basic education they need in the manner they need it but also can be taught how to learn.

I too, saw a list of monthly wages. This is because a particular document wasn't opening up correctly for the CTO and asked if I could open it up on my PC. It was a document outlining the companies planned pay rises. Yes, I shouldn't have seen it, but it happened. I soon found out I was the lowest paid member of the team.

What you do depends on how much you plan to negotiate. If you walk in to your manager and say ""I'm not happy with this, I want a raise"", be sure you have a figure in mind. Make it a reasonable figure.

As someone else pointed out, bringing this up can go either way. It can be seen as ""hey that guy knows his skills are worth the extra Â£Â£ so we need to keep him"" *or* ""hey that guy has a big ego and thinks he needs to be the highest paid member here"". If you are ready for *both* scenarios, go for it.

To help you get a reasonable figure, have a look at local job sites for your role, or near what you do day-to-day. See what others are being offered. It helps give you a perspective in what other people, doing a similar role, with similar experience, are being paid.

You can either up and leave, which is what I did, or bring it up with your manager. If you are happy there besides the pay, I'd advise bringing it up with your manager. I up'ed and got a new job which I start in a weeks time. Same role, only a few blocks down the road, paying *more* than what my co-workers are on. The only reason why I did this was because I started getting unhappy with the work, it was becoming boring, unchallenging and after explaining this to my manager the response was ""well that's what you were hired to do"", the pay problem just added to that. I think if the pay issue didn't arise, I would have stayed a bit longer but still eventually left when I found a suitable place.

-------------------------------------------

The War Doctor (WD) stumbles into the TARDIS. Random consoles are exploding and spewing sparks. He makes his way over to the center console and starts to press button and pull leavers. The TARDIS vworp start to fade in. The WD sinks to the floor with his back up against the console. He starts to glow as the regeneration sequence begins.  

*WD:* (breathless) It's over...  

With a final heavy sigh, the WD closes his eyes and lays his head back on against the console. The regeneration cycle in full swing his old warrior features start to fade into a younger version with short dark brown hair.  

Cut to Main Title  

Fade in on Kensington Gardens, Diana Memorial Playground.
The sun is shinning, a few white fluffy clouds are in the sky. Children can be seen and heard playing at the Diana Memorial Playground. The TARDIS vworp starts to fade in as the police box starts to materialize. Once fully materialize the door opens and the newly regenerated doctor falls out of the TARDIS. He looks up to the sky, falls to his knees.  

*Doctor:* They're all gone!  

He hangs his head down. One of the kids who was playing on the playground sees all this happens and walks over to the Doctor.  

*Kid:* Who is gone?  

The Doctor looks up at the kid.   

*Doctor:* Everyone.  

*Kid:* Everyone?  

*Doctor:* Yes, Everyone.  

The kid looks around.  
*Kid:* How can everyone be gone, I am still here?  

The Doctor still looking at the kid, he mouth slowly turns in to a faint smile. He then looks around and sees the kids playing on the playground, families having picnics, and enjoying the day.  

A little happier.  
*Doctor:* I guess you are right. Not everyone is gone and that is just fantastic.  

In the distance's a lady is looking over at them.  

*Lady:* (yelling) Steven! Steven Carter you come here this instance!  

*Doctor:* You better run along now, I don't want you to get in trouble.  

Steven smiles starts to walk around. After a few steps he turns back to the Doctor.   

*Steven:* Hey mister, what is your name?  

The Doctor turns toward him. Off screen you we hear the sounds of people screaming, with one voice louder than the others.   

*Panic Women:* IS there a doctor around?  

The Doctor looks toward the distress call, then turns back to Steven. His grin wider than before.  

*Doctor:* I'm the Doctor.  

Steven's mother is running up to him and grabs his arm. But before she can pull him away.  

*Steven:* Doctor who?

~~*Doctor:* Just the Doctor.~~  
With a full blown smile on his face, the Doctor turns and starts to run towards where the screams were coming from.

true,mrmessiah,null,null,"&gt; again this is largely projecting onto people rather than real peoples views

I don't know, I mean you see a lot of that in Conservative rhetoric and more recently with the response to the framing of benefit recipients as ""skivers"" (opposed to ""strivers"") it seems to have bled into the public consciousness too.

&gt; that was the problem to solve, not throwing away the grammar schools and all the good they have done 

You can look at it that way, or you can see the grammar school system as being a de facto divisive force and say ""actually, what we should be doing is improving education across the board"". But whichever camp you're in with regard to that (it's kind of a different argument), the point remains that there are a lot of people saying ""why don't people just get on, like I did?"" without noticing that the ladders that have been pulled up behind them.

I was unaware cleaner was white collar. I'm temping right now and have worked in a few areas; some security personnel can barely speak english so clearly some skills are transferable. supermarket shelf stacker's also don't need prior skills or English in my experience. The increase in imports and exports has many cargo staff and ramp agents that also have 0 education and prior skills.

You seem to think an unskilled worker has to move to another identical unskilled job. 

Also, I was not denying the existence of some unskilled workers being left behind. I was trying to say that the cause of the problem is not solely technology, in fact technology is the probably smallest factor.

All you have done is exaggerated the effect of technology. Offering no solutions. What I have tried to do in my last comment towards the end (the part you brushed off with 'this is reddit') is describe how other major factors have affected unskilled workers and how the alternative is much much worse.

Total bollocks. Refining and chemical processing margins are wafer thin - all the profits are upstream in the exploration and production sector.

Corporation tax is calculated at a subsidiary level and, as a special measure for the oil industry, within each subsidiary, each field's income and expenditure is ring-fenced; this means that each field will have a unique marginal rate of  corporation tax. When I worked at BP this was between 55% and 75% depending on the field. Meanwhile BP Oil International, which held the refining and chemical assets had a marginal tax rate of 25%.

To ~~prevent the oil majors from playing~~ *reduce the extent to which the oil majors are able to play* the system to minimise their taxable profits - BPX would love to sell its oil at a loss to BPOI; have an up to 75% tax shield which it could set against other profits; and have the artificially increased profits in BPOI taxed at 25% - HMRC sets a monthly transfer price (a similar arrangement is in force in Norway).

Her husband had passed away about 10 years prior, a lot of her older friends had passed away, and she was having trouble taking care of a whole house on her own. So she moved into assisted living and signed up for university (free tuition for people 65+). She made a ton of younger friends, got remarried and earned her degree in fine arts. The last 9 years of her life were inspirational. 

Meanwhile, I listen to my 67 year old father make excuses every time I try to push him to leave the house and join a club or something.

I've been a regular tumblr user for about 2 1/2 years now, and part of the Doctor Who fandom for a little over a year. The amount of hate Moffat gets on tumblr upsets me so much. I recently gained a lot of followers that seem to be on the anti-Moffat train. I followed them back before I realized that, so sometime this weekend I plan on unfollowing them and trying to find new people to follow who aren't Moffat haters. 

And the people who take social justice to the extreme and think every little thing in Doctor Who is sexist...that bothers me so much. Ugh.

However, there are a lot of great people in the Doctor Who fandom on tumblr. I think it's probably a case of it's the negative ones that are the loudest, you know? The people who loudly bash Moffat or are overly extreme social justice bloggers are the ones who draw attention to themselves.

Part of the allure of the UK, for me, is the history. The US has history, but the most obvious traces of it go back 200 years AT MOST in my hometown. Of course, there is lots of history from the indigenous civilizations like the Mound Builders, but it's difficult to find if you're a layperson.

The UK, however, *is* history for an American. Every day in London I walk past buildings that are older than my entire country. It blows my little Yank mind. Britain has some really neat/weird old traditions that at least seem like they originated centuries ago. Stuff like rolling a giant cheese down a hill, or Morris dancing, or having earls. And Stonehenge! Seriously old stuff, and really cool.

This is not to mention the family history involved. It's hard to find a white American without some sort of Welsh, Scottish, Irish, or English blood in them (I know Ireland isn't part of the UK, but it used to be so I'm counting it here). As someone with the surname Thomas, I can't wait to take a weekend trip to Wales to see the countryside my way-back ancestors knew.

WDAs

Depreciation is not an allowable expense for the calculation of a companies taxable profits as it varies from company to company and an individual company could change their depreciation policy (method and rate charged) from year to year. Depreciation is therefore added back to a company's profits and instead WDA's are then given at a rate set by HMRC *(there are rules for different classes of assets and there is a certain amount of flexibility allowed about how the WDAs are claimed)*. This achieves *a degree of* uniformity across different industries and from company to company.

A relative of mine who was a GP told me that most of the elderly patients who came in had nothing actually the matter, they just wanted somebody to talk to. She had one person who'd always book a double appointment at the end of the day, literally to come in and chat.

My grandmother lives in a sort of sheltered housing block now, and I've visited her several times (it's a few hours drive). I remember one of my Grandma's neighbours, a woman over 100, now sadly no longer with us, the extent of her world was her apartment and a communal living room where she'd sit and watch the buses. She would literally get her walker and shuffle down the hall to the lift, take the lift down to the ground floor to *sit and watch buses*. 

But this isn't just the elderly, it's also the mentally unwell. I've visited a relative in a mental hospital and the 'care' was shocking. They had very few visitors, very little to do. A lot of the patients acted up and would be restrained simply because they were bored and lonely. 

I wonder if it's a result of capitalism. If labour operates according to supply and demand, people are reduced to commodities. What do you do with a broken or worn out commodity? Discard it.

You'd be surprised how many times energy companies incorrectly bill, or the admin is just not right. That can cause huge problems. Say a misspelling of a name on a bill. That could stop you using a utility bill as identity support. It could take you an hour to get through to some companies and leave you frustrated and angry. It all adds up in my opinion.

Combine intelligence with the attributes I mentioned above and boy, We have a future world class player on our hands.

Did I mention he's only 20! Can't wait to see him tearing it up in the coming years.....

From what I understand, the only reason he's out on loan is that a loan deal couldn't be done that Ba would accept and someone had to go but he's young and it all adds to his learning experience.

Before the movie first premiered, I was very excited.  Finally, a new Who show, a back-door pilot that would hopefully get a full series treatment. A way to introduce my husband to the wonderful show I loved so much.  

Then, I watched that horrible thing.  It was terrible.  [Spoiler](#s ""7 gets killed by a stray bullet? Seriously?  After all manner of bad guys missing him, some low-level street thug takes out The Doctor?"")  

Too much romance. The story wasn't great.  They tried to change a significant detail about The Doctor.  It was just not the show anyone was expecting.  No wonder it didn't get picked up.  

In some ways, I'm glad the series didn't get made then.  BBC wasn't ready.  Fox didn't know what they were doing.  It was just too early. McGann is a decent enough actor, he does have the presence to make a good Doctor, he just got saddled with that turkey of a movie to make his debut.  

I've gone back and re-watched the movie recently and I'll be seeing it again this week.  It wasn't as shocking the second time around, I'll give it that.  As long as you ignore the stupid line about [Spoiler](#s ""him being half-human""), it's a watchable adventure.

Even though I hated it the first time I saw it, I still recommend to see it at least once.  You may like it more than I did.

Any judgment based on the Arsenal match too wouldn't be fair, as I'll agree he actually looked one of the best, but probably only because the rest of the team hardly looked like world-beaters that evening.

I'd also have to question the 0 mistakes.  The fact that poor Cissokho took all the flack for that goal at Newcastle is scandalous - Sakho was at least as equally responsible.  I guess they've been thrown in the deep end and if they were squad players at the minute they'd look far better signings - it's just annoying when we have much, much better options for both players.  

For a long time there was a large number of people saying Enrique didn't bring anything to the team.  Now that Cissokho has taken his place, why is it that the latter doesn't get any support?

I remember something from the televised debates, when they were talking about how people can lose their homes when they have to go into nursing homes, to pay for the care. Dave compared a couple of hypothetical people. One had been on benefits for most/all of their life, the other hadn't, had bought their own home and had savings.

When talking about the second person he kept using the phrase ""done the right thing"". I was flabbergasted. Saving money and buying a home isn't some morally upright and correct thing.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"Replace ACS with BCS.

&gt; The American Corporate State employs a full time counterinsurgency infrastructure with resources that are unimaginable to most would be insurgents. Quite simply, violent insurgents have no idea of just how powerful the foe actually is. Violent insurgents typically start out as peaceful, idealistic, political activists. Whether or not political activists know it, even with very mundane levels of political activity, they are engaging in low intensity conflict with the ACS.

&gt; Most of what is commonly referred to as âpolitical activismâ is viewed by the corporate stateâs counterinsurgency apparatus as a useful and necessary component of political control.

&gt; Political activism amounts to an utterly useless waste of time, in terms of tangible power, which is all the ACS understands. Political activism is a cruel guise that is sold to people who are dissatisfied, but who have no concept of the nature of tangible power. **Counterinsurgency teams routinely monitor these activities, attend the meetings, join the groups and take on leadership roles in the organizations.**

&gt; Because the corporate stateâs counterinsurgency operatives have infiltrated most political activism groups, the radicalized members will be easily identified, monitored and eventually compromised/turned, arrested or executed.

Later my dad got a business set up worked stupid hours started pulling in up to 90k we got a big house holidays ect now here is the relevant part my sister was able to have a tutor to get her into the grammar school that I just missed out on.

In the 3-5-2 the CBs on the flanks are a little more at risk for exposurr as well since they're pretty involved in shifting over to close things down when the flanks. Toure has been beaten this way more than once.

I firmly believe that Sakho is the second best CB in the squad behind Agger and at just 23 years old he still has loads of potential, he will get way better. Toure has incredible experience but at times his defending is nothing short of desperate. He manages to do the job but it can look really close more often than it should. He just about managed to keep Benteke from wrecking us but it was so nervy and uncomfortable to watch. I don't get that same feeling with Sakho, he looks powerful and assertive in his decision making. He will dominate the bigger forwards like Benteke and Lukaku, he's basically built for it.  Skrtel is in great form and while his play in possession has improved he isn't as good with the ball as Sakho, nor is he as good 1v1 or in transition play.

Countries such as Hungary and the Ukraine have a long tradition of eating horsemeat; yet they have absolutely shocking welfare standards for horses. And they have a lot of crime of horses who are stolen and sold to the meat man, leaving their owners devastated and never able to find their pets again. I have no idea where she pulled this idea from but I strongly suspect it may be the part of her body that she sits on. Probably the only country that I can think she may be modelling this on is Iceland - but they are a country with a long and proud tradition of raising *useful* horses and culling the ones that don't make the grade for meat because what is the use of keeping one that's unrideable and you can't afford to feed your family tomorrow let alone the horse outside that keeps throwing your son into the snow and bites anyone that comes near him? We don't have that culture. 

I don't mind the idea of eating horse meat, as long as it's highly ethical, like chicken, beef and pork, but selling horsemeat will NOT improve welfare standards, it will diminish them even further. And whilst in this country we are by and large good at treating our pets with respect, it will not stop the scumbags who don't feed their horses or get the farrier out to them - it will encourage them to buy more and sell them for meat. 

BTW, I say all this as a firm horse lover and lifetime rider - the 'horses are pets!' argument doesn't wash with me. They are too big and powerful to be treated as pets. They need respect.
