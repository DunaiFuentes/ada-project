Right, and I agree that its use as a homophobic slur sucks, but what I'm saying it it's already morphing away from this, and words don't just change meaning overnight, or stop meaning one thing before the start meaning another thing. Its continued use as a generalised half-jokey insult will bring forward its demise as a homophobic slur, making it taboo, putting it off limits, will retard that progress.

Which previous elections are you talking about that indicate Labour are well positioned to retake power. If it slipped your mind the last General Elections (yes, you know, the one that matters) Labour lost their mandate/.

Are you talking about opinion polls? If so when has a opinion poll (other than in a land slide) ever been an accurate gauge for the outcome of a GE.

This not a fact. Its a observation. Its also an observation that is warped as QT draws a cross section of a constituency If that constituency is Labour, Lib Dem, Tory then the views and reactions will not be a fair representation of the Nation.

My point was that the words ""dumb"", ""idiot"", ""imbecile"" ""moron"" and similar were all at one time clinical descriptions for people with various psychological or mental illnesses or disabilities. (I've been using the 1881 census for the past couple of years and such words appear sometimes in a person's entry)

In the same way, retard and spastic have dropped from medical use and somewhat passed on into common use as insults. Although, I don't think spastic has continued on - apart from with certain age groups.

To call someone an ""idiot"" in general terms now isn't taken as much of a big deal. Go back a few decades or so and it would be taken as quite a highly offensive insult.

(Possibly interesting point - during teacher training, a topic was raised that a teacher should never refer to someone as ""an idiot"" but it is fine to say ""stop acting *like* an idiot"".)

All clearly denigrating a particular demographic. But cunt is a body part. I think it's perfectly possible to use the word cunt without trivialising or invoking oppression, unlike those other words.

The whole 'op is a fag' is from that same message board. It originates from the hypothetical 'original poster' who is presumably behind the guise of anonymity. [This link](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/op-is-a-faggot) provides a good insight into it, you can also search other memes or internet culture on the site and find explanations. 



If you have any other questions feel free to ask. 



The vital thing to remember is a lot of the current internet culture is derived around our adaptation to the ability to post things anonymously. When anonymous, you lose a personal attachment to your posts and therefore can't feel too upset or unhappy if someone attacks that post - it doesn't necessarily represent you hence personal offence *can't* be taken. (this obviously has exceptions). Because of this, people try even harder to insult others and in doing so, do not hold back as they have no repercussions for their actions. 


Things on reddit aren't *as* anonymous as you have a 'username' but it's still a far cry from representing your 'person' and the internet culture allows people to do exactly that. Represent things about you that you may not do in real life, or represent things you're not. Clearly someone who posts a lot of serious comments and has an old account will take more offence to insults than someone with multiple accounts, some of which could be novelty accounts who uses them to make more light hearted generic comments.

true,lemoninfluence,null,null,"&gt;You say that like before we joined the EU that we were some kind of monsters with no rights and no way to progress as a society.

&gt;We can handle all of that on our own perfect fine, thank you.

I doubt it. We've already had this government looking to remove itself from the ECHR in order to deport someone. And a large part of the complaints about the EU is the fact that it restricts our parliamentary sovereignty, but in order to fully protect fundamental rights (which we didn't do to any reasonable extent before the ECHR and the Human Rights Act) you need special protection of those rights which is in itself a restriction of parliamentary sovereignty. And given the conservative nature of the party, I can't see them being willing to reform the legal system in such a way as to tie parliament's hands in the future.

&gt;Then why on earth do you trust foreign politicians with them? Because you have some stereotype in your mind about X nationality being liberal or Y nationality being honest? They're all as bad as each other.

No, because there are considerable barriers in the way of altering the ECHR, not least of which is because there are a plethora of politicians from different backgrounds. And while they all have the same potential for abusing our rights, it's less likely that they'll all want to do it at once. Separation of powers, it's an old concept that's applied in pretty much all western civilisations.

&gt;Do they have a fully fleshed out General Election manifesto? No, of course not, why would they? They have the luxury of waiting to see what the country is like closer to the time then responding to it accordingly - exactly as Labour is doing and exactly as the LibDems would be doing if they weren't in coalition.

This is a local election though and none of the issues presented by UKIP can be addressed at local government level. And none of that changes the fact that it's all apparently underpinned by the money saved by the sonic screwdriver of UKIP politics, our exit from the EU (which will definitely have no impact whatsoever economically, socially or politically). Meanwhile the wonderfully vague ""more personal freedoms"" and ""less tax"" promises will boil down to a tax cut for the rich and the ability to discriminate against minorities.

Gay people were denied all the rights that you and I take for granted, and they were [put in prison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde) and [castrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) just for being who they are.

Those are just two famous examples amongst hundreds who were persecuted, many of whom are still alive today.

These words have been used against GSMs when they've been beaten up and assaulted, often by people who society put in positions of authority (policemen, prefects and teachers).

Though the advice is still not necessarily good - it depends on the job and your suitability for it. I'll present this hard truth by way of an example: 

Last week I recruited for a contract IT software tester in the North of the UK. We received in excess of 250 applications from all across the country in just one week - a look through these quite quickly showed that a healthy portion hadn't read the specification of what we were looking for (including those lacking in necessary skills, those seeking a higher rate than advertised but ""just wanted to see if they'd offer £400/day, rather than the advertised £350/day"" etc.). 

Plenty of people then, who hadn't grasped what we were looking for.

Then there's the awkward truth that some people will mess you around. We've found people contracts in the past who have dropped out after only a week or two of work because they found something they preferred that was more local to their home in London (far from the North where the job is), or it paid more, or whatever the reason might be. That's personal preference of course - but it *does* leave us and our client in a problem. 

I mention that because when I go on to say that we had a number of calls from candidates in remote locations without much contract history or with questionable experience - well it does tie us up in speaking with people who might not be right for the role. 

It would be great if we could speak to all 250 individually, but we're a business as well. Our business comes from removing the workload for our clients by finding the best possible people for the jobs - but we have to be business minded about it as well, so calling all 250 people is just not going to happen. It's wasted effort. That's the hard truth. 

And if it sounds like calling 250 people isn't that hard - fair enough - but then consider that any one consultant with our company could have between 10 and 20+ active positions to recruit for at any time... then consider the other (up to hundreds) of applications they might get for *those* roles. Then there's speaking with clients, organizing interviews and all the other daily tasks in the job. 

Short version? We might need velcro shoelaces but some of us have *very* busy days and fielding calls from candidates who hope (but might not be right) isn't what we can really do. 

So be sure before you call - that you're really *really* the right person. Being eager is great, but be sensible about it. 

(Apologies if this appears rant-like but it's important to get the finer details of ""our side"" of things down as well - a great many people will never see what actually goes on inside a recruitment office and whilst there are always cowboys, there are also hard working people trying to do a good job - just like any other industry). 

CV-Library does go on to make some good points about leaving it a few days to call though (although if you're right for it, we **will** call you) and not being too pushy. It's not great when you already know that a candidate is seeking more money for a job than your client is prepared to give - but the candidate still wants you to make an application 'just to see'. 

Dare I say it, people on both sides of that fence have trouble with shoelaces sometimes ;)

I think the biggest flaw is that you can't buy every drug you want. There is one or two drugs for one purpose and if you have not-dangerous side effects BUT there is a drug that does the same but doesn't cause that side effects, you still can't buy it. You also can't buy them with your own money for unknown reasons. As an example: my mother needs hormone plasters. That one hormone plaster she got was perfect. No side effects or anything. Then the insurance company decided that she doesn't get that hormone plaster anymore and has to buy anohter brand. That one gives her weird rashes but she can't get the other one.

And, obviously, a problem any country with universal health care suffers from: people with private insurances have a big advantage because those insurances pay a lot more. As an example: A friend of my mother needed to be x-rayed. So she called the place with the x-ray machine and they said, that they won't get an appointment in the next 4 weeks (so one month waiting for x-raying). She then called again and said that she's got private insurance and got an appointment for the next day. She shouted at them and got the appointment anyway.

I seriously wonder how they get so much support.

From what I can see, they have a very limited target audience:

EUROPE/IMMIGRATION: Bad for anyone with family in, or strong links to people in other countries.

TAX: Really, really bad for low income households. Worse than the poll tax Thatcher tried to create. Beneficial only to people earning over about £45,000 a year, ie, currently well within the 40% band.

DEFENCE: Massive defence spending increase. Unappealing to people not looking to fight more wars.

ENERGY, CLIMATE CHANGE: Ridiculous position on climate change,  very unpopular with environmentalists. Unpopular with most scientists involved in energy and efficiency R&amp;D since a lot of funding will be cut.

GAY MARRIAGE: Obviously unpopular with anyone not heterosexual.

LAW &amp; ORDER: Increased prisons and harsher sentences a short step away from a police state. Scary for anyone considered about civil liberties.

ECONOMY: Huge tax cuts on the rich and corporations, higher tax on the poor, and somehow still paying for massive defence expenditure. Doesn't make sense to economists.

SOCIAL: Against multiculturalism, obviously bad for non-white British people.

Nope, there were tons of muppets at college just like him, you see them all over as you pointed out.

&gt;understand that there are a lot of people in London, white and black, who's peer groups do talk in what could be described as a Caribbean accent or use Caribbean words. 


I don't expect people to go around talking in the Queens English, I'm far from that myself. I'll say ""I'm goin' t'shop, want owt?"" rather than ""I am going to the shop, would you like me to purchase anything for you?""

But seeing people walking round, especially posh white kids talking like ""Bare, you get me, smh, kmt, swag"" etc is fucking lame.

&gt;And what about black people, who are raised in a household where a Caribbean accent is the norm, and whose peers all talk with a Caribbean accent, who talks in a 'white' middle class accent? Are they the same as white people 'acting black'?

There's no such thing as a white accent, if you mean that sort of posh villagey accent, then I get you. I have no problem with people of any colour sounding however they were brought up. 

It surprises me sometimes when you see people who look ""really Indian"" or whatever talking with like a Cornish accent, I'd go as far to say it somewhat tickles me, but I have no issue with it.

I guess I don't really care if cockneys gonna cockney or whatever, but when you **KNOW** people are just putting it on, that's what annoys me.

&gt;Also, why would a Kenyan speaking in a Caribbean accent be any different to a white person speaking in that accent?

It's not for me or /u/cleos to tell you which words are prejudicial against minorities (or against those who are otherwise without power in society).

I believe that the whole point of awareness of these kinds of slurs is self-policing and consideration for others.

So you asked ""is moron an ableist slur?"", I searched /r/SRSdiscussion for ""moron"", because I figured they've covered this ground before.

I'm sorry you don't like the source subreddit, but taking a look at /u/cleos's reasoning on this, I find her position pretty sound.

&gt; If people I respect are asking me not to behave in a certain way, that's when I know to moderate my behaviour.

Yes, but minorities may not be able to ask us not to use slurs, due to the history and effects of oppression. So I think that necessitates checking oneself. 

There's no point in you asking me not to use the n-word if I then go and find some other way to create a new ethnic slur. There's no point if I stop using the n-word and start using some new word based on a brand of chocolate. 

So I think the whole point of not using slurs is to understand that they're not about specific individual words, but about power and institutionalised oppression and stuff.

http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/category/europe

You can look at the UK European Election results where the two most popular parties are either traditional Eurosceptics or anti-EU.

You can look at the polls when there is trouble in the EU.  When Cameron walked out of emergency talks, he polled better.

The UK has already passed a UK referendum act for if the EU tries to take more powers, or tries to enact ratchet powers in Lisbon.  It passed.  

The PM has called EU support wafer thin, and is pushing for reform which France and Germany have even ignored - to the point of not even filling in a questionnaire the UK gave them.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22061662     

Over 80% now want a referendum.

http://www.democracymovementsurrey.co.uk/dyk_pollwatch.html

Gordon Brown actively went the day after the official signing and photoshoot to sign Lisbon.  He had to sneak in through the side door it had become so toxic.

And this is how the UK feels about the EU now.  It clings onto every veto, every opt out, and politicians who don't bring the rebate meat back to the UK table are publicly chastised - only the EU is moving in a direction towards more integration and a *post national* EU federal state - and it is showing no signs of listening to an alternative UK position as pushed by Cameron in January.   

Even Labour backbenchers have been pushing for a smaller EU budget.  EU expansion into Federalism would be contrary to what is now the three largest UK popular vote parties.  At the end of last year 56% wanted to leave, and that's before more federalism, and voting reform in 2014 which will mean European Council voting will no longer have to be unanimous.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/17/eu-referendum-poll

The only way Maastricht and Lisbon passed UK veto was by the UK securing opt outs and vetoes which regular receives the ire of the EU community. If it's unpopular now, wait until they try to remove more UK powers.

Here's an FT link: 1 in 3 wanting to stay in the EU, from February.

http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cb2057fc-7917-11e2-b4df-00144feabdc0.html

When the Bruges Group did a study of those that knew about the EEA they found that 70% supported it over the EU.  When YouGov did the same thing they found a 62:38% split in favour of leaving the EU.

This is one thing I really don't get. We have the 4th highest military spending in the world, at $60bn per year, only behind Russia at $90bn, China at $166bn, and the USA at $682bn.

Now, we can't honestly be expected to match the militaries of these countries, just because they have much higher populations than us. 

Also, we won't be fighting any major ways on our own. If a major power, like China, declared war on us, we would have European and American backing. The only countries who could declare war on us and not get us help are possibly countries like Argentina, who I would assume we would be able to beat. 

So, what is the point of spending all this money?

...Later in the piece ""Chelsea’s lack of veteran leadership has been exacerbated by Didier Drogba's departure and John Terry's physical disintegration. ""

So, we have veteran players that we don't coddle and jerk off in the press, but a lack of veteran leadership? Cech? Ivanovic? Cole? Mikel? What about the aforementioned, non-jerked-off Lampard? I mean, look, you won't find a bigger Chelsea homer than me, but remember all the talk about how Terry was the bionic man, and all the times when he raced back from an injury weeks before expected? That catches up with you. Injuries are cumulative, and the guy just hasn't been right all season. 


""Others believe the veteran is being punished for his loyalty to Chelsea regimes past, pointing to the recent FA Cup semifinal loss against Manchester City when the goal-scoring midfielder was left on the bench, deprived of one more chance to play the hero.""

If he cared so much about staying, having reaped millions of pounds over the last decade just from his wages to say nothing of any endorsements...why does he need to score another huge payday? 

This is another thing that drives me crazy. Lamps doesn't play CAM anymore, he's back in the pivot in midfield. Did we need a goal? Obviously. Could Frank have provided that goal? Sure. Maybe. Who knows. Lamps didn't get on the field because he gets forward at every opportunity, moreso than usual, so that he can try and nab his 203rd goal, leaving the back 4 totally exposed. I mean, seriously, I have never seen the man move faster than he was against Basel when he was racing into the box to try and grab a garbage time goal. Tracking back? Nah, no calories need to be wasted there.

Also, one last thing that I just cannot comprehend. You hear it every single game from the commentators...Chelsea are on pace to play 69 games this year, the most ever by a prem side...you don't think that takes a toll on the players? Shitload of games + paper thin squad = tired legs = dropped points. But no, we're losing because Frank and Terry have been mistreated by management. 

Whatever. Rant over. It's the name on the front of the shirt that matters, not the one on the back. KTBFFH.

Yes - they're against it and the others are for it. You can't argue that civil partnerships are effectively the same, because then there's even less justification for their refusal to support marriage.

&gt; I'm sure there will be a prebate in the flat tax for anyone below the poverty line. The main goal of flat tax is to prevent loopholes for the rich who hide their money.

How would it conceivably achieve that? A flat tax rate and removing tax loopholes are two completely different things; the rich do not reduce their tax burden by pretending to be in a lower tax bracket. There is an argument that fewer wealthy people would dodge tax, but certainly not enough to compensate for nearly halving the top tax rate. I also think it's a little ludicrous to say that it's their 'main' reason for reducing tax on the wealthy.

&gt; Nuclear power stations are probably the best way forward on environmental issues. So I don't take issue with their stance.

They also plan to increase coal power stations, and don't think carbon emissions are a problem because they don't believe in global warming. They're correct on nuclear power stations, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.

&gt; I don't think you should lump tax cuts and defense expenditure together. These should be separate issues but then again I don't want an increase in the defense budget. 

They're both very much part of the budget, so must absolutely be considered together.

I don't see how a flat tax would make it more difficult for rich people to avoid tax. Avoiding tax is about getting your earnings classed as something other than income. The rate of tax has nothing to do with it! Certainly getting rid of a progressive tax system will not have any effect on it.

To stop tax avoidance, you find the loopholes and close them. It's not the system that is complicated, it's the tax advisors who make it complicated. Chanting the income tax rate to one number isn't going to stop them from doing it.

They don't say anywhere how they will help low income households so I won't assume they'll ""do some rebates or something"". Even if they did rebates for low income people, isn't that just a pointless and inefficient way of having progressive tax anyway? It just doesn't make any sense except as a way of reducing tax for rich people.

Preventing the government informing paramilitaries they know will kill someone of that individual's location, to execute by proxy (Shaghan v UK)

The legalisation of homosexuality in Northern Ireland (Dudgeon v UK)

Stopping contempt of court from infringing on freedom of the press (Sunday Times v UK)

The mentally ill who voluntarily commit themselves to an institution are owed the same duty - suicide watch etc - as those who are sectioned (Rabone v Pennine Care)

Ensuring that existing prisoners still get access to solicitors (Golder v UK)

Ensuring that workers maintain rights to join trade unions (Wilson v UK)

Giving the police an obligation to act if somebody is being dangerously stalked (Osman v UK)

Preventing indefinite detention under the declaration of a national emergency (A v SOS for the Home Dept).

Preventing public birching of children by the police in the Isle of Man (Tyrer v UK)

Retention of DNA &amp; fingerprint data by the state must have limitations (S &amp; Marper vs UK)

No, but a Bill is under way and likely to be introduced under this government.

&gt; It would bring in more money. If they are no loopholes to exploit you can't exploit them. I'm more interest in the pound amount then the percentage. The pound amount would be higher.

Loopholes involve using methods to keep income outside the standard tax structure. It doesn't matter how flat your income tax structure is - there are plenty of necessary transactions outside it, and those are what are misused for tax avoidance. There are also difficult aspects of international financial law which enable tax avoidance (and evasion) which would not be fixed by a flat income tax rate. As I said, a flat tax rate will not bring us any closer to preventing tax avoidance/evasion. The pound amount would not increase.

We're a net importer of coal. We would simply be importing more coal to pollute  the environment.

I don't understand. All government spending is based on overall tax receipts - it's called the budget, and it's quite important. UKIP are threatening to throw defence spending completely out of whack with it.

For a long time it was the Tories (boo!) and the Whigs (yay!). The Tories turned into Conservative and the Whigs into Liberal. Along came Labour, and sadly the Liberal party faded away, so that it was just Conservatives and Labour.

Sometimes another party became a bit significant then faded away.

FPTP lends to a 2 party system and I think unless we develop proportional representation we won't get more than that. 

It seems that since Labour replaced the Liberal party it is possible for one of the 2 parties to be replaced - indeed in 1997 the conservative landslide defeat by labour meant people talked about conservatives no longer being a force, and it was conceivable that the LibDems would replace them. Didn't happen of course.

The only plausible way of UKIP surviving in the long term is for the conservative party to split along the European line. Joining mainly into UKIP and some into the Libdems (who's social democrat credentials are slim), with some SDP going to Labour.

I have, however, said gay on many an occasion to refer to something being annoying or bad. From a young age it was one of many words that, I guess as children we could get away with a little bit more than using actual swear words. It's something I've grown up doing, and very rarely associated it with gay people - funnily, being gay has something I have never really cared about, it's their choice and I was never brought up with anyone trying to instil that it was bad, it was simply just never talked about, like racism. A person's sexual preference is just that, it's theirs, it has nothing to do with me, and honestly, I'd be flattered if someone said they were interested, but I'd tell them I wasn't gay and move on.

So I don't know that what you're saying is really entirely true, having grown up calling all manner of things ""gay"", I actually really have nothing against gay people - obviously, as I've grown up I began to realise the real meaning of it and rarely use the word any more, although I do some times find it hard to choose a word and find myself calling something gay, it's usually only in the company of friends where I find myself caring less about choosing words than I do around others that I don't know as well.

As an adult, I can certainly say that calling someone specifically that, yes, it certainly does give those sort of connotations, as we grow up we become more aware of what words really mean and how to use them, but there are many teens on reddit and young people in general that may not have reached that point, so I can be a little more forgiving of it happening when it is a younger person that doesn't necessarily understand the impact of what they are saying, but when it's an older person, then it certainly does start to seem like they're doing it, fully aware of what they are saying, and that makes it worse in my eyes.

&gt;Greer also alludes to the fact that the word vagina, which is considered the non-vulgar term, was a Latin name given by male anatomists for all muscle coverings, meaning ""sword-sheath"". She considers it contentious as cunt has no such meaning, it simply refers to the entire female genitalia (she also mentions that vagina is applied purely to the internal canal).

So I would suggest on that basis, vagina is more sexist than the word cunt ever could be. Please don't accuse me of being obtuse. I'm genuinely trying to have a conversation with you here. From what I can gather from the 70's feminism that sought to eliminate disparaging terms for women, the main argument against it was that it reduced a woman to a mere body part. In that sense, I can't see how calling a man a cunt would contribute to reducing a woman to mere body part. I've actually gone on to read about this, so to call me obtuse seems extremely disingenuous. I am genuinely curious as to how it has historical ties to oppression of women. Now in the USA, it does appear that it is an insult reserved for women. However, given that in the UK it is not used in that respect, I don't think it can be considered to be such a sexist a slur. Given my recent research I could understand how in the USA it could be considered a sexist term in the USA. But slurs need to have history of oppression tied to them for a word to be considered a slur against a particular demographic IMO. Given that it is not a gender insult word in the UK, I don't see how that can be said to be the case.

Prick is literally the word male genitalia. I call women pricks sometimes. I'm not saying anything about men in that instance. Likewise the same applies to the word cunt should I use it against a man. It doesn't have any historical context of oppression, at least not in the UK. These are not gender specific insults. The word cunt is not tied to the oppression of women, nowhere near in the same way that the words faggot, or queer, or nigger are attached to oppression.

I'm honestly seeking to be educated on this topic. But if you're simply going off of biology, without any historical context of oppression, I fail to see how a vulgar biological reference can be considered a slur against any particular demographic. I fail to see how using genitalia as insults denigrates either sex. If you're going down that route, in a world full a patriarchal oppression, where clearly women were looked down upon, and who's treatment has been nothing short of disgusting for thousands of years, then why in these patriarchal societies is a vulgar word for penis just as common an insult as the vulgar word for vagina. If there is some historical context I am missing, please share it with me. But if there is no historical context, I cannot consider it a slur, I won't consider anyone using it a bigot &amp; nor will I consider them ignorant. I just fail to see how the word cunt is tied to any of this oppression. I really do. The are so many words that could be tied to the oppression of women, but cunt just seems to me to be another arbitrary swear based on human genitalia. I can't see it being tied to oppression, anywhere.",0,1367601246,null,0,1367601470,0,c9rripi,t3_1dlzy2,t1_c9rripi,t1_c9rr25h,null,1431336299,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Negative:

*Thieving

*Rough

*Benefits cheats

Positive:

*Good sense of humour

*Good at making music

*Friendly/welcoming


Other:

*Politically left wing


In my experience thieving/rough/benefits cheats stereotypes are no more true than in other places with a similar economic situation, however, Liverpool has some pretty rough areas which may add to that impression.

The music is really good. I really like the underground punk/rock 'n' roll scene. However, there is a bit of a sense that music *must* be good if it's from Liverpool, so some of the stuff that's more desperate for acceptance can get carried away.

The friendly/welcoming stereotype seems fairly true. It can be quite nice to have a stranger chat with you if you're in the right mood. If you're not it can be annoying.

The humour thing... Can be annoying. Some annoying people think they *must* be funny if they're from Liverpool, and this encourages them.

The left-wing thing I find very true. Liverpool has a particular 'brand' (among slightly older people) of hard-line, unreformed, working-class socialism, which I rather like.

Huh? Historically not; now, yes. They've been gradually moving things in the right direction for a while now, including the introduction of civil partnerships, equalising the age of consent and so on. It's an area of law that was terrible just 20 years ago but is much better now. Change doesn't happen overnight, but the mainstream parties are continuing to move in the right direction; UKIP is not.

&gt; No everything is taxed that same hence the term flat. There no loopholes. You should take an economics class.

No, *income* is taxed the same. To quote Wikipedia, ""A flat tax (short for flat tax rate) is a tax system with a constant marginal rate, usually applied to individual or corporate income."" For example, UKIP want to abolish inheritance tax - which would obviously not be at the same tax rate. Small financial gifts would not be taxed at 25%. Money given to a spouse would not be taxed at 25%. Money paid to an oversees shell corporation would not be taxed at 25%. Money allegedly moved between personal bank accounts would not be taxed at 25%. Understand?

&gt; How much coal?

45m tonnes of the 65m tonnes we currently burn. This would obviously increase if we increased the number of coal power stations.

&gt; You focus on defense only in a massive pot of other spending is silly and you know it.

No, if they were suggesting a big increase in any area of public spending while promising tax cuts and a reduced deficit that would be cause for concern. The fact is that it's defence in which they've promised a massive spending increase, which is why I'm focusing on it. It also implies even more savage cuts to other areas than would otherwise be necessary to achieve that tax cut (and they do stand for a smaller government with lower spending). As the tories' struggle has demonstrated, we are not in a situation where it's easy to make vast cuts without significant effect.

true,generic_human_1979,null,null,"&gt; Due to the way the votes are counted a vote for the Liberals is worth less than a vote for the other two.

It's not that they're worth less, it's that you're not voting for a particular party to run the country, but for your local area. From that, the party running the country is considered to be the one running the most areas. For example, if you have 100 seats, with 100 constituents voting for each seat, and in all areas they vote 51 for party A, and 49 for party B, then party A will win all the seats, despite party B receiving 49% of the votes. AV doesn't really fix this, since it's still the party with the most seats that wins, but it does mean that within each seat it becomes a little less of a binary choice of most/least votes, and becomes a little more based on the general popularity of a candidate in an area, and through that smaller parties have a better hope.

I don't really know the proposals for proportional representation, but it seems to me to conflict with a party system.

true,The_Bravinator,lancashire,Lancashire,"As someone who's lived in both countries, I do think there's a genuine difference. In the UK we use a much greater wealth of body words to describe things both good and bad. ""Dick"" ""asshole"" ""twat"" ""ballsed it up"" ""that's the tits"" and so on. While ""cunt"" is a word that still has some power, it never (and I'm saying this very personally, as a woman who obviously does not speak for anyone other than myself) it never *felt* like a gendered insult. It didn't *feel* like it was imbued with all this derogatory stuff about women.

When Americans use it, the word is much more charged, and much more gendered. It's almost always used against women, and it's got a very particular feel to it. You can almost *sense* the contempt behind it. The woman so labeled is a bitch, weaker, lesser, worthy of nothing but scorn. And even with that weight, it's thrown out so very frequently and casually against so many women for the smallest of offenses.

I'm no sociologist, so all I can speak from is my own experience. But while I choose not to throw the word around except when discussing it, my *reaction* to it will be very different depending on its cultural context. Because when it comes to slurs, cultural context is really all that makes them what they are.

I understand that many people feel differently from me on this, though--that the word is always a gendered slur--and I respect that.

I believe the argument relates to how so many laws passed in the European parliament affect those living in the UK. Also, leaving the EU would require a voiding of the original Treaty of accession (or so I believe). Here's a rough idea of how EU legislation works currently:

Treaties:

Primary legislation, fundamental and constitutional framework, created by negotiation between States. These have to be ratified by each Member State (normally through a parliamentary vote; sometimes by referendum) before the treaty comes into effect. Possibly one of the most famous treaties of recent times was Maastricht, which created the Euro single currency. The UK opted out of that one. Leaving Europe would require the UK to void the original Treaty of accession and this would need to be ratified by Parliament. Given that ratification of treaties happens frequently via referenda, this would appear to be a logical step if the UK were to leave the EU.

Legislation:

This is where EU law is created, enabling it to fulfil its responsibilities. Classed as secondary legislation, below Treaties.

Regulations:

Apply to all countries in the EU; the most direct form of EU law and which affect most people. As soon as a Regulation is passed, it has binding legal force throughout every Member State, on a par with national laws. The classic example is weights and measures regulations, forcing all goods in Europe to be sold in metric quantities. The UK can still sell such goods as milk and beer in pints, but you'll note the label that also quotes ""568ml"" on pints. This is where many people in the UK start quoting urban myths, such as cucumbers have to be straight; bananas have to be curved; etc. The point is, these laws are not passed by the UK Parliament. Once Europe passes a Regulation, it is binding on all countries. This pisses some people off.

Directives:

Similar to Regulations, however, although the desired outcome is binding, the individual States can decide the methodology on how to put the new ""law"" into place. National authorities therefore must take action to make the Directive a part of national law. Most Directives I've come across relate to the cross-border trading of financial services (e.g. MiFID) but I'm sure there are many other examples.

Decisions:

EU Decisions are aimed at a specific country and are binding upon that country only (rather than the whole of the EU). For example, when BSE was found in cattle in the UK, the EU passed a Decision banning the UK from exporting cattle to the rest of Europe.

tl;dr Many people don't like the fact that ""unelected"" officials in Europe can pass a law that impacts on UK citizens. As we joined Europe via a Treaty of accession - which had to be ratified - a referendum would be a logical way of voiding the Treaty and leaving the EU.",0,1367603283,null,0,false,0,c9rs8xp,t3_1dmjb7,t1_c9rs8xp,t3_1dmjb7,null,1431335955,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Frankly, what the non-EU figure is now means little (UKIP aren't even here on an anti-non eu immigration basis); people are voting for them because many of the British Public want to utterly reject the doctrine of Multiculturalism and despise the main parties for allowing such waves of unskilled immigrants to come in over the last number of decades. Many simply hold the view that if somebody wants to come to this country, they must be able to speak the language and must adapt to us; we should not be adapting to them. UKIP are the only major party to reject multiculturalism.

Not only that, but a whole area of once low-skilled jobs for the young has been ripped from the British people due to over 590,000 immigrants, many eastern european and with relevant experience, many of whom take these jobs for minimum wage and on zero hours contracts, essentially stopping any young brits with 0 experience getting into a job in that sector; pushing them onto benefits and ruining any hope of them moving up the social ladder.

Ok, what you meant to say was travel at least as fast as air travel.  It's irrelevant what the method of transport actually is.  Imagine something as magical as heavier than air flying machines were in 1900.

The vast majority of goods are transported around the world on ships actually.  I think you're overestimating the importance of being able to get people around the world quickly, especially now with the Internet.  So if (when if no alternative to gas turbine engines is invented) air travel ceases, yeah we wouldn't be able to go on holiday to Australia without travelling for a week, but we'd still be able to get all around Europe within a day and trade goods internationally.

Take a look at the people who *typically* use these words. The stereotype is the 13 year old xbox live kid, right? A kid born *this* century, lives in leafy suburbia and has grown up taking modern life for granted.

These kids don't properly understand what homophobia or racism actually is. We've come *so* far in Human rights in such a short space of time that we've actually managed to raise a generation of kids who don't really believe it ever happened. 

They've never seen systematic bigotry, they've grew up looking up to rich, successful and adored black men &amp; women. They have a black president. Gay people in TV/Movies/Music is an every day thing and isn't ""edgy"" anymore.

They feel safe using words like Nigger and Faggot because they literally can't conceive of a world where someone would actually think the things those words imply, at least without being ridiculed by everyone around them. They **know** their friends won't assume bigotry when they use these words. They aren't scared of the connotations because to them there aren't any. It's just an insult.

Call it rose tinted spectacles but to these kids who are 13/14/15/16/17 etc racism is the old crazy guy on the street corner nobody listens to. It's the teacher who gets fired and loses everything or that one news story they read where once somebody got beat up for the colour of their skin.

Does bigotry still exist? Fuck yes it does and these kids will almost certainly discover it when they start looking for jobs, voting, interacting in any meaningful way with anyone &gt;25 *but* right now they just see 'faggot' as an insult from a by gone age. A relic from back when people were idiots.

That's the word, by the way - not ""offended"". I think a trigger is like a PTSD reaction - like a solder gets after the war.

My dad used to tell me about the teachers at Manchester Grammar - him and his mates would drop a [metal pencil case](http://i.imgur.com/fxciUOm.jpg) on the floor and their latin master would take cover under the desk. Like, he'd throw his chair over backwards and hit the deck, 'cause he was shell-shocked from the war - any loud noise'd set him off.

That's what they used to call PTSD back in the day - shell-shock. Poor bastard would spend the rest of the lesson with his hands shaking. Fucking hilarious when you're 15, like, spend the whole lesson trying not to laugh, but it makes you think, doesn't it? What those guys must have been though.

I thought the idea of safe spaces was that not everywhere needs to be like that. But I don't know. It seems a bit redundant when the same word is across the top of the page. 

Yes, as I understand it rape survivors (and I think it's politer these days to use that word) can suffer PTSD. And I guess they can suffer triggers or shell-shock. If you want to make this subreddit a safe-space, then you should talk to the mods about that.

Offended is something else. I think there are significant elements of harmfulness about that. I mean, in the case of some of these guys, it's just a matter of denying them basic human rights, arresting them for being who  they are (like it would be if you got arrested for being scouse or for liking girls) and then using that word.

&gt; There has been a year upon year decrease in non-EU immigration

&gt; Non-EU immigration has fallen from over 350K to under 250K since 2002, and is on the downward trend.

&gt; Work visas have dropped by over 70K since 2002.
&gt; So which particular non-EU visas/immigrants do you see as being the problem?

Yes, non-eu immigration.

http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/376108/Britain-has-highest-immigration-in-EU

&gt; Research by the EU's statistics arm Eurostat has revealed Britain in 2010 had the largest intake of immigrants at 591,000.

These are EU immigrants, not non-EU ones.

&gt; Immigration into Britain has been on the increase since 1997. In 2003, numbers exceeded 400,000 and by 2004 it was 500,000 when the borders were opened to Poland and other EU countries.

&gt; The UK population now stands at 63.2million with one in eight residents now born abroad.


Here's a bit more.


http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/dec/11/2011-census-data-key-points

• 13% in England and Wales born outside UK.

• Just over half of these arrived in last 10 years.

• 37% of Londoners born in foreign country.

Many of the British public are sick. Here's a few more interesting facts.

http://yougov.co.uk/news/2012/12/17/perilous-politics-immigration/
&gt; Over the last decade has the level of immigration been good or bad for Britain?
&gt; 67% bad

&gt; I am concerned with Britain losing its culture: 68%

Basic training is a bit of a culture shock for most, but it's not too bad as long as you expect it to be hard. It's been over 16 years since mine though, and I've never done a recruit training job, so I'm not the best person to ask about that. There is an RAF forum [here](http://www.e-goat.co.uk/forums/forum.php) which is apparently very helpful to people who have questions. I don't use it myself, I can't think of anything worse than talking shop in my own time. 

Life depends upon where you are and what job you do. We have some bases that are almost all RAF and others which have all services working together. The accommodation caries depending on where you are posted to, sometimes it's shit, other times it isn't. 

The hours will depend on your trade, if you do admin and general support type jobs like that it's usually 8-5. If you're a techy it could be that or more likely it will be shift work depending on the times the guys are flying. 

There are so many different roles and trades it's really difficult to give you any specific information that can help. If you were thinking of joining the RAF you'd be best to do your aptitude tests, see what they offer and then find people on the RAF forum who can tell you specifically about that trade and the various jobs within it. What's always good to find out is what possible posting locations you could have, some trades get some nice gucci posting locations, others don't. 

It's not particularly easy in any three of the forces these days, we have admin clerks out on patrols out in Helmand these days, which would have been pretty much unheard of a few years ago, we've had to adapt to become more of a fighting force even with our ground personnel, we used to generally send out officers to war, these days pretty much everyone goes. 

I'm not going to get into some pissing contest with the RN or the Army guys on here about which is the best or whatever, it's horses for courses, we all do different things for different reasons. I am glad I'm in the RAF, I've had the opportunity to travel a bit, but probably not as much as I'd liked, especially as the last two have been Afghanistan, with a third trip out there coming up. It's not the greatest place in the world but I've always tried to make the best of things even when in a shitehole FOB or PB somewhere in Helmand. I've met some of the best people I've ever known in the shithole desert. 

Whatever you choose, wherever you end up, if you do choose a career in the forces I wish you all the best for the future and I hope you have some of the interesting, challenging and fun experiences I've had over the years. Good luck.

Sorry?

That article confirms exactly what I said. Dyslexia/Dysgraphia/Dyscalculia are identified as specific learning difficulties. However as a spectrum the article describes wide ranging and potentially profound difficulties combining, excluding or going beyond these.

Moreover, I don't think a poorly cited, outdated wiki article is especially appropriate on this subject.

I would recommend slightly more informed sources such as [mencap](http://www.mencap.org.uk/all-about-learning-disability) or the [Foundation for people with learning difficulties](http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/help-information/about-learning-disabilities/definition-learning-disability/). The definition can, though does not necessarily, include condition such as cerebral palsy and autism.

Granted the term learning *difficulty* and learning *disability* can sometimes be mangled. However they are quite definitely used interchangably by many professionals. (Edit sorry I mixed up a word)

For this reason Specific Learning Difficulty is used for the Dyslexia/Dysgraphia/Dyspraxia range. Abbreviated to SpLD. I have some experience, with this, as I have one, and have dealt with professional for it for many years.

If you are ""actually retarded"" as you put it then not being able to learn is EXACTLY what your problem is, and its trying to help with that that most treatment is focussed.

True true. I must admit it can be hard to wrap your head around the issues and complexities that the lgbt community face. It's probably safe to say that many redditors haven't met anyone from the trans community and so their understanding is a little limited. I confess that I am rather ignorant of lgbt issues and am still learning about it, when I grew up in Singapore I didn't know any openly gay people (it was and still is illegal, although not enforced) although there were a few people that are now openly gay. At the time I wasn't anti gay (I've always had a pretty liberal attitude to life) but would sometimes use the word gay in a negative connotation (eg; 'that's so gay' ect, kids can be stupid  although I never said anything like faggot or other homophobic slurs). I also had a feeling that gay marriage probably wasn't a good idea mainly because I thought it might affect the child's upbringing (which is a little ironic considering how shitty my parents were, especially my Dad). 

I kind of get what its like to not seriously think about an issue, to think of it more of an abstract idea then something that actually exists and that ignorance can have such a detrimental effect to individuals. 

My current girlfriend is bisexual, who for a long time identified as a lesbian but in recent years has discovered her sexuality and her gender is a little more grey than black and white. This is something that takes me a little while to wrap my head around but I try to be supportive.

The answer to your question is in your question.

There is no ""tax evaders"". Tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance is perfectly legal. What these big companies and other individuals are doing is tax avoidance, which is perfectly legal, not tax evasion.

If you and the government don't like it, then change the law. Companies have a legal obligation to their shareholders to pay the minimum tax possible. Noone is going to voluntarily pay more tax than they have to, that would not only be illegal for a large company, but stupid. If you don't like they volume of tax they are paying, then lobby the government to increase the tax rate.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"AS level government and politics student here. It's coming up to exams so I've recently revised all of this and hope you find it useful. I also hope to reassure you that I am somewhat qualified to talk about this. Let's begin:

Very simple. There's precedent in the UK to hold referendums on constitutional issues. This was primarily started by Blair with all the constitutional reform like Northern Ireland assembly, Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and the failed regional assemblies for England. This president has been continued under the Tory-Lib Dem coalition with thinks like the AV vote and the upcoming Scottish Independence referendum. 

A constitutional issue would broadly be something relating to how the powers of government are effected. Obviously all the regional assemblies effect who holds power and the AV referendum is about how we elect our politicians which is all about power. Sometimes constitutional issues can be expanded to include human rights, but that's less certain. 

What there is very clearly **not** a president for, is having referendums on social, economic diplomatic issues. Social issues are all about **benefits**, the NHS, gay marriage, what side of the road we drive on, what standards our food should be made to, how many hours people work, **trident** ect. That's all social and thus is not *not* constitutional so there's no precedent for having referendums on them.

The European Union is an *extremely* constitutional issue. The EU holds power over us^[1] and EU law is one of the sources of the UK constitution^[2]


^[1] ^(EU law supersedes UK domestic law, though we maintain *complete and utter independence* because we can amend the European Communities act at any point and thus, leave the EU. The EU cannot force us to stay in it and thus holds no binding/permanent power on us) so it definitely qualified for having a referendum over it because of the previously mentioned case of precedent.  

^[2] ^(The UK has an uncodified constitution, ie, not contained in a *single* document. Because of this we have multiple sources of the constitution ranging from: statute law, ie, acts passed by Parliament; precedent, ie, having referendums on constitutional issues; interpretation, ie, books like Erskine May sometimes are so good at explaining how the UK system works they are quoted as a source; Treaties; EU law; The Royal Prerogative; and more, but that's the main stuff.)

true,Ivashkin,null,null,"&gt; Ok, what you meant to say was travel at least as fast as air travel. It's irrelevant what the method of transport actually is. Imagine something as magical as heavier than air flying machines were in 1900.

Sub-orbital might happen, but it's still kinda flying and it will take a lot to transport people economically on a regular basis this way. The gravity tunnels idea is cool, but the infrastructure isn't technically possible with any technology we have today, and neither is the materials science. Things like teleportation might happen, but so far science is nowhere near that. So flying in some form is the only thing we have to work with, and we shouldn't not do something because of what might happen in the next half century.

&gt; The vast majority of goods are transported around the world on ships actually. I think you're overestimating the importance of being able to get people around the world quickly, especially now with the Internet. So if (when if no alternative to gas turbine engines is invented) air travel ceases, yeah we wouldn't be able to go on holiday to Australia without travelling for a week, but we'd still be able to get all around Europe within a day and trade goods internationally.

TBH I think your underestimating the importance of people being able to move around the world. I've worked with people using video conferencing, email, IM and phones but it's still nothing compared to something as simple as still down with them for a meal. The technology in this area might improve, but old fashioned human interaction is still very important.

As for goods, it's one thing to order 30K's worth of widgets from China, but another thing entirely if sending the team who designed the thing to the factory takes weeks there and the same back. It just wouldn't be feasible to do this. So if plane travel did stop, then our biggest focus wouldn't be bitching about an unused airport, but working on rebuilding the supply chains and manufacturing centers to build stuff in Europe.

&gt; And surely it's just common sense to put more money into sustainable transport than unsustainable.

Yes. This is why air travel needs to become sustainable, which means more efficient engines, new propulsion technology and so forth. Not giving up on the concept entirely. And in the UK we also have the problem that building HS2 won't be finished for 20 years or more, and even then it will only cut the entire journey from London to Edinburgh by 20-50 minutes, and will still be nearly 3 hours slower than flying.",0,1367607717,null,0,false,0,c9rtug7,t3_1dm3wg,t1_c9rtug7,t1_c9rsd2r,null,1431335203,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Wow. So now I'm stereotyping you based on a single comment, I'm a prick who think I know everything and I always make assumptions about everything..

It seemed as if you suddenly had an idea of whom I am based on no information, so I did something similar back to show you the absurdity of it. I don't know if you've experienced it on Reddit or not, but no matter how you reply, somebody will always read what they expect to read from your post, not what you actually wrote. I'm not kidding when I say I've been called a fundementalist Christian and hardcore Atheist on Reddit before. People here make too many presumptions, and you were making presumptions too.

&gt; Schedule is one thing, but interruptions are how the world works.

I don't know if you've been to university or not, but at least in my university that isn't true. The students here all have a silent agreement to not bother each other, our families will stop bothering us, and it's possible to tune out the rest of the world. Maybe it's just my university, since it's well reputed as one of the hardest Universities in the UK, maybe the world, but I only allow myself Reddit and a few games.

&gt; Your schedule could have included voting when you planned it a month ago. That's an indication of how much you care about voting.

That's also presumptuous. Did it not occur to you that I may not have known about the vote? That for the few months I've not done anything other than work on my degree? That this is the first time I've been on this subreddit in a year? 

I have to preempt you now because you've probably had a few thoughts relating to my last paragraph.

* No, nobody told me. I have nearly no British friends, and haven't seen any in weeks. I go to a very international university. Nobody here knows about elections locally.
* I didn't get a polling card this time (maybe it wasn't on in my area? But I wouldn't know because I didn't even know there *was* an election?)
* The only interaction with the outside world I've had is Reddit's technology sections, none of which relate to the UK.
* My relatives haven't heard from me in a long time.

So once again, I care about politics, if I didn't I wouldn't be so keen on defending myself here. I've never failed to vote before, but this year I didn't get a polling card and nor did I even know about it. I've not read the news in a while due to doing my final year exams in a week. My only break from revision is Reddit and a video game or two.

The veterans of manu has longevity because of how Sir Alex rotates the squad. For all the flak Rafa gets, he is trying to build that culture. Rafa understands that, and even if he was leaving this season, he isn't running players to the ground. What does he get for it? Criticism, not just from the media, the fans, even from his own players. Why does Terry or Mikel need to comment about squad rotations? It is for their own good. 

Our so called ""veterans"" keep driving managers away, undermining them. Perhaps AVB was a season too soon, but he is a good manager who could given this squad stability over the years. AVB tried to change Chelseas culture, what did he get for it? His ""veterans"" causing turmoil in the locker room. 

As far as Lampard goes, if he would love to stay so much, why can't he get a pay cut? The aging veterans of Manu does, why can't he? I won't even go into detail how selfish he has been playing as someone already has. But basically, the man has done nothing but try to get his goals, leaving his team exposed.

I just hope he gets his damn record so he can get the fuck out already. It's time for the ""old guard"" to move along and let guys like Mata and Luiz, who are genuinely good human beings, to take over.

You might not say it with reference to homosexuality, but as a word it is strongly linked with that and your listeners are quite likely to make the connection. By using a word commonly associated with gay people to describe something bad - frequently something 'unmanly' - you're perpetuating a negative association between being gay and being bad/worth mocking/effeminate, even if only subconsciously to the speaker or listener.

This is not something determined by how you *mean* the word - it's a result of how it's received and you cannot control that. You may not be being homophobic, but you're helping to normalise it. There's a chance that somebody will hear you use it casually, and when somebody uses faggot in a homophobic way or to bully someone then people will think less of it because it's just a normal word.

It also has cross-party support, it's extremely unlikely to be scrapped when Labour come in (I'm aware of the very small amount of differences between major parties anyway).


While i have no doubt this is the case i would have gone about it differently (i have put my points at the bottom).

&gt; The one thing I'm extremely worried about is the way we treat the Victorian housing stock. Anything from the 50's onwards is (relatively) straightforward to improve and there's enough work there alone to last a decade. But the pre-1919 stock. Oof. We haven't got a fucking clue how to treat it, and to treat it well. If we do it wrong we will completely fuck up the stock.

Again i totally agree, same applies to any listed buildings which may not be allowed to have any work done on them whatsoever. It is essentially setting the precedent of ""well you bought an old house, too bad, guess you have to spend more to save the same amount"". I don't think this is going to encourage anyone in that position to participate.

In what way are you involved in policy? I am doing a BSc in Conservation Biology at the moment and wanted to eventually (after possibly getting a masters in Sustainable Environmental Management) go into policy making.

The ways i would have gone about improving domestic energy efficiency are the following:

**Education**

Many people can already afford the basic energy saving toys such as LED bulbs, draught excluders, tap aerators etc etc etc however if you do not have access to the internet, which many people (especially the elderly) don't, then finding out about even these basic technologies is a chore. If you can't get people to learn about new bulbs then there is no chance of getting them to learn about solar heating, for example. 

I would have resource sustainability placed into the national curriculum, there is no point trying to teach adults to save energy if the next generation is clueless about why it is important. 

If you had enough money i would have started a huge ad campaign highlighting the economic benefits of replacing just the LED's in someones house for example, sure we know this will benefit the environment but many people don't care, what people do care about is money however.

I would set up a voluntary/temp contract network in local communities where people can share their knowledge of energy efficiency, i am planning on doing the rounds in my neighborhood who are mostly older people and giving them advice on the basics.

**Funding**

I would offer up a large monetary prize for local councils, whoever succeeds in promoting sustainability and achieving results more than anyone else gets the prize. If the prize was substantial enough this would drive local councils to compete.

I would remove vat from certain energy efficient technologies to lower the cost to the consumer.

I would supply grants to community funded energy installations where possible.

I would increase the feed-in tariffs substantially. People will be more interested in the more expensive energy technologies and be more willing to save energy if they know any excess can be sold for a decent amount. The fact they get diddly squat shows bias to the big energy companies.

I would give tax breaks to renewable energy installation companies.

**Extras**

I think this can be expanded much more, there is more to sustainability than simply saving energy. I would move into the realms of community gardens, rewilding, allotments, home growing etc to try and get people growing their own food, this in itself will save money.

I just fundamentally don't like the whole ""we all must tread on egg shells so as to not upset anybody"" culture that we seem to have in the UK. It's for this reason that Islam gets away with so much stuff by the way - because people are afraid of legitimately criticising it (and Islam really does deserve criticism in the UK) because they are so often reflexively called ""racist"" for criticising a religion. It's nonsense of course, but Islam gets away with so much for this reason.

You may think that's an unrelated segway, but I really don't - I'm talking here about the ""let's not offend anybody"" culture, which means sometimes harmful things go ignored because apparently it's a crime to hurt peoples feelings.

I'm very strongly against homophobia (just one of the reasons people who support gay rights should be pissed with Islam btw), but I disagree that simply using the word ""gay"" to indicate a light negative thing is homophobic.

When I was growing up, there was a Pakistani family on my street. I became friends with their son, who was a year younger than me. It was just normal life for me - I'd go round to Omair's all the time. His mum used to cook this AMAZING curry - so much better than the stuff you see in most restaurants (although there are some great Indian restaurants in this country nowadays), and I'd go round a lot. I went to his so much that I started knowing some of their customs and playing Pakistani games with them sometimes and stuff like that. I was also exposed to many films that we'd now know as bollywood films.

I used to find these films hilarious, because they were so over the top. They were so cheesy and over dramatic, and every single film I ever saw (or this is the memory I have) had these mass scenes where the entire cast was singing a cheesy love song.

One day in school, I was laughing about one of these songs and started imitating it. I got sent to the headmasters office for it. My parents were called in and I was put in the ""racist report book"" for it. It wasn't until Omair's parents found out and visited the school themselves to protest that it was taken off my school record - fucking bullshit, and it's all down to the fact that people just like you, who mean well, take things too far, can't take context into account, and create a situation where we all have to walk on eggshells all the time.

So up for sale is possibly one of the best custom made beds you will ever see 

&gt;I build things from scratch for people whom expect the best 
I am described as a fantasy builder, I can put a model of your business in a bottle or build a childs playhouse that stops traffic, 
rocket powered skateboards, robot bugs, anything thats a little out of the square 

&gt;I have multiple endorsements including museums, and top end firms 

&gt;I am personally endorsed by Sir Richard Taylor of Weta Workshop, for being a multitalented artist including restoration,
of just about anything and exquisite one off handmade models 
Sir Richard has my models in his collection in the foya of Weta 

&gt;What you are looking at is my form of art 

&gt;This job has over 500 hidden screws in it 
The paint has over 15 coats and then it is made to look old on the outside and high gloss on the inside 
The woodwork is fastidious 

&gt;I didnt recess the hinges so to leave a gap for the mattress to breathe 

&gt;The police light (12v) can stay on or off 
when left on at night it leaves the southern cross sign on the ceiling (it shines like a lighthouse bulb would) 

&gt;There is also a chain of LED lights on the roof ( 12v) they have six different pulse settings 
it makes your whole ceiling look like the Tardis is taking off its mind blowing! 

&gt;Once you open the 1970s lock, you will find a handmade Doctor Who replica talking , yes I said talking telephone! 
It says 3 or 4 different things, 
then when the secret button is pushed the green light turns blue 
then pulses and makes the Tardis sound 
It is loud enough to know when your child is not sleeping! 
The telephone runs on 3 AAA batteries and lasts for ages 

&gt;When the brass locks are undone the picture is then pulled down to reveal a full sized single bed 
the mattress sits well when folded up and cannot be seen

In terms of the actual universe, the ""slow moving Angel"" can be justified by the situation: Their fight-or-flight response of turning to stone was being triggered by something other than someone looking at them; which meant that the response was not as absolute or total as it would normally be.

But what made the Angels hyper-effective as an engine of terror is that the TV viewers counted: If we were looking at them, they were frozen even if none of the characters currently in the scene could see them. Allowing us to see the Angels moving broke what fundamentally made them scary.

I thought the first half of the two-parter actually did a really nice job of adding depth to their lore, though: The whole ""image of an angel is an angel"" and ""don't look them in the eye"" aspects were terrifying considering how much time you'd spent staring them down from your couch.",0,1367612371,null,0,false,0,c9rvhw8,t3_1dlzyv,t1_c9rvhw8,t1_c9rmfbq,null,1431334424,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

Why? Most countries have pre-existing laws that grant non nationals extended stay visas and immigration rights for countries where they have familial connections. I don't see how anyone can say that adopting a stance similar to Norway or Switzerland would be anything but a good thing for the UK, considering its economic state.

&gt;TAX: Really, really bad for low income households. Worse than the poll tax Thatcher tried to create. Beneficial only to people earning over about £45,000 a year, ie, currently well within the 40% band.

How exactly is a unified tax rate bad? The fact is that thanks to a myriad of taxes, we spend well over the odds in this country anyway.

&gt;DEFENCE: Massive defence spending increase. Unappealing to people not looking to fight more wars.

Have you seen our Military lately? Let's be clear, irrespective of what they're doing, they're doing it in service of this country, and these are just a few of the daily problems both personnel have:

* Poor housing - MOD property is *extremely* substandard; my brother in law and sister, for example are living on an MOD estate in Hounslow under attachment to the welsh guards. They live directly underneath the heathrow flightpath, and during the recent upgrades...And let's use this term loosely...Instead of the private company that was hired upgrading with adequate soundproofing, they cut corners, did no such thing and didn't even do the job properly. In addition, damp is a problem, water flow and boilers consistently have issues, and in a couple of cases, my sister has had sewerage (That's *sewerage*) overflowing into her garden.

* Proper equipment - out in the field, there have been reports of sharing body armour, substandard weaponry and a severe logistic breakdown. I humbly suggest *you* worry about repairs while taking mortar fire sometime. It might change your life perspective.

 It's an insult that you think the Military budget doesn't deserve expenditure. Granted, many of these issues could be overcome if the Government redirected budgets from elsewhere within whitehall (like the testing protocols for development projects) - but still. Our Military is in a sad state, and much worse than civilians know. Ironically, thanks to the infection of civilian thinking.

&gt;ENERGY, CLIMATE CHANGE: Ridiculous position on climate change, very unpopular with environmentalists. Unpopular with most scientists involved in energy and efficiency R&amp;D since a lot of funding will be cut.

I agree. I would hope they change their stance.

&gt;GAY MARRIAGE: Obviously unpopular with anyone not heterosexual.

Meh. My opinion is that Gay marriage is no one's concern unless they go to church.

&gt;LAW &amp; ORDER: Increased prisons and harsher sentences a short step away from a police state. Scary for anyone considered about civil liberties.

Yeah...Because the current legal system is a jewel in our crown...Right?

&gt;ECONOMY: Huge tax cuts on the rich and corporations, higher tax on the poor, and somehow still paying for massive defence expenditure. Doesn't make sense to economists.

Specify.

&gt;SOCIAL: Against multiculturalism, obviously bad for non-white British people.
Sounds to me like their support can only come from white, rich, heterosexual, old people.

Let's be clear here - if you look around the UK, we're anything but a multicultural society. Polish people have their own community, Black people have their own community, Indians and pakistanis have *their* own community - in fact the only people who really *do* mix, tend to be welsh, scottish or english.

&gt; None; except for construction workers, electrical workers, janitors, roofers, painters, and letter carriers. Minimum wage is often set by collective bargaining agreements in other sectors of the economy and enforceable by law[7]

&gt; However, the law states that paying a worker an ""immoral wage"" is illegal. There is no general consensus what constitutes ""immoral"" payment. One judge at a court in Krefeld, Germany, ruled that a cashier at a supermarket has to earn the equivalent of approximately 7USD per hour. The federal courts in Germany ruled that any wage lower than 75% of the average wage or salary for a specific occupation constitutes illegal payment. However, since there is no well defined legal minimum wage as of February 2013, courts are usually the ones who have the final say and will only rule for individual cases.[36]

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; I think she was good in her first... two or so episodes, but they fall right back onto romantic tension with her, which is a character crutch.

I actually thought the RTD sequence of companions was very elegant in terms of storytelling around this theme:

You have Rose, who actually *is* a love interest. 

Then you have Martha, who loves the Doctor without the feeling being returned. And that tells us something *different* about that relationship than Rose does.

Then you have Donna, who has no romantic interest in the Doctor at all. And that *also* tells us something different about the Doctor-Companion relationship.

Rose, Martha, and Donna all have a unique slant on this issue and each of them tells you something about the other two. And then ""Journey's End"" comes along, puts them all onscreen, and escalates: Martha has left the Doctor because she recognizes the hopeless romance. Rose is reunited, but then ripped away. Donna is turned into the ultimate ""best mate"", but that also gets ripped away.

And the Doctor is left all alone. And that, too, tells us something.

What doesn't work is the sequence of cute female near-miss companions that riddle the series: Kylie Minogue. Madame Pompadour. Lady Christina de Souza. Cleopatra. And so forth.

To that list we can also add Amy and Clara. (I initially thought Amy's ""jump his bones"" relationship with the Doctor was part of a larger pattern of cleverly deconstructing elements of RTD's run in order to get a fresh start.

Voting Labour is against my better nature. I disagree with the vast majority of their policies, Ed Miliband looks like Wallace from Wallace &amp; Gromit, and he would run the country in a similar fashion. Voting him in would be a joke.

Voting Lib Dem - which many of my peer group did last time round - is obviously a no go. They've proven they can't be trusted and won't hold out on their policies. Their principles may be good, but they don't stick to them. 

Voting Conservative just isn't enough. They would've been my default party at the last election had I been able to vote, but I couldn't. Their policies on EU/Immigration are too weak and aren't helping anyone. Osbourne has made a mess of the recovery (although to be fair, I don't think Balls would've done any better) and they're not delivering on many of the things they should be.

Overall, UKIP is the best party *for me*. I have no doubt people here (especially as reddit is so horrifically liberal) will downvote and disagree, probably yell abuse and call me a racist. But for my beliefs, I think they're the ones that represent them the best.

As I said, they don't represent me perfectly at all. I'm pro gay-marriage, and I don't think I'll support all the cuts they make, but they'll be far better for me and my own situation than Labour or Conservatives.

Obviously I know they won't get in. I can only hope that they get a few seats and the Tories get enough to form a Tory-UKIP coalition of some sort, although I doubt it. 

But I feel that voting for them will show the ""main"" 3 parties (although I personally believe UKIP should be considered as much of a main party as the Lib Dems now), that they have to stick to their manifestos and deliver what they promise, have clear policies and show that I'm not happy with how the country is being controlled.

true,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;""Why is the Lisbon treaty different to a WTO treaty?""

Because the Lisbon treaty effected the powers of the EU which in turn effects how the UK government works. The WTO organisation does not. 

&gt; English Common Law

That's specifically to do with the courts and very few areas of EU law would actually be taken to court, unless we're talking about the Court of the European Union which is *not a civilian court* but merely for placing fines on EU member states for not adhering to EU obligations.

Even then I'm a little uncertain. The HRA isn't directly part of the EU (at least in the sense we're discussing at the moment). It's part of the Council of Europe, though incorporation of the European Convention on Human rights is a requirement for entry into the EU. Let me try and explain that in better terms. *Basically*, the quote says that ""international obligations have to be formally incorporated into English"" which all areas of the EU are. They are incorporated under the European Communities Act which was the act that made us join the EU (then the European Community) and placed EU law above domestic law. So all areas of EU law already fit the requirements of your quote because of the European Communities Act. This brings me back to my earlier explanation of why the Commons passes EU legislation: Because they want to sure it up and make sure it adheres to the UK system properly and all that business. 

I have to apologise for this explanation. All the Human Rights Act, Council of Europe, European Communities Act, European Convention on Human Rights, ect makes it very difficult to explain.

true,Wizzer10,null,null,"Well, people call people ""dick"" or ""cock"" too so it's hardly a double standard, the exact opposite of sexism in fact. Sexism is a word used to refer to inequality between women and men. When an equivalent term is used, I have no idea how the use of the word ""cunt"" could ever be considered offensive without context. And also, while you could argue that it being a female organ is offensive (although I already addressed that,) it has never been used against a specific group. 
Faggot: Originally used against gay people.
Retard: Originally used against those with disabilities. 
Nigger: Originally used against black people. 
Paki: Originally used against Asians.
Twat: Originally used against EVERYONE. 
The point is that twat is a term used due to human distaste for genitalia, not specifically female genitalia due to the same stigma with terms like dick and cock, and that most of the vulgar terms we would consider ""wrong"" we're originally used against a specific minority group, which twat wasn't at any point in time.
Of course, I don't like it when someone is upset by my use of it, hence why I try to avoid using the term but seriously, anyone who thinks of it as sexist needs to check their dictionary. I may not be a nice person, I mean, you can call me a dick, a fucker and, yes, even a twat, but the second you call me sexist, you can be sure that I'll be out there to defend my honour.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"This is random and lengthy but I'm just starting a 3rd season on an online game with a friend. I started as Stoke and now I'm managing Liverpool (those who see my posts regarding that team might be surprised that I took that job). That's not the important part though.  

The important thing is what AVB has done with Spurs. His first season saw Tottenham finish 4th and win Europa League. His second season started with bitter disappointment as Spurs were embarrassed in the CL qualifying rounds by Wolfsburg. 

However he more than made up for it by astonishingly winning the Premier League and successfully defending his Europa League crown in his second year. He was linked with Manchester United's manager position when Fergie retired but he turned it down and signed an extension with Spurs.

The scary part is the players he's bought over the years. His first bit of business was unfortunately to sell Sandro to Manchester City, but he replaced him with the one-two punch of Fellaini and Victor Wanyama. Then he made a double swoop for out-of-favor United players Welbeck and Valencia who gave depth and rotation in attack. Again he pounced on an unhappy player when he brought in James Milner for utility and energy. 

After the title-winning season he's started to add a bit more class to the team, bringing in the likes of Erik Lamela, Gokhan Inler, and Davide Santon. He's been also sniffing around Jovetic.

Now you'd think with all these players added surely some people are unhappy and transfer listed. Nope; everyone is fucking happy. I've been trying to pick up his scraps for 3 windows and no one fucking wants to leave the club. Everyone gets games, everyone contributes, everyone got new contracts after the title win. Sandro, Scott Parker, and Huddlestone are basically the only first team players who have left the club. He's creating a goddamn footballing utopia.

His 4-3-3 in the Europa League Final: Lloris; Walker, Dawson, Kaboul, Benny; Waynama, Fellaini, Dembele; Valencia, Defoe, Bale. The most physical ass-kicking impossible to beat midfield I've played against. 

On the other hand, Wenger has apparently lost his fucking shit. I wasn't paying a lot of attention to his transfer dealings but on the last day of my first season at Stoke (where I finished 5th, only missing 4th on goal difference, playing negative horseshit football) I beat 2nd place Arsenal 5-0 at the mighty Britannia to deny him the title. Libor Kozak (the Lazio guy who missed about 200 chances against us IRL) scored all of them thanks to a hat trick of assists from his strike partner Peter Crouch. 

That's not the remarkable thing about this match though. In a game in which Arsenal could win the title with 3 points, Micah Richards started in central midfield and Laurent fucking Koscielny was deployed as a left winger. It was a bold strategy but as you've seen it did not work out. 

This got me wondering what the fuck Wenger had been up to, and I uncovered the horrible truth: the dude is obsessed with fullbacks. His first season he bought Fabio Coentrao to add to Kieran Gibbs and Nacho Monreal at left back. Okay, fine, Gibbs gets hurt a lot. I understand. Then in January he loaned in Aleks Kolarov from City. Okay so now we have 4 starting-calibur left fullbacks. Then later in the month he brought in Micah Richards to go with Sagna and Carl Jenkinson, but he didn't even play right back half the season. 

Every time I play Arsenal something bizarre is going on with his lineup. Micah Richards or Vermaelen in midfield when a fully-fit Arteta sits on the bench, Koscielny preferred to Cazorla in attacking midfield, 3 left backs on the bench. It's madness. Also Belgium won the world cup.

Which means we'll still need flying or the world will get a lot smaller for us.

Mea culpa. I just googled EU trains.

So again, train travel has it's place but a world without planes will be a whole lot smaller. Which is why the focus should be on better planes rather than a world without planes.

FITs still provide a return on investment high enough to attract anybody with access to the capital: the main reason for the reduction has been falling costs. And that was kind of the point - forcing consumers to pay for any significant amount of energy at 10 times the market rate would never have worked. Even now, if anything, FITs are disproportionately generous for the amount of effect they actually have on CO2 emissions and energy security. 

From a social justice perspective (something many greens seem quite keen on), the system is also deeply regressive; forcing bills up for people who can't afford solar panels or don't own their own houses and providing returns on investment better than any ISA for the wealthy owners of big houses with plenty of spare cash. The only significant relief is for the owners of large industrial plant, where the consequences of reductions in economic competitiveness are too obvious to ignore... I'm all for well-thought-out support for low carbon generation, but the system as it stands is neither fair nor effective. 

I would be much more comfortable seeing more government funding of energy R&amp;D and significant infrastructure (where the ability to borrow cheaply and accept returns over a longer period of time makes a genuine difference to prices), means testing of the winter fuel payment, more support for insulation of homes and a unified policy for reducing emissions while keeping electricity bills low, rather than just offering scatter-shot short term incentives generous enough that people's natural greed will point the electricity generation mix in the direction of the loudest lobby group.",0,1367617280,null,0,false,0,c9rx6lf,t3_1dmb8k,t1_c9rx6lf,t1_c9ruzy0,null,1431333629,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"See I love the tediousness of FM but what I do want is to actually be able to control players in a game with some depth and feel like I'm playing different teams and not ""the computer"". 

IMO 90% of the actual gameplay problems with offline FIFA can be traced to just a few simple things:

1) Difficulty levels  
2a) AI  
2b) Homogeneous / vacuous tactics and little player individuality  
3) Ball tied to a specific player 100% of the time

When you play FIFA offline, there is very little difference between playing against Manchester City and playing against Stevenage. Sure it's a little easier to play against a weaker team and they will probably play more direct at times, but it isn't anywhere near as stark a contrast as it would be in real football or indeed in FM 2013. 

The biggest reason for this is difficulty levels scaling the capabilities of players and a lack of uniqueness or PPMs. Playing against Karl Henry should be a bit different and easier than playing against Xavi but not really in FIFA. It's more about whether you're playing on world class or semi pro or whatever. Along these same lines Younes Kaboul should never lose a header to someone like Tevez, but crank the difficulty all the way up and it WILL happen.

It pisses me off that FIFA added all these superficial designations that masquerade as tangible PPMs, as if people will think they matter. Oh wow, this guy's a speedster! That must mean something! WOW! Tactician! I bet he's really cool! Only things like power free kick or diving header or fancy flicks actually give a tangible difference but they are all made with virtual pros in mind so they don't have any that actually affect AI behaviors. 

The game should have stuff like ""attempts killer balls"" or ""plays one-twos"" or ""gets forward whenever possible"" or ""switches play to other side"" or ""attempts long range shots"" etc to apply to players. The pathetic work rate ratings and little arrows for movement are not even close to good enough. 

I understand things like difficulty levels need to be in the game, but I don't see why it can't coexist with a setting that gets rid of them entirely. I also understand AI is not something that's easy to program but surely with the next generation of consoles coming a major overhaul is on the cards.

In contrast the average Reddit user would see marriage as a human right - if one person can have it as a right why can it be denied another person?

true,Frantic_Child,null,null,"UKIP is a result of decades of laughably relaxed immigration laws allowing unskilled workers into the UK along with the doctrine of Multiculturalism and 'nanny state' being thrown into peoples' faces for too long.

Many people are voting for them because many of the British Public want to utterly reject the cancerous doctrine of Multiculturalism and despise the main parties for allowing such waves of unskilled immigrants to come in over the last number of decades. Many simply hold the view that if somebody wants to come to this country, they must be able to speak the language and must adapt to us; we should not be adapting to them. UKIP are the only major party to reject multiculturalism.

Not only that, but a whole area of once low-skilled jobs for the young has been ripped from the British people due to over 590,000 immigrants, many eastern european and with relevant experience, many of whom take these jobs for minimum wage and on zero hours contracts, essentially stopping any young brits with 0 experience getting into a job in that sector; pushing them onto benefits and ruining any hope of them moving up the social ladder. Once you could get an apprenticeship as an electrician without too much hassle, now you'd have to be a genius or incredibly lucky to even come close; immigration is a key contributor to this. Tell me, why would a businessman hire a 18 year old on an apprenticeship when they can hire 32 year old Yuri The Builder to do it for less?

/r/unitedkingdom may disagree with me, you may call people who share my view 'rayciss' &amp; you may think me a nutjob; but the simple fact is is that at least 30% of the country share my view &amp; we have been ignored, we have been called racist, we have been labelled 'clowns' and 'loonies' and 'fruitcakes' and 'closet racists' and it is many of that 30% who voted UKIP today.

Honestly, I think watching the entirety of Classic Who is a monumental feat. I always recommend going through serials and finding episodes that interest you (a quick runthrough of the ""most interesting"" episode types for me: Daleks, Cybermen, Regeneration, Master/Time Lord, and any story-arc like Fenric or The Key to Time). 

3-4 serials a week I doubt would be enough to go through classic Who till august. There's 155 serials of differing length (a serial, btw, is a story comprised of several episodes, it was the common format of Classic Who, though you'll only see the ""official"" title showing that it's part of a 3/4/whatever episode story after Season 4 and the Gunslingers). 

I won't list stories to watch but I will list a few stories you may wish to avoid, along with the Doctor in it:


Five - Warriors of the Deep (poor production values)

Six - Vengence on Varos, Twin Dilemma, Timelash

Seven - The Happiness Patrol (Bertie Bassot villain, if you don't get that, a villain is made up of liqourice parts &gt;.&lt;), Delta and the Bannermen and Paradise Towers.

In general, be careful around the 80s era, the show was cancelled for a reason (though, ironically, the last Doctor, Sylvester McCoy's era is considered to have been a great attempt to revive Who that sadly failed.

I agree, using 'vagina' as an insult is also sexist. I'm not sure about the 'more sexist' thing though because I wasn't aware of the anatomical distinction between vagina and cunt, and I think few people are. Arguing that really does seem to be pedantic 'going off biology'.

Personally I think that this is quite simple - using 'cunt' as an insult attaches negative connotations to a heavily-gendered word.
This is not comparable to calling someone a 'prick' because prick is a male-gendered word and there is no history of oppression for men - this is for the same reason that calling someone a 'nigger' is very offensive but 'honky' is not. Yes some women are seeking to reclaim the word which I think is a great thing, but that does not necessarily make it okay for men to say in the same way that the reclamation of the word 'nigger' by the black community does not make it okay for white people to use.

They do, but I don't think that necessarily means rent would be as high as it is if it were not for housing benefit. So say for example you've got got an area with a whole bunch of similar houses being rented out at £500PCM, and say for example we lose some percentage of of the tenants because housing benefits get scrapped. You've then got a situation where there are more houses available and less people able to afford them.

Reasons I didn't like River: she is super obsessed in love with the Doctor (The Wedding of River Song was too far)

Her relationship with the Doctor seems one-sided and hollow

Steven Moffat has built her up to be his ""equal"" which isn't possible, imo. Nobody can equal the Doctor.

River Song's life just revolves around the Doctor.

Reasons why these things don't bother me?

River Song is super obsessed with the Doctor because she was raised to be a psychopath. She's seriously a psychopath. And she was young and immature. If you notice her in Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, she is more mature. I'm not sure if that makes Moffat a crap writer or a genius.

River Song isn't the Doctor's equal because nobody can match the Doctor. But River Song is allowed to be badass, like Jack Harkness. Nothing wrong with it. The marriage itself I still believe was empty but that doesn't affect my opinion of River.

River Song's life revolves around the Doctor because well...she was raised a psychopath. It's a sad story really, that her whole life is so screwed up. It should be a bit sad.

And obviously River and the Doctor's relationship seems one-sided. Their timelines are back-to-front so one cares deeply for the other while the other has no feelings. And the Doctor?

Well, to be fair, Classic who episodes lasted 30 mins, Modern Who is 50ish, so you're looking at twice the length of a single sitting. Add to that the fact that tv shows of this genre are far more modular in episode format now (as in, each sitting tries to be able to be taken indepentantly unless it's a special two/three parter). Three episodes of Modern Who is worth Six of Classic, but with the bonus for the viewer watching on broadcast to get more out of a sitting.

And no problem :) Sontarans have four or five serials, depending on if you count a serial that doesn't feature them but features the enemy they fight the eternal war against. Introduced in The Time Warrior, then you have the Sontaran Experiment, a certain episode that I don't want to say since the existance of Sontarans in the episode is a spoiler but it's a Tom Baker episode in the 15th season, the Two Doctors (the only time two Doctors meet up that isn't a special anniversary, it has the Second and Sixth Doctors, Troughtan (2) died later that year at a Who convention)

Daleks, really, you can't go wrong with any of their episodes. The Daleks, the first serial, is a little slow and the Daleks are a bit out of character in some ways, but in general it's awesome. The Dalek Invasion of Earth is pure gold, if a little slow too. The Chase, and the Daleks Masterplan are both great but sadly are missing episodes. Then with (2) you have Power of the Daleks, and Evil of the Daleks (Evil is REALLY good IMO), (3) has Planet of/Day of/Death to the Daleks, which are ok but not essential imo. (4) has Genesis of the Daleks (first Davros episode, Davros is in all classic Who Dalek stories after Genesis) which IMO is essential, and also Destiny... which is... subpar. (5) has ressurection, (6) has Revelation... which can be argued to be more Davros than a Dalek story, and finally, (7)'s Remembrance of the Daleks is awesome. If I had to recommend three, I'd recommend Evil, Genesis and Remembrance, but all of them are good stories (Destiny of the Daleks is the most lacking but even that has some moments)

Cybermen are more hit and miss, sadly, personally I feel they never quite got the Cybermen right. The Tenth Planet is the last serial of (1) but, let's face it, everyone who looks at the Cybermen from that now will laugh (well, the recent figures manage to make them look creepy). (2) was basically the Doctor with the Cybermen as his ""enemies"". The Moonbase is a little interesting, Tomb of the Cybermen is REALLY good, the Wheel in Space is interesting too (both it and Moonbase are missing eps), and the Invasion is really good because it doesn't rely on Cybermen to tell it's story. (3) never had Cybermen (sadly), and (4) fought them once, Revenge of the Cybermen, which is.... Arguable, but IMO one of the worst stories. (5) had Earthshock which is quite good, but few story twists. (6) had Attack of the Cybermen, which IMO is the worst, it's near impossible to decipher the plot if you haven't seen the older episodes (considering the plot depended on a 20 year old story before VHS was popular, you can see the trouble) and it contains the infamous Fat Controller. (7) had Silver Nemesis, but it's not too Cybermen orientated. If I had to recommend three, I'd say  The Tenth Planet, Tomb of the Cybermen, and The Invasion or Earthshock.

true,elmuzzerino,null,null,"&gt; I would say it actually can be extended to many people in the UK, not just the Scots.

That's certainly true if you consider the UK to be a collection of regions, as opposed to a collection of countries. Yorkshire for example could have devolution as a region of the UK. Scots will pretty much always tell you that they are a country though.

&gt;  would also make the case that devolution would solve virtually every argument put down on the table

Completely disagree. Thus far, devolution may have delivered a certain percentage of power and even that small amount has caused problems in the UK entire with accusations flying north that Scotland is being subsidised to provide certain devolved things such as free care for the elderly and prescriptions.

If Scotland wants control over broadcasting, natural resources, energy, international relations, drug abuse, data protection, firearms, telecommunications.... on and on and on... then Scotland is going to need a whole lot more than devolution. This is before we even get to the big ticket items such as WMD's and defence in general. 

&gt; I would also make the counter argument that independence isn't going to change the fact Scotland has a huge dominant neighbour to the south. I think, counter-intuitively, you might actually find Scotland has less say over many of its affairs (particularly economic) under independence.

I'm not sure Canada, New Zealand and even Eire would agree with that. All of which have large dominant neighbours, especially Canada. If your argument was that these smaller neighbours would suffer economically due to their neighbour, then Canada should almost certainly be struggling. But they are not, they are flourishing by comparison.

&gt; If the Scots think they are going to tell 55 million people what to do, they are radically mistaken.

I'm not sure what you are referring to. What would Scots be telling the rUK to do? 

&gt; I suspect the best case scenario under independence is probably an economy roughly along the lines of what Scotland currently has

This could only be a valid point if Scotland did not receive any more economic power after independence, but surely you realise that a lot of fiscal powers would then be in Holyrood's domain, not Westminsters. Unless you don't think these powers are worth much? 

&gt; some sliding formula for oil that will gradually taken hold in about 20 years

Under UNCLOS, any and all taxation from Scottish international waters will accrue to Scotland. Are you saying it would take 20 years to implement this? 

&gt; I can think of no benefits to choosing independence over maximum-devolution,

Devolution will never allow Scotland to control her economy, assets, resources and taxation. Perhaps broadcasting and energy might get devolved, but why would the UK do that? Even if Scotland was able to control more than the 12% of her budget right now, how high could that possibly go? 20%, 25% perhaps....

Independence will put Scotland in at least the same position as the 27 members of the EU, with control over her own affairs as close to 100% as possible. Even with EU laws and regulations, if Scotland can get 90% control of her own affairs, then I'd call that independence and I'll think it's worth it.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Diame is a great shout. That combination of technique and athleticism is very attractive in a player. 

Also, I know he's another FIFA warrior but a young midfielder we could look at is Pedro Obiang from Sampdoria. I don't watch a lot of Serie A but one of the guys on a Spurs forum I read is a huge Italian football fan and really knows his stuff. He rates Obiang very highly as sort of a well-rounded midfielder from box to box. I'm going to watch him a bit more next season. 

And then of course my most recent mancrush Jordy ""I have a spelling error on my tattoo"" Clasie. I do think we will need one more midfielder as Parker and/or Huddlestone aren't going to be here forever.

 I'd prefer it if we were more constructive and tried to create a better union. For example; We could create a mini European-style union of the British isles. Maybe if we became a republic, we could invite the Republic of Ireland to join, with the incentive of seeding Northern Ireland back to them. If the UK  as we know it and royalty no longer existed (not that I have anything against the royal family personally, It's just about time we let go and turn over a new leaf) it would suck allot of wind out of both of their sails.

I mean we could remain a part of the European free trade area but create our own equal political union of England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of man etc. 

So:

* England would gain more autonomy from the EU.

* Scotland would gain independence England.

* Ireland would be reunited and Northern Ireland would still be part of a union with Great Britain.

* We would be a fairer union, a bigger union and a more independent union sharing and coordinating the burden of defence, infrastructure, research &amp; development etc.

We would each have to make a bit of a compromise...

Then the New Who came out and I thought ""No way.  I'm not doing this again.  NEW Doctor Who?  They'll ruin it.  It will be awful.  They'll probably try and update it for Americans or something.  Nope. Not watching.""

Wasn't until 2008 that I watched New Who, because I was sick home from work and caught a rerun of Girl in the Fireplace on SciFi (Now ridiculously Syfy) and...well, that was it for me.  Immediately after watching got into a medication and fever fueled frenzy and acquired then watched *every single New Who episode up to that date*.

Cool story, bro.

He's attempting to recover on his original blog by claiming that what he meant was that the BBC wants to hold onto Moffat, just not on Doctor Who. But that also contradicts what he said (which is that they want him specifically because of the huge ratings he's delivering on Doctor Who).

If the BBC was actually tired of Moffat they would simply fire him and continue the series with somebody else.

Something about her never clicked for me.  The married couple + Doctor thing was very different, and props to Moffat for going for it, but I think it was way to awkward to work.

I do think that Martha fits into the sequence as you describe, but I don't think that position does her character any favors individually, as it forces her to play the hopelessly smitten, which doesn't look particularly good on anyone.

I have to disagree about the almost-companions throughout.  I think those characters and their moments break the formula from companion to companion, and show that the Doctor doesn't always get to travel with the people he finds.  It doesn't always work out hunky-dory.  And I think there's something beautifully tragic about the Doctor feeling connected to someone strongly enough that he wants to bring them along, and then having that ripped away.

It's handicapped if it has to prove a negative. How can you glorify that like the Yes campaign can? So it's left with talking about strong links, our history and culture. I'm just glad most people in Scotland aren't fucking stupid.

You also have the added benefit to the Yes campaign that it's offering change, whereas No is basically saying 'how it is now' which could upset people not happy with anything that's gone wrong recently.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"That's the thing, I don't think it can be said it's a heavily gendered word when it is used against both sexes equally. I could understand how one would say that for the word bitch. Nigger is tied to the history of oppression. Slut, bitch, whore are all tied to the history of oppression. Cunt is just a vulgar word used indiscriminately by and against both genders. There is literally no history of cunt being used to oppress women. Therefore I fail to see how it's an oppressive word. I don't accept that just because it refers to female genitalia it's sexist. The fact male genitalia is also used goes to show that using genitalia as an insult is not oppressive, otherwise surely we'd only use those of the oppressed. You're just repeating the same phrase again, ""women have cunts"". Not even all feminists agree that it's oppressive. So I fail to see how it makes me a bigot for feeling the same. I'll make an effort not to upset people with its usage. But in my own circles, and informal occasions, I'm going to use this word. Further more, the notion that you can say whatever you like about a group, with scant regard about their feelings, just because they have no history of being oppressed, seems to me to be willfully ignorant, naive, callous and divisive. 


You could take all this on board, as I have with your point. Or you could just call me a bigot and be curt about it.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"Actually those two are two of my favorites.

The **seventh Doctor** is my favorite. I told myself when I started watching classic many months ago that I wouldn't pick a favorite. I wanted to love all the Doctors. And I do. But the seventh has stolen my heart.

He's got a dry humor with a dark Time Lord power underneath, and of course, a kickass companion: Ace. Their relationship is so unique, it's a tag-team ""you do the talking, I do the walking"" with 7 as a sort of stand-in parent/guide and tutor. Yet at the same time, it's almost, if you want to put on the goggles, romantic. But because of the tutor/guide thing and 7's distant otherness, it's very platonic.

And by dark Time Lord power I mean that during the seventh Doctor's era you got the feeling that while the seventh seems like a goofy dusty professor on the outside, sometimes you can tell there's an undercurrent of something. This something is alien, it's terrifying, and it's dangerous.

But it's different from the godlike awe I get from the tenth Doctor. This is where it gets hard to explain. The tenth Doctor's godlike-ness, in my opinion, relates to his vanity. Both are very unique to the tenth Doctor (unlike the shallow narcissism of the sixth or fourth).

But the tenth Doctor makes you think that he is some kind of tragic and lonely god high above us who lives in another plane. The seventh Doctor feels more like a pervasive sense of otherness. Dark otherness. (That and it's been pointed out to me that while Tennant is a fantastic actor, he can't do ""eccentric"" to save his life despite being a master at barely-concealed-anger. McCoy has the opposite acting strength/weakness.)

Btw, this dark sense of otherness is very strong in the novel Lungbarrow. Funnily enough, he is revealed to be the Other in the novel and his cousins in the House of Prydon often wonder what the Doctor is. He's Time's Champion for one thing...
What's interesting is that I say these things about the seventh Doctor but I don't know how I reached this feeling. Probably because of the story Remembrance of the Daleks. It was my first seventh Doctor story. I think. I don't know why, but there's something compelling about his personality. It's a blend of dignity and humility, comedy and darkness.

In retrospect he's also an amazing Doctor (and I'm more sure he's my favorite now) because of his excellent run on Big Finish Productions' audio drama range. McCoy's stories have made me cry. Yup. And break my heart. And just recently I listened to what is, imo, the best radio drama* I've heard yet out of 200+ and it's with SEVEN.

*Despite the term ""radio drama"" it's primarily just for purchased on www.bigfinish.com (though it has been on radio). They use the original actors for Doctors and companions, have full cast with full sound. It's not people sitting and narrating. It's like tv but for your ears. Sounds of peoples' feet walking on floors, doors opening, background noise, shattering glass, gunshots.

The **third Doctor** is my other favorite Doctor besides the seventh. He's one of the most serious Doctors, if not the most. It took a while for me to realize I liked the third (after the frivolity of the second).

But the third Doctor is great. He rocks a fantastic dandy outfit, knows Venusian aikido (karate, really) and shares a nice paternal relationship with his companions. The third is one with a strong moral compass and a no nonsense attitude.

Whenever the third talks about the Time Lords and Gallifrey, I sometimes got the feeling that the Doctor was very old. He really felt like he came from an ancient civilization. Maybe not in a scary sense but more a feeling of ""this man came from somewhere else and has garnered all kinds of experience and wisdom.""

There are episodes in which the third Doctor claims he's thousands of years old. There's a brief scene in the Curse of Peladon (iirc) in which he talks of his childhood.

One of my favorite scenes is in The Mind of Evil (which is unfortunately only in black and white) in which a man questions the Doctor's scientific credibility, saying ""If [the Doctor] were a scientist-""

And the Doctor cuts him off, ""If I were a scientist?! Let me tell you, sir, that I am a scientist! And I have been for several thousand-""

at which point the Doctor stops himself, takes a breath and storms out.

I initially didn't like three because he was serious, and of course I came to love his incarnation. Before this all, I had seen clips of the third Doctor before. Mainly when he regenerates into the fourth. The main clip shows a couple minutes of stuff before the actual transformation and in those couple minutes I was immediately interested. I guess it's foreshadowing. In fact I just LOVE Planet of the Spiders.

What's unique about the third is that he's very much an establishment character. Or at least more than any other incarnation. He liked to criticize government bureaucracy and calls ""military intelligence"" a contradiction in terms, but due to the nature of his era, he's very much the gentlemen who will only consider those of his calibre to be ""players"". I cannot fathom my liking of him. It's even more confusing than the seventh in some ways.

The holylands has mad street names, but I'm going to leave that as a suprise for you when you arrive; it's pretty big in my opinion and as I said, it's all uni wankers like us.

If you want a party, you'll find one in the holylands, but generally the people are alright guys, some of them you'll see on the street a week later and think ""fuck, me.

1. Short of The Doctor being the creator of the universe (or God in short) he probably wouldn't have been around for the very first question to be asked. Yes; he may have travelled back in time to the point where it was asked; but inevitably it would have been asked by someone else and had nothing to do with him. 

2. Leading on from 1, ""the first question"" and ""the question you have been running from all of your life"" may not be the same question; and neither may be ""Doctor Who""; as people have asked that since the very first episode. 

3. ""Silence Will Fall When The Question is Asked"" may be another question again entirely; as it would be highly improbable for all of those elements to be linked. However; the fall of the eleventh and the fall of the silence must be connected; but could be a literal fall than a metaphorical fall. 

4. How does Dorium know all of this so readily; short of it already having been asked and these eventualities having already happened? If they had, then silence and the doctor would have already fallen.

5. Does the fall of ""The Eleventh"" actually refer to the 11th Doctor? It could be something totally unrelated. ",0,1367651388,null,0,false,0,c9s6257,t3_1dlrzo,t1_c9s6257,t3_1dlrzo,null,1431329375,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I've owned both 11 and 10's toys from thinkgeek.

10's got a UV and and Ink nib that fit into the bottom. Over time, it loosens, and could require being glued into place to prevent any falling apart you may encounter during use. the slider switch (where the Sonic SHOULD be activated from) has a cap on it, that also gets loose. Don't lose it though, it covers up the phillips head that holds the thing together. The UV effect is cool, but come on. Tennant never did that shit.

11's is probably the best bet if you're on a budget. it has 4 sounds that you can use, as well as being able to extend on its own. The cap that covers the red button gets so loose, so fast that sometimes, you'll hit the button to extend the sonic, and it'll pop that end open. Ended up gluing that shut too. Over time, the clasp that keeps the sonic closed will erode from constant opening/closing making it almost impossible to keep closed on a shelf.

11's also got the Universal Remote Control Sonic (Which I recommend for any fan of 11 who's not necessarily got the strictest budget) It's a full metal replica, that doesn't open, but it DOES turn your TV on/off, change the channel/volume/input. It's not quite *screen accurate* but it's close enough. It's got an FX mode with all the Classic Sonic sounds, as well as a few others. (it also blinks in morse code, secret messages from the TARDIS - Pretty cool shit, 11 messages in all)

Eventually, I decided my love for Who was worth the money, and I bought [THIS](http://imgur.com/a/tlwf9#3)

That's a Celstial Toystore *Replica* Sonic. 11th hour Variant of the 10th/11th Doctors Screwdriver. Used only in Matts first episode.

They can be purchased at www.celestialtoystore.com

They are *expensive*, but they ARENT *toys*!

They are essentially atom for atom reproductions that would make you think that you plucked it from The doctors hands, or straight from the console.

I already have my $800 squared away to grab my 11 the *second* its available

(not paying $4000 to QMx and Robatto for a piece that falls apart the second you flick it open and doesn't make a sound)

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Scotland has around 25% of EU offshore wind potential, 25% of EU tidal, and 10% of EU wave power. Implementing around a third of that would generate around seven times our predicted energy usage for 2050.

The [2020 Renewable Energy Roadmap](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/08/04110353/0) has a lot of detail on what kind of potential is available from each source. Onshore wind, offshore wind, wave/tidal, and hydro are the main sources.

Ensuring that there is always enough power available is a complex subject unfortunately. The wind can be about 40% stronger off shore and often stronger during the day than night: both of which make it more useful than onshore wind farms. However, as with any renewable, storing power when it's not needed to release it when it is will be key.

Onshore we do this with things like hydro stations by using spare power to pump water back up into a reservoir to release it on demand. There are some [interesting ideas](http://www.sustainablebusiness.com/index.cfm/go/news.display/id/24847) as to how that could be down offshore - given the opportunity for exports I think you will see this kind of thing being developed in tandem.

I would highly recommend getting some armored gloves.

For a helmet, I would look at spending the same amount on a BASIC helmet. It's more to go wrong with all those hinges, and it's cheap for a reason. I wouldn't want to have a 70mph crash and have the chin bar fail.

http://www.ghostbikes.com/products/On-Road-Gear-Motorcycle-Clothing-Kits/8941-roxter-waterproof-motorcycle-jacket-and-trouser-kit.html this is what I bought from there for my jacket and trousers. It's a little cheaper than your selection. And I really rate it!!! It doesn't look amazing. But it is comfortable, airy, warm, all the features like removable inner lining, the trousers and jacket connects via a waterproof zip for when it is raining, and it keeps you incredibly dry and warm! It also has shoulder, elbow &amp; knee protection with a pocket for a spine protector - but when I upgrade my bike, I will be upgrading my gear. 


The two best things I have EVER bought for my bike are these...

http://www.ghostbikes.com/products/On-Road-Gear-Thermals/3487-buffalo-soft-fabric-inner-gloves.html

In the blistering English weather these are a GOD SEND! After 15 minutes in winter without the balaclava, your neck is uncomfortable freezing! And the thermal gloves really help for sub-zero riding for keeping your hands warm and responsive. For a tenner for the pair, PLEASE GET THEM! For your own good!

Immigration has proven to be detrimental to Native society. Our communities have been destroyed, our work ethic annhilated. London is a perfect example of how damaing immigration has been. You claim to want to live in such a community and yet you don't, I do. You would never live in the places I live, you would move if you could.

Immigration of the worst immigrants from third world countries into a welfare state is the most insance suicidal idea I have ever heard of and fools like you swallow the idea whole because you think it's cool to be diverse. Diversity is NOT a strength, Commonality is a strength. The more people have in common, they are more trustful, more charitable,. there is less tension, less crime and more oppurtunity. There are hundreds of reasons why an ethnic majority is preferable to a group of minorities.

So far, noone can prove this social experiment has benefitted the British population, it hasn't, it has been a bane and such the british people have a right to prevent anymore.

I wasn't implying that. I'm white British and lived in a pretty nice area, a few asians moved in and they did no harm, both neighbours on each side were pretty old must have been in there seventies while I was a toddler, the ones of the left moved after the missus died. 

The people who moved in to replace them were a family of clampits, two young kids always running around screaming, one older lad blaring music all the time and having shouting matches with his parents. The parents drinking heavily and arguing, blaring the tv, shouting at their son.


&gt;Our communities have been destroyed

I've never experienced a sense of community after living in various white neighbourhoods, ever. However I have been invited for dinners with people of varying ethnicities and they made me feel very welcome in their home and I showed them the respect they deserved, which they reciprocated.

&gt;London is a perfect example of how damaing immigration has been.


London has some shitty areas, every big city does. It also has some amazing history and culture, some of that owing to foreigners.


&gt;Immigration of the worst immigrants from third world countries into a welfare state is the most insance suicidal idea I have ever heard of and fools like you swallow the idea whole because you think it's cool to be diverse. 


I don't like anyone cheating the system and stealing my taxes, no matter what their colour. It's funny how most people I know who were/are benefit thieves are white people who complain about immigration. My sister being one of them.

&gt;Diversity is NOT a strength, Commonality is a strength.

Lets all sit around talking about football, eating chips and drinking lager and enjoy how white we are, shall we?

&gt;they are more trustful, more charitable,. there is less tension, less crime and more oppurtunity. 

Any facts to back that bullshit up?


&gt;There are hundreds of reasons why an ethnic majority is preferable to a group of minorities.

The country is 85% white British.

&gt;So far, noone can prove this social experiment has benefitted the British population, it hasn't, it has been a bane and such the british people have a right to prevent anymore.


Facts, stats, any relevant information that isn't hearsay or opinion/posturing?

&gt;660,000 WHite Birts left London in just ten years, that is more than the entire population of Glasgow.


More likely due to the insane cost of living and wanting to escape to somewhere quieter, but what the *fuck* does that have to do with the population of Glasgow?

&gt;Why are their thoughts, feelings and interests not a concern? 

I've never heard any of their thoughts, feelings or interests and neither have you, you're projecting your own insecurities and issues onto them and trumpeting your own cause.

&gt;When will you be happy?

When xenophobic morons like you shut the fuck up and stop blaming every problem we have on forins.

&gt;Will you be happy when we are a minority in our own cities?

I masturbate to the thought nightly. 

&gt;You wont be becuase people like you who worship this ideal never live in it but you an tell us working class whites to deal with it.


The only thing I worship is Scarlett Johanssons arse. I **am** a working class white, I earn fuck all, I just don't have a hate boner for anyone not white.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; **Even that small amount [*of devolution*] has caused problems in the UK entire**

I think this is a temporary anomaly due to the fact Alex Salmond gets all the political benefits of being able to spend money, without any of the political constraints of having to raise it himself through taxation. Under maximum devolution I think this would essentially be resolved - as Scots would simply be spending the money they generate.

&gt; **Under UNCLOS, any and all taxation from Scottish international waters will accrue to Scotland**

That is true of any new material resource that is found... However, whilst North Sea Oil is proximal to Scotland, the industry was developed and financed by the entire UK (infact largely by money from London). So the oil profits are really a joint asset. Having said that, I don't doubt Scotland will take the lions share of it... but my point is we aren't going to see Scotland taking a full share on independence day, simply because of the financial ramifications for the whole UK (which is also in Scotlands interest, as the last thing they want is their biggest trading partner in recession and unable to afford their new oil). The sensible (and politically touted solution) is that oil profits will be shifted in favour of the Scots over a 10-20 year sliding formula, with most gains after an 'adjustment period' of about 3-5 years.

&gt; **What would Scots be telling the rUK to do?**

To clarify, what I meant was: A small newly established nation, going 'against the grain' on several internationally important issues (like Trident) is not going to sit down at the negotiating table, with a well established global player and dictate the terms of their sucession. This is I think, the biggest misconception in the whole independence debate, and it is in this sense I am refering to the Scots having a dominant neighbour off their southern border. Sadly, pointing this out often gets dismissed as *'talking Scotland down'*. Whilst Westminster has every duty to allow and support the referrendum, they don't have any obligation to pander to some of the more outrageous suggestions Alex Salmond has made. (His latest one this week was that Scotlands share of the liabilities should have ALL north sea oil profits retrospectively deducted for the last 40 years... there is literally no precedant for it, and it makes no legal sense given the above points about how the industry was developed. It also takes no recognition of times when the 'rUK' was a net contributor to Scotland - such as in the early days of union after the financial fallout from the failed Darrien Scheme)

&gt; **Devolution will never allow Scotland to control her economy**

I don't see any reason why Holyrood can't have pretty much ~100% control over their tax and spending obligations, with perhaps a small (we'd be talking like 2-4% of GDP) contribution to foreign policy/defense. Rather than using a formula to dictate how money is distributed to Scotland, we should be using a formula to calcuate a the tiny amount of deductables (for UK wide spending like defense). Everything else would be up to Holyrood - it's what Holyrood wants, it what the Scots want and its what the rest of the UK wants. 

This is what really pains me - we ultimately all want the same things for each other, but independence trys to achieve that by seeking to create divisions where none actually exist.

&gt; **Independence will put Scotland in at least the same position as the 27 members of the EU**

It remains to be seen whether independence will even put Scotland in the EU, at least unless they are prepared to accept the Euro as their currency. But we could all debate this till the end of time (I have no idea what will happen in that regard... I dont think anyone does).

White area with 2 asians? That's your ''diversity''? I hate the term ''asians,'' it's a big continent. 

|The people who moved in to replace them were a family of clampits, two young kids always running around screaming, one older lad blaring music all the time and having shouting matches with his parents. The parents drinking heavily and arguing, blaring the tv, shouting at their son.

So two asian housholds represent the etnire ethnic group and tis affects while one bad white neighbour represents all ethnic brits? This is anecdotal tripe.

|I've never experienced a sense of community after living in various white neighbourhoods, ever. However I have been invited for dinners with people of varying ethnicities and they made me feel very welcome in their home and I showed them the respect they deserved, which they reciprocated.

As I said, our communities have been destroyed, both by mass immigration and the Thatcher period which also had a large influx of immigration. Britain once had a vast sense of multiple communities where everyone knew everyone else. I wish I had been a part of it.

|London has some shitty areas, every big city does. It also has some amazing history and culture, some of that owing to foreigners.

Little of that is foreign. It is most native culture. Most shit areas have immigrant majorities.

|I don't like anyone cheating the system and stealing my taxes, no matter what their colour. It's funny how most people I know who were/are benefit thieves are white people who complain about immigration. My sister being one of them.

Anecdotal again. Per capita, South Asians and Africans have higher unemployment.

|Lets all sit around talking about football, eating chips and drinking lager and enjoy how white we are, shall we?

You did not disprove what I said, you made as strawman argument here. British culture isn't just a deacde old, it is very very old and as I said, it has been annhilated. There is more to our way of life, you live it and breathe it, you laws are part of it as is your language. Do not disrespect what makes you.

|Any facts to back that bullshit up?

http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=fullhttp://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/05/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=full

Similar studies have been done elsewhere. Commonality is a greater strength, it's common sense. If a antion holds the same racial, cultural and economic background, they are more likely to get along. The less in common creates friction.

|The country is 85% white British. It isn't 85%, it is lower and in certain cities it is lower than 60%. Birth rates are also important as the birth rates of differing groups means ethnic Brits will be a minority. The problems we haev today are miniscule comapred to what we will have in the future.

|Facts, stats, any relevant information that isn't hearsay or opinion/posturing?

The cost of immigration has far outweighed its benefit. I dont consider cheap labor for oligarchs to be a benefit to ethnic brits, nor is the emplyoment taken away. Immigration has destroyed our work ethic, it is has seperated our society and risen costs while putting massive pressure on diwdindling inefficient emergency services.

|More likely due to the insane cost of living and wanting to escape to somewhere quieter, but what the fuck does that have to do with the population of Glasgow?

No, they left due to their communities changing. The cost of living rose as the more people moved in. Why didn't they leave before? They elft over the past decade when the immigrant population rapidly increased. Radicla changes forced many white britons out, don't imply otherwise. Their ethnic itnerest was ignroed for the benefit of cheap labor for oligarchs. Why deny the obvious? Next you'll claim they are racists and dont deserve to live in a city where they and their ancestors have lived for centuries.

|I've never heard any of their thoughts, feelings or interests and neither have you, you're projecting your own insecurities and issues onto them and trumpeting your own cause.

You ahev already said that whites moan about immigrants. So 660,000 left for ''cost of living?'' and no the crime waves, radical community changes?

|When xenophobic morons like you shut the fuck up and stop blaming every problem we have on forins.

YESH, SHUT THE FUCK WHITE BOY, STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR ETHNIC ITNEREST! STOP CARING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE!

Xenophobic? So Im have an irrational fear of dark skin? Why is pigmentation important? Do you think i run from anything dark or slavic? You clal it a phobia, a phobia is an irrational fear, a deeper unsettling fear which is considered insane. SO im insane now? Stop using the words with phobia in them, they make no sense used in that progressive context.

|I masturbate to the thought nightly. 

But you live in a white majority.

|The only thing I worship is Scarlett Johanssons arse. I am a working class white, I earn fuck all, I just don't have a hate boner for anyone not white.

Why do you assume I do? I have my self itnerest at ehart aswell as my future and present generations. So far, you have not proven, yet again, how immigration has benefitted us, becuase it hasnt, it has been a net cost and bane. Why must I and others accept something detrimental to our well being?ANswer without using the petty excuse of colonialism.

The reason we avoid slurs like ""nigger"", ""faggot"" and ""retard"" is because those refer to people who are marginalised by society. 

My mother is scottish and, in a conversation about blackface (specifically [this event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padstow#Mummers.27_or_Darkie_Day), or one like it) once told me that she thinks black people are oversensitive sometimes because she doesn't mind jokes about scottish people. I think she said how it's all friendly banter between the English and the Scottish.

When I told her that the difference is that Scottish people have never faced systemic discrimination (in living memory, at least) she had one a bit of a lightbulb moment - you could see the realisation in her face.

So I don't know if this makes sense to you. 

The difference is that gay people sometimes get a kicking for being gay and that black people do face ongoing discrimination - they get stopped by the police for no reason, or turned down for job interviews just because they have the wrong name.

So that's why these words have more power - when someone called you ""whitey"" elsewhere in this thread, you were able to shrug it off, because discrimination doesn't affect you that way. If someone's called a ""nigger"", then it's making light of the discrimination that black people face - it's like saying ""you get discriminated against all the time, and I don't even have to care about it""; it's insulting the person not for what they did, but for who they are; it's showing how lucky you are, and that you don't even realise it.

As mojojo42 pointed out, the main way is using excess energy when the wind is good to pump water back upstream of a reservoir, and then use the water to generate hydroelectricity when wind is short. It sounds crazily inefficient, but it's apparently 70-75% efficient.

If you think about it, solar electricity has the same problem. It's no good if the power goes off when the sun goes down.

Compressed air works too. When there's too much energy, motors are used to compress air. When the wind stops, the compressed air is released to power turbines and generate electricity.

Either way, you create a system whereby electrical energy is converted into potential energy to to be switched on automatically when wind power drops.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"Sorry, I thought it was you who was calling me a bigot. Upon closer inspection, it wasn't.

The context in me using feminists was that I thought you were calling me a bigot. I was just saying that it's not such an open and shut case. There are feminists out there who don't believe it is a sexist term. But people are telling me that no, I am 100% a bigot and that's that. Turns out that it wasn't you, and I've carried that accusation over into this discussion, so forgive me for that.


I agree that it's just being a dick, so I'll try not to do it in future. But everyone's a dick sometimes.

I don't really appreciate that I'm trying to have an honest discussion with you and you're coming at me on a personal level. Being patronising, making out that I'm ridiculing feminism. Why are you accusing me of being tearful for example? That just seems extremely aggressive. I don't care for oppressed men. I just don't understand in context how it's any different. This whole, ""But what about the menz!"" is not very mature. You're being curt **again**.

&gt;What planet do you live on? Why are you getting so tearful? How do you possibly practice this doublethink???

Do you think this is productive? I'm trying to have an honest discussion with you.

In regard to double-think, it just seems to be double-think coming from your explanation. That's my point. You're sanctioning one kind of genital insult, but condoning the other. I don't see how if you think one is denigrating, then the other can't be. That seems to be the double-think that is confusing me. I'm simply questioning it. It is your explanation that is practising it. And that's what I think is divisive.

I read about 5 articles this morning about feminism and the word cunt. I still don't buy that it is sexist and oppressive. A lot of the arguments came down to when you refer to a woman as a cunt you are reducing her to nothing more than her mere sexual organs. I just can't understand why when you call a man that it can be said to doing to the same thing, considering they do not have a cunt. The argument then went on to say that it was feminising that man as an insult, but I just can't see it. I can see how you are feminising a man with the word bitch or pussy - these words have got gender role implications and are gender specific insults based on female behaviour. But cunt just honestly seems to be a vulgar body part of an insult - it is not linked in any way to female behaviour, there do not seem to be any allegedly negative female traits attached to this word. It is merely a body part. Bitch conjures up sexist attitudes towards the way women are perceived to behave. The same with pussy. I just can't see that for the word cunt. I'll bare in mind that it does upset some people. I'm not a complete prick. Interestingly, I also read this morning, that male genitalia based insults can also be considered sexist against women. The argument being that it normalises the male anatomy. That was just way over my head though, but it goes to show that it's not a straight forward issue. I don't think it would be fair to go around calling people sexist against women for using male genitalia as an insult, because as you say there is no council that decides these things so it is open to interpretation. So I don't think it's fair to call people sexist or bigots on such a complex issue.

Anyway, you can call me a dick for using the word cunt if you like. I'll accept that. Everyone's a dick one way or another. But calling me a bigot because I don't fully understand or agree with the word cunt having sexist connotations, is not really productive. And I'll argue against that, like I am now. But it wasn't you who called me that, so this discussion has been inspired partially by false pretences; although I am wiser from it now so no regrets. I'm not saying I'm not a dick. I am a dick.

I'm so pleased to see Thompson getting a start ahead of 'Browneh'. I think he'll line-up on the right of the midfield diamond, as he used to be a right back before moving into a central midfield role. Interesting to see Drury start ahead of Warnock, I'm guessing that Warnock's place for next season is already secured and McDermott wants to get a better look at Drury.

However, without Diouf I'm concerned that we'll struggle to keep hold of the ball. We'll have no real outlet out wide, either, so we'll have to rely on Ross or one of the forwards drifting wide. At least in Varney and Morison we have two forwards capable of running the channels, not that I want to see us doing that too often.

true,phys1cs,null,null,"&gt;Scotland's real long term asset will be its coastline- wind and wave power could see Scotland become the first entirely renewable energy country. They could even export it to England and Europe for a good source of revenue.

Exporting electricity, especially from renewables (exports occur at times of high supply and consequently very low prices) will never provide a revenue stream comparable to that of oil. If anything, it will be a *cost* to the taxpayer due to higher prices.

As an example, let's say in 2025 Scotland generates 50TWh of electricity from renewables. Say net consumption of power is also 50TWh (about what it is now) and there's 30TWh of non renewable production (also about what there is now). Significant investment in converting Scotland's existing hydroelectric generation capacity to pumped storage could provide enough to support high wind penetration relatively easily, and this would achieve the '100% renewable' target and provide exports (mostly to England) of 30TWh. That's probably a relatively achievable target, and (assuming Torness gets a life extension until 2030 and more gas plant is built) could also be done at the same time as reducing CO2 emissions.

Here's the thing: the current market price of power is about £50/MWh. Let's assume the non-renewable portion of Scotland's future energy mix ends up costing £40/MWh while the renewables cost £80/MWh (less than current onshore wind even in good locations, about half the cost of new offshore wind and significantly cheaper than wave, tidal and solar). Presumably these would be funded through a feed in tariff or ROC style scheme, the cost of which would be paid by *Scottish* consumers - just as France doesn't pay German FITs when they import German renewable electricity, there would be no reason for English consumers to fund a Scottish policy.

So, under the current system Scotland pays roughly £2.5bn for the electricity they use (assuming market prices - in reality, power is usually bought on longer term contracts but the overall price is quite similar). In this hypothetical future situation, Scotland generates a total of 50TWh of renewable energy, all of which receives a price of £80/MWh (total cost: 4bn, paid by Scottish consumers). There is also 30TWh generated at £40/MWh (total cost: £1.2bn) and 30TWh exported. Let's assume it's exported at £50/MWh, although in reality it would be a lot less since when renewables are exported there tends to be an oversupply. Total extra income: £1.5bn.

Overall in this situation, Scotland now pays £5.2bn for electricity (up from £2.5bn) and receives £1.5bn from exports. Net, electricity has gone from costing Scotland £2.5bn to costing £3.7bn (up 48%), assuming 100% of the export revenue stays in the country. In fact, the vast majority of the extra income goes to the owners of wind farms, the majority of which are multinationals based outside of Scotland (Iberdrola, RWE, Eon, EDF, AES etc). The fact that electricity is being exported at market rates but generated under a subsidy from Scottish consumers also means that the power generation part of electricity bills has increased by 108%, despite the average cost of renewable generation only being (a rather optimistic) 60% higher than the current market rate.

Total UK *tax* revenues from North Sea oil and gas are about £7bn per year. Anybody who expects Scottish electricity exports to come anywhere near that would be better off running for a seat in Cloud Cuckoo Land. Plus, with the recent closure of Cockenzie and likely closure of Longannet and Hunterston B within 10 years, it's not even clear that exports actually *would* increase...",0,1367668752,null,0,false,0,c9s83at,t3_1dmdk9,t1_c9s83at,t1_c9ry5cs,null,1431328345,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's not universal and not necessarily the best approach. Cambridge is based entirely on end of last year finals, as is Oxford for humanities (and end of years only discounting first year in science). The argument is that aptitude at the end of the degree is what matters, and it allows more flexibility (in terms of teaching and study) in reaching that point.

I think the main problem with scrapping AS exams is that they're a great leveler for university applications - those at bad schools tend to worse in GCSE, but at AS the gap closes and the results are more indicative of merit.

Edit: I also don't really buy that it's necessarily harder to have one set of exams - it's all relative, and if you can't remember as much as somebody else for one big exam then you won't be able to for a bunch of smaller ones.

They said the old Target novels helped them become interested in reading, and are hoping the donations will help inspire a new generation of fans to start reading, too.

The [fans' original blog](http:///targetwho.blogspot.co.uk/) ends with this note:
&gt; 
**Doctor Who Fans: Can you also help?**
We acknowledge that there will be parts of the country we cannot reach.  We simply don’t have friends or relatives in that area, but there are Doctor Who fans EVERYWHERE!  Also there are more schools in the UK than we have books.  Children around the country would love Doctor Who books in their school libraries.  We hope that you will all join us in our quest to put a Doctor Who book in every school on this the 50th Anniversary year.

&gt; If you have ever read a Target book, if you have ever enjoyed the show, or even if you just think our aim is a wonderful idea, please consider buying just one book and donating it to YOUR local school.  If you cannot find an old Target novelisation, or your budget doesn’t allow for one of the new full length novels, one of the new Doctor Who Quick-Reads would be perfect. The latest one only costs £1.00. 
If you do, please tell us where and we can record your donation on our pin map.

Firstly, January exams are a useful way of separating the huge amounts of information that has to be learnt.

Also, the issue with AS and A2's is that you progress in skill over the two years, and it is understandable that people would wonder why the exams aren't worth less. However, I would say that the exams are not that much easier, and for example, my Russian module from AS history had as much information to learn as my A2 WW2 module.

The most embarrassing part about this is that it can be kinda-fixed with one line of HTML in the header.    

Right now when you visit the page in IE 7, 8, 9, or 10, it is loading the page in the newest rendering engine (e.g. IE 10 loads it in ""IE 10 quirks mode""). This will often break the page in newer versions of IE.     

But all versions of IE have a backwards compatibility mode that will render the page in IE 5/6 quirks mode even without user interaction. All you have to do is add:   

     &lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=5"" &gt;    

To your header section and IE will render the page correctly even in IE10.   

It won't help WebKit, Firefox, or similar but it will make their page work on every Windows OS and in every copy of IE.

That allows their two holding mids to control Bale pretty well, one can mark him closely and the other is still free. Also, Dempsey will absolutely drop into the middle and allow their right back to tuck in and this will crowd the space in the middle in front of Hudd and Dembele even more. No space for Bale and limited space for Defoe to make runs.

BAE will get forward but if their right attacking mid tracks back, he's still covered and stranded out wide on the left by himself. The best route of attack then is Lennon stretching play on the right with support from Walker. They need to look down the right side early and often and try to draw attention and maybe open up spaces in the middle.

If Southampton presses and doesn't give the CBs time on the ball or Hudd time on the ball, I don't see Spurs easily unlocking them and getting some goals.

Unfortunately BT aren't the only ones lagging behind. There are only a handful of UK DSL ISPs that support it, with the most fanatical being Andrews and Arnold. Shame that you really will have to remortgage to be with them though.

My own ISP loves to profess that its pan-European transit network is IPv6 ready, and that they can provide it on leased lines etc. But they still won't do it on ADSL/fibre.

&gt; Also I think they should be required to inform customers before they switch over your connection.

You could argue that it shouldn't change much if it doesn't affect the usual activities like online gaming. If you want to host servers then you should probably be with an ISP that at least offers one static IP.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; Are they really going to give all British citizens guaranteed access to Scottish citizenship, even if they've never been to Scotland and have zero Scottish ancestry or familial connections?

I would assume so, yes.

&gt; Maybe I'm being cynical but that seems the least likely outcome, no?

If you go for an inclusive model, as has been suggested, then in addition to the above you would be offering Scottish citizenship to any person (British or not) who had some familial connection to Scotland.

Citizenship is a complicated area, particularly with the UK's own long history of special cases and significant dates, but you can see something similar [in Ireland](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/irish_citizenship_through_birth_or_descent.html) where irrespective of your/your parent's place of birth you can still become an Irish citizen.

I suspect those would be the two main strands. Clearly if you are a British citizen you have as much right to live in Scotland as someone born here so I see no reason why Scottish citizenship would not be open to you too.

&gt; I'd go even further than that; many positions within the military require you to be a born national, born to born nationals and XX years of residency to access the different levels of secret clearance.

Sure - most nations have different rules for their intelligence services than they do for their infantry. Then again, the people working in all of those roles are working to protect Scotland at present so they could presumably be trusted with that responsibility in the event of independence.

Perhaps in 20 years the equivalent to SIS might introduce a birth requirement but, in the short term, I would expect your current post would be more significant in obtaining clearance than having been born in Aberystwyth rather than Aberdeen.

&gt; given the nature of Scottish nationalism I don't think it's unreasonable to expect favouritism for born Scots and an overwhelmingly Scottish command personnel

Could you explain what you mean by ""the nature of Scottish nationalism""?

I wouldn't expect any particular favouritism: the country would be looking for capable people. Being capable will be more significant than where they are born. There would doubtless be a few idiots proclaiming that someone wasn't ""a real Scot"" but I am sure Fijian soldiers fighting for the UK have also faced similar prejudice - you can find idiots everywhere.

&gt; So that leaves me completely out in the cold right? Doesn't sound very inclusive to me; in fact it sounds downright dangerously ambiguous, as if the people themselves have been overlooked. Or worse.

As a British citizen I think you would be offered Scottish citizenship if you wanted it. Depending on what you do in the navy then there may or may not be an equivalent post, but clearly applying for a job is slightly different from applying for citizenship.",0,1367680102,null,0,1367680478,0,c9sa3wv,t3_1dmdk9,t1_c9sa3wv,t1_c9s76ze,null,1431327395,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

With the current system, people seem to be learning the information for an exam and then forgetting it directly after. In other subjects where you may be tested on different areas in the different exams, this may work (although it is far from ideal), but in mathematics you need what has gone before.

For example, my class had to go though finding the stationary points on a curve recently, a topic we did to death at AS. By this I do not mean a quick refresher, but being retaught in the same way again.

Having said all this, I still agree with the modular format, but I feel student attitudes towards it need to change.",0,1367680998,null,0,false,0,c9sabxf,t3_1dob95,t1_c9sabxf,t1_c9s8vy1,null,1431327290,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Also, you have to consider the humanity subjects, which have such a broad range of things to cover that asking people to do so and remember all the different events and people in a short space of time is simply asking too much.

true,Froolow,null,null,"I tend to see UKIP as not really being a ~~'serious'~~ 'heavyweight' party, in the sense that they have an idea in their head of what they want but no sensible policy on how to achieve it. As a result, they seem to speak to the 'common man' who thinks all the problems in the UK could be solved if only politicians had a bit of common sense, when in fact most of the problems are deeply, deeply complicated and would not benefit from a 'common sense' approach.

Reddit hates them because their policies are poorly thought through (which does not appeal to the demographic in reddit which is politically intelligent, sifting through policy) and because their policies tend to be socially conservative in scope (which is anti reddit's userbase)

Take for example their policy of a flat rate of 25% income tax. That sounds - on paper - like a 'sensible' policy which benefits the aspirational middle classes at the expense of 'scroungers' on minimum wage. Leaving aside the fact that it would represent an **enormous** tax hike to the average UKIP voter (probably something like an extra £1000), it would also absolutely kill the exchequer - estimating tax take is always sketchy but if [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/8321369/Top-1-of-workers-pay-quarter-of-all-income-tax.html) *Telegraph* article is correct then UKIP are saying that - in their opinion - Britain can reduce its expenditure on things like the NHS, education and military by *at least* £20 billion while still paying to do all the things UKIP have promised. Maybe they can, but they have not produced any kind of numbers to support this claim which suggests - to me - that they haven't actually thought that far ahead.

Or, for example, their policy of reducing 'bureaucracy' in the NHS. I work for the NHS and - quite apart from the fact UKIP's stated policy is to make me redundant - I happen to know that the 'pen pushers' are the ones who stop people getting contaminated blood in operations, or who catch people like Harold Shipman by pouring over decades of data to spot outliers. Since UKIP haven't said how they will 'streamline the NHS' I can only assume they have absolutely no idea because it is a knee-jerk reaction of most political non-sophisticates that 'managers' must just clog up the system.

The cardinal sin in politics - the only one that I think the electorate should never, ever forgive a politician or party for - is lying. The Lib Dems are feeling it after their tuition fees fiasco, and the main reason (I think) UKIP are so unpopular is that it is *clear* to anyone with half a brain that they are lying about their ability to deliver their policies, because it is clear their policies are half thought-through 'wishlists' rather than serious and sensible attempts to solve Britain's problems.",0,1367681102,null,0,false,0,c9sacxw,t3_1dn637,t1_c9sacxw,t3_1dn637,null,1431327277,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I know that most people are struggling with the few modules they've still got to take, because the amount of information in them is staggering.

The worry is that people will cram just before the exam, then forget all that material shortly afterwards. Your short term memory only has a particular capacity, so the more exams you take, the more opportunity there is to temporarily cram a larger percentage of the (now-broken-up) information into your mind. 

I don't agree that there's too much information in these courses to assimilate, the whole point of exams is to show that you understand, have absorbed, and can apply in future all of the information in the course. It only feels that way if there's an attitude that education is a distraction, something that happens to you while you're trying to live the rest of your life, rather than an opportunity and a central purpose.

I'm not talking about every subject, but the current modular system for the sciences for example has so much information to cover that spacing it out is actually useful, and considering that each module is like a 2 hour test, it would be punishing to combine several of those together.

No it wouldn't. The summer exam session currently runs from early May to late June. If you examined modules in such a way that there is at least a month between the exam of first AS/A2 module and the second module of each subject, that leaves plenty of time for revision.

&gt; Also, the issue with AS and A2's is that you progress in skill over the two years, and it is understandable that people would wonder why the exams aren't worth less. However, I would say that the exams are not that much easier, and for example, my Russian module from AS history had as much information to learn as my A2 WW2 module.

Angus Robertson MP: “Taxpayers in Scotland contribute more than £3.3bn a year to the MOD, but only £2bn is spent on defence in Scotland. The Secretary of State’s predecessor Liam Fox acknowledged that “between 2000 and 2010, the total reduction [in service jobs] was 11.6% but the reduction in Scotland was 27.9%. Given the disproportionate personnel cuts and the defence underspend in Scotland will Secretary of State rule out further amalgamation or disbandment of Scottish raised units?”

The MMR study has been proven to be total crap, meanwhile IPv4 is nearing exhaustion if you realise that all those /8s that HP/IBM/General Motors/US DOD/Xerox/etc have but don't use are not likely to be relinquished (and if they did it's just kicking the can down the road rather than trying to solve the problem now and implement v6)

Some RIRs do not have much space left to hand out. RIPE is on their last /8. If I am reading http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/ipv4-exhaustion/reaching-the-last-8 correctly, BT or any ISP wouldn't get more than 1,024 addresses even if it asked.

&gt; BT just found an excellent excuse to ring more money out of people who need listening ports.

Do you know how much space BT's retail ISP operation has and its utilisation? If you don't, how can you claim that it is purely a money making operation. They have implemented it on the lowest tier plan, for low usage customers. There are not likely to be many people hosting servers on that plan, and if they are it would be more prudent to go with someone who gives them a static IP and other nice things.

It is a 3 pound difference between the cheapest and the next plan. It's not exactly the fast track to riches.

I see your point. I think the truth is that the real world requires a whole mixture of these various skills, to different degrees.

The least benign example would be a trainee doctor dealing with a sight-unseen patient in an A&amp;E, in the middle of the night.

- Walk through the Princes Street Gardens when crossing Princes Street - much more beautiful and much less busy. You will come across the National Gallery which is exceptional.

And then after (or before!), it's worth climbing the Scott Monument - I think there are 200-odd steps and the staircases get quite narrow near the top but the views are astonishing. 

- Climb Arthurs Seat in Holyrood Park - the highest point in Edinburgh and with wonderful views to the coast. 

-When you're visiting the museum, it's worth stopping for coffee nearby at Brew Lab - in my opinion the best coffee in Edinburgh. If you're hungry you can get cheap and delicious Indian food at the nearby Mother India. Other good, cheap lunches in that area include Union of Genius who specialise in soup.

- If it's a warm, sunny day I would recommend walking along the river, the Water of Leith, starting in the Village of Dean and finishing at the Galleries of Modern Art.

-On Saturday between 09:00 at 14:00 there is a wonderful market on Castle Terrace where you buy (and taste!) wonderful Scottish food.

- You could just walk, wander and explore the New Town and take in the beauty and the architecture whilst visiting the local pubs and cafes.

I think that's pretty much what I said by ""kicking the can down the road"". It's obvious that no one has really been thinking about it and there's a slight panic now that v4 address space is running out. Trying to get those companies to give up their addresses, if they managed it, is just going to prolong the problem.

&gt; We're also having this problem with IPv6 where we've already started handing certain entities trillions of addresses.

I'm not so sure that it is a big deal. I guess you could argue that ""if we don't think about it now, it'll be headache 10/20 years in the future"" just like handing /8s was fine back in the day, but if the IPv6 address space is huge enough to provide for some silly number of addresses for every square centimetre on the planet (or whatever that statistic is) it shouldn't be a problem.

IPv6 has a lot more IP addresses than IPv4 (enough to give millions (I think) to each person on the planet).

The NAT equivalent is like when someone calls you from a company but doesn't have a direct phone number. Your caller ID gives you a phone number, but if you call it you just get customer services/the receptionist/a message saying who the company is. You don't know which person called, only that someone from that company did.

The system, without NAT, is where everyone has their own phone number and can directly contact each other.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Companies pay money to third parties to bring them customers. You'll sometimes see it called affiliate links. That used to mean that expert amateurs writing reviews, or guides etc might give you details of a company that they're pleased to deal with. If I remember an example from perhaps 15 years ago when the web was rather different you might read through someone's personal webspace and on there it explained how to use usenet/newsgroups and what software to get and which service provider to use. The information was useful and everybody worked together. The service provider would pay a small sum of money for every customer that the private individual sent across to them. For example he might get a fiver for every customer that signs up and stays for 3 months. 

Spin forward to nearer the present day through 'advertising features' and all sorts of stuff... and you have sites who will give the customer a little bit of their cut. For example it might be that if you signed up with my link, and I got a fiver then I'd give you half of it so that you would sign up with my link rather than someone else's.

And right now we have cashback sites which report to give you -all- of the money. I'm not sure if that's clever wording or they make money elsewhere, but you usually get the best possible deal by using them.

The biggest UK two are QuidCo and TopCashBack. By following their link to a product, and buying it, or signing up or some other activity 

For example I signed up for a free trial of Netflix, and they're paying me £15 for it. I didn't keep it as I didn't like the video quality. Regardless though I get £15 from TopCashBack, a few months down the line.

The payday loan companies also operate through the cashback sites. They're desperate to snare new customers and they pay top dollar for it.

http://www.topcashback.co.uk/paydayuk/ &lt;-- That one pays £30.30 cashback which is slightly higher than the cost of borrowing. 

http://www.topcashback.co.uk/quick-quid/ &lt;-- Pays £35 and the cost of borrowing is 20 or 25 assuming you don't have terrible credit. 

There's dozens of payday lenders and you could make a bit of money by collecting the cashback.

I would warn you that your bank's credit scoring system might shit bricks if it sees them passing through, or if you apply for a mortgage it might make things difficult if it's on your statements.

Also, cashback is not guaranteed, and while the vast majority is paid out you do have to wait a while for it to come through and there's no certainty that it all will.  I've always got my cashback eventually although I often have to raise a claim because I have quite aggressive cookie settings on my browser.

There is certainly evidence that a [sterling area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_area) could run for decades, or that the EU can take a constructive approach to unusual situations (e.g., [German reunification](http://www.euractiv.com/future-eu/eu-negotiator-main-difficulty-ge-interview-498395)), or that cross-border pension schemes are [quite common](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-cross-border-schemes.aspx).

They are fairly easy to pick, the picks look like this.

The lock picks looked like that, I reconised the deforst diamond (second from the right) from her picks out of casual observation, which is used for picking pin and tumbler locks.

A mortice lock, which is what they would have used in this time period, and what the locks in the episode look like. The internals look like this:

http://i.imgur.com/W7uhFfk.gif

Considerably diffrent from Pin and Tumbler locks.
They are also REALLY hard to pick. And the picks for them look way diffrent.

Edit;
Its more obvious when in HD (my grans computer can't handle it) but here are some screen shots from iPlayer.

http://i.imgur.com/rHdSYj3.png

Here the lighting is good on a small ball pick.

Its used mostly for pin and tumbler locks, but also wafer locks.

http://i.imgur.com/LHMjFrc.png

And here is a shot of the lock, clearly a mortice lock.

At the start of the episode you get a clearer shot of all the lock picks, but I can't get a good screen shot of them, but I can see others that are used on pin and tumbler locks (rakes ect).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Much easier to tell you to upgrade if you need your own IP, which will make them money.

Network engineers are expensive. Network equipment upgrades to handle carrier grade NAT are expensive. IP address exhaustion is a very real issue. Implementing carrier grade NAT isn't a quick and cheap 5 minute job.

The revenue derived from a few people who will upgrade to get an IP address for their server is probably dwarfed by the cost of upgrading to NAT. It's better to do it to the people least likely to know or care about having a public IP address rather than the people with unlimited fibre connections that more likely do.

BT would get more money by doing what they usually do. Raising phone line rental or charging people even more when not using direct debit or by charging phone rental fees that have probably paid for the rented phone many times over. These don't require expensive labour or capital to do - just a simple billing change. 

For the time being anyway, you can still opt out of NAT even if you are on the lowest package. So it won't be as lucrative as you want to believe - and demolishes the argument that BT is doing to make money rather than because they are running out of IP addresses.

Of course.

&gt; For example; if the report they commissioned into potential EU membership was bad news, would they include it?

I don't know. You've [already said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1dgyql/scottish_independence_damage_to_uks_reputation/c9q9xjg) that they haven't published it to date (do you have a link to the UK government report you mentioned BTW?), so it may be that they won't - or it may be that they will.

The UK government may of course decide to take a [more constructive approach](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/12/18/scottish-independence-mic_n_2324048.html) with the EC in the mean time, in which case any existing opinions regarding EU membership would become moot.

Regarding EU/NATO/Sterling, it's worth remembering that the status of those will not change the day after the referendum. On September 19th 2014, Scotland will still be a part of the UK - still in the EU, still in NATO, and still using Sterling.

The process of secession will take some time, as will the process of accession to those bodies. My guess is that the UK government will continue to refuse to ask the EC for an opinion before that date and that a great deal of the current posturing will simply be discarded when the time comes to implement Scotland's choice.",0,1367694665,null,0,false,0,c9se6es,t3_1dmdk9,t1_c9se6es,t1_c9sdmee,null,1431325405,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Given the nature of our media the second they do that we, the audience, are informed and we become aware of this. So no surprises when a doctor regenerates. 

Matt Smith said at the start of the sixth season that he wanted to leave in a way that none of the other doctors had; to shock and surprise the fans. 

The theory; therefore; is that he regenerates at the end of season 7. This doesn't need announcing because the 50th is a multi-doctor episode, so he would still be part of the cast for that.

If they can eventually move people to online claims they can automate the process and get rid of a few hundred thousand job centre staff.

They're still going to need to keep *some* staff in the job centres, but when everyone is moved over to online processing the physical locations can be minimally staffed and costs can be cut. 

This is why they have been moving people over to the job centre website to do job searches. Eventually you won't even have to sign on every fortnight and prove you've been looking for work, because they can track how many jobs you have applied to via the website.

There are at least 60 members of staff on around 4 floors of a building at my local job centre. Take an average of about £25k a year and that's 1.5million a year, every year.

Exactly; there's no direct benefit to anybody.

&gt; Perhaps if people actually had IPv6 connections the demand would be there for other services that use it?

So long as they didn't also have IPv4 connections.

&gt; The business case should be that IPv6 is the future - it's not wasted money or effort, and what difference does it make if you do it now or a bit later as you inevitably will have to?

That's why all the network kit we've bought has been IPv6 compatible. But it's not until something is the *near* inevitable future that you implement it - when we first looked at IPv6 it was still quite undecided-upon. By now we're just in the habit of waiting for it to look imminently relevant.

AAISP is pretty small change - meanwhile if BT threatened to pull their account due to shitty firmware (be it IPv6 or any other feature) stuff would get done. At least that's how it works for the company I work for, that deals in the millions per account.

While ISPs aren't demanding IPv6 the manufacturers are going to consider it an irrelevance and at best do the bare minimum to claim IPv6 compatibility even when that isn't very useful. That'll just mean a boatload of shitty buggy firmware when ISPs and customers really badly need working IPv6, whereas by doing things years ago the kinks would have been worked out.

I can't comment on consumer router capability though.

Not immediately. For IPv6 to work, you need it to work end to end.

I've read loads of comedian's autobiogs and t5hey are usually shitty cash-ins, but said book was so interesting, being a transcript of a couple of his shows and the interjected chapters the motivations for the content of his shows. I just think that is a comedian's book, done right.

The only difference is that they don't play nice when you make racist, homophobic or misogynist slurs, but get in your face about it. 

Well, aren't you just completely **adorable**. Note that I don't have a problem with the content they point out, it's the [gigantic circlejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1doo87/effortful_poop_scoople_gem_of_rape_apoligia_and/) that follows afterwards. It's outstanding how they manage to be worse than all the racists, homophobes and misogynists they hate so much. That's why I reckon they'll get riled up over nursery rhymes, because they've already made quite clear they'll circlejerk over anything.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Scotty being fit/in form isn't the answer. He just doesn't fit our style of play any more; if you believe otherwise, you're deluding yourself.

He's a great player, but he's not the same type of player as Sandro, at all. Sandro plays much more positionally sound defense; he throws himself into tackles, but doesn't get caught out of position nearly as much as Parker, and doesn't venture as far up the pitch as often. Moreover, Sandro sees the field offensively in a way Scotty doesn't; this isn't to say that Scotty runs around blindly, but he's much more liable to pass the ball to someone who can't do anything with it, or who will get jumped by multiple defenders.

Scotty's game has always been to attack, attack, attack, box to box; this opens the game up immensely, allowing other teams to break against us and then, in turn, for us to counter-attack from their break. Which worked really well last year when we would sit our back four deep and let Rafa cherry-pick up the field and serve as the igniter on attack. But this year, with a high back line, we can't afford to let teams break from midfield against us.

If you don't believe me, look at how much more settled we've been since Huddlestone came into the side. No, we don't have quite the cutting edge in attack, but I think that's more due to Dembele's lack of fitness than the loss of Parker. What Huddlestone does positionally is sit in front of the back four and retain possession/ break up attacks coming through the middle of the field. Where Scotty would be breaking up into the attacking third, Sandro &amp; Huddlestone sit deeper, collecting clearances and cycling the ball back to our attacking players.

Scotty does still have a place in the team; but it's not as our defensive midfielder. I want to see Huddlestone &amp; Parker together, with Parker freed up to run about without being the only defensive midfielder on the pitch.",0,1367700076,null,0,false,0,c9sfocb,t3_1domfh,t1_c9sfocb,t1_c9sc8y3,null,1431324699,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Personally I only work on 3G and LTE modems and routers: my interest in ADSL routers is more as a consumer (although I do discuss them with our fixed-line engineers),

Out of interest is this the red company that recently bought a Bracknell-based outfit?

&gt;  My impression is that consumer ADSL routers have become so commoditised that it is difficult to get a supplier to step up to the mark: the design capacity is not there, and they would have real concerns about whether they would make their investment pay. Remember that a device costing £30 has very little profit margin even when there is essentially no technical design required to make it.

I am not an ISP, nor do I work in consumer manufacturing so my opinion is probably as relevant as yours, but I'd still argue that while £30 on its own is insignificant, £000,000s or millions is not. I only know from enterprise-grade kit that we'll bend over backwards to sort out a customer if they are threatening to go elsewhere and take lots of money with them.

&gt; BTW, I have experimented with Cisco 700 and 800 series routers. What a load of crap! The problem is not the router functionality, but the ADSL modem part, which will fall over for hours at a time and will give only about 60% of the throughput of consumer routers when it does work.

I don't know what a 700 series router is (do you mean 1700?) but I agree with you, at least up to the 877. From what I've heard it has a flawed and discontinued ADSL chip and Cisco has done all it can to get it working somewhat well (there's a special firmware floating around specifically to resolve problems with BT's 21CN DSLAMs). There's more to that story but I'm not sure how much I am allowed to say, other than Cisco has invested a lot of time and money to get it to where it was, even after the 877 was end of lifed.

I've never had the opportunity to play with anything newer (I have FTTC so wouldn't mind trying the 88x line as they have built in VDSL, since I don't work in routing or switching it isn't as easy to get my hands on one) - I use an 1800 series with the Openreach modem. It's practically flawless. Plus they aren't too expensive on eBay now if you want one.

When I had ADSL I had a 1700 series router with ADSL WIC. It most certainly didn't synchronise at the full line rate that any other router did (8128/832), but I put that down to its age)",0,1367700690,null,0,1367701230,0,c9sfua2,t3_1dofy6,t1_c9sfua2,t1_c9sfpsg,null,1431324621,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your IPv4 address is something like 203.24.14.25 - four numbers, each in the range 0-255. That's the address for your router, and behind that you'll have addresses like 192.168.1.xxx. It's the router address which matters for our purposes. The 192... addresses are ""private"" - you can't talk to them from outside.

Ok, with IPv6, you're going to get an additional router address which looks like this:

2001:8a4:123:342:0:4231:ade3:3ed4

That's an additional address: it doesn't replace the IPv4 address, but is used along side it. Your PC transparently uses IPv6 when possible, and IPv4 when it isn't.

As you can see, it's much bigger, with the idea that you can't run out of addresses. Ok, but that's not the whole story. Each device in your network will also get a similar address, but in this case it is a *public* address. Unless a firewall stops it (which may commonly be the case), it *is* possible to talk to your PC from outside. This was the way that the Internet was originally designed to work, and will help with getting things like Skype or XBox network gaming working efficiently.

Just out of interest: you will be allocated a minimum of 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 for your home LAN, all of which are real public addresses. This may seem wasteful, but it makes it easier and cheaper to design the routers, and makes them cheaper to build.

Were you doing anything CPU intensive with the router, like ACLs or firewalling or QoS or anything fancy? They aren't very powerful buggers. I've used an 827, and (other than not syncing at full line rate) the throughput was to be expected. The 1700 was the same too but all I was doing was NAT, basically, nothing else.

&gt; What sort of throughput are you getting on the 1800 with FTTC?

The modem syncs at approximately 64Mbit, and I get about 60Mbit of throughput, which after overheads sounds pretty much spot on. Upload wise I sync at the full 20Mbit and achieve approx 17-18Mbps. Nothing to complain about. I'd like to try a 887 or 1900 but haven't had the chance.

The CPU pretty much maxes out when doing that and I don't think I have any CPU intensive features enabled, nor have I looked into seeing whether I can optimise anything.

I think right up until his Eighth incarnation he might have been vaguely about right.
But I think so much happened in the time war, he frankly lost track. And has just been vaguely guesstimating and adding things up. 
And when you speak to a human who's only alive for roughly 80 years at most. Saying you're easily ten times older is probably a bit creepy. 
Saying you're knocking on, (if we guess he's lying a lot) to be almost 20 times older is pushing it.

See, ninth doctor was quite a new one. 
He took the time to look at his reflection in the mirror in Roses' flat. And died whilst still traveling with her.
Tenth Doctor, travelled a LOT. With a lot of people. For a lot of time. And even when he stopped, he ran for a long time bouncing around the universe. the idea that he died at '6', for someone as old as him seems a bit ridiculous. I think he probably clocked up a hundred or so years. His eleventh incarnation seems good at wasting time, I imagine his tenth was just as practiced.

And finally, 11.
Who doesn't have a clue. In the impossible astronaut, he claims to be 1200. He just dossed about for 200 years since he last saw Amy and Rory and decided to round up. And since then, he travelled on and off with them for what, 13 years Amy said? something like that. Just for his adventures with them.

Nah, I'd say he's knocking on closer to 1500 at least. Actual guess, about 2000+ Depending on if he's been truthful about his age up until his ninth.

I sucked at chemistry for the vast majority of GCSEs. Got a C in my mock and then somehow pulled an A* out the bag. I genuinely don't know how, but I did do a lot of revision because I knew it was my weakest science. 

Use the Bitesize revision stuff. Some of it is very basic, but I found that when I went over the basics, it helped me understand the complicated stuff that I didn't get. 

Obviously do lots of past papers, and mark yourself honestly - or if you don't think you can get a parent/friend to do it. Past papers get you used to the style of questions they'll ask you and how to respond. You'll soon pick up the techniques you need to answer the written questions, and you'll also work out what areas are your particular weakness in chemistry - I assume you're not bad at *everything* - just some things. I for one did not get (and still don't get) titration. But once you know that, you can focus your revision on that.

Revise for all of them now, then a couple of days before each one, focus on the closest one. So do general revision for the next 10 days or so, then focus on physics. Then go back to bio &amp; chem, then focus on chem solidly for a few days.

I assume you also have other subjects, too, so obviously revise for them, but if this is your main worry, dedicated maybe 50% of your revision to it and then alternate between your other subjects.

true,theartofrolling,null,null,"There's a vast amount of evidence out there that shows that if you allow addicts access to an environment where they are safe from being punished, that provides clean needles, and a safe regulated dose of their drug then a few things happen.

1. A significantly higher number of addicts are able to recover, and maintain recovery for a substantially longer period of time.

2. Addicts and ex-addicts find it easier to re-integrate properly into society.

4. There's a significant drop in the rate of ""needle sharing"" and other unsafe practices which increase the risk of disease.

5. Less (potentially infectious) needles lying around outside, in the park for example.

3. Fewer addicts buy and sell illicit drugs, instead maintaining their habit, or recovering, with clean heroin from the clinic. Fewer addicts also live off criminal means. So less money for criminals overall.

4. You see a reduction in homelessness.

5. You get a significant reduction in new court cases for drug use and petty crimes.

The biggest part of the problem is this; people expect someone to come up with some sort of miracle strategy to completely eliminate drug use and drug related crime. That is never going to happen. Ever. We need reasonable solutions backed by scientific studies to deal with this problem. We have them, but we're not using most of them.

Here's a few links I pulled up, but I'd always recommend researching for yourself.

true,Randamba,null,null,"The answer to your question is yes.  Also, she actually died and was buried in that episode also, which is the end of two timelines.  Only one known Timelord has lived twice, let alone three times, so if Clara was Jenny then we would have to assume at several things:

1. Jenny learned how to time travel before becoming Clara.

2. Jenny somehow regenerated into a baby, or little girl, and was adopted by Clara's parent's, but the whole adoption process was missed by the Doctor who thought she was the natural born daughter of Clara's parents.

3. Did she ever see the TARDIS? If not, then she would have no idea that her dad is actually Matt Smith, because she doesn't know that he regenerated.

4. She's died twice, so she would have had to be saved after being buried at the end of the snowmen episode.

New point:

If Clara had not actually been born to two human parents then the following theory would be way out there, but possible.

Jenny- regenerates into Clara before or after learning time travel from somewhere.

Clara- obtains a pocket watch from someone to hide her timelord identity while she is on the run from some unknown enemy.

Clara- Now appearing human in mind and body, she has forgotten everything and has a wild timeline that crosses into the Doctor's timeline in a weird fashion.  First he sees the end of her timeline, she is turned into a Dalek, which causes her to forget him because the trauma caused her to forget almost everything. Second, he meets her at the snowmen, the first time Clara actually meets him.  She has a yearning to be with him all the time because in the very back of her mind she remembers her dad, but there aren't enough clues to make her feel out of place, and she doesn't know the Doctor is her dad anyway.

Clara - Dies again during the Snowmen episode, however, the pocket watch somewhere making her human hides her identity.  After everyone leaves her grave, the one person chosen to watch over her identity digs her up and revives her with some kind of future tech.  All memories of the Doctor are gone again because the trauma from dying caused her to forget the past several weeks, and her guardian takes her to a new era.

Clara- this is where the theory breaks.  Later when the Doctor finds Clara, he also goes backwards in her timeline following her as she grows up to see if she's a normal human.  A pocket watch hasn't been shown to do anything like that.  The only possible way for this theory to work is if Jenny, who was technically very young, regenerated into a baby, and then was given a false identity by some protector, who then rigged it so her new parents adopted her.

It's possible that this new predicament is a future timeline event of the Doctor, but highly unlikely.  If the Doctor somehow witnessed Jenny die, and regenerate into a baby Clara, then after all this time chasing the mystery, he would realize what happened, and use a pocket watch on her to give her a relatively normal human life.

Problems here arise because she appeared in multiple eras as Clara without the Doctor, implying that he did not make her travel around anywhere.",0,1367710588,null,0,false,0,c9sigiu,t3_1dnwuc,t1_c9sigiu,t1_c9shw1j,null,1431323388,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,ctesibius,cnty-uk,"Reading, Berkshire","""Technophobe"" my arse. That's an excellent question.

Yes, that is a real risk. Your IPv6 address is 128 bits long. Let's divide it in to two 64 bit chunks - this is one common way that it's chopped up. The first bit is the same for all of the addresses on your personal network, and the second bit is different for all of them. Let's call them the prefix and the suffix.

You can't do anything about the prefix. That's allocated to you by your ISP. I have a bit of a campaign on to get this changed periodically in our systems, because otherwise it will make it trivial for Google to track any traffic from your home network. However this one doesn't say which device on that network it is - your smartphone, your PC, your fridge all have the same prefix.

Now the suffix is more interesting. Each device can pick its own suffix (a bit of a simplification, but that's generally true). The original way that was suggested for this based the suffix on the ""MAC address"" of the Ethernet or WiFi adapter, which would mean that each device got the same suffix each time. They already have the same prefix, so they get the same full IP address each time. As you suggest, this might not be a good thing.

Eventually someone spotted this as a problem and they defined a standard called ""Privacy Extensions"" which would change the suffix every 24h. You might think that that would break any connection you have up at the time, but one of the things I skated over earlier is that in IPv6 you usually have more than one address. So in this case, the PC stops using the old address for new connections, but carries on using it for old connections until they terminate. This will help with privacy to a certain extent, but only where the device implements the standard. PCs and such should be ok, but I rather suspect that when light switches and fridges become IPv6-enabled they will just ignore this standard.",0,1367710690,null,0,false,0,c9sihgg,t3_1dofy6,t1_c9sihgg,t1_c9sg6rr,null,1431323376,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
