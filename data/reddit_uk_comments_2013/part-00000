1. ""Run"" is simply a keyphrase in Doctor Who. It encapsulates perfectly that the show is about intellect and wit. Not about charging the issue head on and trying to outbrawl them. 

2. Pond was incidentally the right word, yes. But how would ""children"" or ""nightmares"" have captured the danger? They wouldn't. Pond, on the other hand, is enigmatic. Why would someone choose pond as a word to describe simultaneously danger and a motivator? It's precisely because of that, that Clara chose that word. Because she knew it would intrigue the Doctor. It doesn't matter that she didn't know about the additional effect.

3. If there was a way for River to exist outside the Library then who figured it out? Who made it happen? And more importantly, why? Who would have the skill, knowledge and motivation to do this? Only the Doctor and River would have. And given that one is trapped inside the system and the other apparently doesn't think there is a way, then I really have to say that this is definitely the weakest point.

4. The Doctor got kissed, he didn't initiate. Admittedly he didn't really try much to stop it, but hey, it's still an important distinction. The Doctor already flirted with Clara in the Asylum. Clara is simply a flirtatious person, that much is clear.

Unless some ridiculous offers come in for the players you mentioned (or they pull a Torres and ask to leave) I doubt we'll see them go this month. 

Hopefully we can shift Cole (to QPR) and perhaps Downing (back to Middlesbrough) too. 

I'd be worried about losing Coates. We can't afford to lose a CB but I keep seeing rumours about us being interested in other CBs who might come in to replace him. I hope that's not the case because I really like the lad - plus I think losing him could upset the likes of Suarez and Lucas. 

I reckon Pacheco will probably go though. I like him and he's been good for our U21s. But sadly he's never delivered when given the chance in the first team - though admittedly he hasn't had many chances to prove himself. I'd hope for a return loan to Norwich, not sure if they'd need/want him but if it did happen it would be good PL experience for him.

true,LocutusOfBorges,null,null,"&gt;Nah my GCSEs were crap and I can't be bothered going through the interview palava when you get the pretty much the same thing anywhere else.

No,  you don't.

Assuming you want to take the traditional PPE route, there's absolutely nowhere else in the country that offers a PPE course that can hold a candle to Oxford's- in quantity of teaching, quality of teaching, breadth of opportunity stemming from the experience, and the utility of the piece of paper you come out of it with. The teaching method's fundamentally different to its equivalents around the rest of the country- far, *far* smaller tutor:student ratios, significantly more contact hours, and a greater breadth of specialised academics on hand to teach. 

If all you want out of it's a piece of paper, then by all means- ""you get pretty much the same thing"". In every other regard that matters, though? Oxbridge trumps.

Nonetheless- *do* try and pull yourself together enough to get to *a* half-decent university. If you want to go into politics, it's the best route around. 

Regardless, though!

&gt;I love politics and the idea of representing a community and voting on national decisions. I can't see myself doing anything else when I'm older so how would I go about this?

This is an appalling mindset to hold if you want to get into politics.

You like the idea of a job involving representing people and voting on the country's political direction? That isn't viewing politics as a calling- it's viewing it as a route to personal status and power. 

I've met enough people holding that sort of mindset in the time I've been involved in activism for a lifetime. Sort yourself out- do you want to be in politics to *help people*? For a *cause*? For what you deem to be morally *right*? 

Or do you just fancy being the next Tony Blair? 

You're sixteen years old. You might not realise it yet, but you're almost certainly desperately naive about the whole business. 

Most people that *actually get somewhere* in politics get there (obligatory scaling of the pole aside) actually caring about a social cause enough to fight for it. 

Unless you're in politics *for* something, you shouldn't be thinking about going into politics at all.

If you find yourself caring about a cause, go out and *campaign* for it. It doesn't even have to be a party platform- though making a name for yourself in a local party can certainly help things.

I think a dedicated r/doctorwhocrafts would be a good way to go as it would allow more in-depth discussion on art &amp; crafts. Posts that do well there could be reposted here.

An alternative would be to just give in and create a r/doctorwhodiscussion, and have everyone who wants to discuss the show to migrate there. It would be a shame to let this subreddit decline into nothing but TARDIS shoes and Dalek cupcakes though. 

A few more suggestions to clear up the clutter:

- The mods work together more to enforce the rules. At the moment rule-breaking posts that get a lot of up votes tend not to get removed.

- Change the CSS so that the rules are above the FAQ and so are more visible?

- Message rule-breakers (spoilers in title, 'look what I got for Christmas', 'my favourite scene', etc) to let them know why their post broke the rules and has been removed. I don't know if this already happens and I appreciate that it would be time-consuming, but it would help others to learn and thus lead new subscribers by example.

3. I would be perfectly fine with the dark ending (IE Arthur) if the way that we got there weren't so dumb. Huge plotholes everywhere with not very smart writing, although we've had 4 series of less than great writing, so they're sticking to the norm. 

4. I'm extraordinarily grateful that the M/A relationship basically ended as well as it could, with Arthur knowing and loving Merlin. That they did extraordinarily well.

Johnson is one of the best RB's in the world when he's on his game.

It's simply not true- Glen has some of the best tackling on the team, and has great pace and recovers well.  He's also got a pretty good mind for tactics IMO.  And his ability with the ball- dribbling, passing, shielding, crossing- really should not be understated.  Probably the best attacking fullback in the league.

And Suarez is consistently the only bright spark- or one of very few bright sparks- that Liverpool has.  He's surrounded by kids and so-so players (by Liverpool standards, and compared to him), but he still produces consistently brilliant displays, week in, week out.  He's the best dribbler in the league on his day, and full of invention, grit, and determination.  His passing can also border on sublime quite often, especially his chips in and around the box.

I wouldn't call the RTD-school of arc-story ""subtle"". Just non-involved. Slipping a word of phrase into episodes is fun, but doesn't let the concept breathe, or even develop mystery except for those who are paying really, really close attention. Yes, that makes it a nice easter egg, and rewarding for those who find it, but is not actually telling a story (or, maybe, is repeatedly telling the same Big-Bad-across-the-universe story). 

The cracks were immediately the mystery, and they did a pretty excellent job of revealing new information throughout the series, while still rewarding those who were paying attention. Series 6 did a less good job with the astronaut/Doctor dying, for various reasons (personally, I think the mystery was TOO big and tried too hard; of course the Doctor isn't dead, or even in moderate peril). 

We'll see where the continued hints at memory and memory loss are going with series 7, but it feels a lot more restrained than the past two Moffat stories (though there's some lingering arc-questions it may be building up to as well).

moffat's seasons are higher production quality, the scripts have story arcs that actually mean something, and the plot twists are meaningful.

watching the Doctor under Russel T. Davies was like watching a British Star Trek. It was a cookie cutter episode formula.  Doctor arrives in new time zone/ area zone to investigate supernatural elements. Turns out its an alien. Doctor defeats alien.

Moffat's episodes are just so much more sophisticated.....  and i'm talking about the subject matter here, not the production quality (which is better nonetheless).  

I honestly think Moffat is a genius and the best episodes and best storylines are from his direction.  I cant wait to see what he does with the Doctor and Sherlock, because he is very good at what he does.  I can't believe he single-handedly has artistic &amp; plot control of two of britains biggest, most internationally recognizable pop-culture characters.

It may only be that the Doctor regenerates more often due to being put in harm's way so frequently and thus gives this false impression of negative aging.  I always suspected (and the Doctor has hinted in both old and new Who) that they did age, just much much slower than humans (say 100 human years for 1 Gallifreyan year is my estimate).  True Immortality is supposed to be impossible for a Gallifreyan (Rassilon set a trap for such people in The Five Doctors), but it has happened (the Master rejuvenated in a Numismeton gas rush in Planet of Fire, and the Valeyard was offered the Doctor's remaining regenerations in Trial of a Time Lord, River Song shared some of her regenerative energy at one point).  More recently the Doctor has made mention of ""Regenerative Energy"" as if it's a pool that can be depleted and (hopefully for the series) filled.

true,doctor457,pertwee,Pertwee,"Okay, so I was listening to a podcast discussing the newest Christmas episode and I might have realized why Amy Pond and, by extension, Rory, have become such mainstays of the past two and a half series of Doctor Who. It's a little bit of a leap, but hear me out... 

During the ending of The Big Bang, when Amy re-creates the universe, Amy remembers the Doctor back into existence. We all remember this scene if we saw it--Amy sees River, she notices the TARDIS journal, and she remembers the Doctor--HER Raggedy Doctor. She doesn't just call him back into being, she calls him home. She doesn't ask him to come, she scolds him for being late to her wedding. And her specific invocation for bringing back the Doctor and the TARDIS, the words that finish bringing them back into being? Something old. Something new. Something borrowed. Something blue. Now, Amy initially speaks these words while trying to describe the TARDIS--but how well does this describe The Doctor himself? 

He is old, but re-created to be something new. He might be a person, but time with him is only borrowed, not forever. And what is the Eleventh Doctor eternally? Blue. Sad. Especially over his loss of the Ponds at the end of the Angels Take Manhattan. Wait, that last part ended up being tangential, but I like it so I'm leaving it in. 

Anyways, when he shows up he's just the way that Amy would want him at the wedding: dressed up and ready to go. And when she brings the Doctor back, Rory remembers... everything. He's not only Rory, he's Rory and the Lone Centurion. He's better than just plain old Rory. Anyways, when this happens, Amy imprints the need to return into the Doctor. He isn't just the Doctor--he's Amy's Doctor. 

He can't quit the Ponds until they won't let him back anymore, and even the departure is difficult. What isn't said, though (because it isn't realized within the confines of the series), is that it is not only because of the potential paradox of running into the Ponds after knowing that the end of that adventure is ""The Final Farewell"" but also since Amy actually wishes him away forever--she lets go of him, she rejects any further experience with him. And The Doctor falls into a depression because he has lost his newest and literalest raison d'être (literally ""reason to be"" or ""reason of being""). 

TL;DR: At the end of The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, Amy not only brought the Doctor back into being, she merged him with her ideals of him (as she did with merging Rory with his Auton counterpart), making him her Doctor. She is his reason to live, and it is only her complete rejection of further interactions with him at the end of The Angels Take Manhattan (well, moreso than the paradox thing) that keeps him away, crushing him. He literally has no reason to continue to be after the woman who re-created him to be her loyal companion rejected him. He is no longer her Doctor.

So now the transfer window is open, It'll be interested to see what happens. It would be good if we could bring in someone else to play on the left or right. Looking at our attacking options now, we have:

Strikers: Borini, Suarez, (Sturridge)
-
Wingers/Inside Forwards: Downing, Cole, Sterling, Assaidi, Suso (?), Shelvey (?), Suarez
-

We're pretty much set on strikers already, once Sturridge moves.

Now, Suso and Shelvey are just products of lack of positions for them to play in the midfield, so that's why they are being shafted to the wings, so we can cancel them out as natural, proper wingers that we're looking for.

Downing and Cole we'll hopefully have Brendan piggy back out personally, be it this month or in July, so for the sake of discussion we'll rule them out.

So that leaves Sterling and Assaidi that can play on the wings. So, for some reason, Assaidi isn't getting any game time, so that doesn't make him very ideal to play for us on the wings. And while Sterling is good, he's still really young and he might want to take a break once in a while. That leaves only Suarez as the experienced player that can play on the wings for us.

So, ideally, if we can sell Cole and Downing to add to our transfer budget, we should be looking for one or two more players that can play there.

The entire previous episode had been building up to the moment where the doctor would be imprisoned in the Pandorica.  I was hoping that the day would be saved by some intelligent and well worked-out story telling.

Instead, the doctor is out within the first five minutes, with little explanation, using a blatant paradox that is very badly concealed.  

Personally, I think a satisfying good Doctor Who conclusion should be like a murder mystery.  It should make sense, it shouldn't make things up on the spot, and if you're really clever, you should be able to guess what's going to happen.

I don't have the answers and I don't understand the difficulties in implementing these things. But in this case, it's the NHS that deals with the binge drinking that appears to be a problem and the obesity problems we have.

This is purely conjecture, but I imagine it's drinkers of alco-pop type drinks which contribute the most to the state of the high street on a Fri/Sat night than say, ale drinkers. These drinks are more addictive and it's as though you're not even drinking alcohol.

I'm not anti corporation or anti capitalism, but they are making inferior, albeit popular, products, which some of us become addicted to and it's society that foots the bill.

Sorry, but Y2K was more than a scare. The reason it gets trivialised is because it was so well prepared for and so little went wrong. I worked in the UK oil and gas industry. A huge amount of our control systems were non-compliant. Refineries, offshore production, pipeline control systems. A huge amount of money and effort were put into updating systems years ahead of time. Even with all the preparation we still had some failures, but largely not affecting production or infrastructure. If our industry and other industries, power, water, infrastructure, transport hadn't put in the effort the consequences would have been devastating. Granted, a lot of IT companies made hay out of the issue, and a lot of unnecessary work was done, but in real industry, industry that you and I depend on, Y2k was a fucking big deal and was very, very effectively managed. It pisses me off no end when I hear people say it was a non event. Companies spent millions making sure it was.

So, outside of some arbitrary and pointless boundary there is literally no reason for the concept of Greater Manchester to exist, although there are some voluntary and a couple of government funded things which deal specifically with Greater Manchester but there's no reason why this couldn't be incorporated back into Lancashire. 

I don't know of anyone who says that Bolton is in Greater Manchester and I've always addressed it as Bolton, Lancashire and I wasn't even born until 1984 which shows the strength of Lancastrian identity that existed in the area after the boundary changes.

It's an odd one that's for sure! I'd be interested in what actual Mancunians think of it as opposed to us who just surround Manchester, I guess for the surrounding towns (although as I say, wasn't born) it must have felt a bit like being told they where now just a suburb of Manchester which is possibly why there's such a strong sense of identity in a lot of those towns that became Greater Manchester.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"I think I remember Houllier in approx. 2001 saying that ideally we'd have at least 4 strikers.  At the time we had Owen, Heskey, Baros, Litmanen AND Fowler (followed by Anelka on loan after Robbie left).  I know we played a different system in that we played with 2 up front as compared to now, but as Brendan said in an interview before the Sunderland match back in September, to realistically challenge for the CL places (which we're not there yet but hopefully next season), we need to score about 70 goals a year.  We need to dramatically increase our chances of hitting that target, so any new, quick forwards who we can bring in I will welcome with very open arms.

As for our winger situation, I agree, we ought to ship out Downing.  It's a shame, I really want to support him, but it doesn't make sense to keep playing someone who has contributed so little to this club (statistically speaking only, of course).  If we can find Cole a new club as well, that's a HUGE savings on wages between the pair of them.  I would play Sterling on the right side and Assaidi/Suso on the left.

I would bring in one more right-sided winger if it were up to me.  While I respectfully disagree with your assertion that Sterling might need to be given a rest because he's young (I think his youth is an advantage in that he doesn't need a break as much as some of the others), I do realise that if he got injured then we need someone to step in and take over and not break up the team's chemistry.  I'd even go so far as to say that if we can get an older winger, he can mentor Sterling and help him develop further, as he's definitely not the finished product yet.

Realistically, this is January and we almost certainly won't be able to get this all done this month.  Hopefully by the time next season rolls around though, this team will be even closer to Brendan's ideal and results will pick up.",0,1357045249,null,0,false,0,c7p6xmi,t3_15rkee,t1_c7p6xmi,t1_c7p6aql,null,1430823755,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Yeah, I guess. But back then we had 4-5 strikers vying for two places (5:2, or 2.5:1) and with Sturridge we would have two strikers going for one place in the team (2:1) with Suarez available to play as striker anytime. Also, Baros (who joined later than 2001 IIRC) and Litmanen (who played as a second striker/attacking midfielder anyway) were pretty okay with being benched once in a while, to say the least. I don't think Sturridge/Borini/(whoever else we would hypothetically bring in) would be very happy with sitting on the bench, considering we've paid 10m+ for Borini and are probably going to pay 14m for Sturridge. And I don't think BR would pay that kind of money for a backup/reserve player.

And just to be clear, I was mentioning Sterling being young and wanting to take a break once in a while in two points. As in, he's young and may still be inexperienced, (1st point) and due to the nature of his game (making use of his pace to beat the opponent, tracking back a lot to defend, etc.) he might need to get a break once in a while (2nd point). We did see him get a break for two games (from a starting place at least), against Fulham and Stoke, so that shows that he does need to rest once in a while.

But yeah, I agree that we should look to bring in another winger, though it doesn't really matter which side he can play on.

Sturridge, I think it's pretty clear he'll *want* to play centrally (he is primarily a striker after all), but nobody knows if he will. And from what he's showed it seems like playing centrally is his more natural role as well.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; Both Sturridge and Borini don't really have the trickery or immense pace of a winger

But that's the thing - we're not using wingers the way, say, Spurs or United are. Our wingers are expected to cut in and be goal threats, not necessarily by running at goal with the ball at their feet, but by moving into goalscoring positions to be fed by others. That's why Borini popping up centrally to score from wide areas is an argument **for** playing him wide rather than against - by starting wide rather than centrally, his runs into central areas are harder for the opponents to track/mark.

That's why I said it was 3 goal-scoring slots rather than the 1 you suggested; because our wingers aren't being asked to play like normal wingers, they're really closer to being wide strikers. Look at Barcelona - how many conventional wingers do they have? Pedro is the ideal model for what Borini could offer, David Villa is a centre-forward who was more than happy to play wide for Barca, Iniesta certainly isn't a winger but can play wide; Sanchez and Tello are the closest thing Barca have to real wingers, and even they aren't the type to blaze down the byline.",0,1357050568,null,0,false,0,c7p7f8f,t3_15rkee,t1_c7p7f8f,t1_c7p7bmb,null,1430823984,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Not a lot of convictions.

Your original point was that there was lots of charging but not a lot of convictions. Conviction rate was almost exactly 80%. You may believe that is a poor return rate but I think most prosecutors would be happy with it.

It is an undisputed (and well reported) fact that the initial investigation was poor and sloppy police work led to an unnecessary and unacceptable number of people being arrested.  However you also appear to be claiming that too many people were charged frivolously. This is clearly not the case.

&gt;it gets worse when you consider they had 7250 suspects only only got 1451 convictions.

I don't think you understand the word 'suspect'.

I totally support your point that Charged with != Convicted.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"The main point was more of how sometimes he just makes his routine passes, be it to Suarez or whoever, and the goalscorer actually makes the goals himself.

By taking set pieces you actually have more of a chance to assist. Set pieces are already considered dangerous, it's basically a free chance for you to send a good ball in. A lot of goals come from set pieces, and the assist is credited to the set piece taker, even though it's not actually as brilliant as what Silva does (skipping through a few defenders and slipping it through, or doing a quick turn for the sudden through ball). Most set pieces you don't aim for a single person or a small area, you go for the general area just outside the six yard box, that way anyone has a chance to put it into the net.

Silva, Mata, Rooney and RVP aren't like Gerrard. Gerrard takes all crossing free kicks and most of the corners. RVP doesn't take corners, and when he takes free kicks he tends to go for goal himself. Silva's assists are actually really brilliant, it's clear that he actually set up the goal. Mata's are pretty much the same. Rooney doesn't take that many free kicks/corners.

I really have yet to see Gerrard clearly assist a goal himself, as in, give a clear cut chance to someone to score.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; but I think it couldn't hurt to have an extra striker.

On the other hand, him coming back now reduces his chances of West Ham making the deal permanent. If he comes back and they go down, they won't have the money to buy him; if he comes back and they stay up, they'll say ""we don't need Andy Carroll to survive in the league, why waste 18m on him?""

It'll also give Carroll the misguided belief that he could still salvage his Liverpool career, and that'll make it harder to shift him next summer.

Besides, we're realistically out of the running for the top 4 this season, and a guy who scored 1 goal every 5 games for us in a more direct style than Rodgers' isn't going to magically launch is back into contention. We gain nothing by bringing Carroll back, but we potentially lose 15-18m and 80k/wk from our transfer &amp; wage kitty for next season.

His hold up play was great, took everything out of the air and controlled it brilliantly most of the time.

One other thing -- Amy wrote the book if I'm remembering correctly, right?

true,bobanators,eng-Worcestershire,Worcestershire/Cambridgeshire,"Yeah I'd say you can. But I think it's more the training that does it. Builds muscle and training can be pretty intense depending on what activities we are doing. Some are very strenuous and some less so. I've definitely lost weight from doing the training and my 10 min bike journey to uni and back. 

It does depend on what position you play too. Being on the line I wouldn't say gets you much exercise at all but the rest involve quite a bit of running. 

Also being on the kick off or kick off return team means you have to run full pelt up field a few times a game. 

So I'd definitely say you exercise quite a bit but no doubt it's more the training that does it. 

Yeah the game does involve a lot of stopping and starting. I did read that the game is only about 5 mins, but it is definitely longer than that. It's 30 mins a quarter, maybe about 10 minimum is game time. 

I think it's becoming a hell of a lot more popular. Not all unis have a team but in our league there has to be at least 10 uni sides and we are a smaller league, of which there are about 6 odd more leagues. Which isn't a lot really now I think about it.. 

Why not rugby? I wasn't really a fan of it at school in pe lessons. Our school never had teams either so I never got to try it out properly. I've always wanted to give American football a go so when I found our uni had a team I gave it a go and I loved it. 

Plus, I sound like a huge pussy now but I don't want to get hurt playing rugby!

It's interesting that you feel that getting automatic time off from work is the only way you would be able to celebrate Christmas.

In other countries, like those in Asia, if you are a Christian, you apply for time off for Christmas - even in countries where Christians are a majority.

Our system is also inconsistent - if we are going to have automatic time off for Christmas, then we should also all have time off for Chinese New Year, Setsubun-sai, Ramadan, Eid, Rosh Hashanah and all the other major religious holidays. Anything else is, frankly, discriminatory.

You can't give days off for every single significant date because it would flood the calendar with holidays. You'd hardly ever work. Not to mention the fact that most people don't celebrate it. Barely a significant minority celebrate most of the things you mentioned. It would just be another day off. No religious or cultural reason to do it (for most people). It's not discriminatory. If they want a holiday, they can apply for it. As far as I know, their employer is obliged to give them a holiday for religious reasons. If not... well, they should be. It's responsible democracy.

I'm not sure how it's immoral, unless you're afraid of insulting people who probably couldn't give a fuck. Not everything has to be rational. Stop being such a boring fud and let people enjoy themselves. Oh, and it does make economic sense. People spend loads of money in preperation for the big holidays, which more than offsets the lost business on one or two days.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt;  Oh, and it does make economic sense. People spend loads of money in preperation for the big holidays, which more than offsets the lost business on one or two days.

People would spend just as much regardless of if they had to work or not. Whether you have to work on Christmas or not has no bearing on one's propensity to celebrate it, as evidenced in the countries where this is happens.

&gt; As far as I know, their employer is obliged to give them a holiday for religious reasons. If not... well, they should be. It's responsible democracy.

There are plenty of democracies where your religion stops the moment you enter the workplace. Your religious and political views have no right to exist in the workplace, they are divisive and expressing them is unprofessional. In many cultures, your loyalties to your work and supporting your family are considered more important than your religion and one would never let religious obligations come before obligations to your employer. Religion is personal, and is kept to the home, family and place of worship **only.**

true,widgetas,null,null,"The other examples you raise are interesting, and I find I have personal conflicts. Fishing, for example, on a base level could be seen as similar to chasing the fox (a thrill when the float/line bobs) and yet it would seem rather extreme to outlaw the practice - maybe we're mammal biased? Pheasant shooting I find myself frowning at due to the fact that the birds are bred to be shot, with (I believe?) the consumption being a happy byproduct these days. I might be wrong.

There is, I think, an analogy to be made with bull fighting. I was unaware until a couple of years ago that the bull is consumed after the kill. However the manner of its death is still wrong, to my mind, in that entertainment is made from the protracted kill. I suppose its torture after a fashion.

If we concentrate on animal killing that involves prolonged death, I think that fox hunting would fit into that category with bull fighting. Fishing (if killing the fish), hawking (catching rabbits with hawks?) and pheasant shooting is, at least, not protracted but rather swift. 

Back to foxes: 

I know people involved in fox hunting too and they aren't posh sorts either. I grew up in a fairly rural area (the town where the Berkeley Hunt meet each Boxing day) but I believe that the region is still in a majority of anti- hunting with dogs, the same as the rest of the country over all.

What is immoral about enjoying hunting: I'm no expert but I believe it ties in with what I've said above about finding entertainment in the death of another creature. It's true that times change of course and it once was the case that people found entertainment in the deaths of other people, depending on who they were. It could be that as we're more and more removed from death, we (in general) find it less pleasant to see - let alone enjoy - death.

I do recall a lady saying, before the hunting ban, when it was clear that the law was going to come in: ""Why should the majority spoil it for the minority?"" Surely that's one of the issues with democracy, and it happens with anything (or should) that the majority find distasteful. And I'm not sure that the urban/rural dichotomy is as striking as it's implied. You might happen to have a reliable source that says otherwise, or not? But even if that is the case, so what? There's always a bell curve too, with people living in semi-rural areas. But would drawing a distinction like that mean that countryfolk can't have a say on issues that would mainly affect urban dwellers?

If I remember rightly way back in the 90's the fox hunting debate wasn't ever argued *for* by mentioning that it's a sport, or that it's fun and that people enjoy it. That was used against the practice right from the start, but it took a number of years of the other arguments for hunting being rebutted or dismissed for something like this to be said: ""We enjoy it and who are you to tell us we can't do it?""

There's kind of a mistake in your second quotation there, although it's my fault. I accidentally deleted something before ""It's responsible democracy"" and I can't remember what it was. It's not supposed to come after that statement. Sorry :/

* I agree with the sentiment that he's a box to box midfielder, but with the pace that Spurs play from their box to the other, he's more of a ""accurate-release"" man rather than one who will run with the likes of Bale and Lennon

* Let me expand on accurate-release, he's the kind of player who Sandro would pass the ball to on the break and then after going 5-7 paces with the ball to allow Bale and Lennon to GET ON THEIR runs and choose directions, he can play it for them exactly there, he's got the composure, experience and skill to do just that

* Creative midfielder, no, I value Parker as a player and I think he's a stunning footballer, but we can't expect him to pull a role like Silva. He's a CDM by nature, no point trying to ""develop"" him as a player who is creative at this stage of his career. He's got a decent attacking mind and plays enough key passes as it is, we're fine really, if we want Spurs to be taken seriously at the world stage, we need to get a proper creative midfielder, someone like, yes... Sneijder. :P

* The only problem for me here is how does AVB juggle Dembele, Sandro and Parker?

I can't imagine the first part of series 8 being filmed and ready for broadcast before the end of summer, especially if Moffat is busy elsewhere.  I don't think that they'd try to squish all of series 8 into the end of 2013, that sounds like insanity, especially since it isn't even filming yet.  I'd expect either 50th anniversary special, then christmas special, then series 8 in 2014, or the first half of series 8 in the fall, then the specials, then the second half in 2014.  Regardless, as there's no way it can be filmed and ready to go before a certain point(which I still insist has to be at least 7-8 months off), I see two options for what could have been done with the end of series 7:

1) Hold off on the second half of series 7, since we had a little taste to hold us over with the christmas special.  Have a shorter break of 3-4 months, then the rest of series 7, followed by another short break before starting series 8.  This is what they're trying to do, I think, and I appreciate it because it means that I don't have to wait for so long that I forget what's been happening.

2) Start showing the second half of series 7 right after the christmas special, finishing up the finale by the end of February.  Then we have to wait 6+ months at minimum for series 8.

true,wahahay,null,null,"Parker and Dembele are both box-to-box midfielders, but interestingly, Parker's attacking is about as good as Dembele's defending

Dembele's defending isn't bad, far from it. He tackles well and holds the ball exceptionally. However, he isn't inclined to intercept, hold his position or man-mark, things you expect from a CDM. He probably could, but has spent all of his career as an attacker by nature.

With that cleared up, and if you read Waffuls post re. Parker, you can picture a perfect partnership in CM.

Parker to defend and Dembele to attack initially, but if Dembele is getting closed down too much, he could switch to defend and Parker to play his more passing/hoof style of play on the break. A good way of mixing things up without having to substitute.

true,LAXLuther,null,null,"Here is a dose of reality for you.  The grass is not greener on the other side.  This is a response I wrote to someone else about aspects of UK life that people don't always hear about:   

The UK is a deeply dysfunctional, narcissistic and infantile society.  

If you move there, adopt and live by the British national motto: cut off your nose to spite your face.

It's best if you lack self-respect, self awareness and any sense of shame.  It will make your time in the UK less painful.

If you are a young woman, go out on cold evenings wearing as little as possible in order to ""pull"".

If you are a guy, make friends with at least five or six other guys, go out as a pack and get as drunk as possible.  The aim is to throw up in public and to pick a fight with the police.  

If you are a teenage girl, you're likely to get pregnant soon.  

If you are a teenage boy, try and get a girl pregnant soon.  

Learn to swear in public, particularly at bus stops, in the bus, or when using your cell phone in cafes.  

Littering is a national sport, so feel free to dump your rubbish in the street, at bus stops, in shops, or anywhere in public.  

Vandalism is a popular and funny hobby, so feel free to smash bus stops, old phone booths, public art, window shops or anything in public spaces really.  If you find vandalism sad, then you are in for a painful experience.   

You don't have to clean up after yourself, because there is someone who will do it for you.  If a place is not clean, throw a tantrum and/or complain about it.

Be arrogant, loud, gobby and aggressive, especially in public.   

Aim to get an Anti Social Behaviour Order (or whatever it is called now) and be proud if it.  After all, it's like wining a trophy.  

Don't show any consideration for other people whatsoever, anywhere.  

Learn to believe you are more important than anyone else, especially people from the European Continent.  

Learn to mistrust Europeans, and to hate the French and Germans.  Remember, you are not European, you live in Britain, which is not part of Europe.  It's off the coast of Europe.  

Learn to accept that you'll be ripped off by everyone for everything.  

Learn to complain, but not to do anything about it.  

Learn to talk about the miserable weather in order to avoid talking about your feelings.  

Get used to functionalism, but not beauty or elegance.  

Get used to really ugly architecture and very grim, bleak towns and cities.  You'll soon realize that concrete and tar are everywhere.  

Say goodbye to common sense and logic. 

Don't expect any stimulation of the senses or passion for anything as a result of blandness and greyness, which infect every aspect of life in the UK.

If you are humble, you won't get anywhere.  

Don't expect kindness especially as a foreigner.  

If you don't like dogs, you're in for a big shock.  

If you are sexually active, you'll have a STD soon.  

You are likely to put on a great deal of weight.

You are also likely to develope a drug addiction.  

Take up binge drinking.

Don't expect friendly and/or good service in shops, restaurants, cafes, post offices etc.  Customer service in the UK is terrible and those working on front-line services, or in customer services are doing you a favour by ""helping"" you.  

British bus drivers are the most miserable bunch in the world.  

Public transport is very expensive, and you do not get value for money.  The trains in the UK are the most expensive in Europe, but there ate frequent problems, delays and excuses for the disintegrating rail network.  

Don't expect to go anywhere by car in a hurry.  Traffic in the UK is horrendous.  It will take you hours just to travel a short distance.  

Because of the cost of public transport (and companies trying to suck you dry and deliver a bad service), and the problems with traffic, it is quite difficult to be spontaneous, unless you are prepared to be ripped off, and have a significant amount of time on your hand.  

You just have to accept that in 99.9% of the time, the answer to a request will be ""no"".

Don't hope that things will get better.  There is no interest in improving things.  People prefer things to remain the same.      ",0,1357072172,null,0,false,0,c7pbuyz,t3_15s9fh,t1_c7pbuyz,t3_15s9fh,null,1430826207,-43,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-43

Firstly, it even states on the front of the log book that being the registered keeper doesn't imply ownership.

You have two things you now need to do:

1) Remove the brother you don't want driving it from any insurance plan you have. Inform the insurers that your parents added him without your permission. Next time he's out in the car phone the Police and say someone has stolen it. Inform them you're the owner but not the registered keeper. When they stop your brother they'll phone you to ask if he has your permission. Say no. He'll then be done for TWOC as well as having no insurance. If they phone the brother you bought it off instead of you and he says your younger brother has permission, by giving him permission to drive a car he's not insured for then your older brother gets 6 points and a fine.

2) In regards to the V5. Get a fuck ton of parking tickets. Deny all knowledge of driving it. Under the new rules that came into force in October 2012, the registered keeper then gets to pay the parking tickets. See how long it is before he decides to send off the V5.

true,angelkimne,null,null,"Well. I'm half American, half British, and I've spent a fair bit of time on either side of the Atlantic. So I guess my advice is worth something.

Firstly, architecture. You should realize that there is a lot of ugliness inside and outside London! There's alot of concrete, a lot of ugly housing estates. But at the same time, there are some ridiculously pretty towns and cities (like Oxford) and London is full of amazing architecture, new and old. There are generally alot more old buildings here in London than there are in any American city I've been to. I live in a pretty Victorian housing estate -- and living in pretty old buildings is no big deal over here.

Secondly, in terms of natural beauty, we (unfortunately) lack the resources of America. Depending on where you live exactly, you probably have prettier sights' than we do! We have lots of green fields, tame forest, some hills, and some pretty coastline, but that's basically it. There are some mountains in Scotland. Nothing to compare to your National Parks, though.

Thirdly, the UK has way better politics! Our government gets stuff done. There is no gridlock. And its a lot less superficial. There are no TV advertisements, no talk shows, no ideological extremism... No right wing extremists; no left wing extremists. None that will ever get power, anyway. We are pretty unpatriotic in comparison, which I really do appreciate. We're far *far* less religious, too, and I appreciate that even more!

There are some other reasons that I might prefer life in the UK. Pedestrian culture -- cars are absolutely optional and unnecessary here in London, and I don't have one -- walking and cycling is more viable and common than it is in most American cities. More historical sights, attractions, and interests.   No guns (even our police are unarmed)!

Of course, it helps that London is a true world city.

true,mejogid,null,null,"Just FYI - if you're from a working class background and a bad secondary school, and if your AS module results are good, then you'll stand a good chance of getting an interview.  A good reference from your school also helps.  Some colleges will ask for submitted essays or do assessments at interview, which is another chance to leave behind your GCSEs.  If you get a prospectus, then you can look at which colleges have a higher proportion of state school intake.

And don't think of interview as a palava - if you think you underperformed at GCSE, then it's a chance to set yourself apart (which is an opportunity you won't get.  This is especially the case if you're passionate about a subject.  They're both excellent universities, and the college system means that they have far more active student politics scenes than most universities.  Judging by cabinet ministers' alma maters, it'll also hugely increase your chances of making it far in politics.

And finally, while the statistics you posted below don't make happy reading, it's worth noting that both universities have very large access and bursary programs to try to counter this.

Please produce any petitions or customer surveys for me to read where people demanded food stuffs (liquid/solid) with higher salt content, high saturated fat content, higher sugar content. I would be very interested in reading them and then maybe I will come the same conclusions as you about human control.

Your logic 

&gt; Consume fewer calories than you use (the sum of your maintenance and lifestyle calories) and you WILL lose weight

is a master stroke. I never thought of that. You really did earn your PhD, didn't you. Have you published that insight? I'm sure you'd win a few awards for it if you did.

Your comment history is very telling as to what sort of a person you are

* I don't particularly hate obese people
* I say fuck them (Especially when it is entirely up to those people choosing to smoke too much, drink too much and eat too much, to the point where they are an unhealthy burden on everybody else)
* because some lazy fatty can't exercise any self-control or responsibility for their own health?
* but most are just pigs with no self control who don't give a shit (nothing like a good bit of generalisation - did you generalise in your PhD or did you provide facts (please don't answer as I want our conversation to terminate here)?)

The UK is the culture I know best, the country and culture I know most about.  I can't focus on other countries and cultures because I don't have the same depth of knowledge of those countries and cultures. 

It's interesting, that at no stage (tonight or on other occasions) has anyone actually asked what I like about the UK.  You see, as I said, humour contains and element of truth, and that leaves people uncomfortable.  So what they do is attack.  You're one of the few people that has not done that.

true,patnevin,null,null,"I'd be in for a centre-back, central midfielder and a winger.

Beyond Fonte and Yoshida, we don't have any stable deputies (I don't personally feel confident in Hooiveld as first reserve). If rumours are try and Davide Astori is available and willing to join, I don't see why we wouldn't go for that, though I'm not sure I'd put him as immediate first choice, despite most likely being a cut above (as we've finally settled into a reliable pairing in Fonte and Yoshida).

Today might tell against this slightly, but I feel we could do with another tenacious midfielder. Schneiderlin and Cork together as first choice are great, however I don't personally think Davis and Ward-Prowse are adequate back-up. Despite having performed well today, I see Davis more as back-up for Ramirez in the attacking central midfield role (and should be subbed on/rotated in appropriate matches accordingly), rather than playing as one of the two who look to intercept and break up play (Cork and Schneiderlin). Ward-Prowse is very promising, but I wouldn't want to rely upon him to play week in week out if either of the first two were to be injured. If we could find a relatively young player of the quality of Cork/Schneiderlin, I'd hope we'd snatch the opportunity to bolster our squad immediately. Not quite sure who'd be suitable though and I wouldn't say this is necessarily a priority at all, but something we shouldn't sniff at.

We need a winger. De Ridder is not good enough. Mayuka is not a winger. Guly shouldn't regularly be looked upon as a starter (despite two very good performances against Stoke and Arsenal). Beyond those players we only have Lallana and Puncheon (we shouldn't play Gaston/Rodriguez out there either, they're wasted there) and I reckon genuine competition for a starting spot would be great. Someone like Tom Ince or Wilfried Zaha would be perfect, but I suspect our sights would have to be set slightly lower than that.

true,Baconesque,null,null,"I only moved to Edinburgh a few months ago and as a pretty big football fan, think I can offer a relatively unbiased opinion.

First thing, football is pretty huge in Scotland. I can't dig up the source but will add the link if I find it, but if I recall, Scotland had one of the top three figures of any country in Europe, ahead of England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France in terms of percentage of population regularly attending matches.

Secondly, and kind of an unfortunate flip side, Scottish football (even the SPL) really isn't that good, at least technically. I'd put it the SPL teams on par with lower-Championship or League One teams, apart from Celtic who I guess would be in that Championship/Prem limbo in their current form (yeah, the Barcelona result was amazing but they still got beat by Hibs at the weekend). On the other hand, it's quite entertaining to see something different and the physical nature of the game here reminds me of English football a couple of decades ago.

From an Edinburgh perspective I can only speak for Hibs with limited experience. They seem to be the 'East' team, although technically Leith, and are pretty frugal compared to their neighbours in the West (Hearts) who are going through financial difficulties similar to Rangers at the moment.

Hibs have got a decent stadium with a capacity of around 22k I believe, although it doesn't hit that apart from 'Category B' games (Hearts/Celtic). The atmosphere is always good though - the North stand is the tamer 'family friendly' stand I believe, but I've been in the East Stand near Section 43 (the 'ultras') and there's been a fantastic atmosphere. I was initially a bit worried being an English guy there but I've been made very welcome both in the stands and in the local supporter pubs even though I'm not a real Hibs fan. I think they appreciate new supporters since they're not filling the ground out anyway.

In terms of tickets, you can get a season ticket which is about £400 or so I believe, a 'half' season ticket around Christmas which is around £210, and the individual games cost either £22 or £28. I know a fair few people who only attend the occasional match. As for popularity, it's really difficult to give an answer - amongst the students I know and a lot of my work colleagues, nobody really seems to care, but those who have their roots in the city going back a few generations do seem to take an interest I find.

As another poster said, if you did happen to move here you do have the option of Newcastle which is about two hours away on the train. St James Park is a fantastic ground and it's a convenient way of watching some Premiership football, plus they do tickets for £10 deals a couple of times a season. Similarly, you could possibly get some tickets for Champion's League matches at Celtic Park although I imagine they sell out pretty quickly so you'd probably have to pay over the odds.

&gt; Coca-Cola Vanilla is the limited relaunch of the formerly produced Vanilla Coke soft drink from the early 2000s to compete with Pepsi Vanilla. Vanilla Coke is a vanilla flavored version of Coca-Cola Classic.
&gt;
&gt; The Coca-Cola Company announced in early 2002 that Vanilla Coke would be introduced initially in the United States with distribution starting May 15, 2002, followed by a rollout in Canada. The introduction of vanilla flavor was hailed by The Coca-Cola Company as ""the greatest innovation since Diet Coke in 1983"".[1] It also marked the 116th anniversary of the Coca-Cola Company.[2]
&gt;
&gt;In November 2005, after slumping sales, The Coca-Cola Company announced that Vanilla Coke would be discontinued in North America and Great Britain by the end of the year.[3]
&gt;
&gt;In January 2006, Coca-Cola launched Black Cherry Vanilla Coke and Diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coke, a fusion of cola, black cherry, and vanilla flavors.
&gt;
&gt;In 2007, Coca-Cola Vanilla was re-introduced in the U.S. and Ukraine with new packaging and with several new variants.

true,LAXLuther,null,null,"&gt; I assure you everyone will agree that there are parts of the UK which could use some change, however, the same can easily be said for every other country! Every country has incredible positives and negatives! 

Absolutely.  No country is perfect.  And I love the way you put it i.e. *incredible positives and negatives*!  But since the UK is what I know best, I can only comment on those.  I would hate to make statements about Portugal or Greece for example, because I have never lived there for extended periods. 

&gt; I ask you then, what do you love, not just like about the UK?

Thanks for asking.  

I love the countryside.  It is beautiful and green.  I would not want to live in a place that is dry.  A few years ago I did some work in South Africa.  It was a remote part of SA and the landscape was dry and brown.  I hated it.  I missed the green fields and hills of the UK.  

Even though I don't love London (I'm not a city person), there is an incredible buzz which you don't find in many other cities.  You are spoiled for choice in London.  There is just so much to do.  

I love Scotland, particularly the Highlands and Edinburgh.  There is a sense of space in Scotland that I don't feel anywhere else in the UK.

I adore the older generations in the UK.  The older people know not to take things for granted.  

Where I live, there a long coastal paths, and I can't wait to get to the cliffs when I get back to the UK to go walking.  

I appreciate the fact that we are often innovative.  We like to try and do things differently.  It doesn't always work, but at least we are more adventurous and don't simply repeat the past.  

I have an unending love for our music scene.  

I think we live in a fascinating country that often tries to hold opposites together.  But it is hard and can be confusing.  The important thing is, we try to be accommodating.  It's not so extreme as in other countries.  

There is a great diversity of cultures in the UK, particularly London.  You don't always find that everywhere.  

Politically, it is a stable country and I'm grateful for that.  I'm not a patriotic person, but I am proud that we have stability.  

Those are my immediate thoughts.

Edit:  thought of something else - our sense of humour (though it is lacking on Reddit).  We have one of the best sitcom and sketch show histories in the world.    ",0,1357081447,null,0,1357081813,0,c7peepi,t3_15s9fh,t1_c7peepi,t1_c7pe2qh,null,1430827416,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

Just a few quick points, which you might find to be of interest:

* Crowd was pretty damn flat. I sit in the Kop and I think that we got into full swing on songs less than 10 times throughout the 90 minutes, to be honest (excluding the two MoTs at the start of each half). Bolton were actually out-singing us in the 2nd half, before we suddenly put pressure on them - for the first time all game - which led to us scoring the goal. After that, I don't think that I heard the Bolton fans again.

* Thank goodness for that penalty; Eddie Gray might have already summed it up, but let me tell you, we would **not** have scored in open play. Their Goalkeeper literally did not have a save to make. We only looked threatening immediately before and after the move which led to our goal; McCormack's chance was a great one, essentially unmarked at an angle near the right-hand post of the goal, but he almost had too much time to think about it. His eyes darted twice from the ball and the goal, then he blazed it over the bar. Rudy had a free kick deflected for a corner, but it didn't look threatening on the replay.

* Tate had a shocking performance. Kevin Davies won around 75% of all balls knocked up to him, which really helped Bolton's attack. The only defender who could win fights for the ball against Davies was Pearce, and since Pearce simply cannot play on the right side, it was easy for Davies to just latch onto Tate and win almost everything against him for 90 minutes. I honestly think that Lees would have done a better job - and would consider dropping Tate, if I were the manager.

* We're still completely inept at passing in midfield. Austin was awful in the first half: his first action of the game was to mess up a simple pass and gift Bolton a chance on the counter-attack. However, once the goal went in, I have to say that everyone in midfield looked more relaxed and composed on the ball. Austin looked almost shell shocked in the first half, but after the first goal he was suddenly hitting long-ranged passes and splaying the ball around with confidence. Hopefully he can keep it up!",0,1357083142,null,0,false,0,c7pev6d,t3_15ru68,t1_c7pev6d,t3_15ru68,null,1430827623,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5

Maybe: Agger, his injuries will prevent him moving but he may finish his career back in Denmark, or somewhere that he'll get regular football when he gets moved along for the new CBs

Doubtful: 
Suarez. He seems to love the club and fans and has wanted to be here for a long time. But I think he'll do a Ronaldiniho and go to Uruguay and play till him late 30's there.

I'm in the UK at the moment but in the past I've had good results with tunlr. Download a copy of DNSJumper and set up an entry for tunlr. Mine looks like this (from DNSJumper.ini)

    [Dns_Servers]

    1. tunlr=149.154.158.186,199.167.30.144

DNS Jumper is here

http://dns-jumper.en.softonic.com/

tunlr's website is here

http://tunlr.net/get-started/

&gt; The primary (preferred) DNS IP address is:
&gt;
&gt; 142.54.177.158
&gt;
&gt; The secondary (alternate) DNS IP address is:
&gt;
&gt; 198.147.22.212

So they currently recommend different IP addresses from the ones I'm using.

Once you've got it set up if you get country blocked just launch DNSJumper, select tunlr, and refresh the page in the browser. Once you're done you can switch back to the default DNS servers, quit DNSJumper",0,1357088506,null,0,1357130441,0,c7pgbsz,t3_15si1j,t1_c7pgbsz,t3_15si1j,null,1430828312,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

And the influx of worldwide players searching for more money means that English players simply don't come through as much now.

A friend called me up yesterday and asked if I was doing anything for new year's eve. Nope, I said, I'm gonna sit in my flat, alone, sulking.
He replied that he was gonna do the same but was up for sulking together if I fancied it.  I did. We ended having dinner in Camden then walking up towards Primrose Hill to watch the fireworks. An Aussie girl asked me for directions and I told her we where going that way and that she was welcome to join us. She did and we spoke of how we 'envied' each other's birthplace.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"Thanks for posting this. Good read, but I feel he wrote it because absolutely everyone is saying Frank should stay so it sells papers for being different to say he shouldn't.

Here are my problems:

&gt;he is unlikely to accept a big salary decrease

We haven't really been given the information to know what has been offered and what he would be willing to take. Frank is not a mercenary and anyone saying he is is just attempting to russle some jimmies.

&gt;The first is that clubs tend to think that a players past form is a good guide to future form, despite ability tending to decay after the age of 30

The difference is that Lampard is *still* hitting some great form in his mid 30s when he is supposed to be falling. Considering Chelsea is also playing him in a deeper position, the problems that come with old age (slower reactions and slower overall) are, while not entirely nullified, not as important.

&gt;Pundits also point to Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, who have been re-signed at Manchester United, as reasons to keep Lampard...Football history is littered with ageing players who have been kept on by clubs on high salaries, but have performed below expectation.

Anyone who watched the Everton game would have seen the standard Lampard set. Even his goal count didn't do him justice for the performance he put in and it was a performance any young footballer could look up to. I don't think we would have won that game with someone else playing in Lampard's position, the same as Fergie feels when he wins a game because of Scholes or Giggs.

&gt;the question is whether this scoring record can be sustained

Scoring at least 10 league goals in the last 9 seasons (bar this current one), scoring at least 5 goals in the last 16 seasons including this one, and scoring 6 goals **this season** in just 11 appearances. If you play him, the goals will come.

Both teams were terrible, the crowd was silent as a result, and our only decent spell of attacking football led to us getting the penalty. If anything we were lucky that Bolton were as poor as they were, otherwise we would never have come away with 3 points. Even after we scored they looked just as flat and lifeless as before, despite the fact we were openly inviting them to attack. The referee never let the game flow, stopping it at any opportunity he got, and neither team really seemed interested in attempting any flowing football. It was a hoof-fest.

Positives: Diouf played well, as did Pearce. McCormack looked sharp, Austin woke up in the second half (absolutely fantastic tackle on Spearing at one point) and Byram continues to impress.

Negatives: Green was very poor, as was Tate. Becchio worked hard but couldn't do anything in the air against Zat Knight. Peltier still doesn't look comfortable at LB. We need to stop playing him there.

I bought my brother an Arsenal jersey here, it's a really beautiful jersey. I was cautious about it, but it was worth it in the end. When I purchased it, I also got a discount for a Mexico black jersey from the 2010 world cup; I bought it and it was also a very good quality. 

Both of the City kits (last year's away and this year's third kit) that I've bought have been through the MCFC shop though. 

If you were looking for a physical shop, maybe try the mall. Although each time I've gone and asked for Manchester City--the store clerk brings me an United kit. I just look at them and walk away. But of course even here they run from $70 and up. Maybe you'll have better luck?

The best thing to do is wait for the end of the season, the MCFC shop had a good discount on the kits at the end of last season.

I'd highly recommend starting off with the Third Doctor (it's SO much easier to get into), and then nipping a 1st/2nd Doctor story in every now and then. It's much more manageable than going through several seasons worth of black and white and reconstructions. Regardless, at least watch An Unearthly Child for nostalgia reasons.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This sort of decision making would disproportionately effect the poor, as they are more likely to smoke or be obese. 

What if a person had merely lived with a smoker for years? Would they be seen as culpable for making the choice to live with that person? Or maybe they smoked for a number of years, gave up a decade ago, and only now is the cancer hitting them. Would that person be seen as living dangerously, or would anyone who smoked at any time be refused treatment?

Where would the line be drawn for obesity? BMI is the actual definition for obesity, but BMI is hardly a foolproof system. 

You say we would need to have evidence they indulged in an 'unhealthy diet' over an extended period, but the only evidence you would have is the weight of the person. Some, although a minor percentage, would perhaps have other medical issues that lead them to gain weight easily - perhaps a diet that would lead one person to be obese would not lead another person to become obese. 

What then happens to these people? Do they simply NOT get treatment? ""Sorry sir, your emergency treatment will not happen now as it appears you've eaten to many pies. We're going to leave you to die now.""

Or will it happen, but the person suddenly find they have a medical bill for tens of thousands - maybe hundreds of thousands - because someone has made the ambiguous decision that this person caused it themselves. At least with private medical insurance a person is aware of what their insurance covers and does not cover, but to withhold healthcare at any time without warning, based on a decision as to whether the person has 'lived right', seems pretty awful and open to miserable misuse and problems. 

Finally, what is the REASON we are refusing treatment (or payment of treatment) to these people? To save money? To what end?

I think the interview is probably the most critical part of the application process for overseas students, because realistically the admissions tutors have no idea what our Australian subject qualifications/grades mean. It sounds like you have a strong academic record though, so provided you submit a decent personal statement, I think you should stand a solid chance of getting an interview. Be aware though that having awesome grades doesn't necessarily mean you will gun the interview; the converse is true too of course. Extracurriculars don't really mean too much, unless they specifically demonstrate a particular interest in the subject you're applying for.

If I could recommend one thing, it might be worth actually flying to the UK to do your interview (and checking out the town too to see if it's a good fit of course!); expensive option I know, but in my experience (from anecdotal accounts) interviewing at one of the other overseas centres may just get you overlooked by equally strong candidates who interview locally (the local interviews are conducted by fellows from your chosen subject and college, whereas the overseas ones will be representatives who most likely will be from both different subjects and colleges).

Unfortunately I don't think transferring is much of an option, just because of the way the Tripos course structure works -- there's no ""credit"" to be transferred, and most of the course is pretty thoroughly planned out from first year.

Regarding scholarships, the trusts (Commonwealth and Overseas) offer limited funding, but these are means-tested (based on financial status/income). The fees *are* expensive, but if you think you're going to have trouble affording them, chances are you'll get some support from the trusts.

As a business owner I understand the benefits provided to me by taxation - as in, roads, communications, educated staff, legal processes and protections. These cunts seem to think that none of this applies to them.

What they should really do is stop maintaining government services outside every tax dodgers place of business, let the roads outside Starbucks crumble, pile up rubbish outside the doors and explain they can't afford to move it due to tax dodgers.

I ONLY have a strong academic record - my extracurriculars are really not worth mentioning. I know that in the US, extracurriculars and recommendation letters mean just as much as your GPA, if not more; I really hope that what you say about extracurriculars is correct. :/ I'm not a ""well rounded"" person ahah... I looked at the application process (UCAS and the other form international kids have to fill in) and it looked fairly standard, but not in a ""fill these out properly and you might have a shot at getting an interview"" way; they looked a little 'bare', if that's the right word to describe it. Am I right in assuming, then, that it really is ALL about your academic records (ie grades + ATAR) and your person statement, as far as snagging an interview goes? 

I was thinking of going to Singapore to do my interview, assuming that I am offered one, because of prices. You make me doubt that decision D: but that is an amazing point I hadn't thought of before. Do you think that choosing to do your interview in the UK really helped your acceptance? :/ It IS very costly... 

No transferring? D:&lt; So it's either getting in from first year, or waiting  until you're applying for a Master's or a PhD? :/ That's a huge letdown... 

if I don't get in Oxbridge, I'll most likely head to ANU and do a PhB there, at half the cost. The benefits of ANU are that I get youth allowance, and HECS loans, and the entire undergrad experience will cost about half as much as going to Cambridge (which will add up to around 150k AUD by the end of the three year degree) :/ but Cambridge has an amazing physics department... 

I've researched the Cambridge Overseas trust, but there were only a couple of undergraduate scholarships (none that covered full fees) and I'm definitely not confident about receiving one, since the only strong point that I have is my academic prowess. I receive youth allowance right now, and if it was decided solely on financial status and income, I'm pretty sure I'll be eligible (mum is unemployed and is going to school, we have no income, on government benefits, etc) but I have no idea how I'll be able to afford anything if I don't get a scholarship or any sort of funding.

true,blorg,null,null,"You live in Vietnam? I've only been there twice for a bit under two months but I never had a note refused, and I had some pretty worn ones ([like this] (http://www.flickr.com/photos/coinbooks/6535204481/)); worn enough that it would be difficult to see how you could wear it any more.

I've read that advice about currency but it is outdated. I've been in SE Asia for fifteen months now (currently in Cambodia) and I have **never** had a note refused outside of Myanmar, and even there they would accept more than what you might think based on what you read in guidebooks or the internet. I actually made it a game to try to spend all my shittiest dollars from Cambodia, crumpled, torn, written on, overprinted (currency traders in Cambodia stamp any dollars that go through them) and had no problem passing them on the second or at worst third attempt.

I only really used dong in Vietnam; very very few places priced in dollars (only a few tourist oriented places in Hanoi, in my experience, and they all accepted payment in dong anyway.) It is completely unnecessary to carry dollars in Vietnam. Cambodia is the opposite, the entire economy runs on dollars and riel is only used for very small purchases. But it is no issue as the ATMs give out dollars and no one cares about the condition of the notes. Myanmar was principally kyat but dollars were required for a few things (trains, entrance fees and about half the guesthouses.) Thailand, Laos, the Philippines and China all use their own currencies.

Point is, with the exception of Cambodia, it is a foreign currency.

Some of the places in the centre will take pretty much anything ""hard"" currencywise, so long as they know the going rate, but the dollar has a special status - followed by the Euro, Yen, Singapore Dollar, Sterling, Aussie Dollar, Canadian Dollar etc. - although with all of these others you're going to get a fairly shitty rate anywhere but an overpriced tourist place, if they'll take it at all.

As for the fees, if they give you an offer and you make it, there will be a way, I promise. Outside of the big American unis Cambridge really does has some great bursaries, but again I've only really known about the ones given to UK people.

out! Look, Cambridge doesn't want someone who does a billion different extra curriculars but is distinctly lukewarm about their subject, they want someone who is genuinely talented and *enthustiastic* about their subject. I'm a mathmo and getting into Cambridge was my obsession in 6th form, like *complete* obsession. Go out, get on the right side of your physics teachers (who after all are only trying to empart delicious physicsy knowledge on you) read and learn physics, go to the local telescope or whatever and *just get really excited about learning physics.* Nine months is a long time! I'm not saying this guarentees you an offer or anything - who am I to say that? - but that is fundamentally what they're after.

There's 2 ways to do it. An easy non invasive method if you don't eat and a shitty method for if you do eat. This is because if you've eaten then acid makes its way up into the mouth or something and generally causes bad shit to happen.

Are you aware that the vast majority of cultures (and their associated moral codes) did and do precisely this? 

Humans evolved to be hunter-gatherers in societies that emphasized solidarity within the group and hostility to outsiders. 

Indeed in many pre-literate societies the term they call themselves by means ""the people"" or ""the real people"". The default morality of the human species, *the one that's written in the DNA of every one of your trillion cells*, says that outgroup members are to be considered less human than ingroup members.

Incidentally, the reason the Nazis were successful (for a time) was that their programme of National Socialism resonated very well with instincts we all have within us.

&gt; worthy of being considered moral?

I'd rather not use the word ""moral"", it has baggage that tends to obscure the issue.

What I will say is that some societies are demonstrably more successful than others. If you look at the UN's human development index or just about any other criteria for how ""good"" a society is, the same countries appear again and again at tjhe top: the Scandinavian ones. So it seems reasonable to suggest that they are the best societies that've ever existed in our 5000 years of recorded history. (At least if you don't include preliterate ones: people in those societies may be happy, but people used to modern technology wouldn't want to go without it.) So there are objective grounds by which one can say that some societies are better than others.

I'll also say that Islam, at least in the ways that it is interpreted by many of its modern followers, is deeply problematic in the effects it has on their societies and the rest of the world.

I'll leave by answering your question with a question:

&gt; is any moral code that considers one group of people (women, in this case) as less human than another (men) worthy of being considered moral?

I consider Boko Haram (a terrorist group whose name means, approximately, ""education is evil"") to be subhuman vermin. Am I worthy of being considered moral, in your opinion?

My stance is that some societies demonstrably have better outcomes than others, and that is partly caused by the beliefs and values of the people and their rulers. So if some beliefs and values have better outcomes, they can reasonably be called better, or more moral.

Of existing societies, Scandinavian ones seem to have the best outcomes on many measures. So it would make sense for other societies to emulate them.

&gt; *I understand that you were the victim of an internet ‘death hoax’ in 2009. What happened? How did you manage to cope with such a difficult situation?*
 
&gt; To tell you the truth, I really haven’t coped with it all that well. When it happened I wasn’t internet savvy; I didn’t even have a Facebook page. And, of course, these things happened without my knowledge.
 
&gt; The first I knew about it was when people started phoning up, being very apologetic to my wife. One day she had something like 15 calls.
 
&gt; Somebody eventually sent through a link. We looked at it and sat there horrified. I was touring at the time, and theatres began to cancel my gigs because they thought I’d been killed in a car crash. I tried to rush round and say: “Look, I’m not dead,” but the damage had been done. It was horrible.
 
&gt; We tried to get the announcement out there, but it was too late by that point. We put up a Facebook page and started a Twitter account, but people were still perpetuating this myth.
 
&gt; Then things got very dark. We began to find ourselves embroiled in masquerade Twitter accounts, where people were pretending to be me. Children’s special needs groups were getting very offended at the stuff I was supposed to have said online, and it wasn’t me!
 
&gt; From the moment it happened to now, we’re still smoothing it out. It’s ongoing. What may have started as a prank became more sinister as time went on.
 
&gt; It’s been awful. I call it a blip because, thankfully, people did see through it. People still offered me the work, but there was a time when the large companies wouldn’t come near me, especially with the other horrible rumours that came out.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; First point, don't wait for 2 fucking hours for the train, just turn up on time. Top tip.

Are you deliberately being obtuse? I am not late for trains (and I have been known to arrive at the station an hour early) - the trains just don't run that frequently. It is a single track line where the train is more like a shuttle. 

I just checked and it's actually even worse than 2 hours. There is a train at 13:30, then the next one is at 17:45, then 22:00. That is unbelievably fucking shit and you're trying to suggest that I should use that instead of the car? Don't forget the logistics of getting to the station - I could either walk along the high speed, busy road with no pavement, or cycle and have nowhere to put the bike.

It would be impossible to even hope to get to my destination before 9am, because the first train of the day in the mainline direction is at 10:30am. Or, I can get in the car, drive to the mainline station and use the twice-hourly services to my destination.

Oh, and they stop the service entirely during summer, to ensure the line is clear for intercity services from London for all those lovely tourists that don't stop on the intermediate stations on the branchline.

So I'd have to get the very expensive bus and ensure I get up in time for it as it runs every hour - and it doesn't run in sync with the train timetable despite it being the terminus for the bus service.

&gt; As for the rest, my point still stands, you're talking about convenience, not necessity. I lived in a rural area and had a car because it was convenient, not because it was necessary.

Good for you, but I am referring to the rural area in which I live. Maybe it was practical to walk, cycle or take the bus or train for you, but for me it is not at all practical.

You don't seem to be able to comprehend that a train service that runs every few hours and not during the morning peak (not 2 as I said) and a bus service that costs the best part of 10 pounds per journey is total crap, and that it is not a matter of convenience, it's outright practicality.

It really sounds like you're one of those cycling mafia lot. I repeat: I do not dislike public transport when it is practical to use it, but for me it isn't practical to use it for all of my journeys.

&gt;I agree that outside of major towns public transport is shit in the UK. That's what privatisation does for you.

Privatisation is not the whole story. The branch line wasn't exactly booming with trains every 10 minutes at 125mph quad-track during the British Rail days, it was crap then and it's crap now.

I don't think bus fares would have been any different - one of the key reasons is the cost of fuel, and that would have gone up regardless of if the bus companies were privatised. The bus company serving my village is a local firm, not First or Stagecoach. I believe the steep fares are due to a **lack of public subsidy**.

&gt; How far are you from work/shops/friends/etc by the way? Have you ever considered moving?

40 miles from work (most of which I use train for), 5 miles from the supermarket (although there's a village shop that I walk to), 5-40 miles for other shopping, variable for friends. I don't want to move, I like living here and I don't mind paying for a car to get around - but it's the whole ""public transport is great and everyone should use it"" that gets me up when it just isn't for everyone.

That is all. Fixed prices. Just what you see.

Also, wages in Australia are way higher than they are in the UK (mainly due to the exchange rate).

The train from Katoomba in the Blue Mountains to Central Station in Sydney is a 109km journey, and it takes about 2hrs on the train. It would be the longest commute by train that anyone would do in Sydney.

The price for a *return* ticket is $16.40. Which is roughly £11. Peak. For any train travelling from the moment you purchase that ticket to the expiry date on the ticket.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Definitely see CAB. There's also a CAB book - this is from the 2008 edition, which may be out of date by now.

The landlord has various repair responsibilities by law, irrespective of the tenancy agreement. These include basins, sinks, baths and toilets. There's no mention of showers in the book.

Although tenants have these rights by law, there are certain punitive measures landlords can take such as attempting to regain possession of the property or not renewing the tenancy when it expires, so the book advises speaking to an advisor before attempting to use this general right.

The landlord is also responsible for ensuring that any electrical appliances supplied with the accommodation are safe. This includes heaters, cookers and even kettles. There's no mention of showers, but no reason to believe they're excluded. However, an appliance can be safe even though it doesn't work.

**HOWEVER** - In a point about landlords not dealing with damp, the book emphasizes that you should carry on paying your rent or else you're basically giving the landlord an excuse to evict you. I assume that applies for any kind of repair.

You may think that most landlords will just do the repair to settle the issue because evicting you, then still having to do the repair so someone else will take the property, will cost more. In my experience, this isn't how landlords tend to think. For example damp can be hidden quite cheaply, and will stay hidden long enough to get new tenants in, but a trouble-making tenant means either doing a proper job (more expensive than one patch-up, but cheaper than repeating it several times a year) or finding an excuse to evict. There's quick cheap short-term fixes for a lot of things that at least some landlords will always prefer.

My point is that buying close to the date, or most of the fares, are extortionate and not worth the hassle.

Here's an example. Say I want to take a train right now from Leicester to London. What will it cost me?

I Googled for ""uk train"" and picked one of the top sites ""raileasy"". It quoted me £55 for a one-way ticket to London leaving at about 3pm. Now I own a car that takes £80 to fill the tank with diesel, and I can do 600miles on that tank. It's 100 miles from Leicester to London, so that's £13 in fuel. So already, I feel like I'm being ripped off. 

Say I still want someone to drive for me, so I check the price of a taxi: http://www.clubtaxi.co.uk/longdistance.html

It's £100 for a taxi from Leicester to London, and that taxi takes 4 people.  I actually have a wife and two daughters, so taking the taxi to London is cheaper than taking the train AND it's door-to-door at a time of my choosing. Yes, it will take an extra hour travel time.

Australia (overall average, excluding mining boom states): AUD$70,000, source: http://www.livingin-australia.com/salaries-australia/

true,Elliottism,null,null,"I also did a BTEC Television Production course. I went to college to do A levels and such, but dropped out as I really didn't have any motivation to study maths and Psychology. 

I am now about to finish my final year at Bournemouth University's Television Production course and I have to say, looking at some friends who went freelance straight out of college, it's a much harder route to take. I think university is the way to go. 

However, I wouldn't just go to any university course, make sure they have employment links. Such as Bournemouth has an excellent worldwide name, Westminster has some very good equipment and staff, Salford is literally spitting distance from the Beeb @ Media City.
Media courses are almost at every university, so make sure you get good quality from what you get. (especially now you're paying 9k p/year)

At the end of the day, you want to be employable. Companies don't give a toss if you've got a first at university if you're given a camera and shrug your shoulders and say I've never done this one before. BUT, it's that added edge, what did you DO while you were there, what did you make. I have to say I came out of BTEC with a Triple Distinction, but looking back at what I used to make, I shudder to think if I hadn't had taken this route. Uni teaches you how the real world works and sharpens you up in every single way. 

For instance, Bournemouth University (I promise I wont make an advert for them, but it's a very good course!) got me paid work at the Olympics this year, I went in as a camera assistant, but came out operating the Old Trafford, Stretford End Camera of a Brazil vs Belarus football match. 

Also, uni gives you the opportunities to do work on the side, make your own films, and you get to use their kit, no need for hefty credit card payments for cameras you might find arn't up to scratch. (tip: Canon 550D w/ Magic Lantern Firmware - google it) 

Overall, Although it depends on what you want to do, I would absolutely push for anyone to go to a University Course, as long as that is focused on getting you employed at the end of it.

true,UncleDuster,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Hi. I think you may have misunderstood my point.
&gt;would you be happy with 23% of those executed being innocent?

CPS make the decision to charge if there is a ""realistic prospect of conviction"". This is obviously a different threshold from a court where ""beyond reasonable doubt"" is used. 

In the Operation Ore figures I quoted, CPS decided that there was enough evidence against 1800 suspects to justify pressing charges against them. Of these 1800, 1400 were subsequently found guilty in a court. 

The obvious question perhaps is why didn't CPS only press charges against those 1400?

The answer is that CPS are not psychic. They do not know what defence the defendant may rely on in court. They do not know which witnesses will prove compelling under cross examination. The cannot (unfortunately) predict the fickle nature of a jury. For these and a mass of other similar reasons no prosecutor will ever have a 100% success record.

To directly answer your question, no I would not be happy with 23% of those being executed being innocent. But that is why we have a court system as well as a state prosecutor. You may argue that CPS should apply the same standards as a court. If that was the case then there would be no point in having a CPS and everyone arrested would be sent straight to court. I don't think I need to spell out the massive expense of that not to mention the trauma and stress for a huge number of innocent people.

&gt; McAlpine would be lynched if it were down to people like yourself.

While it's not necessarily true for the entirety of the UK, for Cambridge what matters is that you enjoy and are passionate about what you want to do (personally I think this is a given if you really do want to do it at University) and that you are good at it.

That's why **relevant** activities can be good. Not because you've just done random achievements to list on your application but because you've done them out of sheer desire to explore the subject you like further. The admissions officers are very good at distinguishing between people who did it because they wanted to and did it because they wanted to improve their chances and if the only reason you're thinking of doing something is for the latter, it wont really make a difference (although it may make a difference after University when you're applying for various jobs as there is emphasis on experience rather than passion).

&gt;how BIG a chance do I have?

It's really hard to quantify it like that unless perhaps you did some statistical analysis on previous applicants. Every applicant is treated on an individual basis, there's no set formula. If you meet the required academic grades then it essentially comes down to a subjective opinion about whether you're right or not, but don't worry, they are very good at it.

&gt;I want to do physics. What should I do, then, to increase my chances?

Keep doing what you're probably already doing, watching/reading scientific and mathematical documentaries/books. Ever heard people talk about things in Physics which you're interested in but don't fully understand? Go check out the wikipedia page and try to understand it, even if it's just a scratch on the surface. 

If you're not sure what special relativity is about yet, go check it out, if you do, do you know what the difference between special and general relativity is? How about what quantum mechanics is about? If not, go check it out! If you do and you understand it, then you're doing very well indeed.

true,Shaolin76,english,Wirral,"Firstly let me preface this statement by saying I know nothing about UK Parking Law other that what I have just read for my own information here:

[Fight Private Parking Tickets](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/private-parking-tickets)


I have condensed the pertinent information which i mined from the above article:


This ticket seems to be issued from a private company **Vehicle Control Services Ltd** who are an approved operator of the [British Parking Association](http://www.britishparking.co.uk/AOS-Members). This doesn't necessarily mean you MUST pay them. You can dispute the ticket but that would mean you would lose any discount for paying the ticket early.

You should appeal in writing to the parking company themselves first and state that you fully intend on taking the appeal to **Parking on Private Land Appeals** [(Popla)](http://www.popla.org.uk/). You would have the option of disputing the ticket to Popla if the parking company denies your appeal. Here is a [Template Letter](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/redir/7464171c) you can use to appeal against the ticket. The plus side of an appeal against a member of the BPA is that the member (Vehicle Control Services Ltd) must pay popla £32.40 for the appeal to be heard so you are effectively fining them and letting them know you know the procedure.

In order for your appeal to popla to be successful you will need to give one of the following as your reasons for the ticket being unfairly issued:

* **The vehicle was not improperly parked**. If you weren't parked where the operator said you were, you hadn't overstayed, you clearly displayed your ticket or there weren't proper signs in place.

* **The parking charge exceeds the relevant amount**. If you've been asked to pay the wrong amount, or have already paid the charge.

* **The vehicle was stolen**. What it says on the tin - this covers if your car was ticketed while stolen (not if you'd lent it to someone).

* **I am not liable for the parking charge**. This covers if you'd sold the vehicle or bought it after the alleged parking gaffe.

I'm guessing you would need to argue against the first point. They are implying that you parked without a valid ticket or permit. From what I've read, you'd have to successfully argue that you did have a ticket/permit.

Even if the popla appeal was denied you still have no obligation to pay immediately. The parking company would have to get a court to force you to pay the fine but then you really are talking about a hefty fine.

**tl;dr You can appeal but you might as well pay the fine unless you did actually have a ticket/permit to park and the warden didn't see it for some reason**

===========

**EDIT:** Upon further reading I would probably ignore the ticket and wait to see if they actually issue  court proceedings. It is very possible that they won't go to the trouble and expense of pursuing you in the civil court system. If they DO issue you with a court summons (not a notification of intent, but an actual summons) then pay them or start the appeal process.",0,1357143143,null,0,1357144722,0,c7pr32d,t3_15tv64,t1_c7pr32d,t3_15tv64,null,1430833538,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

But in essence, what you just described is how every young person has probably felt since the industrial revolution started.

The demand for university degrees is sadly more due to the shockingly poor quality of students leaving secondary education and being essentially unemployable.

Yes, they can use MS Word, Twitter and Facebook - but try getting them to write a properly structured block of writing without using shorthand and txt-speak, and you are going to struggle.

There is indeed a perception that companies are behind the times - but that is often because students come into work expecting it to be like school or home in terms of IT access - and no company is going to give a 16-year old school leaver unfettered access to do what they want with the computers - and certainly not during the working day.

Oh, and tough luck if all you ever used were Apple computers and complain that the office runs on Microsoft. What did you expect?

What is needed then is that students need to have a more realistic expectation of life - and that returns us to my original question - are the young too cosseted to realise what being an adult involves?

If so - then that is a failure of education (both schools and parents) and an expectation that it is possible to get rich quick with minimal hard work in a more celebrity driven culture.

Then again is it not the educational establishments job to prepare the young for adult life? The kids may be cosseted but then it should be up to their parents/teachers and the responsible people in society to help shape their world view and morals in the correct manner.

It isn't really that they can use word, twitter, fb but they seem a lot quicker at adapting to change (which is very important in todays economy) than some of the older workers who are sat comfortably doing the same stuff in the same way they where doing 10 years ago. They may have smartphone but all that they use is the call or text functions(I am generalising a bit here). I do think there is a fear among older generations regarding tinkering with any sort of new equipment that kids generally dont have.

I just think that we should be adapting to the young as opposed to trying to make them conform as they are in fact the future and at some point we will all have to depend on them so lets try and not fuck them up in the process...

No, just don't smoke weed where you're going to get caught.

&gt; Would you say the same to a homosexual in the 1950's ?

If you were caught having sex with a man then yes, you're going to be punished and there's not much you can do about it. You accepted the risks when you broke the law. It was immoral, and as a result the law was changed when society matured (as will eventually happen with drugs, IMHO).

Having said that, homosexuality never hurt anyone. There are actual tangible reasons why drugs are bad for society, which is why they're illegal, you can't really compare the two laws.

However, the only point I'm trying to make is that the Police aren't the one making the laws. A lot of Police don't agree with all of the laws they enforce, they're normal people with opinions just like you. I completely believe that drugs should be legalised (free to use, but not free to sell outside of licensed shops) as it will remove the criminal element of the problem.

The personal statement and references shouldn't be taken lightly though. It's a good idea to write a draft, have someone (teacher or friend) read over it and critique it, and continually improve it between now and when you have to submit. If it hasn't been made clear already, the *passion for your subject* is really important and needs to come out in your personal statement.

Regarding overseas interviews, I don't want you to get the wrong impression: the admissions process really does try its best to catch the best students and not let them slip through, so you may well be fine just interviewing in Singapore. I didn't go to Cambridge either for my interview actually but still got in.

The reason why I suggested flying over though is that of the Australian undergrads who I do know, the ones who interviewed locally got straight offers from their colleges, whereas the ones who interviewed overseas were pooled. Like I said, your interviewers in Cambridge will almost certainly be from your subject, which isn't necessarily the case if you interview overseas (my interviewers were from different subjects to mine).

Regarding grade estimates, I can't remember exactly but I think I just gave them my individual subject grade predictions. There's no A-Level equivalent of the ATAR, so I don't remember there being anywhere for me to give that on the UCAS application.

The place looks more like a gallery than a university, which is obviously nice if you are studying art. It also had a rather 'bohemian' or relaxed or hippy feel compared to other universities I went to, and it was probably leaning towards 60/40 female male ratio among students. The different atmosphere is probably because most people are studying art/design and 'arts' subjects (like English or philosophy), which sort of effects what sort of person studies there (eg. Loughborough is sporty and LSE 'businessy'.)

No - the kind of person that is happy to work in a warehouse doesn't change if you offer a bit more money. Throwing a lot more money gets better staff, but they are dissatisfied with the work and do not stick around. Either way it's not economical - I will pay more for increased productivity but not base salary. Getting decent staff is my problem, and I'm not really asking for help with that - we'll cope one way or another! 

What I am saying is that you/people are probably unaware what proportion of people at the bottom of the workforce that have little to offer (in terms of qualifications / experience / expertise) but are also unable to offer even the bare minimum of working productivity - turning up reliably and working for 5 days a week. The fact that we have to sift through so many of them is the red flag - on average you cannot trust these guys to actually turn up for work.

I can see your second formation transforming into a 3-4-3 (next time once we're more confident on the ball) if we're looking to chase the game and grab a few goals (like how the Spain national team/Barca sometimes do), maybe with Gerrard dropping back into Henderson/Allen's position and bringing in Borini smack in the centre of Suarez and Sturridge.

Of course, I think there's going to be a lot of overlapping and switching of positions. Suarez likes to drift left and right to pick up the ball near the corner flags, that'll allow Sturridge/Borini to get himself in the centre. Gerrard will surge into the penalty box at times allowing Lucas/Henderson/Allen to drift casually into his position for a shot if the ball comes out.

Not true.

The stoical Gen Stanley McChrystal put a stop to all that, but one can still get hold of muffins, crisps, and fizzy drinks.

I mean there are people like your brookers and your Mitchells's, who are 'channel 4 comedians', but seem like decent intelligent guys who kind of pop up on panel shows from time to time, but aren't exactly loud honking arseholes, and are pretty good at the other stuff they do.

Then you get your Cordens and Whitehalls, who, when on the panel shows, basically just behave like colossal pricks and compete to see who can shout the naughtiest thing the loudest because look at how impressive they are when they do that.  Corden I loathe especially because his only real talent is that he just FEROCIOUSLY craves the attention of other people.  That's literally all there is to the man.

Connolly probably, more than anything, hates what they represent, I suspect.  Which is the commodification of comedians.

If I want to travel on a certain route, I can hardly shop around between different rail companies and choose the best ticket can I? There is effectively no competition and thus why successive governments have thought that a privately run train network running on publicly maintained infrastructure was a good deal for either the commuter or the taxpayer is completely beyond me.

There is an argument that when the contracts are up for renewal, multiple companies can compete for them and the government can choose the best option. This would require a touching but misguided faith in the honesty and competency of the companies involved when forecasting their figures and an equally touching and misguided faith in the honesty and competency of ministers in making the right decision.

So we've ended up with a train network so heavily subsidised the state could run it for the same amount, and commuters are seeing fare increases far above inflation every single year while it's the private companies that are making profits from this fucking omnishambles, pocketing huge amounts of both government subsidy and commuter fares. The lack of competition means they can and do form massive cartels, fixing prices and fucking commuters.

If Labour would step up and commit to re-nationalising the railways, buying back the contracts one by one as they expire, I think they'd get a hell of a lot more support than they think. Having an affordable railway network is one of the most important factors when we think about how to get cars off the road and reduce carbon emissions, but successive governments have shown they really don't give a fuck.

If you understand the theory, then maybe you just need to actually practice the calculations, or figure out why you make mistakes - e.g. do you rush them? Both a natural grasp of the subject and the ability to get good grades in it are necessary to succeed. Maths is also really important for university-level Physics.

You should try to improve your grades as much as possible. Talk to your teacher(s) about what you can do and hopefully get them to see how much you enjoy the subject. Ask questions. If you can improve your grades in Physics within the year then that should show potential. You should talk about what made you suddenly decide to do Physics in the personal statement.

&gt; In my personal statement, were I to reach out and connect with researchers or do other things that outline my passion for physics, would that benefit me more than anything else (except getting better at physics, which is a given)? 

I'd say the teacher statement is probably more likely to benefit you than talking to researchers, tbh, assuming you're starting from an *okay* personal statement. It's by no means essential. I'd focus more on reading around the subject and being able to talk about it, explain concepts and why they are interesting to others.

true,cabalamat,null,null,"&gt; The Scandinavian countries are only doing well by standards such as levels of education and wealth, which are by no means universal standards of morality.

UN HDI covers education, wealth and life expectancy. While these things aren't universally valued, the vast vast vast majority of people, in all cultures, would rather be educated, rich and alive than ignorant, poor and dead. 

But there's more... if you go by other criteria, such as prevalence of murder, or amount of corruption, nearly everyone agrees that murder and corruption are bad things, and guess which societies come top there too.

&gt; I would expect them to do fairly poorly in stats that show the prevalence of pre-marital sex, for example, which has been a virtuous quality for large amounts of human history.

Most people enjoy sex, whether pre marital or otherwise. so you'll get at least as many people for it as against it. So it's not a universal standard. But essentially everyone agrees that (e.g.) being murdered is bad, and if you choose criteria that everyone agrees on and rank countries by them, some countries will come out on top. I think it's fair to call those countries better by universally-agreed-on standards.

My personal sense of morality is based on empathy. However, there are limits to human empathy; it is easier to empathise with one person suffering than with a thousand suffering, for example. So the person who wants to be moral cannot just rely on empathy, but must use *reason* to see that a thousand suffering is worse than one suffering.

The morality of an action depends on the harm that is caused. To us today, the suffering caused by child rape is clear. Would the suffering be the same for someone in the 7th century? Physically, yes. Emotionally? How would their feelings about the incident change if the action was completely accepted by society?

The one thing that is really frustrating to me is that Rodgers refuses to play him in his preferred position in the PL and only chose to play him as an AM. It's baffling, and really impressive, that Gerrard has played every minute in the PL so far, but I feel like Sahin would be his ideal replacement right now, especially since Lucas is back which would allow him to focus more on dictating the game.

true,cabalamat,null,null,"&gt; My personal sense of morality is based on empathy. However, there are limits to human empathy; it is easier to empathise with one person suffering than with a thousand suffering, for example. So the person who wants to be moral cannot just rely on empathy, but must use reason to see that a thousand suffering is worse than one suffering.

Indeed. A death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic.

&gt; The morality of an action depends on the harm that is caused. To us today, the suffering caused by child rape is clear. Would the suffering be the same for someone in the 7th century? Physically, yes. Emotionally? How would their feelings about the incident change if the action was completely accepted by society? Wouldn't someone still feel a sense of violation, since as a child they couldn't comprehend what was being done to them?

It's hard to know what people in a different society would have felt.

Because of TV, books, the internet, etc, most people are aware that other societies exist and have existed with radically different moralities. But in the 7th century, the world wasn't like that. Most people were illiterate, many never went more than ten miles from where they were born in their entire lives, most only know of one society, and for these people, unless they were extraordinarily insightful, the idea that there would be different moralities was literally unthinkable.

Went along and to be fair, they were nice enough about it.
However, I heard nothing.

About a month later however, friday afternoon, they sent a brown envelope with my P45 in it.  Nothing else.

Was only examining it and finding the part that said my benefits payments ended mid september that I'd even know.

Unfortunately, this pushed me deeper into depression and it was a couple of weeks before I could face going out, and seeing my new doctor for the first time.  Who pretty much asked me what I expected him to do about it and refused to give a sick note as he didn't consider me unwell.

He also didn't believe that I'd been left alone for around 5 years on IB without checks, but that was true apart from one visit, to a doctor who listened to me and wrote me off in full, a couple of years ago.

So got in touch, was told without his support I could appeal, but I'd be paid nothing to live on until it was over, so it was the only option to sign on to JSA.

Now I agree I shouldn't have just been left to claim IB for 5 years without any checks, however, I couldn't deal with anything, and don't believe it's my fault.

I genuinely thought I had a good chance at ESA, as I believe I'm capable of some work, with some limits, however, it seems the majority are being shoved straight to JSA, where it seems little care is taken of the client, just a push to get them off the books, sadly.

Maybe Inter would consider subsidizing Sneijder's salary because he's in poor form and causing trouble in the locker room (so why would we want him?), but I don't think there is any way Barca will subsidize Villa. Neither is going to take a 50-100k/week pay cut to play for Spurs. Hugo is still young and makes a reasonable salary. VDV was on less than 100k/week (70-80?). 

You can't deny that Spurs are a bit of a running joke in the transfer market because of the number of players the club is always linked with.  It was mostly because of 'Arry's talks with the media, but he's long gone and we're still linked with just about every top player that is unsettled and up-and-coming youngsters that will cost a fortune.

So it's still to be determined how well he fits or how many goals he'll score for us.  Until he's played a fair few matches, we owe it to him and our backroom staff to trust that he's the right player.

And Chelsea just replaced him with Ba, confirmation just came through.  Whether or not Ba is better than Sturridge or vice versa is another debate for another time; so that's something the redditors on /r/chelsea can discuss.  But we've been after Sturridge for 6 months now.  He hasn't featured at all under Rafa and so there were no drawn out negotiations to worry about.

If you don't work in the the Philippines even if you have 10kids to support, guess what you get? thats right, zero.
Which is why kids here grow up knowing they have to work and people who were unlucky and did not get an education know that life's gonna be tough but most try to make sure their kids don't face what they went through.

A tricycle or jeepney driver will be working 12hours a day often 7 days a week to make ends meet just so he can feed the family and send his kids to school.
Yesterday I was chatting with a Tricycle driver he earns around £12 a day for 12hour days, I went to his very basic house, met his 2 daughters, 1 has just finished a chemistry degree the other has just finished school and going to university.
I wish I could take some of the ""I'm owed everything in life"" brits out here to see what it's like.

It's just that I think y'all's mentality is ridiculous and I'd like y'all to understand this other way of perceiving things.

You'll probably never really understand the extent to which Britishness affects the American condition. The fact is we were birthed from you and that's how we look at you. We'll always have 'American' as our first name, but we'll also always have 'Britain' as our surname, if you will. Even though we're a nation of immigrants from all sorts of different places, we still focus on the UK (in our media, etc.) more than any other foreign country. For example, I just got back from the store. When I was riding in my car, the BBC World Service was playing on my radio. Not any other country's media; just Britain's. It's a part of our everyday life, though it largely goes unnoticed and taken for granted. So we *do* know a lot about Britain. The fact is, you're a little island. Imagine if Hawaiians got on boats and colonized and established the nation of China. They would look back upon Hawaii as their original homeland, always, much like diaspora Jews looked at Israel. So, no, Britain isn't just yours. It's all of ours.

You were taught wrong. Most British people (nationality and ethnicity) are of Briton origin. It's not weird or backward to acknowledge a nationality or ethnicity. Y'all have this strange mental hang-up/paranoia left over from WWII that the rest of the world doesn't have. There's no risk of Britishness-oriented fascism springing up in America, because we're such a melting pot and we simply don't care that much. But there it seem like y'all are constantly afraid.

http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=46104&amp;season_id=141

140 total appearances, 68 of them (48.5%) from the bench.  32 of 63 matches (or 50.8%) for Chelsea were from the bench.  He's scored 38 professional goals.  Considering about half of his appearances were as a sub, that's not a bad ratio (27.1%).  Add to that, he's spent the majority of his career playing out wide, in his unfavoured position, the numbers become even more impressive.  Where he plays for us remains to be seen but I'm sure he'll spend some time in either position, possibly swapping with Suarez throughout the match.  But Chelsea feel as though he's worth £12m.
