true,Saiing,cnty-england,UK -&gt; Japan,"&gt;So explain to me why DRM is a reality

Because it's used in practically every new release of every type of media from every media company with very very few exceptions.  I'd call that reality.  It's pretty hard for anyone who claims otherwise to be in any other state than absolute denial.

&gt;and if it's effective at at meeting that need with examples of how that works and why

As I said (if you'd read my comment properly), that was neither the purpose of my comment, nor a position that I'm trying to defend.  You're asking me to take a view that I've already clearly stated that I'm not attempting to push.

&gt; Once you've done that I'll be able to actually reply to you because you'll have actually made a point of substance

No, what you mean is, you'll be able to reply with your pre-prepared stock answers, that always get thrown around when the DRM debate comes up.  What you want is for me to defend DRM as a system, so that you can trot out the same tired old cliches that we've read time and time again.  The fact that I took a different view -one against which you can't copy and paste the usual circlejerking arguments, is what bothers you.

If you actually had a shred of integrity, instead of pretending I haven't said anything of substance you'd see (as everyone else can who read my comment) that I made a number of fairly clear and easy to understand points.  They're right there just 2 comments above this one.  You just don't want to address them.

&gt;rather than just claiming that since it's a reality we simply should accept it instead of seeking change.

Ok, by all means go on not accepting DRM.  It'll still be there when you and I are long gone.  In the meantime, for the sake of most people's sanity, I'd prefer to make the best of a bad lot, rather than inconveniencing myself and everyone else on the 'net, because I refuse to compromise and will hold out (for my lifetime) for an unobtainable goal.  But it's your right to take that view if you wish.  No one is going to stop you.

However a few years ago TD Waterhouse was one of the worst ISA brokers (at least customer service wise), these things change over time and thats why you need to look at transfer fees!

I think most people should be looking at the vanguard funds or other [low cost index trackers](http://monevator.com/low-cost-index-trackers/), also the money builder/[regular investing](http://www.tddirectinvesting.co.uk/choose-an-account/regular-investing/) features that let you invest in equities/ETFs for stupid low commission.

So its important to note the fees, platform fees (HL specifically), transfer fees. Available (and desirable) financial instruments [not all funds are available everywhere]

Personally I have my bulk with HL, and that fine as long as im not being raped by platform fees. Stay away from Barclays stockbrokers

Alliance Trust, Bestinvest and Sippdeal are held in high regard and have been for a few years, also they all have reasonable fees. [Here is another monevator article on vanguard and how to get at them](http://monevator.com/cheap-vanguard-index-funds/)

true,[deleted],null,null,"The (paranoid?) cynic in me thinks that him getting mistakenly arrested by a genuine police officer could in turn have been a 'meta-stunt' to generate publicity.

The footage implies that after the 'real' PCSO grabbed him, he was dragged back to the store while the camera continued to record it. In that time, a producer could have quickly informed the officer it was a stunt and then left out that small slice of footage where the charade was broken. It also implies that once he was successfully brought back, the PCSO had to fight to subdue him and pin him to the ground *with* the assistance of the fake officer, the two of which seemingly never share a word at any time about what is going on. Again, in those several minutes, did nobody mention it was fake?

There are probably potential legal reasons or hypothetical consequences for why it would be problematic for a real police offer to be caught up tackling someone in a fake stunt, reasons that might have needed the producer(s) to inform him. Either there was genuine confusion but the BBC staff quickly realized to take advantage of the situation for the added publicity, or all of it was actually arranged.

Sorry I meant to say ""had to be a reality"" my bad. It's funny that you first say ""every"" and then admit to exceptions for which ""very few"" is not actually what I'd call a fair description. It's the reality of most stuff I'm happy to admit I just don't think that a  good thing.

&gt;As I said (if you'd read my comment properly), that was neither the purpose of my comment, nor a position that I trying to defend. You're asking me to take a view that I've already clearly stated that I'm not attempting to push.

Now I'll hold my hand up here and admit I actually miss read that part of your post. It's purely my fault and I apologies. But the point I'm trying to make is that attacking people for pointing out why DRM is bad thing for consumers, and issue it introduces in a wider context and why it's ineffective because DRM is something companies are currently pushing and that we should just accept that push is a bad idea.

&gt;No, what you mean is, you'll be able to reply with your pre-prepared stock answers, that always get thrown around when the DRM debate comes up. What you want is for me to defend DRM as a system, so that you can trot out the same tired old cliches that we've read time and time again. The fact that I took a different view -one against which you can't copy and paste the usual circlejerking arguments, is what bothers you.

As I said above I hold my hands up to misreading the intent of your argument and I'll happily deal with it directly as we follow but I'd just like to call you out on this. You can't simply dismiss an argument because it's well established. Calling it a circle jerk is an insult intended to imply that the results are unthinking and you are also trying to imply that I'm mindlessly following something rather than finding that I agree with the point raised. As some one who clearly so upset that I, as I've admitted, misinterpreted your argument I find it deeply ironic that you seem so heavily invested in this attempt to misrepresent an argument you disagree with as some how being less valid because lots of people agree with it.  

&gt;If you actually had a shred of integrity, instead of pretending I haven't said anything of substance you'd see (as everyone else can who read my comment) that I made a number of fairly clear and easy to understand points. They're right there just 2 comments above this one. You just don't want to address them.

Your point as far as I can tell is that we should simply accept DRM because that's what the companies are pushing for and that if we don't they will retreat to proprietary standards. 

So you must be supper excited about this

http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/12/western-digital/

Which marks the start of hard drive companies trying to limit how you use the product you brought. Which mirrors calls from the industry that all hard drives should come with projection like this. They do that because they understand that DRM on general purpose hardware can always be worked around because you always have to provide all the tools for decryption in the software. If that can be locked away in the hardware it becomes much hard to crack.

According to you this is the reality that we have to accept, allowing companies to dictate how we use our hardware else they will clearly start making their own... only that's not how it works in hardware some one, somewhere, will always offer an open standard and the reasons to use that open standard rather than developing your own remain huge. With out laws forcing DRM in to standards there is no reason to introduce it and by doing so we are seen to admit that DRM is something that is needed in a standard. 

&gt;Ok, by all means go on not accepting DRM. It'll still be there when you and I are long gone. In the meantime, for the sake of most people's sanity, I'd prefer to make the best of a bad lot, rather than inconveniencing myself and everyone else on the 'net, because I refuse to compromise and will hold out (for my lifetime) for an unobtainable goal. But it's your right to take that view if you wish. No one is going to stop you. Just like no one is going to stop DRM.

The only DRM that is effective is in terms of software where part of that sofware is run on the companies servers. That's it. Everything else *has* to be able to be broken, if you make the data human readable it can be circumvented. It does next to nothing to reduce piracy and as a result often give the people who didn't pay for the content or software the better experiences of using it. 

So why is DRM still so heavily used and why does the industry think it's important? Firstly, ignorance, the idea of DRM makes sense at first glance and for risk adverse investors who may not be aware of the details? I can understand that they want that so I can understand why companies are so often willing to simply throw DRM on something for the sake of having it. 

More insidiously pressure from lobbying groups have lead to creation of laws that make circumventing DRM illegal. In the US particularly this has lead us to the situation where the content makers can effectively veto new technology they don't like, all they have to do is introduce DRM that that technology would have to break (even if the lock is flimsy and easy to bypass) and that technology is rendered pointless. 

This is not just scare mongering; 

http://www.techdirt.com/blog/innovation/articles/20120313/11281118092/why-anti-circumvention-laws-are-evil-hollywood-gets-to-veto-dvd-jukebox-despite-complete-lack-infringement.shtml 

And you think a future in which big content industries get to dictate what technology can and can't come to market is one we simply have to accept? Honest? You do realise that that means tapes, VHS, dvds, personal home computers as we know them, the internet, mp3 players, the phone you probably have in your pocket and a lot of other stuff either wouldn't have been allowed to market if they came out under these laws or would be incredibly hobbled as a result?

So, fine, you keep accepting DRM as being a reality we can't change simply because it's currently the reality and I'll keep trying to change it because if we don't the future is going to suck. 

Even if a world with out DRM meant the content producing industry was destroyed I would *still* be pursuing this because where DRM is heading is going to lead to the undermining or even destruction of an open web and that for me is far more important. As it stands there's a hugely strong case that DRM actually hurts more than it helps so fighting it and making the industry aware that it's not required is hugely important.

Sure, single episodes you might be able to grasp the idea of, but most of them would require some insight into what the Doctor is all about for the full effect.

What's with the phonebooth? What's with all this 'magic' in a sci-fi series?"" and things like that, minor things that completely ruined their experience. Some of them were totally cut off on the concept of Dr. Who, and that's fine, it's not for everyone, but others I recommended to try and watch the two first episodes of season 1, and that's where they said ""Ooooh, now I get it"" and suddenly realized how much they enjoyed that episode. Now some of them even view themselves as 'Whovians'.

As for the Doctor, I'm probably one of them who don't have a favorite. I think they each have their qualities, and some of their shining moments and such are based more upon their episodes than their character.
9th was a war veteran. He had the entire Time War closely connected with him which made him somewhat angrier and more easily agitated. He had vengeance in his eyes whenever he saw a Dalek and I for one think that was fantastic. Shining episodes with him would include ""Dalek"", ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"", and ""Bad Wolf/The Parting of Ways"".
10th was still angry, but had gained a more light approach to things. He was a sort of romantic/mysterious character who loved little riddles and to play around, but whenever he got upset, hell would follow. He had a lot more episodes than 9th which I think is part of the reason for his popularity, not to mention some of the best episodes really spoke for David Tennant as the Doctor, especially episodes like ""Army of Ghosts/Doomsday"", ""The Runaway Bride"", ""Human Nature/The Family of Blood"", ""Midnight"", ""The Stolen Earth/Journey's End"", ""The Waters of Mars"", and ""The End of Time"", where he really played through as the Doctor.
11th is much more quirky. Much more child-friendly, yet also a lot more odd and incomprehensible. Has so many little oddities about him that makes him the kind of Doctor to make you smile, while still being able to show off the awesome that is the Doctor. I especially enjoyed Matt Smith's performances in ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone"", ""Vincent and the Doctor"", ""The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon"", ""The Doctor's Wife"", ""A Good Man Goes to War"".

Also as a random aside: I wonder if you could live on 1 mil. I mean clearly you could for a fair amount of time.    

1 mil / 20 (years) = 50K/year.    

But what if you just tried to live on the interest? If you could get a 5% interest rate (is that possible with 1 mil?) then that too is 50K/year and goes on forever (although inflation would make that 50K worth ""less"" year upon year - because everything else gets more expensive).    

In real terms here is how much 50K is worth year upon year (based on 2.7% inflation) in today's money:    

 - Year 0: 50,000      
 - Year 1: 48,650   
 - Year 10: 36,500   
 - Year 20: 23,000    
 - Year 30: 9,500   

So 1mil would easily buy you 25 years of not-working until you had to cut into the base capital (i.e. the 1 mil its self) and then another 20 years after that again. So at least 55 years of not-working on 1 mil won today.    

So realistically no matter your age - you could quit working forever on 1 mil. In particular if you used your 50K/year to invest into a retirement fund (or assumed that the 1 mil pot would be your retirement fund).

Back when the war first started there were various pieces about how the best end-goal would be the partitioning of Iraq into ethnic regions. There were two groups pushing for this IIRC, those who honestly wanted peace for the region (e.g. Kurdish autonomy) and those who wanted to break off the oil-producing regions to make them easier to manage.

A few years later I saw another piece arguing that much of the tension was deliberate. It listed all of the actions taken by the occupation along with why each annoyed specific groups. There did seem to be a pattern in it, all of the decisions seemed divisive. 

There were also some very odd incidents such as [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra_prison_incident), where coalition forces have been accused of performing attacks using ""undercover soldiers"" (SAS here) aimed at assigning blame to other ethnic groups. IIRC there was dnotice associated with this, so the details weren't covered much in the UK (don't quote me on that though). The UK press focused more on the rescue op (remember the burning tank video?) and kinda glossed over why they'd been arrested. IIRC they were equipped with IED-making equipment when they were detained and it was reported that they had been targeting a religious festival in Basra. More details [here](http://www.globalresearch.ca/british-chief-police-investigator-in-basra-dies-under-mysterious-circumstances/1100) from a questionable source though much of it is cited elsewhere.

&gt;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/12/western-digital/
&gt;Which marks the start of hard drive companies trying to limit how you use the product you brought.

No, I'm not excited about it at all.  My fundamental point is that in the case of HTML hooks for DRM they're likely to solve problems of closed incompatible standards, because DRM already exists on more or less everything you purchase digitally over the web.  This has nothing to do with DRM on hard drives, DRM on toasters or DRM anywhere.  It's a singular issue of HTML.  I don't like DRM any more than you do.  But I'm a realist.  And given that DRM is not some future issue we can avoid, but something that is here, is well established and isn't going anywhere, I'd like to minimize the inconvenience it causes, rather than bury my head in the sand and pretend it's going to disappear.

Clearly we're not going to agree on this, and much as I'd like to debate it further, it's getting late in Japan and my eyes are starting to blur, so good luck with your cause to eradicate DRM from the world.

Two examples that stand out in my memory: [""student with no criminal record was jailed for six months for stealing a £3.50 case of bottled water""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8695988/London-riots-Lidl-water-thief-jailed-for-six-months.html), and [""serial thief given 16 months for stealing donuts""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-14573000).  
These sentences were so harsh because the crimes were classed as looting, even though it would be fair to say that the 'real' looting had occured earlier and these were oppertunistic acts of petty theft. It was a pretty controversial move but justified and backed up by ""the greater good"" argument, and ultimately went unchallenged because it was a time of crisis for the UK and the emergency sentencing seemed to work towards putting everything back to normal.

At the time I was on the side of the law, and I though I wasn't sold on the concept of heavily punishing individuals who made bad decisions that were non-violent and relatively harmless, I could see that these crimes only occured because of the riots and letting it go unchecked would provide more incentive for others to riot and loot.

true,Xuth,eng-lancashire,Southener in the North,"I opened this and didn't expect to see another Journo graduate. Don't worry, you're in a good place with your NCTJ accreditation. Make sure you have your shorthand up to 100wpm and you should be golden (I didn't learn mine until after I graduated - whoops!). It's tough, but the media is a big entity despite how it may seem.

**Places which are often overlooked by graduate journos:**

**- News agencies.** Not the big ones like Reuters or AP - I'm talking ones like Whites in Sheffield or the other regional press agencies dotted around the country. An absolutely fantastic way onto the ladder. 

**- B2B magazines.** There are literally thousands of these out there. Anything from Pubs Quarterly to Bid Managers Monthly. These are a fantastic way into the industry and holding a position like this gets you further along the interviews when it comes to the bigger magazines and papers. You'll be immediately expected to write a lot - it's great for building you up as a reporter. 

**- Press and Communications jobs at government institutions:** This includes hospitals, MPs, government offices. Again, a good way to build up contacts for when you move on later. 

**- Local papers.** Work for free, get your name noticed. That's what I did. I just hung around so bloody long giving them stories that they gave me a job despite being a tiny paper. Be persistant, never just do a week and go ""well, thanks then - Bye"". You turn up the next Monday and ask if you can have another week, then another week, etc. At the very least, you'll end up on a very short-list of potential people for the next job postings. 

**- Abroad.** Specifically the United States, Canada and other Anglophone countries (Australia is a bit 'full' of British looking for work though). The trick is not to go where every other travelling journo thinks is a good idea! Washington DC, LA, New York; they're all *full* of freelancers trying to get the next story. Don't underestimate places like Florida, and other southern states. Huge populations, but less competition to beat you to the scoup. Having a bit of British know-how, accent and charm (shorthand for one - they just don't bother any more) gets you further than you'd expect over there. A friend of mine from Uni just landed himself a job as a presenter on a Kentuckyian local news station! His first ever job except footlocker. 

**General Tips: **

- For the love of Hunter S Thompson - keep writing! There's nothing worse than letting your skills stagnate. Blog, re-write stories in your own style to keep fresh if you have to. 

- Build up your contacts list, attend your local council meetings at home. You'd be amazed at the number of stories which pop up at those things but which don't get reported because there was no reporter from the overworked and underpaid local rag to pick up on it! Pass this onto your local paper.

- **Don't lose faith.** Fuck it, you worked hard throughout your degree. You obviously care about this profession. Yes, it's a competitive one. It's a bloody unforgiving one to get right - but don't you *fucking* dare end up in some shitty 9-5 sales job where you spend half the day masturbating and the other half looking at pictures of cats on Reddit. If you're anything like me then you made a choice three or four years ago to become a journalist because it was more interesting than the majority of the other 'I'm doing my job so I can get home and think about other things I wish I was doing' shit out there. Don't go back on that now and regret everything when you get made 'Sub-Divisional Regional Manager at Boring Generic Business &amp; Co' in 10 years time. 

Sell yourself like you're the next Joan Dideon or Tom Wolfe - if they turn you down in favour of some spoilt-son-of-the-news-editor or [insert political wing here]-blogger then, quite frankly, they'll pay for that later with the shit journalism they'll produce. 

The very best of luck to you. I look forward to seeing your next by-line.

 - Inspiration: He beats her up. To show her - he is more powerful, therefore superior, and a ""man"" in her eyes again (plus to punish her for her insulting him (in his own head)).    

So he starts hitting her. But instead of feeling better about himself, he feels worse, so in resentment for what she *made him do* he escalates it until his anger burns its self off.    

Unfortunately he isn't that strange. The above happens in many households and in many relationships (not just men, and not just straight relationships).

Who cares if you spent 50p too much on chocolate this week and but were 50p under on sweets?

Start by taking cash out at the start of every week.  I take out £30.  That is for me to spend on what I want for the week.  I can blow the lot on sweets or in the pub or at the cinema but once it's gone, it's gone till the next week.  It goes in my wallet and I take it out and I feel myself spend every penny.  That's how I budget ""cash"", I know that by paying for the cinema tonight, I will be staying in tomorrow night.  If I'd had lunch out today, there would be no pub tomorrow.  Everything I save today means I can do something better tomorrow.

Everything else, pay for on card BUT you can only pay for things you have budgeted for.  I have 1000 a month go into the account in pay, rent etc comes out just after that.  A fixed amount goes to savings.  What's left is for the months Cash (as above) and for things like topping up Oyster, buying petrol/food/whatever else within the budget.

Finally, along with savings and current account, I have another account  I call ""Set Aside"".  I put money aside monthly to pay for annual expenses.  I put aside enough for my car insurance (600pa), 2 new suits, Christmas and 500 for holidays.

That's it really.

* **Story 1:** When I was a small boy I was taking a piss once and, being so small, I was only just able to get my penis over the rim and I wanted to wee like a grown-up. So I was stood there, happy as a clam, spraying forth with some gusto when the toilet seat shifted, and began it's descent like a mouse-trap if mouse-traps were designed to go a little slower so the mouse got more scared. It seemed slow from memory, but before my 6-year-old self knew what was going on, my cock was breaking the toilet seat's fall, and acting as the filling of a porcelain sandwich like I was the star of some particularly niche website.

* **Story 2:** A couple of years after the events of story 1 I was practicing my headstands on the sofa, like running up and resting my head in the angle between the back and the seat of the sofa whilst throwing your legs up against the wall, in what at the time was our junk room. As I was doing that I began to get a bit bored of it though, so started trying to add some spins and shit like that.

 For the most part it was successful I think, managed to get a good few 180^o turns in so I ended up facing the sofa and wall. I was going very well, I mean I occasionally lost my balance and flopped sideways onto the sofa but that's to be expected it was a work in progress, and I sometimes thought 'Hey maybe I should move that picture (there was a big boat picture we had nowhere to hang put on the sofa), it could get damaged with me doing this so near it.' but as is the way of an energetic young Pogotwig who possesses no feck, I did not move it; and as is the way of an energetic young Pogotwig who possesses no feck, the next time I fell I fell into the the picture. I broke the picture frame. 

 It was ok though; my thigh was a receptacle for some of the broken glass. It hurt like fuck, but I kind of just calmly dealt with it. I mean truth be told my first two reactions were ""Oh that's a shame about that picture, I hope my parents aren't too upset."" and ""Cool!! I've got a proper injury now! Oh boy, I can't wait to emphasise the importance of this in the playground!"" and I just pulled what I hoped was all of the glass out of my leg and decided it'd best to stop after a few more headstands, then I told my mum about what a tit I'd been.

There can still be treatment outside, and it is better for him to associate with normal people rather than those with problems.

There isn't much that treatment will likely do anyway besides institutionalise him and make him less able to deal with people coming out.

If you start at the 9th doctor with Eccelston, you will care for Rose and all that happens during 10 (Tennant). If you skip 9 and start at 10, then you won't care about her storyline as much. And I recommend caring bc it makes the middle of 10 so much more emotionally involving. 

If you want to start with episodes that are not bad British 2000's TV, (said with love) then start watching the first few episodes of 11. You will know who River is when she shows up in 10 (I hope that's not considered a spoiler) but that's the only bit that carries over. 

There are really two major story arcs within the plot line of the whole show: 9 and 10, then  11. 

TL;DR
Watch it from 9. Power through it bc you won't be sorry that you did. And if you HAVE to have a glimpse of what's to come, watch Blink. (I'm probably going to get yelled at for recommending that).

Worse part is it appears to be working on certain subjects, the amount of subjective prejudice is disgusting.  More and more people appear to be openly happy to place blame on groups which they have little to no knowledge about, just because politicians and pundits say so. 

The whole benefit scroungers is the worst part and the way I hear people refer to gipsies (pikies) is absolutely sickening. Now we have the anti-EU and anti-Immagrant sentiment on top of it. With statements like ""Those polish are coming taking our benefits"" or ""Those polish have taken all our jobs"".

I'm by no means implying that we are already at a near Nazi style state or so, but any form of blind prejudice is planting the seeds to aspects of fascism, because it allow people to feel good about them selves, that it's not their fault, it's the fault of the jobless, disabled or any other group which people feel don't contribute to the taxation system in one way or another. 

In certain ways it's not that dis-similar to 1920-30 Germany, the great depression resulted in large scale poverty, the powerful/financial tycoons where to blame, but it was easily twisted to blame the Jews in Germany or anyone who had a negative effect to the economy.  Now you look at Britain, little different approach yes, but the bankers caused the 2008 financial crisis and the government continually attempts to blame the benefit scroungers for the problems, when that doesn't work out it's the Labour government.  It's so easy to blame others behind a mark of pride.

These are just the thoughts I have regarding this, the worse part I heard was Bob Crow on Question Time even starting the Anti-EU sentiment, that's starting to show me that things in the left and the right are very fucked up.

The reforms make it clear that having a ""spare"" room in the first case is fine, because the person hasn't actually moved out, but prevents people from saying they need an extra room for their kid when they moved out years ago.

In all honesty, I think the idea has merit. From working with a local social housing group I know there are plenty of people living in big family homes despite the fact that their kids are married and researching universities for their own children, while at the same time there are entire families living in apartments my partner and I would find pokey. The simple solution would be to build more houses, but as with everything which is simple to fix the execution is really hard. So it comes down to the fact that the people who need big family homes are people with families, not people whose families grew up and moved out. Which again is a really simple idea, and something most people would agree with when talking about social housing.

The problem with this is that in order for the simple idea of ""you should move somewhere smaller so this couple with 3 kids don't have to live in a converted shoe-box anymore"" needs to be turned into legislature, and somewhat vague concepts of ""too big"" and ""too small"" need to be legally defined. And this is where the problems start because there are always going to be people who fall just outside of the limit, and because you cannot have a law that includes words like ""kinda"", ""nearly"", ""use your judgement"" etc, or a law that defines thousands of exceptions which are nearly all outliers, people will lose out and people will get screwed over.

Furthermore, as a first-rate nation with the power to intervene around the world, we *should* intervene to bring to justice the governments which do not uphold the principles of human rights whenever we have the resources to do so.

Well, I suppose you could see it that way, but more honestly it was because of the 1941 uprising. Had they not tried to throw off their colonial masters then they would not have been able to make that call. 

We would have taken Iraq back regardless of any troop access problems. All that did was give it a higher priority. 

&gt; The 1914 invasion was against the Ottomans, not the Iraqis.

It was for Iraqi oil which had recently been discovered in Basra. The Germans had just built [a railway all the way to Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Railway)  to access it which basically bypasses the whole ""Britannia Rules The Waves"" thing. It was a major [contributing factor for WW1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Railway#Role_in_origins_of_World_War_I) (shipping was changing from coal to oil), one they won't teach in school for obvious reasons. 

The British Army were deployed [directly to Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Basra_(1914\)) to claim the oil for themselves. These were the good old days when things were a little more honest. That it was Ottoman didn't matter. 

&gt; And 1991 didn't go outside the borders of Kuwait.

I was quite careful in the link I presented, check again. We conducted over 100,000 sorties into Iraq targeting government and civilian infrastructure.

However, the survey question we are discussing is not whether invasion was carried out in the correct fashion, but if invasion itself was the correct course of action to take.

If you believe in intervention, then there could have been a case to intervene in Iraq in 2003. There are four conditions conditions, according to international law, that can lead a country to lose its sovereignty; repeated aggression or invasion against neighbours, genocide, knowingly and willingly harbouring terrorists and breaking the 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Iraq broke not one, but all four of these laws, so on purely on a legal basis there was a case for invading. Personally, I think involving America in something like this will never end well and we shouldn't have got involved, especially as they've refused to back the United Kingdom in international disputes recently.

Also, the state of the Kurds in this current regime is a hell of a lot better now. They are peacefully part of Iraq, which is more than what can be said for the Saddam's regime which held on to them with an iron fist and cannisters of nerve agent.

The question was not ""Do you believe the initially stated reasons for going to war though"" or ""Do you believe in the sincerity of TB and GB in the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq"" - it was about the rightness or wrongness of the war itself.

Do I believe it was right to depose a genocidal dictator? Ummm...yeah.

Honestly I wonder if some of you get so tangled up by placing everything into one pot that you all truly lose the plot entirely.

&gt;One has to be oblivious to the trend of US aggression.

The past is not evidence.

&gt;You talked about the sectarian violence as if it just happened. Violence wasn't a problem until after 6 months of occupation, starting slow then escalating, and it seems like a great deal of that was planned by the US.

Oh, it does? Make your case then!

&gt;I suppose Abu Ghraib was just a failure to have a plan.

Well that doesn't really make sense as a statement or a question, but on the assumption that you're implying that the human rights abuses which occurred at the Abu Ghraib facility were a result of a failure to plan, to an extent I'd say actually probably yes, there does appear to have been a real lack of training and arrangement of oversight in prisons, although largely I think it's probably just evidence of a few people doing their job very poorly and the people under them behaving very badly.

&gt;The US created an enemy within so the occupied people didn't fight the enemy without.

You claim, although the fact that the US has spent the last decade fighting hard in Iraq suggests that this might be nonsense.

&gt;I can't talk seriously about hubris with an unashamed militant who always thinks the west has moral supremacy.

I don't think militant means what you think it means. I also don't think the west always has moral supremacy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; ...it was about the rightness or wrongness of the war itself.

What metric are you judging rightness and wrongness. You have excluded motive from the equation, so I presume you are focusing on practical success?

&gt; Do I believe it was right to depose a genocidal dictator? Ummm...yeah.

To remain consistent you have to opposed the US.

&gt; The past is not evidence.

That actually aligns with the trial of Saddam. He has indicted on charges after about 1985, which was when he cut ties with the US. The US couldn't use the war atrocities nor the genocides even though that is obviously the greater and more clear cut crimes, and the crimes people like you use to justify the Iraq war. They would have had to present evidence that would implicate themselves.

&gt; I think it's probably just evidence of a few people doing their job very poorly and the people under them behaving very badly.

Doing a job poorly implies incompetence. I'm under the impression that the ""plan"" was deliberate and thorough. One just needs to look to the coordinated military operation to justify, legalised, extend and implement torture colonies. Iraq is not a shit hole because the ""plan"" was too vague but that is the argument that too many people are making. The US had priorities, humanitarian issues were not near the top of the list.

&gt; You claim, although the fact that the US has spent the last decade fighting hard in Iraq suggests that this might be nonsense.

Of course, if you'd have been an Iraqi under conquest you'd be pissed off as well. My point is only peaceful communities can build strong nations, and the US from Nicaragua, Argentina, to Vietnam has always employed this tactic of divide and conquer. I think American militants are perfectly happy with the low level violence that is mostly directed at civilians because it justifies the past and continual colonisation. One by one each middle eastern state is falling to US and old colonial powers, and talking of plans this is all going to [the plan reveal by General Wesley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LTdx1nPu3k). Iraq had to fall to take out Iran.

&gt; I don't think militant means what you think it means.

Fine, arm chair militant.

I still don't really think oil is the reason we didn't go into Syria, more realpolitik. 

We (the West) didn't like Gadaffi. Not enough to get rid of him of our own choice, but when a rebellion meant that toppling him could be done relatively quickly and easily without massive military deployment or economic cost, we went for it. His military was relatively small, poorly trained, and with outdated equipment, which facilitated this.

We (the West) don't like Assad. Not enough to get rid of him of our own choice. I this case though, when a rebellion took hold in 2011-2012, he was running a 200,000 strong army designed to fight a conventional war against Israel, equipped with quite good Russian/Chinese kit, and trained to a good level by regional standards. We COULD have toppled him, but it would have been an undertaking on the scale of the Iraq invasion, so it didn't seem worth it.

I agree that Russia and China opposing intervention adds another reason why the West wouldn't want to commit the blood, treasure, and political capital to deposing Assad using our own forces, but I don't think it's the main reason. I think it would just be too difficult for the reward on offer; the juice isn't worth the squeeze.

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"So, it was ruled they didn't give claimants enough information and were required to backdate benefits, so instead of actually doing that, they change the law so they don't have to?

To make it even worse, they even went so far as to ensure the people affected couldn't ask for the minimum wage from the placements?

I cannot think of any legitimate reason for this other than to save face for a piss poor policy that's blown up in front of them. So far, their workfare scheme has statistics to prove it is ineffective, it's costing the taxpayer serious money, it's put unbelievable hardship on the unemployed during a recession that some economists are arguing is being antagonised by the government's economic policy, and now to boot they are retrospectively altering laws to deny anyone who essentially was exploited by the lack of information given to them from what they legally should have been owed?

That's on top of the overhaul of people being taken off disability benefits who have been hit after experiencing more personal loss than a lot of the politicians making these decisions know about (anecdotal evidence aplenty here), with the government slashing benefits as far as possible attacking things like people in social housing with more bedrooms than they need without ensuring smaller alternatives are available and cutting public sector jobs where possible.

Labour shouldn't be backing this amendment and nor should the Lib Dems, not over this issue. Proactive amendment as of this date could be agreed on, but in this state they are saying they haven't broken the law because they have amended it to say they're not responsible.

That is some very poor judgement from a department that is meant to be acting in the interests of the citizens of the country, not the politicians whose careers are on the line for this, and a government showing it is willing to take steps like this, in my opinion, has no place in power.

Funny how a government likes to have rhetoric about being responsible for your own decisions isn't quite so good at that when they feel they made a mistake.

I think parts of the Tories have their own little plan for what they want. I do believe at some point they will repeal the national minimum wage. They're extending the workforce as far as possible and ensuring as many employees are available as possible, then as soon as the minimum wage is gone, they can cut corporation tax further to 'encourage' businesses to come make use of cheap labour and low tax rates. By making benefits as bad as possible, they are 'encouraging' people to take any jobs they can and literally cry out for jobs.

The problem is they don't seem to realise in a global economy that the United Kingdom has got fuck all to offer. What can the people of the UK offer a business that they can't get elsewhere? As it stands people just are not consuming as much as they used to. There is no scope for expansion in an economy with no money in it. They won't be bringing their jobs here no matter how many times you get Osborne to do his shamanic ritual dance in the Treasury wishing for money to rain from the skies because, much as the whole word 'private sector' implies, they don't want to and it's up to them. They're still making a profit, they're waiting for things to improve in the parts of the world that matter to them, not for us to fuck ourselves over as badly as we can.

Sorry for ranting. I'm just tired of seeing a government that has some capable people in it being absolutely useless and acting as if the unemployed and poor are responsible for everything wrong with the economy.

Also; as for the DWP spokesman who claimed that """"This legislation will protect taxpayers and make sure we won't be paying back money to people who didn't do enough to find work."""" - they can go do one, in the nicest possible way.

Most prisoners have a lot of plans about how they're not going to end up in again but when you get out there's either no one to meet you at the gate or it's one of your old buddies, you might not have a place to stay and all your old social-psychological issues still remain.

&gt;Guido has spoken to witnesses about last night’s fracas, this is what he has pieced together from various accounts.
&gt;
&gt;At about 10.15 pm last night Eric Joyce’s researcher Martin Brown (pictured on the right above) exchanged words with Louise (an MP’s researcher, whose surname is known to Guido) outside the Sports and Social in the area where people smoke in the Commons Inner Court. In the ensuing altercation Louise was knocked to the ground – allegedly by a punch.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Alex Cruz Vidal (pictured, right), a researcher for deputy speaker Nigel Evans, intervened to protect Louise and restrain Martin Brown by wrestling him to the ground and sitting on him. The administrator of the Sports &amp; Social came out and with Alex’s help manhandled a shocked Martin Brown into the bar’s little cupboard sized office and locked him inside until the police arrived. Police came to arrest Brown and Eric Joyce showed up shouting at the cops.
&gt;
&gt;Joyce – who had already been involved in some argie-bargie in the Sports and Social earlier that night – is said to have arrived at the scene and reacted angrily to being told by a copper that his staffer was being arrested – he pushed the copper, who came back to restrain him, where upon Joycey threw a punch at the copper. At this point another copper joined in to restrain him, resulting in the Honourable Member for Falkirk ending up on the floor being handcuffed before being taken away into the back of a police van.
&gt;
&gt;By this time there was a large crowd and around a dozen policemen outside the Sports &amp; Social – including PoliticsHome’s Tony Grew – who only saw the second altercation involving Joyce not the original altercation involving Martin Brown that kicked the whole thing off. Police closed the Sports &amp; Social and the Strangers Bar early…",0,1363378884,null,0,false,0,c8wbosx,t3_1ac8r4,t1_c8wbosx,t3_1ac8r4,null,1431597366,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,jcrreddit,null,null,"Hopefully, when your friend laughs at you for wanting to start at the beginning, they mean the ACTUAL beginning of the series back in 1963; and NOT the rebooted beginning of the current, updated series which started in 2005.

As a fan, it would definitely be great to start back in 1963, but there are huge chunks if shows missing because they taped the show on the ""new"" video medium, and to save money, the BBC TAPED OVER shows.  (Side note: This would have also happened to Monty Python if Terry Jones (or one of them???) had not purchased the tapes.) So, you can't really start at the very beginning and watch every... Single... Show.  Even if you wanted to.

At any rate, I would definitely recommend starting at Series 1 (the new present day numbering system) Episode 1.  Why would anybody ever want to skip out on the Eccleston season?  Or on the introduction of Rose?  Or Captain Jack Harkness? Or in any little tidbits of information that can be referenced again in the future. (Or past... Or present... Or... Well, time travel gets a bit sloppy you know.)

This question seems to be asked over and over again; and I'm really happy that each individual person asks in their own post.  I would never belittle someone asking this question by saying, ""Check other posts! Check the FAQ!"" Or whatever.  There's ALWAYS repeat posts on Reddit everywhere!

A good analogy for a reason to start at the current series run beginning is as follows:  I have never seen even ONE episode of The Sopranos.  Where should I start watching?  Season 3?  No!  The first episode.  Who'd want to miss something.

And who am I to say what someone may or may not enjoy.  Maybe you'll hate Rose.  Maybe you'll like (random recurring character from future season) and be mad it took you so long to get to them.  But the full journey is fun in and of itself.  Things will mean more.  You'll be more invested.

TL;DR

Start with the first episode of ""Series 1"" from 2005.

Work's a bitch. So much to do. Really long hours. Drowning in a sea of inefficiency and people trebling my workload unnecessarily. But, I've decided that things must be perfect (cos I'm a control freak) so some of it I've bought on myself. 

I threw all my toys out the pram on Thursday morning and had a hissy fit of immeasurable proportions at our IT department. I managed to get an irritating pile of bollocks sorted immediately for the entire organisation, and now they reply to my requests within ten minutes flat instead of a week later, or, as has happened, simply never. 

Found out that the agency who pulled a fast one with me at the last minute on my rate did the same with the new girl who started work with me on Thursday. Gonna be bitchin' on them to HR next week. In real money terms it's costing me 2.5k a year through their extremely calculated methods of deception and outright lies. Net. Motherfuckers. 

Fingers crossed my fucking managing agent won't make a pass at me for a third time when I have to see him at some point this weekend because I don't think I currently have the frame of mind to fob him off in a kind manner. This is probably why I seem to constantly be propositioned by fucking idiots. Too nice about saying 'no.'

We see Torres loose the ball a lot because of this.

From what I've seen of Lukaku at West Brom, he is pretty damn good with his back to the goal. Still not as good as Drogba with the turn and shoot, but he can hold play up nicely, which will give Mazacar time to catch up.

&gt;naive in thinking the British government or others really care about people being killed by dictators

That's as good a place as any to look at. Whilst no; civilian deaths are not usually the prime cause for an intervention/invasion I definetly think it plays a large role in international politics. We only would have happily kept out of WWI if Germany hadn't invaded neutral Belgium (and also their subsequent butchering of the civilians), likewise why did we join the Kosovo and Bosnian War when there actually was no material interest there: oil, strategic location, or alliances? What about U.S losses in Somalia? Also look at the very long list of U.N peacekeeping missions to see that our leaders and politicians do have a alturistic human side. Humanitarianism is not always just an excuse.

Unfortunately, yes, for every humanitarian war there are 4 'greed' wars which off-set the balance somewhat. And yes I've studied Agent Curveball and the preparations for invading Iraq before the President was even informed, and of Blair's yuppy eagerness for just a little spotlight and U.S goodwill. And yes it reeks of shit. The humanitarian reasons came after the occupation went pear-shaped.

As for intervening in Iraq but not in Zimbabwe, once the decolonisation process was finished, Africa became a very brutal place to be in, for the most part. Directly our fault again but in the unforeseen consequences of our shoddy map-work and division of indigenous peoples. After Somalia most Western countries did a complete reversal and stopped intervening in the case of civil wars, let Africa sort itself out. Rwanda and Zimbabwe are the main cases in point. Bush Jr. thought Iraq would be a cake-walk like it was for his father (in all cases it was, except the occupational period which was a disaster.) however fighting in Central Africa against a heavily guerrilla and sneaky enemy in a location you have no knowledge of, at a huge distance from supply bases is a very tough challenge for any military staff, nigh impossible. Kosovo was difficult enough for the EU in their back-yard. Libya? Round trip 8 hours for our aircraft, Mali isn't too far from Spanish bases either. States will intervene when their experts deem it fully possible with few risks. Obviously Iraq was misjudged and poorly executed.



There is also another good reason to be in favour of the Iraq War, arguably the toppling of Saddam directly led to the rest of the Arab world seeing their leaders for what they were (ruthless despots) and the strength people power could have to change the system in what later became known as the Arab Spring. Like the Iraq War there are many reasons why it occured but our invasion had a lot to do with it, I believe.

&gt;**How is the voting record decided?**
&gt;
&gt;The voting record is not affected by what MPs and Peers have said, only how they voted in relation to that topic in the house - i.e. ""aye"" or ""no"". Votes on each topic were examined, and strength of support determined based on these votes. Follow the ""votes"" link next to each topic for details. Additionally, in many votes, MPs and Peers are told how to vote ('whipped') by their parties. Since the Whip is secret, we have to assume, like the Speaker, that all votes are free.

So it doesn't take into account if the votes are whipped because the Whip is secret.

As for why an MP would vote differently for a topic, some topics are spread out over different bills. For example with university fees it shows David Milliband as being a mixture of for and against university fees. This is because he voted for university fees when the Labour government introduced them, but he voted against the coalition government increasing them to £9000.

Ed Balls is pretty much the same. Point being, any senior Labour politician will have frequently voted along the party line - which has been quite shitty. It's arguably a pretty big flaw in our politics, due to the strength of the party whip.

Regardless, if you won't vote for a Labour government led by an MP with a voting record like this then you won't vote for a Labour government led by an MP who's voted.

But lest we forget, *Doctor Who* started in 1963. The idea of telling stories using television was still new. The only frame of reference people had at the time were stage plays, radio plays, and that influence was brought over to the television medium. 

Television in 1963 bears absolutely no resemblance to the television of 2013. 

*Doctor Who* was on the forefront of, not just science fiction, but entertainment television itself. To that degree, it's remarkable how the show has evolved. 

I imagine that when people who grew up with the show tuned in in 2005 to see ""Rose"", they, too, were put off by the frantic pace and action and explosions. 

If you were disappointed, you're not alone. There have been many people who jumped out of bed, said ""Today I'm going to watch the *very beginning* of *Doctor Who*"", started Episode 1 of *An Unearthly Child*...then found themselves on Facebook half an hour later.

But I also think they're mindful of keeping the Doctor's memories intact, so they let them be portrayed in the characters as well. For instance: 9 was very much affected by the time war, so much that he had some of the most vengeance/anger controlled actions of all the doctors. Even the Dalek's said ""You would make a good Dalek"". 10 had a lot of anger issues as well, but had become somewhat brighter and more focused on the adventure. But 10 lost some of his companions. A lot, even. And that began affecting him as well, making him more sworn to secrecy and keeping himself locked up in... well, a box. This doesn't really shine through until he becomes 11 though, where his quirky character shines through a lot more. At this point he has pretty much accepted his actions after the great time war. ""Fear me, I've killed them all"". But he has also become a man who obviously hides some of his true self from his companions because of how it went down with the old ones, going on adventures as if it's a drug to keep him 'sane'. One bit of guilt replaced with another. So to sum it up: 9=War veteran. 10=War veteran in recovery with more sociability and more lust for adventure. 11=Semi-recovered war veteran with more secrecy and too much lust for adventure.",0,1363387887,null,0,false,0,c8wepi7,t3_1ad7l7,t1_c8wepi7,t3_1ad7l7,null,1431598801,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

In my opinion the, in long run Comic Relief (in its current form) wont help the third world countries it's supposed to because the worrying fact is that the Earth is hugely over populated. Because of that there simply aren't enough resources like food and water to sustain the population so all the lives saved actually perpetuate the problem because in the long run it just means more mouths to feed which will eventually lead to the situation getting worse. 
In fact one could argue that we shouldn't be helping at all until the population has decreased to a more sustainable level.

**But.** On the other hand leaving people to die like that would be so inhuman a policy like that should never be put into practice. 

Instead what Comic Relief and the other charities should be doing is help spread contraception across the third world and trying to encourage people not to have so many children as well as doing what they already do. Also in first world countries, domestic waste reduction and population capping policies should be implemented to and combat the fact we are running out of resources.

(After all, it's not just the Tories here - ""Social Democrats"" have implemented austerity on the continent, brutally so in Greece.)

Everyone's employed, everyone's able to buy shit, but only for as long as you can keep the public spending up and the military budget up. 

Hjalmar Schacht was the man behind all the public spending and to be fair he was right about some things.. He wanted to increase infrastructure and he did with stuff like the autobahns but at the same time he had Hitler on his back wanting to increase military spending. Eventually Schacht got fired for repeatedly telling Hitler to calm down on the military spending. 

He got replaced with the one and only Goering who from what I can tell was in charge of basically everything since he was the ultimate 'yes man'. Lol. 

So then Goering was like 'Fuck yeah, up military spending by a fuckton. Fuck that educated and competent Schacht.'

The military driven economy of Nazi Germany can also be seen as a catalyst for the wars they got themselves into, eventually accumulating into WW2.

Do a bit of reading about the past Doctors; see which one intrigues you the most; find out which of his stories are rated the most popular; and start from there. 

I'd advise not doing William Hartnell or Patrick Troughton's stories on your first try, since those are the hardest to get into for someone unfamiliar with the show.

Anything from Jon Pertwee on - when *Doctor Who* truly started to come into its own - will be a good way to acclimatize yourself with the way *Doctor Who* stories were told in the past.

In many African countries, people need lots of children to surive. If you have lots of children, you have lots more hands to work on your farm, for example, which means you, and therefore they, will survive on. However, this means that in a drought, or some other disaster, you have a lot more mouths to feed, which leads to the big famine problems like we are having in Ethiopia. Also, it means a lot more people to treat for illness. 

So, if you go over to an African country, say 'Hey, I know you are starving, but it would be much better in the long run if you have less children', it won't help anyone. The economies and infrastructure in many African countries just aren't set up for smaller families.

Also, Comic Relief doesn't just give aid as in food or mosquito nets. It spends money on building schools, and improving infrastucture that way. It has been shown that with higher education, family sizes can get smaller, as people (expecially women) have more opertunities to make money, and therefore need less children, or want to have less children.

The bad news is that if you've been in a job for less than a year you virtually have no employment rights, and even after passing a probation period they can sack you up to day 364 with virtually no legal consequences. The good news is that you have a recognised disability (I think) and they are discriminating against you.

Immediately go to see Citizens Advice. 

I think there's two types of diabetes: 1 and 2. I forget which is the more serious. Let's say you're type 1 (currently not life-threatening); not carefully managing type 1 can lead to type 2. By denying you the right to address your illness after you've told them about it at your interview they are denying a basic human right to take care of your health for a potentially life threatening disease. And, you are very right here. I have a friend who has type 2 (or whichever is the more serious). She has to inject herself with insulin five times a day. She's had to have decades of teaching herself to know when her levels are dropping to inject herself. Now, here's the serious bit: if she fails to keep her levels adequately high and misses an injection, it's SERIOUS. She's not like most people who can just laze around in bed at the weekend and not worry about sleeping until 1pm. If she misses a few of her injections, her blood sugar levels can drop so low that she literally slips into a coma. She lives on her own too, so you can imagine how dangerous this is. As a result, her life is regimented. It is RUN by her illness. When her blood sugar is low, I can tell. She gets scatty, she forgets things. If she misses her alarm clock in the morning (any morning) she runs the risk of falling into a coma. When I worked with her, I had her address, her best friend's contact details, details of the managing agent's details who held a key, and we had an agreement that if she ever didn't turn up for work by 9.15am (she usually got in at 8.30am) I would start calling her. If no reply, I would wing it straight up to the managing agent, get the key and bust into her flat to check she hadn't missed her alarm and slipped into a coma. So fuck me if these people really think it's not serious or life-threatening. Seriously, fuck them.

Get advice immediately.

Secondary question: how long from the start of your shift and when you asked to be relieved to get your sugar levels up?

Edit: she knew about slipping into a coma because it happened to her several times in her childhood until her and her family learned how to cope with it/avoid it.

[Wikipedia has quite a comprehensive list of war crimes committed by the allied forces.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_war_crimes_during_World_War_II) (Any I list may or may not be mirrored there.) To expand the idea I'd say the same about WW1 as well and perhaps earlier conflicts, because it was basically a climax of old colonial powers.

* Concentration camps were invented by the British in the Boer War as a means of subjugating native peoples under an invading force. They were used extensively by the US on its home soil, and should Germany have won and managed to siege America I speculate that we would have seen very similar emaciated pictures and mass deaths coming from their rather than eastern Europe.
* Eugenics was an American invention and actually applied.
* Hiroshima and Nagasaki are obvious things to point at—needless mass civilian execution for a war that was already won most likely to scare the Russians shitless.
* Hitler (and Stalin for that matter) were directly financed and equipped by the West. Most notable from my memory was IBM who actually supplied the technology to log ethnic data on the entire population.
* The most egregious case in my mind was the Greek ""Civil"" War. After the monarchy fled the German invasion, an anarchistic people lead insurgency managed to force them into near total retreat. The first thing the allied forces did were to crush this new form of government and reinstate the old monarchy.
* The forcible removal of 750k palestinians to make way for Israel.
* Anti-communists, amongst others had fled soviet russia and the Allied forces returned many to their deaths under [Operation Keelhaul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Keelhaul), so whilst Hitler was supposedly purging Europe of jewishness the Allied forces was doing a similar thing to a different blood line.

That whole period has been re-written as some humanitarian crusade, and that helped the US go on to commit all manner of atrocities and [bloody regime changes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions).

I think you probably have a pretty good case for discrimination and unfair dismissal. 

Here's an uncouth word of advice: threatening to go to the local papers will always massively put the shits up a past employer in these circumstances. They may end up paying you six months salary to avoid it, and/or to avoid going to court. So, you need to play clever. First step, CAB. See what they say. The problem is, a lot of employers know and assume that their workers can never afford the time or the emotional energy it would take to go through a long, drawn-out court process in the first place. So they assume you are poor, won't do it, treat you like shit.

Going to the newspapers with 'I was sacked by a massive food chain for having a life-threatening disability' is going to put the ball firmly back in your court, may avoid any court case, and get you a wedge of money because they will basically pay you off to keep you quiet. MAYBE. It's not the best method, or most sensible, or most respectful, but you have to think about your own mental wellbeing before you take on huge battles. If that means that you have to be a bit ruthless to get six months (or more) of pay to give you enough time to get a new job, then so be it. They have already resorted to ruthless employment conditions with no apparent reason with you. As long as they have nothing else on you (you turned up late all the time, you were rude to customers, you were drunk) then I think you are pretty much the good employee who was discriminated against for a disability here. 

Edit: having worked for a few CEOs of large companies, I can promise you that if you send a letter to the CEO (type it, whatever) but with a hand-written envelope and a postage stamp instead of something that's been franked through a machine, that CEO (of the group) will have that read by his PA. His PA will read it, and if the subject line is: unfair dismissal, currently conversing with the Daily Mail (or similar, or at least put that in the first few lines), that CEO will read it, shit his/herself and they WILL sort it out. They'll consult their top internal lawyer and the head of HR. Unless, legally, you have no grounds. Which I do not believe to be the case. The CEO will get the top people on it, and they are very likely to arrange a pay off without you even having to pick up the phone to any shitty tabloid.",0,1363395383,null,0,1363395935,0,c8wgwsw,t3_1adq2l,t1_c8wgwsw,t1_c8wgl6c,null,1431599837,11,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,11

If you put £3000 into your ISA account last June, and took £2000 out January, you can still put £2640 in. This limit is effectively reset on April 6th 2013, where you can put a maximum of £5760 in until 2014. The amount you can put in an ISA increases every year.

Note also that you can put more money in, but the interest is then taxed. I've not been lucky enough to be able to do this so I cannot comment on how it works.

**Track your income and outgoings now**, if you can. It's probably not important for you right now but is a very good habit to get in to.

**Get 3-6 months (the more the better) emergency money.** If you injure your hands or back, you may be out of work for a while. Make sure you have enough money available to account for this possibility. (Your instant-access ISA is perfect for this.)

I'm a bit drunk. Look at the time it is on a Friday night in the UK. I've been researching new Minecraft switches and watching shite telly with the family. I've successfully put FOUR bairns to bed (well I helped with it, but I did do well). I've been talking about proper horror movies with people who have much more experience with them than me but are good friends.

""Off of"" is how I would say it. Sometime's I lapse into Geordie when writing because that's the only language I can reach, and I need to get the thought out before it disappears.

At a Beer Festival some (3?) years ago I started ranting about something. Not directed at the people who came outside for a smoke with me, directed at something we were all pretty angry about. A very good Scouser (who I do not see as much as I would like to see) told me ""You Geordies don't pronounce the letter K when you're drunk!""

I thought about it and realised something. When I'm angry, the sound that the letter K represents seems totally unnecessary. He's right! I'll say ""Fu ' ing..."" when I'm angry.

Well, when I'm a bit drunk then some other rules will become unnecessary. I might say things like off of.

I've only had to use them once but they used to have solicitors who would write extremely harsh letters to people for really, really low fees. The sort of fees us sorts can afford. So maybe they can arrange to get it done for you.

Over this weekend what you need to do is this: get a piece of paper and write down notes on everything you remember. Find the old job advert if you can. That's especially important because a lot of companies say they are equal opportunities employers in job adverts. Well, they have not been for you. If it was online see if you can find it through your December browser history, take a screen shot, print it, take it. Then you need to write down everything. Start date. Who managed you. Who told you that you could not have a break. Who you met with in HR and when. Every detail you remember of that conversation. And so on. Go to the CAB armed with absolutely everything you can remember (in a chronological series of events) and they can probably tell you exactly what you need to know there and then. 

Good luck.

Will you reply to this some time and let us know how you got on? Please try to. 

So, my suggested routes: 

1) CAB / possible threatening letter from CAB recommended (and non-rip off lawyer)

2) Letter to the CEO if the above doesn't work or fails

3) If 2) fails, actual conversation with a journalist at a shitty tabloid press, Daily Mail, Express, whatever - but make sure you are clear you want to be paid for your story and negotiate the amount; I think six months of salary is reasonable, it's peanuts to them

Bear in mind that 3) puts your name on the internet and may potentially make you unemployable in the future. It depends on what sort of jobs you're after. Can't imagine if you're looking for similar roles they would really bother to google your name, but people are odd and vicious, so just bear that in mind.

true,xxlozzaxx,australia,Ex-pat... Maybe?,"&gt;What are the tax agreements between the UK and Aus? Where do you pay tax?
Is the 'resident' and 'non resident' thing awkward?

If you're employed you make a declaration on tax forms given to you by your employer. You are given a choice to elect yourself as a resident or as a non-resident.

* If you declare yourself a resident, you pay 13% tax (increases as wage does though)


* If you declare yourself a non resident, you pay 32% tax (increases as wage does as well)

Tax is given from your gross wage weekly, unless you have an ABN (Australian Business Number) in which you are self-employed and therefore you are responsible for your own taxes (you can guess how compliant people are).

At the end of the financial year (start of June) you can claim your tax back. As I've come to understand it, you get 100% of the first $8000 back and then diminishing returns on the rest. You can do this whilst still being in Australia.

Superannuation works slightly differently. if you earn $450 a month or more then your employer (unless you have an ABN) is obliged to pay a minimum of 9% of your wage into a superannuation fund (best thought of as a pension pot).

You're right in hearing it is difficult to get back. Generally it is claimed *After* leaving Australia for good. It *is* possible to claim whilst still in Oz but you therefore forefeit your right to work, so say you have 2 months left on your visa and you just plan to do the east coast or whatever, you might agree not to work to get a sum of money to travel with.

The tax back thing is basically a compulsory savings system, which is pretty cool, I think I'll get a couple grand back this year and hopefully a ton next aha. Super is harder to calculate as I've worked with a ton of different firms and therefore I have a load of different amounts with different firms, but I mean, I'll happily spend a week sorting shit out to get a few grand from it. aha.

Oh, yes, you were, it was you. Excuse me if I write everything you say off as massively cynical and unhelpful bollocks, because you have nothing constructive to say other than to troll people and feel you have some higher purpose to teach people lessons from your own upbringing.

Be helpful, give constructive critisism or just shut the fuck up. Done with your trolling, dude(tte), get a fucking life.

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"MSE has some great savings guide, but here's how i'd do it; 

1.  - make sure any and all debts are cleared EXCEPT for student loans. see [should i repay my student loan](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-repay). 

2. put a regular amount into an ISA and work on topping up on isa till it's maxed out. get the [best value isa from MSE here](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-cash-isa) - (hint, new ones are released in ~ 2 weeks time for the start of the financial year, you'll see more released then). 

3. if you managed to save more than the yearly isa limit and its not the end of the tax year yet, then start a [regular savings account](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts). Next financial year, start to [drip-feed](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/best-regular-savings-accounts#dripfeed) from your isa into your regular savings account, while also saving a separate amount into your isa with the aim to put in the max limit in by the end of the financial year.

With 1 + 2 you've got the best rates possible for fairly instant access savings at very low risks. - the drip-feed ensures your money is always earning the best interest at least cost to you. 

pension - if you are self employed, you won't be paying into one. The earlier you start this the better because of compound interest.  I'd highly recommend getting a private scheme.

MSE recommend the following rule is used 
&gt;Take the age you start your pension and halve it. Put this % of your pre-tax salary aside each year until you retire.

I would personally want to put at least 250 a month into one, ideally more than that. At 31 i put in ~ 210 a month and it is severely not enough - I'm going to be forced to increase it to around double that in the next few years in order to get any kind of decent pension, possibly even more, as i have not put enough in previously.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I really think that 4-3-3 is fits our squad the best.

 GK: Cech RB:Azpi CB: Iva/Cahill CB: Terry/Luiz LB: Cole RM: Rami CM: Mikel/Luiz LM: Oscar/Lampard RW: Moses/Hazard ST: Ba LW: Mata/Hazard

The problem with the 4-2-3-1 is that our midfield isn't properly balanced for it, and due to the kind of football we want to play our defenders have to play a high-line that they're not really equipped to handle. Our best defensive midfield pairing in this system is Mikel and Rami, which is fine for Mikel but not getting the best out of Rami. The 4-3-3 can still be used to play great football and serves the majority of our players better. The back 4 stays the same but asks something a little different from our fullbacks. In midfield, Mikel provides the defensive presence, Rami uses his insane athleticism to play box-to-box, and Oscar or Lampard orchestrate the attack from a deeper position (something we seriously lack currently). Hazard and Moses are ideal wide players, and can each play on either wing. And of course, the striker stays pretty much the same (though we could experiment with a false 9 if we really wanted to).

The only two players I'm not sure what to do with are Luiz and Mata. Luiz isn't a huge issue, but I'm not sure whether I like him better in defense or in midfield. Mata, on the other hand, is the only player that I don't think this system will benefit. This is a big deal because he's arguably our best player. He's played his best football in our 4-2-3-1, but the reason why I have hope is that for most of his career he's been a winger. His explosive form could be down to the fact that he's genuinely getting better as a player/adapting to the league (rather than just being better in his current position). If I'm right, then he can do what he's doing now from a wider position. That would be excellent, because it would mean that we offer an attacking threat from everywhere on the pitch (even our defenders, whom I love and admire greatly for their goal contributions, truly out of this world).",0,1363405111,null,0,false,0,c8wjrj8,t3_1adie7,t1_c8wjrj8,t3_1adie7,null,1431601246,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

So, for two years, her local clinic raved about this new insulin drip that she could have fitted to her body, it's being tested, we're absolutely going to get it for you, etc etc. From what I can gather it's the difference between having an small 'implant' versus a motherfucking mass attached to your hip.

And then she had to move home. And borough. And because of this, new new Local Authority basically said 'NO CHANCE.' It's sad because she'd built up such a good relationship with this clinic over the years. And frankly who the hell wants an iphone sized implant on their hip?

Last time I saw her, she was absolutely distraught. Then she got a call from the old clinic in her old borough. They had the equipment rep for the jaffa-cake* sized doo-dah in. The nurse or whoever was managing her case happened to talk about her in passing to the sales guy or whoever visited from the manufacturer. The equipment people have offered her four years with no cost to have the jaffa-insulin body thing. What's not yet clear is who pays for the insulin, and if it has to be her local borough, will they pay for that. Or will they simply refuse it, say it's new tech we cannot support, and it ends up being completely false hope (yet again).

So it's all still a bit of a mess, but I'm feeling hopeful that she'll get it sorted some time in the near to medium future.

Get several used clean jars from the kitchen. Put labels on the front of them, e.g.:

* entertainment
* saving

Then, every week/month when you get your pay, after the mandatories (e.g. rent, water), withdraw the rest in cash and divvy it up amongst the jars.

Now - when money is in a jar it is visually obvious what purpose it is for. Psychologically you will not be able to avoid the fact that if you pinch money out of the saving jar you're robbing yourself.

All televised and speculated Doctors are the same being.  They have different ideas of themselves, but they all carry on as the same being.

For example, you thought of yourself one way when you were 6.  You thought of yourself a different way when you were 10, or 15, or 20, or 30....  Hell, I know *I* did.  But you were always still YOU.

In my case, for a time I was ""Davey"", then I was ""David"" (and don't you DARE call me anything but that!!!), and then I was Dave.  Each of these phases of my life had their own idiocyncracies (sp?), but they were all STILL ME.

Likewise, the Doctor.  Like humans, he grows and changes - physically in his case - and goes through dramatic alterations.  Granted, he doesn't do this gradually as we humans do, but as we fans often need to be reminded...he is NOT human.

I've deviated slightly from the point, but just as my 40ish self sees a kid driving stupidly and says ""Hey, slow down, you fucktard!"", my 30ish self would have calmly flipped them off, my 20ish self would have probably been that idiot and my teen self would have gone ""Fwew, Blimey! What a nice car!""

Now.  Just as my teen self and my 40 year self would appreciate the same good Bowie song doesn't mean that my teen self and 40 year self would agree on much.  We would probably quarrel...a lot.  But that wouldn't make us any less of the same person.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"Noise will always be a difficult one - it isn't really amplitude that makes noise annoying. I may be a special case - I have Aspergers. But even for people in general...

1.  Noise is just about the only thing people can't fully habituate to - sure you can get used to it and become consciously unaware, but even then it still causes an unconscious stress response.

2.  It's more about control and the situation than about amplitude. Fairly quiet noises can be extremely annoying when you can't stop them or control when they'll occur, even though there are much louder noises under your control at the same time that don't bother you at all.

At 8:30PM I guess there's a conflict - one persons quiet TV time is another persons limited opportunity to get a job done after work.

Anyway, at the moment I have a problem because mice have got in. I've done what I can to block them out and I have traps and poison down, but the upstairs neighbour has deliberately been leaving food out for them.

I've tried to reason with him - I really don't care if he has pet mice so long as they *are* pet mice in a cage, but encouraging wild mice in is a bad idea. In theory, the problem is that they carry fleas and mites etc, and they get into cupboards and so on. But TBH the thing that *really* bugs me is the sound of them chewing on bits of wood or whatever coming from the ceiling.

It's not very loud, but it's noise, and I can't control it.

Music doesn't bother me so much even when it's a lot louder. I have ear defenders for the times it does, and sometimes the music is loud enough that it's still annoying with those on, but that's pretty rare.

The upstairs neighbour also has shouting fits, though, and that annoys me more. As far as I can tell, he's shouting and complaining about other peoples noise, though I normally can't hear any other noise for him to complain about. TBH I think he has bigger mental health issues than I have.

And with all the mouse noises, music, shouting and even next doors dog barking for hours sometimes - well, it turns out that I'm the arsehole for ""deliberately making an annoying clicking noise"". As far as I can tell this means typing too loudly on my admittedly mechanical, but [Cherry MX brown based](http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Brown) (theoretically non-clicky) keyboard.

It's true that Martha was always sacrificing herself and she was always treated as second-best by the Doctor, but it's a giant leap to connect that to racism, or something that would only happen because Martha's black. All the companions are pretty much the Doctor's subordinates, and it's a perfectly believable thing that after Rose, the Doctor would *want* a companion who's more of a caretaker-- what connection is there to her race? And the show itself kind of judges Ten for his treatment of Martha by having her walk away from him in the end, something no other new companion has done, so the message there is that if you treat someone like shit, they're going to leave you. 

&gt;Additionally, as a character, Martha suffered from incredibly erratic writing ranging from “great” and “okay” to “shoddy” and “wow, so, so shoddy”

And BTW, I've heard at least several hundred complaints (mostly not directed at me, but I could hardly avoid hearing them) yet I've personally not complained about noise even once - this doesn't count as the neighbours, landlords etc don't know about it. I've asked the upstairs neighbour to do something about the mice, but irrespective of what actually annoys me, that's an issue in more ways than noise.

The fact that you put quotation marks around ""deliberately making an annoying clicking noise"" suggests you think that either; the noise you're making doesn't count as a nuisance, or that you don't accept typing on your keyboard makes any noise that he can hear. 

No - it means that he thinks I'm trying to deliberately making a noise with the intent to annoy him, and all I'm actually doing is typing.

And irrespective of whether he's sensitive to quiet sounds, it's not reasonable to require me to never type. The only thing I was ever good at was programming, plus the nearest thing I get to social contact is online.

Interesting that no-one at all is choosing to empathise with me. Let me be clear - even if he has a noise-sensitivity issue that explains his reaction to my typing, he makes far more noise, both many times louder and also quiet noise too, and *he* is the one who has shouting fits for hours at a time and pretty much any time of the day. In fact, he's only just quieting down now from almost two hours of shouting and swearing about the next door neighbours noise (from what he's saying, they're complaining to each other about each others noise, though I can only hear him).

&gt; I have Aspergers so of course I can't simply put a foam mat under my keyboard to stop it making noise that I know is annoying my neighbour. Or move my desk. Or moderate my behaviour in any way.

You're jumping to false conclusions about how noisy my keyboard is, and about my behaviour. My keyboard is mechanical, but those are Cherry MX brown keyswitches (non-clicky, often called ""silent""). I'm absolutely not a keyboard-thumper. A foam mat would make **no difference** whatsoever. And *he* moves from room to room complaining the whole time. I moderate my behaviour a thousand times more than my upstairs neighbour does, and incidentally also far more than most normal people.

In terms of how annoying my noise is to him - he mentioned it once, when I was asking him to deal with the mice (and giving him the trap and poison to do it). In terms of how annoying other non-autistic people are to him, his shouting and swearing at one next-door neighbour (about their noise that I cannot hear) is pretty much an everyday thing.

Peter Davison, the fifth Doctor, was not even allowed to put his arm around his female companions for that reason, a granddaughter from long long ago simply didn't work with this mindset. When Susan returned in The Five Doctors writer Terrance Dicks originally wanted her to call the Doctor ""Doctor"" and not ""grandfather"" for this very reason. A short story by Script Editor Eric Saward was released for the 20th anniversary where it turned out that Susan wasn't actually the Doctor's granddaughter (the story is not very good btw), and this is perfectly in keeping with how the Doctor was perceived back then. That's also why the big kiss in the tv-movie was so controverse at the time.

The people the article refers to are either fascists or authoritarians. The designation of left and right ought to apply to an economic ideology, the basic split being between free markets or some interpretation of Marxism.

 The word 'liberal' for example, is typically used now as a way to described a 'lefty' when it actually is meant to describe an individualist world view, i.e. a Tory. When I say the word 'libertarian' you may think of Nigel Farage or Ron Paul, people who we typically associate with the 'right'. However the original Libertarians were actually anarchists i.e. people like Bakunin who wrote about mutual aid.

As the economic pressure is put upon people they will look for someone to blame; the rise of fascism is predicated upon those in power seizing upon a people's fear and ignorance.

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; Well if he's told you you're making a noise and you know that the noise you're making annoys him, and you continue to make that noise, you are doing it deliberately.

Pedantically, yes, but that doesn't mean it's reasonable to demand that I be perfectly silent. Please note - you know nothing about the situation other than what I've described, yet you're assuming that I must be acting unreasonably - based on what?

&gt; Also, you've literally just said you've never once complained about the noise he's making.

Absolutely. OP posted about a somewhat similar situation - being frustrated with other peoples noise then having them complain - and invited others to share their frustrations. So I did. Apparently, that was a mistake.

The fact is that I *always* take my problems to be mine and deal with them as best as I can. My symptoms include passively accepting situations that others rant and rave about, and compulsive self-reliance, obsessively trying to fix my own problems for myself. That's a fairly common pattern in Aspergers.

&gt; So you know, maybe that would be a start? Instead of not telling him that you've got a problem with his noise and just ignoring his requests to moderate your own... maybe you could ask him?

Normally I might do, but this is a case of adapting to the actual situation. I have a *minor* issue with his noise - it'd be nice to vent a little and get some empathy, basically. And I'd have a tough enough problem discussing that with most people without them thinking I was making a big deal out of it and taking offence. That's part of the disability. And this particular person is having shouting and swearing fits all the time anyway, directed at someone else, not me.

I *have* spoken to him about the mouse situation, as I already said. And he complained to me once, even though he complains to others all the time. And didn't it occur to you that maybe his complaint to me was purely in reaction to my complaint to him?

To be honest, I don't really know that the noise he was complaining about is my keyboard - I'm seriously impressed with his hearing if it is, but it's only a guess. He could have been complaining about heat expansion/contraction noises (which are louder than my keyboard), or rain hitting the pipes outside (which is louder still) or he could have just made it up because he knows I use a computer a lot and it was an easy retaliation when I spoke to him about the mice.

And if he just needs me to be in the wrong about something, I'm fine with that just so long as he deals with those mice.

I'm much less happy at the idea that I'm not allowed to vent in a conversation where others are venting, and where there was an open invitation to vent, without having someone assume I'm in the wrong with no actual knowledge of the situation and criticize me for that.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"&gt;I don't think it is ever a very good idea to be providing welfare.

I know you don't but based on the comment you made before ('Welfare can't really be justified in most circumstances.') i asked you when you thought it could be justified and what your reasons were? When you avoid the questions like that it makes me think their no logical argument in your head.

&gt;If the Government gives people money for nothing then what incentive is there to work? Welfare dependence is an increasing problem in our society.

I think you have a very poor understanding of the human condition. To the extent that we can generalize about the human race (I actually believe we can to a large extent) its fair to say that people are motivated by a number of factors. People have ambition to make something of themselves which goes beyond earning money. People want to be seen to have achieved something by their peers. People want to feel that they have accomplished something. People want to avoid being on welfare because it is tough, it restricts your freedom and it makes you feel worthless. People have separate ambitions other than just earning a living but that none the less will earn them a living. You see everything in terms of money and greed, which is wrong in itself, and yet ironically you think that people will settle for the minimum in terms of money and greed. So their you go. I have given you just a couple of examples of the top of my head of incentives for people to work if the government gives them money. As a side note, if what you were saying was true than once people had earned enough to live on for the rest of their life they would always stop working. Life shows us this is not the case.

&gt;Welfare doesn't protect society, it coddles people. Bribing people not to riot is a ridiculous thing to do. If someone steals or riots then they should be put in prison, there is no excuse.
Defence is there to defend us, the realm and the interests of the realm.

Society takes alot away from people, that's why welfare is justified. It's not about bribing people not to riot, it's about giving people the minimum so that they dont **have** to riot or steal in order to survive. Why should people be forced to live as wage slaves with no opportunity of a better life? why should they not wish to organise society so that it benefits everyone and not just those with the opportunities and ego to get ahead and push everybody else's head's into the dirt? My point is that if you push people to the brink of existence then their will be no incentive for them to remain part of a society that tells them they must remain slaves or die. Then what incentive do they have to keep the laws of are society?

You said 'Defence is their to defend us'. What a ridiculous statement. What are they defending? I asked you to tell me that already and you will not. When you say they are defending the 'realm' you must surely mean the state, and by the state you mean the people who make up the state. So then my question, that apparently you refuse to answer, is why defend the people in the one instance and not the other? 

&gt;You can continue trying to redefine words all you like, but no one is falling for it.

Why is your definition correct whilst the governments is not?

&gt;Almost all, if not all, of the money people get is invested in something. You're showing again your blatant ignorance of finance.

If you call money sitting the bank and collecting interest investment, or if you call the banks playing the financial markets investment then you need to justify why this is investment in the economy. If you your talking about something else then you need to say what your talking about. Otherwise your just saying i'm wrong and its meaningless because you wont explain yourself.

&gt;If you're competing with other people for paid work then obviously someone loses out, but that's just capitalism. There are plenty of untapped markets but if you do decide to compete again other people then expect to fight for what you get.

So then what is to be done about those who lose out? Remember that is what we were talking about .That is why i made that point. You need to justify people starving. Do you think that every unemployed person should expect to find untapped markets?

&gt;Your inability to spell simple words like ""our"", ""there"" and ""you're"" along with your misunderstanding of basic words like ""invest"" don't make you sound like an intellectual.

What makes you think i have any interest in sounding like an intellectual? The reason i cant spell for shit is because i'm dyslexic, it has nothing to do with intelligence and the fact that you would resort to such comments suggest you really have nothing to say of any value. 

&gt; I want to live in a society where people take responsibility for their own actions and don't expect others to support them. I see no reason for adults to be treated like children.

You are describing a selfish cold society and i wonder if it is a reflection on your own life perhaps? Besides, Your definition of adults being treated like children is problematic since it rests on the redistribution of wealth in the form of tax's yet you see no problem with a state run police force or army etc etc.  Why should we be protected like children from the each other? Why should we be protected like children the rest of the world? Besides, if i sore a man who was starving i would help them to eat and if i could would help them have a place to live. That's treating someone like a human, not a child. 

&gt;I see that there is a level of employment and that there'll always be a section of people with not enough money to live, but I reject the notion that there are people unable to get through a week without making some money.

Then define employment. Because at the moment that seems like a contradiction in terms. 

Also you accept that their will always be a section of people in society with not enough to live on. You accept that this is the case because of the society we live in. You don't put it down to personal stupidity, you accept a basic rate of unemployment. Then why should we not support those people when it is not their fault? 

Also, what a horrible statement 'I'm sure they can earn enough to feed themselves' is. It shows that you have a basic disregard for your fellow human beings. O, i'm sure they will not die. I'm sure that mother will have enough to feed her children. Let's leave them in the gutter for a week and see how they do. Are society will be the stronger for it.

&gt;Tax is morally justifiable, ridiculous public spending isn't. When the Government takes tax they're expected to spend it well in the interests of the people paying it. Currently that doesn't happen.

But your unable to make an argument that says that tax in the form of welfare is not morally justifiable. I just made an argument to that effect. You just countered with a statement that rests on your own definition of what is in the interests of the people in reply to an argument in which i refuted your definition of what is morally justifiable. Explain why you think my argument was wrong? 

&gt;Labour isn't the only cost, which is what I've been saying, it's simply one expense of many. It's true that the labour is cheap but the roads, railways, geography, electricity and simply their position in the world all all factors against them. If a company finds the UK is the best location then they'll invest here.
For example you could build a car in the UK, take it by road to the coast and ship it anywhere in the world. The power infrastructure is stable, the people educated, the roads fast and the ports efficient. It's also incredibly close to Europe. Trying to do the same in the LEDC, for example Zimbabwe, would just be a complete disaster.
There's a reason you see the LEDC countries producing lots of manpower intensive products like clothes and shoes but very little in the way of high tech products like cars and trains. Our advantage in the past was always automation and we're still ahead of the third world in that regard, we have a significant competitive advantage.

So then in that case being tax is not so important and we should not base are tax policy on trying to bribe companies to stay here? 

&gt;What other countries do doesn't concern me. I certainly don't think the UN should start telling people what they can pay their employees though.

The UN already does in it's charter actually. It's just that nobody listens to it. It states that everybody must be paid enough to live on. Why is it that what other countries do doesn't concern you?

I generally get on Ok with my neighbours, but there's always one flat that's trouble - in the last six years there's been four different sets of tenants, and each one has done something that could be considered irksome.

* **Smoking in the hallways**, because the flats are no smoking, but they don't want to have to go outside.
* **Banging internal doors** - the current occupant averaged twenty times an hour, between the hours of 9PM and 10PM [That I know that is, I'll concede, ridiculously sad.]. Though that was because he didn't realise how loud it was - a quick mention and now I hardly hear it.

* **Noise from exercise equipment** - I'm guilty of this myself; my rowing machine used to wake up my neighbour. When I realised this I immediately started using it in the evenings, rather than six in the morning.

* **Blocking the halls** - Obviously one or two things outside your door isn't the end of the world. But an exercise bike, two suitcases, and three fullsize refuse bags is taking things a wee-bit too far.

* **Parties -** This one is the one that's been the most problematic. Nobody has a problem with people having parties, but surely I'm not alone in thinking it's common courtesy to let folks know in advance? If I'm up at 6 Friday morning, I don't want to have to listen to ""banging tunes"" that start 10 that evening, and go on until 3AM. But if you let folks know in advance? Not so much of a problem.

Although I'm not sure renting really did work that well prior to the 1980s, [Peter Rachman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rachman) comes to mind. If indeed, it was so sucessful - why did people flock to buy houses during Thatchers economic reforms?

I don't see why a compulsory national register of landlords and lettings agents with the legal power to ban 'Rachmans' would be bad for landlords at large. Personally I'd love to go further and introduce rent control laws like they have in parts of the USA. That would prevent situations like we had during the Olympics - where tenants of 2 or 3 years were being told to leave their properties for the duration of the games or pay 5-10 times the cost to compete with tourists.

As I've said before, I think landlords have an unrealistic sense of financial entitlement because of the boom years. They talk about returns of 5%... which are rediculous. In reality, they invest ~£30K for a deposit in the south east and get a pre-tax annual return of about £14K or 45%. Obviously that money is tied up in mortgage but it also appreciates in value as the property market recovers. As soon as rents regularly exceed the mortgage repayments it strikes me that landlords are making excessive profit. As I've said, I don't see why someone who is 50 can own two houses with debt held by the bank - but someone 20 years their junior can't own 1 house with debt held by the bank... even though they have 20 extra years to pay it down.

Do you have a suggestion of what age I should start a pension? I have only just turned 21 so it's not really occurred to me before apart from the fact that my Dad is starting to struggle a bit after the recession wiped out a fair whack of his pension.

For example, look at Downing &amp; Henderson. Last season under Kenny, they would have been given far fewer tactical instructions, and more of a license to 'play their own game'. We all saw how that went (and that's not to criticise Kenny's methods; they work, but those were the wrong type of player for it).

But instead it was just some bloke who isn't very good at public speaking.

true,NEWSBOT3,null,null,"you should start the pension as soon as possible - because of the way interest works over long periods of time putting 50 quid a month in now is worth more than putting in 150 a month in in 10-20 years time would be. (ie, at 7% growth that 50 quid becomes 193 over the 20 years. If you started putting into it 40 - your money is worth 2-3 times less). Over 50 years, that £50 becomes £1,500. it's a little more complicated because of inflation, but basically the best rule is to put in as much as you can afford as early as you can. 

of course, everyones got things to spend on / save etc so the MSE suggestion is probably best -aim to put in about 10% of your wages (pre-tax) - and increase this by 0.5% each year.

The thing with pensions (and what likely happened to your dad) is that there are different levels of risk involved. A lot of risk is the best way to make big returns, but it also risks losing money if it doesnt work out.

Mine is 75/25 between safe funds and some risky ones. When you are younger - you can tell your pensions company to use quite risky strategies - because you have more years to make it up if the risk doesnt work. You can also tell them to be very conservative - this gets you less growth, but also means less chance of the value dropping.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"I just shared this in another thread but it applies here too: 


I really think that 4-3-3 is fits our squad the best.
GK: Cech RB:Azpi CB: Iva/Cahill CB: Terry/Luiz LB: Cole RM: Rami CM: Mikel/Luiz LM: Oscar/Lampard RW: Moses/Hazard ST: Ba LW: Mata/Hazard
The problem with the 4-2-3-1 is that our midfield isn't properly balanced for it, and due to the kind of football we want to play our defenders have to play a high-line that they're not really equipped to handle. Our best defensive midfield pairing in this system is Mikel and Rami, which is fine for Mikel but not getting the best out of Rami. The 4-3-3 can still be used to play great football and serves the majority of our players better. The back 4 stays the same but asks something a little different from our fullbacks. In midfield, Mikel provides the defensive presence, Rami uses his insane athleticism to play box-to-box, and Oscar or Lampard orchestrate the attack from a deeper position (something we seriously lack currently). Hazard and Moses are ideal wide players, and can each play on either wing. And of course, the striker stays pretty much the same (though we could experiment with a false 9 if we really wanted to).
The only two players I'm not sure what to do with are Luiz and Mata. Luiz isn't a huge issue, but I'm not sure whether I like him better in defense or in midfield. Mata, on the other hand, is the only player that I don't think this system will benefit. This is a big deal because he's arguably our best player. He's played his best football in our 4-2-3-1, but the reason why I have hope is that for most of his career he's been a winger. His explosive form could be down to the fact that he's genuinely getting better as a player/adapting to the league (rather than just being better in his current position). If I'm right, then he can do what he's doing now from a wider position. That would be excellent, because it would mean that we offer an attacking threat from everywhere on the pitch (even our defenders, whom I love and admire greatly for their goal contributions, truly out of this world).

I didn't really think about our players on loan. Lukaku could be our starting striker, pretty straightforward. De Bruyne could absolutely play in our team, though he's so versatile that I'm not sure whether he'd be better for a midfield of forward role. Those are probably the only two that could crack our starting 11 (except Essien, but that's a bit different). I'd like to see Feruz, Chalobah, and maybe someone besides Bertrand get some bench time. I don't think Bertrand is that bad, but I think PVA, Kalas, and Omeru might be better (though not necessarily the same positions).

SUBS: Courtois, de Bruyne, Lukaku, Terry, Azpi, Ramires, Moses

I would run a 4-3-3. The middle three would be more attacking minded having a holding midfielder and two attacking midfielders.
-Courtois and Cech would split time like Lloris and Friedel at Spurs right now.
-De Bruyne and Lukaku would see chances but need to get used to being back at the parent club.
-In the reserves and moving in and out of the squad would have to be Piazon and Essien. The bison is no where near his former self and Piazon needs a but more experience before becoming a first team regular. He could also continue on loan at Malaga.
-Torres is totally done at this point, he has moments where you can't help but cheer for him but he isn't consistent enough for what we need. Marin could be put on loan because he hasn't had enough chances to prove himself where he is right now.
-Benayoun and Paulo are gone. Contracts expired and there is no reason to renew them.

This is just me. Sure a new top name striker could come in but I truthfully would not be upset if we don't. Lukaku has proven he can score in the top flight and giving him a chance before buying another big money forward that could end up like Torres. This formation is also built to help our strongest players. Hazard and Mata play much better on the wings while Lampard an Oscar are back in the distributor roles that they have both shone in. Mikel is unbelievably consistent and gives our attacking minded CB Luiz a chance to come up and make something happen. Just as he did against united. Every time you saw him at the top of the 18, chances were created.

What it means to be Northern Irish (as distinct from orange/green)? Reasonably young state, therefore no stereotypes to adhere to - I like it and am relaxed about it. Things around me that I see labelled Northern Irish that spring to mind - music and football, reinforce this idea of a young, fresh identity unencumbered by the historical ideas of nation state.

It means I don't feel the need to react in revulsion when I see plastic Paddies/Anglo-centric Brit stereotypes on the news, etc. It's not NI, it's not me. It may well be to people elsewhere but sometimes it's better letting them stay uninformed, lest it means that little unique piece of Northern Irishness that defines me comes in for similarly grotesque characterisation. You could say 'what about the rioting/Troubles?' and there's no getting away from it, it's depressing in a uniquely NI way. But as half of that characterisation is politically motivated and besides as I've never known any other way of things I've learned to live with that dark patch.

How does it fit in with the Orange v Green internals (because predominantly you are one or the other)? Not exactly sure. Ribbing eachother about it seems to work.

That's absolute nonsense, and is one of the main problems faced by utilitarian ethics in philosophy.

&gt;It is entirely viable to judge the ethics by the expected outcome as well as the ideal.

Expected outcome? So what if that doesn't happen. You're introducing the problem of moral luck here. If things happen to go well you made a moral decision, if things go badly for reasons outside of ones own control then the decision was immoral? It ridicules the very notion of morality.

&gt;This principle exists throughout society. The Hippocratic oath is based on it for one.

No, it isn't. A surgeon who tries to save a patient but fails is not a murderer because they carried out high-risk surgery which didn't go to plan.

Obviously if you have the *intention* to kill a person then that is immoral, but if the intention is to *help* them and it goes badly then that is not immoral at all. We can judge a surgeon poorly who carries out surgery he is not ideally trained for, but he has not acted immorally, just unwisely. This is the same as with the invasion of Iraq.

- Nasri made no impact whatsoever coming off the bench. I think we should keep him, he's a fine player, but he needs to lift his game next season.

Disappointing performance really, Dzeko was being a baby, Kolarov was all round terrible. Silva hasn't been that good for awhile - not sure why. Tevez and Zabaleta were the only players who seemed to be working hard - I would Include Milner but I feel he might've warranted two yellows. Barry was okay, didn't really notice him and the same for Garcia.

SUBS: Courtois, de Bruyne, Lukaku, Terry, Azpi, Ramires, Moses

I would run a 4-3-3. The middle three would be more attacking minded having a holding midfielder and two attacking midfielders.
-Courtois and Cech would split time like Lloris and Friedel at Spurs right now.
-De Bruyne and Lukaku would see chances but need to get used to being back at the parent club.
-In the reserves and moving in and out of the squad would have to be Piazon and Essien. The bison is no where near his former self and Piazon needs a but more experience before becoming a first team regular. He could also continue on loan at Malaga.
-Torres is totally done at this point, he has moments where you can't help but cheer for him but he isn't consistent enough for what we need. Marin could be put on loan because he hasn't had enough chances to prove himself where he is right now.
-Benayoun and Paulo are gone. Contracts expired and there is no reason to renew them.

This is just me. Sure a new top name striker could come in but I truthfully would not be upset if we don't. Lukaku has proven he can score in the top flight and giving him a chance before buying another big money forward that could end up like Torres. This formation is also built to help our strongest players. Hazard and Mata play much better on the wings while Lampard an Oscar are back in the distributor roles that they have both shone in. Mikel is unbelievably consistent and gives our attacking minded CB Luiz a chance to come up and make something happen. Just as he did against united.

true,honeko,null,null,"The article isn't arguing that the quality of writing is a form of racism. I think that point was brought up to explain some of the hate toward Martha and nothing else. This is the same reason why the author brings up the romantic complications involving the Doctor's longing after the lost Rose. Neither of these points seemed to be brought up to claim racism.

I don't agree with all of what the author wrote. I can understand how a person *could* interpret Martha's ""subordinate"" position to the Doctor negatively because of historical tropes and circumstances. BUT! I actually think this notion of the POC as a ""second best"" and as the servant/subordinate was totally subverted and blown out of the water with Martha. When I was watching the show, I thought Martha came out more like the Doctor's equal than any other companion. In fact, she was *so good* that she could take care of *him*. She wasn't always in need of his saving her or his smarts to get out of a jam. Martha, in some respects, was stronger than the Doctor. She helped take him out of his despair a little bit and she saved him multiple times, getting very little in return from him. (I don't mean just romantically - the Doctor was the snippiest with Martha and it was quite sad.)

The author contradicts herself, certainly, even referencing [an article](http://www.thestar.com/news/2007/07/07/whos_that_girl.html) that states the role of Martha was ""colour-blind casting."" I really believe this is true and that the Doctor would have been pretty dismissive and hurtful to ANYONE that came after Rose. I don't think his actions were because of her race. However, I do believe the Doctor was ignorant of the complications of time-traveling with a person of color. Unless he was being cheeky, that comment about walking around like you own the place was very uninformed and somewhat tactless. It surprised me when he said it because you would think a centuries old being that loves Earth would be aware of at least some of the basic social dynamics of Earth.... particularly considering that ""racism"" or ""speciesism"" definitely exists on other planets. I gave the Doctor the benefit of the doubt on that one even though what he said was insensitive because I think he was trying to encourage Martha not to let anything discourage her, including her race (if he was aware that this would be an issue).",0,1363448623,null,0,false,0,c8wr0uv,t3_1aed07,t1_c8wr0uv,t1_c8wn3i1,null,1431604725,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You think this is *not* racist? This line, I believe, was written to be explicitly racist to show historical inequalities. I actually thought it was brilliant because, as the audience, we know Martha is more than capable and we know in the future that many POC do become doctors and other types of professionals. The statement shows how these types of ugly attitudes have changed and that is a good thing to acknowledge.

Or, are you saying that Shakespeare referring to Martha as a ""blackamoor"" and lusting after her ""exotic"" appeal is not racist? This is very complimentary racism, but racism nonetheless. It's a form of fetishization of people. This is negative because, as the author points out, Shakepeare's fetishization emphasizes Martha's race as the most alluring and important aspect of her, ignoring all of her other traits. People are more than their race, and this is what, on the whole, Martha succeeds in showing us.

For example in the UK we wouldn't say ""I'm going to Grad School"", You would say you are going to studying a post-grad. You will get insults, mostly playful, from saying Sidewalk (Pavement), Gas (Petrol), Pants (Trousers) etc. 

The biggest thing to watch out for is the spelling differences as they could have a negative effect on your grade: -ize/-ise, To U or not to U and er/re. Setting your word processor to English (UK) should catch most of them but Microsoft doesn't really like that setting.

When I was in 2nd year of my degree (undergrad/Bachelors) we had a lass from South Carolina live with us, she was on an exchange to my uni, and she had a great time. We are a friendly bunch in the UK and you'll find that your friends will translate for you and proof read for those small spelling and grammar differences.

Now this is where the real nightmare begins, after the game we get told we're being kept behind, it seems the Nottingham police had the same genius idea as the Derbyshire police earlier in the season. Anyway we made our way  outside the ground to see a brick wall one side and a wall of police vans on the other side with a tiny gap in which they were letting people out of 2 by 2. 30 minutes later and we were still trying to get out, as you would expect the Derby fans were getting pretty impatient and then I heard someone shout CHARGE! and the crowd pushed forward, which was most worrying. Thankfully for me, I wasn't that far away from the gap and I got pushed right through it, but people behind were looking very worried. The Police though were quick to react and they moved their vans to let people through. I just hope they don't do that sort of thing anymore, of letting the fans out slowly, because it is not a clever idea,  especially at 10:30 pm. That was not the end of the fun as it then took us a further 20-30 minutes to get back to the train station, it probably seemed  worse than it was because we didn't know where we was going. And then to cap it all when we got back to Derby it took us 45 minutes to get a taxi.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In most cases large charities, like Comic Relief spend a hell of a lot more on administrative costs (bigger salaries, nicer offices, etc) than the smaller ones. 

I tend to donate to charities with a smaller remit (say Médecins Sans Frontières) because they have a much better understanding of the type of work they're doing.

If you're thinking of donating to a less well known charity, the best advice is to check the [Charity Commission](http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/) ([OSCR](http://www.oscr.org.uk/) in Scotland) website, they give you a full break down of a charities finances, how much money actually goes to their cause, what's invested, etc.

Liverpool needs to invest in some more CB, we are really struggling in this department.  The 3rd goal… The 3rd goal, showed how weak we are in the defense.

BR lack of substitutions in this game is very very displeasing, it showed that he had a lack of tactical awareness of what was happening in the game. Courtinho was dead, he was running on the spot, so what does BR do? Subs Sturridge off, mind you this is after the 3rd goal and in the 83rd min in which what impact can Henderson possible have? I really think that BR got everything wrong this week, we had to win this game to really show that we are the real deal.

The point that I really want to make is this one… JO**E ALLEN SHOULD NOT BE STARTING IN FRONT OF LUCAS**… EVER EVER EVER... we all know this and we all understand why he shouldn't be starting in front of Lucas, however BR has this blinding love for Allen that effects the outcomes of our games. Now not blaming Allen for the loss however how different would it have been if we had Lucas in? This also ties in with BR tactics and how can he make such a decision, we already knew that Allen was inured… why start him? Now I will bring it back to Allen, I don’t rate him: his passing is poor, his defensive efforts are just as poor and he gives up the ball way too often.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;I know you don't but based on the comment you made before ('Welfare can't really be justified in most circumstances.') i asked you when you thought it could be justified and what your reasons were? When you avoid the questions like that it makes me think their no logical argument in your head.

Perhaps in cases of severe disability.

&gt;I think you have a very poor understanding of the human condition. To the extent that we can generalize about the human race (I actually believe we can to a large extent) its fair to say that people are motivated by a number of factors. People have ambition to make something of themselves which goes beyond earning money. People want to be seen to have achieved something by their peers. People want to feel that they have accomplished something. People want to avoid being on welfare because it is tough, it restricts your freedom and it makes you feel worthless. People have separate ambitions other than just earning a living but that none the less will earn them a living. You see everything in terms of money and greed, which is wrong in itself, and yet ironically you think that people will settle for the minimum in terms of money and greed. So their you go. I have given you just a couple of examples of the top of my head of incentives for people to work if the government gives them money. As a side note, if what you were saying was true than once people had earned enough to live on for the rest of their life they would always stop working. Life shows us this is not the case.

People on welfare are rarely ashamed. Welfare is addictive and hard to get off, that's why it's called the 'welfare trap'.

&gt;Society takes alot away from people, that's why welfare is justified. It's not about bribing people not to riot, it's about giving people the minimum so that they dont have to riot or steal in order to survive. Why should people be forced to live as wage slaves with no opportunity of a better life? why should they not wish to organise society so that it benefits everyone and not just those with the opportunities and ego to get ahead and push everybody else's head's into the dirt? My point is that if you push people to the brink of existence then their will be no incentive for them to remain part of a society that tells them they must remain slaves or die. Then what incentive do they have to keep the laws of are society?

I'm not a socialist, I believe in personal responsibility and not just giving people things. If you want food you can bloody well work for it.

&gt;You said 'Defence is their to defend us'. What a ridiculous statement. What are they defending? I asked you to tell me that already and you will not. When you say they are defending the 'realm' you must surely mean the state, and by the state you mean the people who make up the state. So then my question, that apparently you refuse to answer, is why defend the people in the one instance and not the other? 

The Police and Armed Forces defend the Realm against criminality, foreign attacks and maintaining law and order. Welfare doesn't defend anyone.

&gt;Why is your definition correct whilst the governments is not?

I've already explained it to you, you just choose to ignore everything I say and fall back on your straw man.

It's pointless just retyping what already exists.

&gt;If you call money sitting the bank and collecting interest investment, or if you call the banks playing the financial markets investment then you need to justify why this is investment in the economy. If you your talking about something else then you need to say what your talking about. Otherwise your just saying i'm wrong and its meaningless because you wont explain yourself.

Putting money in the bank is investment.

http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/investment

&gt;So then what is to be done about those who lose out? Remember that is what we were talking about .That is why i made that point. You need to justify people starving. Do you think that every unemployed person should expect to find untapped markets?

Survival of the fittest.

&gt;What makes you think i have any interest in sounding like an intellectual? The reason i cant spell for shit is because i'm dyslexic, it has nothing to do with intelligence and the fact that you would resort to such comments suggest you really have nothing to say of any value. 

Well when you start calling other people idiots you better expect to have your own intellect questioned. Don't play the victim card, falling back on dyslexia, because someone has called you out. 

The worst part is that you continue to make the same spelling mistakes even after I've already pointed them out to you.

He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.

&gt;You are describing a selfish cold society and i wonder if it is a reflection on your own life perhaps? 

See, you're doing it again. You keep on throwing around personal attacks because you're not actually able to argue any other way. Mental retardation is not an excuse.

&gt;Besides, Your definition of adults being treated like children is problematic since it rests on the redistribution of wealth in the form of tax's yet you see no problem with a state run police force or army etc etc. Why should we be protected like children from the each other? Why should we be protected like children the rest of the world? Besides, if i sore a man who was starving i would help them to eat and if i could would help them have a place to live. That's treating someone like a human, not a child. 

The police are there to maintain law and order, they thus treat people like adults.

There's also a difference between charity and welfare.

&gt;Then define employment. Because at the moment that seems like a contradiction in terms.

In reality it's a person out of work, in legal terms it's a person not registered as working and assumed to be looking for work.

&gt;Also you accept that their will always be a section of people in society with not enough to live on. You accept that this is the case because of the society we live in. You don't put it down to personal stupidity, you accept a basic rate of unemployment. Then why should we not support those people when it is not their fault? 

It is almost always their own fault.

&gt;Also, what a horrible statement 'I'm sure they can earn enough to feed themselves' is. It shows that you have a basic disregard for your fellow human beings. O, i'm sure they will not die. I'm sure that mother will have enough to feed her children. Let's leave them in the gutter for a week and see how they do. Are society will be the stronger for it.

Why is that our problem? Why should hard working people be forced to pay for the lazy, irresponsible and criminal?

&gt;But your unable to make an argument that says that tax in the form of welfare is not morally justifiable. I just made an argument to that effect. You just countered with a statement that rests on your own definition of what is in the interests of the people in reply to an argument in which i refuted your definition of what is morally justifiable. Explain why you think my argument was wrong? 

It's morally wrong to take money from one hard working group and give it to another lazy group.

Your argument isn't wrong, I just disagree. You take the stance that everyone should be forced to help other people.

&gt;So then in that case being tax is not so important and we should not base are tax policy on trying to bribe companies to stay here? 

Actually, I agree. Tax breaks are bad, they manipulating the market. Tax cuts should be universal and not different for certain industries.

&gt;The UN already does in it's charter actually. It's just that nobody listens to it. It states that everybody must be paid enough to live on.

The UN is a strange organisation, I don't take much notice of them.

&gt;Why is it that what other countries do doesn't concern you?

Allen should get his operation and not play for the rest of the season. Lucas should be starting every game, with Downing/Coutinho rotating with some of the younger kids (Suso, Sterling, Shelvey) to get more experience before the year is out.

If the Suarez/Sturridge link up is not working for 75 minutes, I think its safe to say that its time to mix things up. 

Rodgers is normally good at making changes, but today we should have had a complete tactical reshuffle at half time. Leave Coutinho on the left, but bring Suarez in the middle right behing Sturridge.

So, really, I believe she's supporting the way the writers highlighted the small, subtle ways other people can be racist. She's describing the casual racism expressed by *characters* in the show, not of the writers. Of course we expect to see racism if a person of color is to travel into the past. I think it should be written about and I think the author agrees with that. It would be pretty silly to avoid altogether. But, I agree with the author in that I'm glad it wasn't overt. Like, the Doctor didn't take Martha to a plantation or something. Dear God! That would have been so difficult to watch! I doubt Martha would have wanted to see that anyway. Well, maybe she would have?? But I'm glad they didn't do that.

There is a small portion of this article that claims Martha's subordinate position was problematic. I don't really agree with that argument, but I can see why someone would think that. In the end, Martha refused to play the role of the unappreciated companion and that was good on her. I was a bit ""hmmmm"" about her marrying Mikey too. Lol, that's a good way to put it.

It's due to their accounting not um, accounting for donated time, wheras the larger charity's does.

true,KnownForNothing,lfc99,,"Sigh, here's my take on the game today:

Jones - Okay-okay I guess. Still looks like he could mess up any moment but he couldn't be faulted for the 3 goals, and did well to stop a few shots. Distribution obviously not Reina-standard though, needs to work on that.

Skrtel - Not a good game from him coming back. He looked ok when he's being confident, charging towards the ball and basically telling the striker, ""You're not going to get this ball. I am."" But his marking has been woeful, his man gets the better of him so many times. Bad game.

Agger - Could have and should have been better. Also got torn apart by the Southampton attack, but was decent in stopping them sometimes and he's really vital in terms of building from the back.

Johnson - What the heck was that performance? Poor all around. He was getting dribbled past, letting them get crosses in, losing out on headers, failing to trap the ball properly, giving the ball away... One good moment at the end of the match, but that doesn't redeem his performance. Shocked, expected more from him.

Enrique - Probably our best defender. Attempted some ambitious long balls that might have gotten through if their defence weren't so alert. Went forward well, but he has to make sure he gets back fast when he attacks, and he has to be careful when trying to corner a man at the corner flag, he's leaving a man open behind.

I'm a bit lazy to talk about the rest, so just a brief overview:

Allen: I think everyone saw it. Bad performance. Bad bad bad.

Gerrard: Bad performance as well. Looked better when Lucas came on, but he was still giving the ball away.

Lucas: Tackled well, tried some good passes (some succeeding) but a lot of his passes ended up being intercepted. Ok game.

Suarez: Determined, was pretty good, really nice ball leading up to the goal. Was all over the place, defending for us as well. Good movement to lose the defender which would have put him in on goal if not for that linesman.

Coutinho, Good performance, should have done better on his 1-on-1 but he still picked up his goal. Also tracked back and defended well. MoTM for me.

Sturridge: Started the first half well, but slowly got worse. Coutinho's goal should have been Downing's, but Sturridge got greedy when he missed his swing on his left foot and tried to take it on his right instead, when Downing was positioned perfectly to take a left footed shot 6 yards out. And then he screwed up a few easy chances and a little wasteful on the ball. Needs to get his form back, he's been questionable for the last two games.

Downing: Good defending, disappeared in the second half (I thought he got subbed off when I returned from getting a drink) but was ok in the first half. He seems afraid to take shots, faking shots and passing it instead. Ok game in the first half, unnoticable in the second.

Brodgers: His team selection was questionable, to say the least. Is he still trying to justify Allen's purchase?",0,1363455469,null,0,false,0,c8wsuca,t3_1aeycc,t1_c8wsuca,t3_1aeycc,null,1431605581,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

In your view but you know so much about tax and how it works with umbrella companies you don't even know that when you claim an expense you only get back the income tax you'd have paid on that income.

Please explain why you think you're losing £2500 a year because TBH your original post was very full of opinion and it was very hard to pull out actual facts, even with the tl;dr which really wasn't one.

You're paying for a service with the umbrella company. You are being correctly compensated for expenses claims and you're paying the correct fees in respect to employers NI etc.

Your only other alternative to continue in this job is to set up as a limited company which will then save you money on the umbrella company fees but you'll have to pay an accountant however that will be far cheaper. You'll still pay employers NI though and you'll still only get 20% of the expenses in your pocket.

You could take the agency to tribunal but then you'll be hit with a massive tax bill from HMRC for most if not all the expenses you've claimed as they would not be allowed under PAYE.

As someone who has worked for agencies for 10 years I'm surprised you're not more on the ball in respect to this kind of set up between agencies and agency workers.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; and the mortgage to buy one on the same street worked out about £310 per month (20 year mortgage).

Don't forget to plan ahead.  £310 might be what the mortgage costs *now*, but that will change.  A 20 year ""fixed rate"" mortgage is only fixed rate for the first few years (2, 3, 5, 10, etc., depending on the mortgage).  Then it reverts to Standard Variable Rate (SVR) which will be considerably higher than the fixed rate they enticed you into the mortgage with.  For example, a typical mortgage might be 1.75% fixed rate for 2 years then reverts to the SVR of 5.75%. [See here](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/) for examples.

The £310 cost of the mortgage now is nearly all capital repayment.  Perhaps £10 of it is interest.  When the interest rate is 8% (it's not coming for a while but that's the target that the Bank of England is aiming for by 2018) the SVR will be 9 or 10% and the interest on a 65k mortgage (rough guess) is going to be around £6000 a year, or £500 a month.  So you would be paying £300 repayment + £500 interest for a total of **£800** a month.  

All back-of-an-envelope calculations, of course, but it hopefully illustrates the point - mortgages are cheaper now than they have been in living memory.  The prices people are being quoted for mortgages are as close to interest free as makes no difference.  Do not let that lull you into a false sense of security.

That said, it's a very good time to take out a mortgage if you can afford it *comfortably*.  There's every indication that the base rate is going to stay low for many years to come.  In 5 years time you'll have paid off 1/4 of the mortgage so your ""worst case"" interest payments will be £375 (+ £300 = £675) a month.  In 10 years time, you're down to £250 (+ £300 = £550).  Not to mention the fact that in 10 years inflation will have made that amount worth less in real terms.

So my advice would be to look at a £310-a-month mortgage as being more like £500.  In the good times you can save the extra money (or get a flexible mortgage that allows you to pay off more each month than you're supposed to) to give you some cover for when the bad times come (and they will at some point in the life of a 20 year mortgage).",0,1363456912,null,0,false,0,c8wt8n3,t3_1aekva,t1_c8wt8n3,t1_c8wp2z1,null,1431605769,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The reason is simply that a tiny minority of morons come out to cause trouble, these people inspire borderline morons to join the pack mentality in causing trouble with minimal risk of consequence. This does spoil it somewhat for the law abiding masses yes granted, but realistically the alternative is large scale public disorder regularly.

Judgments are made based on experience and intelligence on whether a match is ""policed"" or not. My local club is only subject to ""policed"" matches when they're playing clubs with large followings of assholes.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I can see the logic in that. What irks me though, is it is irrespective of career, social contribution or earning potential. So for example, young professionals are often finding themselves stuck renting from blue collar tradesmen... people who were able to get hold of property cheap (even council houses on purchase schemes subsidised by the state!) and then use that to buy further properties to let.

So in the long term, although these youngsters actually have vastly better earning potential, they cannot get on the property ladder.

I don't see why one group of people should be **allowed** to buy up all the property, thanks to their age and the fact they hold property they can borrow against which was proportionally much cheaper when they acquired it in the 1980/90s. All the whilst, the other group are forced to rent from them. Its bad for several reasons;

* Most seriously the system is still open to Rachmanism style abuses, and we saw examples of that in London during the Olympics where tenants were driven out to make room for tourists paying more.

* People who don't own a property don't invest in it. Although landlords invest in a property, it is usually the bare minimum (i.e. crap cooker, cheap boiler, poor insulation etc.) If I owned the house I rent, I'd be doing all sorts of things to it - making it cheaper to heat and better for the enviornment... not to mention more comfortable to live in. Over time it's having a cumulative effect on the quality of the nations property. 

I really urge you to try and put yourself in the shoes of the mid-to-late 20s young professional tenant and try to empathise with how they must feel... it's a very uncertain future for them, as they wake up to the idea that they probably won't enjoy many of the luxuries their parents did/do, despite having better jobs.

The problem at the moment is that their lending rates are very low.

true,CinemaParadiso,english,England,"&gt;Perhaps in cases of severe disability.

You think it should be justified to people in cases of disability because they cannot work but not to people who cannot find work? (Bare in mind that you have already admitted that there must always be a certain level of unemployment and that people can not always find jobs without putting other people out of work)

&gt;People on welfare are rarely ashamed. Welfare is addictive and hard to get off, that's why it's called the 'welfare trap'.

Yes they are. You have no basis to say that. Welfare is hard to get off because in areas were welfare is high, unemployment is high and their are not alot of jobs that provide full-time long-time employment. As workers rights have diminished it has become easier for employers to employ people on a part-time basis and sack people quickly. This is why people who are on welfare often end up back on it after they get a job for a little while. That is the welfare trap, it's not because people find it addictive. 

&gt;I'm not a socialist, I believe in personal responsibility and not just giving people things. If you want food you can bloody well work for it.

Judging from this statement you don't no what socialism is. Also, my statement didn't suggest that people should not work, or have no personal responsibility. I suggest you read it again (or for the first time judging by your response)

&gt;The Police and Armed Forces defend the Realm against criminality, foreign attacks and maintaining law and order. Welfare doesn't defend anyone.

Why do the Armed Forces defend the state from foreign attacks? 

&gt;Putting money in the bank is investment.

This is your best reply yet seeing as the link you provided backed my definition up and dismissed yours! 

&gt;Survival of the fittest.

Then what is the point of the state?

&gt;Well when you start calling other people idiots you better expect to have your own intellect questioned. Don't play the victim card, falling back on dyslexia, because someone has called you out.
The worst part is that you continue to make the same spelling mistakes even after I've already pointed them out to you.


You didn't question my intellect, you questioned my spelling. Their is a difference. I was just explaining to you why my spelling is bad, because you brought it up. 

&gt;The worst part is that you continue to make the same spelling mistakes even after I've already pointed them out to you.

Do you realize that if i stopped making the same spelling mistakes even after you pointed them out to me that i would not be dyslexic? 

&gt;He who lives in a glass house shouldn't throw stones.

Like i said, you have not really questioned my intellect you have questioned my spelling. So your yet to throw a stone, nor prove i live in a glass house.

&gt;See, you're doing it again. You keep on throwing around personal attacks because you're not actually able to argue any other way. Mental retardation is not an excuse.

I apologize, that was personal. 

&gt;The police are there to maintain law and order, they thus treat people like adults

Why is maintaining law and order treating people like adults? Is that not what parents do at home, they make sure there kids do not get into stupid fights with each other and act as the judge,jury etc?

&gt;It is almost always their own fault.

Why?. I've explained in quite a detail way why it is not. now it's your turn. Back up your statements like i have.

&gt;Why is that our problem? Why should hard working people be forced to pay for the lazy, irresponsible and criminal?

Your not paying for the lazy, irresponsible and criminal, your paying for those who drew the short straw and were born into a different situation than you. You could quite have easily been born into that same position. Also, do not make the assumption that your wealth is a reflection of your character or if you are lazy or hard working. Also some other reasons: Compassion, humanity, creating a more pleasant world to live in, empathy, sympathy, kindness, altruism.

&gt; It's morally wrong to take money from one hard working group and give it to another lazy group.

But the one group cannot be described as hard working and the other cannot be described as Lazy. As soon as you take away those perjoritive terms your argument falls apart. 

Now, on a slightly different note. I've talked to you now for a while and i find your character very interesting. I don't want you to be offended or just take this as an insult, but i think you show signs of being a sociopath. Have you ever been told this before? have you ever considered it? Have you taken any tests?. If the answer is yes, then i would be really thankful if you would talk to a friend of mine on here since she has a keen interest in sociopath's (It's something she study's).

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"Public order management is actually quite an interesting subject. 

The primary objectives are to manage the flow of people and prevent violence. Take a football match, if fans all get to the turnstiles at the same time then you have a great big mass of people, and a rush through the crowd to get through the turnstiles could be disastrous. By managing crowds at an early stage you can manage this. 

One tactic used called the ""staggered filter cordon"" is deliberately designed to allow people to flow through but they are slowed down. This prevents a rush from building. 

The other problem is you do not want violence to break out. The best way of doing this is to keep the supporters of the two teams apart. Logistically this can be surprisingly difficult as fans will be travelling to the game by many different modes of transport, all of which must be taken in hand. Another consideration is police resources. You may have to to wait to move Team A supporters from the station to the ground whilst you wait for officers escorting Team B supporters from the bus stop to the ground, allow Team B to get into the ground then the officers can return to the train station, then transport team A across. This prevents the two factions meeting and allows you to manage your resources more effectively.

George Kennan, one of the principal architects of modern US doctrine, proposed that control of oil supply would give the US ""veto power"" over the military and industrial policies of it's rivals, then Japan. And guess what happened, following the war the US negotiated with the China to ensure that it would only supply oil to Japan through US companies. The United States controlled 90% of the oil imports into Japan. The companies may be privately owned, but the US government is the one with it's hand on the tap when it can implement an embargo against you and shut down your economy.

true,bacon_cake,null,null,"&gt;in case there's anyone on this subreddit that knows anything about duvets

My moment has come!

If you're looking for comfort you want a down duvet rather than a feather duvet. *Down* is the soft part of the feather as opposed to the quills, but because of their size you need a well constructed duvet with edge piping and compartments to stop leakage or the down piling up in one end. 

Goose feather is best - primarily because geese are vegetarian and their feathers don't smell, but there's also an argument that they're softer. Some people claim that the further East the geese come from the softer. Hence you'll see Siberian Goose Feathers at a higher premium than Hungarian Goose - although in my experience there's no difference.

A company I would recommend are *Snuggledown of Norway* (stocked by TK Maxx), their products last for years and are decent value, as does anything from The Duvet and Pillow Company.

A great alternative to down duvets are wool duvets (would 100% recommend http://www.devonduvets.com/ ) though they can be pricey. They are stocked occasionally by John Lewis but Selfridges run their lines too.

Here's a historical example: [Al-Andalus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus).

How about we instead ask are there or have there been any other nations based on religion which have been a serious problem? And the answer is, [most definitely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconquista). 

And perhaps we could then ask, are those problems caused by radical ideology? To which the answer is again, most definitely.

Finally we could ask the question, are nations founded on radical ideologies always a problem, and generally it seems history backs this up (insert obvious examples). On the other hand, some religion based nations have not been an issue (Al-Andalus, several Christian nations), so this points to the conclusion that extremism and radical ideology is the issue, not specifically Islam.

But we can continue the Islamophobic circlejerk if that's what turns you on.

Just challenge the belief and show them why it's wrong, then they might change their understanding of their religion to allow themselves to let that belief go. Then a modern Islam might develop that is more consistent with the modern west. Or they might start to turn away from it entirely.

* I will probably post it in the AFC forum, just so any redditors there know it exists - it would be hard to get people who don't already use reddit to up sticks and leave. 

* Make a weekly post in /r/soccer called something like ""League 2 Roundup courtesy of /r/LeagueTwo"". Would be effective at reminding or informing people we exist. We could do this on a Sunday maybe, but at a time when match threads don't dominate, so in the evening perhaps. We would need to establish a format and then have either one person commit to doing it or different individuals volunteer each week
* The hardest part will be retaining members over the summer break, but with some transfer news during the close season and a few big posts as the season kicks off then it should be fine.
* Create at least one match thread on Saturdays or Tuesdays when games are on. Pick a fixture in advance by discussion on Friday - if we're lucky we might be able to get someone posting from the ground as well as from TV or a text feed. 
* Themed posts for different days. As well as regular posts anyone can make have things like a Sunday results reaction thread, Monday with Player of the Week, Wednesday post with goal of the week, Thursday with something else (suggestions?) and Friday with banter/predictions. There could be monthly ones as well - contest mode posts for manager, player and team of the month.

true,honeko,null,null,"Again, for the most part, I think this article is complimentary to the way the show was honest in portraying casual racism throughout time and space, not attacking the writers for being racist. I also don't think the author was trying to say Martha's characterization was racist. Martha's character actually goes against prevalent stereotypes about people of color because she was an educated professional, etc. There's a difference between saying a character's personality and traits were written in a racist way and saying a character was placed into a racist situation. I don't think anyone could argue that Martha was a racist stereotype herself.

The problem I think the author is trying to convey about Martha is about the *role* she was so often put into with the Doctor. She was often taking care of him, which harkens back to the [Mammy stereotype](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mammy). Yes, all companions are in some ways subordinate to the Doctor, but it was marked in Martha and Ten's relationship. She had to take greater care of him than any other companion because he was so fragile from having lost Rose. Because he lost Rose he needed more emotional and other help and he was also especially unkind to the companion that was unable to ""replace"" Rose... to the point of being demeaning to Martha. 

I can see how this is perceived as a negative role for a woman of color to play, but I honestly think it just happened to be that the woman that had to put the Doctor together was of color. I don't think the writers were trying to pin Martha to this ""Mammy"" role. In every other sense, Martha does not represent a Mammy stereotype. She is educated, intelligent, independent, brave, and has a sense of agency. All of these traits culminated in the way she was able to leave the Doctor to preserve her dignity once she noticed that their relationship was never going to change. This is the opposite of the trope, in a positive way.

So, yes. On this point I disagree with the author. Yet, I don't think her critique is invalid. I have seen other people decry the noticeably pronounced servitude that Martha had for the Doctor and I don't really blame them for having such a view since Martha was even literally put into the role of the maid in one of the episodes. I just happen to think that all of Martha's other positive traits and accomplishments free her from the negative connotations of her role as the Doctor's caretaker.",0,1363471721,null,0,1363471976,0,c8wx8o0,t3_1aed07,t1_c8wx8o0,t1_c8wp8ce,null,1431607653,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1
