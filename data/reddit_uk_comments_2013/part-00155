Two Australian boys are walking around talking about a party they just got back from and their minds are beginning to wander so they try and look for something fun to do. They see an old tin mine around on the a hill and decide to go and break into what they think is an abandoned tin mine. The boys jump the fence and start exploring around; jumping on old machinery and basically just running a muck.  A security guard appears and chases the two boys, trying to catch them and lay charges for 'tress passing' on an abandoned tin mine. The boys are quite scared and the guard is hot on their trail when all of a sudden they hear a cry for help from the security guard. The boys turn around to see him being dragged down into the mine by a shadowy unknown creature. *Opening credits*

The TARDIS appears just out of the small outback town the boys are from. The doctor and Clara stand out and Clara questions the Doctor as to why they're in Australia. He explains eccentrically that where they are is fantastic and that near by there is a lake that is entirely pink and goes on to explain why the lake is pink. Little to Clara's knowledge the Doctor is lying and has been receiving distress calls from this area for quite some time but continues to just put it off, until now. Clara asks why they are really here, but before the Doctor can start they hear cries of help. They run to see what the commotion is all about.  The two boys are now running from something else, the security guards wife. She thinks that the boys have done something to her husband and that is why he has gone missing. The guard had called the police before he got carried away by the mysterious figure. The police and wife grab the boys and plan to cart them off for investigation, however the doctor intervenes, flashing his psychic paper and claiming himself as a detective or something along those lines. 

The Doctor and Clara follow many clues and talk to the boys from the mine who are still refusing to believe what they saw. Long story short the lake is pink because of Sea Devil activity and they plan to do something similar to what the Silurian's did but this time with much more detrimental effects and the loss of a life. Please elaborate on my story and ideas, its just an idea but I've dreamt about this before where me and my friend both acted as the boys and what not so it's a story that does resembled that of the series 5 Silurian story but you know it's just something I thought would be cool. Also an AUSTRALIAN STORY, it would be really cool and you could tie that in with Tegan from classic who as well. SO tell me what you think of my idea reddit, I don't mind what is said :)

true,rydleo,null,null,"Fair enough if that's your opinion, but I definitely disagree.  By all accounts of those that follow Spanish footie regularly they seem to agree that Aspas was a very shrewd signing and I tend to agree with that assessment.  Is he Messi?  No, but then again no one else is and he's quite good in his own right as well as he improves the first team and is able to play as striker in the event Sturridge is unavailable. Toure is clearly quality, albeit of the older variety, and is at least as good as Carra was.  Alberto is just a kid but I think an improvement on Shelvey.  If we had signed Tello people would be ecstatic but Alberto's record for Barca B is far superior to that of Tello when he played there which I think says something about him.

With regards to your original question, I have absolutely no concern whatsoever about us signing a 'big name' by whatever you consider that.  The squad we have is already much better than I think most give them credit for and as Brendan himself said:

 ""I am not necessarily looking for stars. I am looking for players who are hungry to become stars""

That's the way forward, in my opinion, and is really the Liverpool way.  We made Suarez a star, Torres a star, and many, many others before them and likely many after them.  What helps is support of our players, not people moaning about how they've never heard of them or they played Segunda so they must be bad.

It is stored both on the chip (for chip+PIN transactions) and on the bank's systems (ATM transactions). This is why the bank is able to send you a PIN reminder through the post. This is also why the only way to change/unlock your PIN is at your bank's ATM (and not any other bank's ATM): the machine can simultaneously reprogram the chip with the new PIN whilst also contacting the bank to update it on their systems.

Courier scammers usually target vulnerable people, in particular the elderly, who tend to be more gullible when it comes to new technology. And, yes, when you're 80 years old chip+PIN is a new thing.

Doesn't solve it as much as you'd think. You can put in place all the security systems in the world but the weak link is always the people. 

At the bank I work for we require customers to use card readers to authenticate payments through online banking. This prevents fraudsters from being able to take all their money by obtaining their password through a simple phishing scam.

You'd think this would be enough, but no: fraudsters will now call the customer pretending to be a well known company - Sky appears to be a popular choice - telling the customer they are due a refund but they need to use the card reader to receive the payment. They will then get the customer to operate the card reader and read out the code it generates while on the other end of the line the frauster is inputting the code into online banking and emptying out the account.

Some (cold, heartless individuals) might say that if someone is stupid enough to do this they deserve to be ripped off. However thanks to an FSA ruling in 2009 the onus is on the bank to compensate customers in almost all cases if they have been defrauded. The only cases that get routinely rejected now are the ones where the customer admits they kept the PIN with the card, as this demonstrates that they have failed to meet their obligation to take reasonable steps to protect their PIN.",0,1375157278,null,0,false,0,cbd32wu,t3_1ja128,t1_cbd32wu,t1_cbcljuz,null,1430044849,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People are now heavily promoting Keynesianism again, so we may swing back to State capitalism assuming this recession is as long as predicted and the recovery as painful and slow as they're suggesting.  The usual path is that capital waits out periods when it perceives that risks are too high or returns are too low, driving labour which has limited access to the means of life to become desperate enough to forego benefits and accept lower wages.  When that makes investing attractive again, the whole cycle starts again.  This time though, the level at which labour in the West becomes a competitive again, in most fields and sectors, is way below cost of living in those places, because competition is global.  So all bets are off for this recovery - unless you want Chinese/Indian standards of living.

Look at Norwich for example, who have brought in players like  Wolfswinkel and Hooper, this isn't a big spending club, they're just taking advantage of the increased revenue and making sure they can tread water.  The league will be tougher next year, and if we want to really climb the table, we'll have to continue to beat those teams like Norwich and Sunderland who will be very much improved from last year.  We can't just worry about the teams above us.

(Sheffield has a bit of a bad rep as being an old and ugly industrial city, but the centre and the south-west side are actually really nice and green.) Manchester is also definitely worth a visit as it's pretty much the happeningest place in the North of England, although I'm sure Newcastle-types would take issue with me there ;)

In terms of rural sightseeing, the Yorkshire Dales are not to be missed, as well as the Peak District further south (technically in Derbyshire but really closer to Sheffield). There's a really nice train journey from Sheffield to Manchester via the Hope Valley, which has lots of little villages with nice country walks and things surrouding them. Chatsworth House is also nice (and definitely very Downton Abbey-like), although I've only ever been to the grounds myself as it's quite expensive to get in.

If you're feeling like you might like a bit of sea, Whitby is (as far as I remember) a pretty nice place, and they do excellent fish and chips what with their being on the coast and all.

And if you're feeling like you might want to go a bit further afield, of course there's always London down south (although I have to say I'm not a fan), but I wouldn't recommend going in hot weather as it can get pretty baking down there. Also, Edinburgh is a lovely, picturesque city -- if you go, be sure to walk the Royal Mile to see Holyrood and the castle.

One episode is sufficient to be diagnostic of depression, the key thing is that its more than just 'feeling sad'.  The technical criteria that GPs should be using are


Key symptoms:

* persistent sadness or low mood;and/or
* loss of interests or pleasure
* fatigue or low energy
* at least one of these, most days, most of the time for at least 2 weeks


if any of above present, ask about associated symptoms:

* disturbed sleep
* poor concentration or indecisiveness
* low self-confidence
* poor or increased appetite
* suicidal thoughts or acts
* agitation or slowing of movements
* guilt or self-blame


the 10 symptoms then define the degree of depression and management is based on the particular degree:

* not depressed (fewer than four symptoms)
* mild depression (four symptoms)
* moderate depression (five to six symptoms)
* severe depression (seven or more symptoms, with or without psychotic symptoms)

symptoms should be present for a month or more and every symptom should be present for most of every day

&gt;The United Kingdom – United States of America Agreement (UKUSA, /juːkuːˈsɑː/ ew-koo-SAH)[1][2] is a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence between the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The alliance of intelligence operations is also known as Five Eyes (FVEY). It was first signed in March 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States and later extended to encompass the three Commonwealth realms of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The UKUSA Agreement was a follow-up of the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, the World War II agreement on cooperation over intelligence matters.[3] This was a secret treaty, allegedly so secret that it was kept secret from the Australian Prime Ministers until 1973.[citation needed]

The agreement established an alliance of five English-speaking countries for the purpose of sharing intelligence, especially signals intelligence. It formalized the intelligence sharing agreement in the Atlantic Charter, signed in 1941, before the entry of the U.S. into the conflict.[4]&gt;",0,1375167766,null,0,false,0,cbd5zse,t3_1j9455,t1_cbd5zse,t1_cbcsc96,null,1430043490,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In terms of outlay to get started though, pretty low to get started I would have thought - not like you need premises or anything, just some stock.

If you want to start a business to make money, I would learn SEO (search engine optimisation). Your startup costs are small - business cards, cost of some cold calls to get business, a stylish suit if you don't have one already for client meetings, and maybe a couple of weeks of your time to read about SEO, play with all the plugins etc, get a feel for your process. Anyway, the good thing is, you don't even need to know web design - I reckon you could hand over reports which detail the work which needs to be done to a website, and then get paid.

The one thing I'm assured of under BR's transfer regime is that each incoming player, whether cheap or pricey, marquee or unknown, will serve a specific function in the squad, and will only be bought if we feel that the price is commensurate to the player's talent and potential. This doesn't preclude spending big either, as all signs pointed to the fact that we were willing to pay up to 25m for Mkhitaryan, which is actually more than Dortmund eventually paid.

As far as your first statement goes, there is plenty of objectifying material aimed at women that do the same for men. How many women have wanked to Captain Jack Sparrow? Let's not forget trashy romance novels. They portray an idealistic image of men, not to mention unrealistic images of sex in general. 

Now do not get me wrong, I am no MRA, however I think when it comes to human sexuality it is a more complex issue. When you watch a porn film, who is being objectified? The women? The men? Both? Human beings are sexual beings. We fantasize and that is perfectly natural. Now if these women were being forced to pose for the pictures I would be just as outraged as anyone else, however their involvement is consensual. 

Let's look at the rights of people to express their sexuality. My relationship with my fiance is a F/m D/s relationship. He is my submissive. Now is it objectifying to men everywhere when I force him to strip, put a collar on him and make him sit on the floor at my feet when I study? No, because it is consensual and we are both happy with our dynamic. What about exhibitionists that get off on being looked at, watched, wanked to, whatever? Should they not be allowed to express their sexuality because it is seen as objectifying to some people? What about gay porn? Is this objectifying because there are no women in it? Lesbian porn? Is that objectifying to women? My point is that it is fantasy, and sexuality is a complex and beautiful thing. It should not be limited or based on the morals of any other person, unless of coarse the activity and images are non-consensual. As long as women want to be photographed and seen in those magazines, it should be ok for them to do so.

2. Changing the Doctor's gender to female.

3. Making the female companion *more* powerful than the Doctor.

Yes he left on a sour note, but he was one of the most entertaining striker that I've seen in a red shirt.

He both he and Gerrard have past their prime fitness levels. Both have lost their burst of pace that made them so effective in seasons past. Gerrard has, in a sense, reinvented himself to great affect. Playing a deeper playmaker role, resulting in fewer classic Gerrard penetrating runs, but more pinpoint long passes.


What can Torres do to stay relevant? What does Mourinho need to do to get the best out of him? He still has some pace, so he could still fit into Mourinho's fast break set up. But that confidence, heck arrogance, to finish that he had at Liverpool comes and goes. With Chelsea looking at Rooney and other alternatives, is the Torres show over or has he proven he still has something left after his performance at the confed?

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Competition is not for a better service though, its purely for profit. Any better service is should be seen by product of this fact, it is not a necessary component of the model. Furthermore, a lack of diversity in the firms operating these services means that you will have a limited spectrum of solutions to problems; businesses are set up in different ways and are more or less flexible to solving problems. The individuals that work for them may also have huge differences as well as management culture etc etc.

By only putting contracts out to tender for similar large firms you get one kind of management that has formed as a local optimal solution to generating profit, not an optimum solution for improving services. A lack of diversity means that when changes in the environment occur it becomes very difficult to adapt, large firms may exist but this only makes matters worse in terms of service improvement because you just have monopolies. Basically when companies are too big the entire idea of a free market system for improving services breaks down because you end up with two or three companies that can compete on price, they suck up all the expertise and then use any means possible (legal activities, illegal spying, corporate sabotage, lobbying government, corrupting officials) to ensure that they maximise their profit.

Limiting the size and scale of companies as well as not allowing companies to own other companies would actually improve market diversity.

No, I believe morality has defined what is legally right and wrong, through several hundred years of evolution of the Scottish legal system via a process of judicial review and case history.

&gt;what other criminals on life sentences are you campaigning for compassionate release for? aren't there any with cancer? 

I'm not campaigning for anyone, I didn't campaign for this one. I'm *explaining* this one, because you don't seem to understand why it happened.

&gt;Compassionate release means despite your guilt and legal obligation to serve a life sentence we are going to release you because you are ill.

'Life' sentences rarely actually mean life, but yes, people are often released so they don't have to die in Prison. There are a few cases every year.

&gt; Compassion means sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others; such as the 259 victims and their families which was not demonstrated by the scottish government throughout this shameful affair. 

The victims and their families are not served by making others suffer. Compassionate release is about what we are, not what the guilty are.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I think it is impossible to tell. There is so much mud in the water that you really aren't going to get a clear answer regardless of how long you look at it. 

&gt;What do we know?

Bale is signed to a long contract and thus the ball is in spurs court. The player would have to hand in an x-fer request to weaken the clubs position, no reliable sources have implied this is even remotely close to happening.

Real Madrid are seriously interested in Bale, enough so that they have been very open with their intentions to sign him in the media. 

&gt;What can we imply

Levy has been using the fact that Bale wears lilly white as leverage in conversation. Both AVB and Paulinho have noted to the media that they were told Bale was staying, both had an opportunity to move away (or not to) spurs this summer.

Madrid, knowing that a Bale x-fer request is about the only way to force Levy's hands are attempting to unsettle the player via Marca. Pulling shit like setting aside the 11 jersey, printing possible salaries and straight up inventing quotes in an attempt to unsettle Bale.

&gt; My additional thoughts

I hate football agents. They are suppose to protect the interests of their client but most of the time just hunt a massive agent fee. Deals have fallen through (or almost fallen through) due to agents demanding stupid fees, Aspas to Liverpool being the most recent example.
One would have to imagine that Bale's agent will make a heap of money off the back of the 'biggest x-fer in history of sports', in my opinion he will be a snake through all this and try push for a move for his own pockets. 

Bale leaving would be more than just Bale leaving. It is the end of free advertising on billboards in the U.S., the end of advertising on FIFA 14, arguably less EPL coverage as the club is less attractive, the end of pulling names like Paulinho, unsettling of other star players like Lloris and Vertonghen, arguably the end of AVB etc. What I am saying is that I think Spurs would be stupid to let go of Bale unless it was for a ludicrous amount of money and possibly even players. If we can't replace his on field ability nor his media attention then I don't think we should sell. Perez has said himself that galacticos pay for themselves, well Bale is at this level and if managed correctly will pay for himself next year.

Hopefully he's given him the same deal as Modric: ""one more season: no CL and we'll let you leave"". He's probably also hoping to convince Gaz to stay another year after that if we make CL, and maybe push for the title.

Unless Real offer to pay for our new stadium, surrounding infrastructure and a couple of good players to replace Bale, I don't think he'll sell.

Also, a lot of people seem to be unable to grasp the concept of a transfer request, ""request"" being the important part. Even if Bale hands in a request it doesn't mean Levy has to accept it. Look at Lewandowski.

I gave it another shot:

Firstly murder is premeditated killing of another human being.

&gt; I make that 1154 violent deaths of interest to the police which would in the US be reported as murders

If they would be reported as murders then that's the mistake of the US. Trying to alter our stats to fit their mistake seems to be a strange why of doing it. Why didn't he alter the US stats to find the number of real murders and compare that way?

Her: Mommy, why are the women on those magazines not wearing any cloths?

Me: They are wearing bikinis

Her: Yea. I bet they think they are sexy

Me: Yea those magazines are full of pictures like that

Her: How come?

Me: For people that want to see pictures of women dressed up like that

Her: They don't think that they can't be sexy without dressing like that do they?

Me: Nah I doubt it. They get paid to do pictures, they don't just walk around in town in bikinis.

Her: Yea. I don't think girls have to dress like that to be sexy. I think it's more important to be smart. They won't be able to dress like that when they are old ladies.

Me: Well, I think your right, it is much more important to be smart and develop your mind. But if they want to dress like that when they are old ladies they can.

Her: (uncontrollable giggling) Old ladies should not wear stuff like that! They will be all wrinkly!

Me: (also giggling quite a bit at this point) Yep but that's their right. People can wear what they want. I don't tell you that you can't wear your Dragon Ball Z t-shirt because it isn't girly enough do I?

Her: (now very serious) My Dragon Ball Z t-shirt is the best shirt ever. 

Me: I agree, it's awesome. And you can wear it all you want, but other people can wear what they want too. Even if they want to dress as a banana every day.

Her: I wish more people would dress like bananas in town

Me: Me too sweetie.

Her: Can I go look at the books?

Me: Sure, just stay by the books where I can see you ok?

Her: Ok :)

This concludes the one and only conversation I have had with my daughter about lad's mags. They didn't seem to effect her self-image or self-esteem. I think the kids are going to be just fine. Laws like this are simply for people who either underestimate how well kids understand things if you just talk to them about it, or are just uncomfortable with acknowledging that sex exits and don't want to have to have those conversations with their kids.

Rest of economy remains crappy, record numbers of people default. Everyone ends up paying for an inflated housing market through tax, but the housing market crashes anyway. 

If the government are going to spend money, it needs to be invested in creating further affordable supply, not providing people with help to buy overpriced housing.

true,Ginto_Maldari,eng-lancashire,"Lancashire, Blackpool","As a 18 year old resident who heavily likes trains, I also think central station being closed to have stopped a form of tourism and freight being accessible.

I also can't find a decent job, made worse by me having aspergers and panic attacks when I think of working in heavy populated shops like primark, my first and only job (and cause of my anxiety)

There is currently nothing that jobseekers will do to at least offer support to social anxiety sufferers, e.g. Offer a minimum wage job working somewhere simple.

I'm starting to feel depressed. I don't mean to be egotistical but me and my girlfriend look 10x better than all of Blackpool too. We dont spray tan, we aren't dicks to everyone we meet (we'd rather avoid having to talk), were the right people in the wrong place.

This council has done nothing to help. If I could get them to do one thing it would to bring more.industry to Blackpool and replace certain buildings with more useful stuff. What the hell is that building beside central car park? It looks horrendous. It should be replaced, it's been there since central STATION was built, maybe before.

I live right beside central drive. It's nice (sometimes. Except for when hundreds of football fans threaten to stab me and I'm just trying to get from bispam college on a bike back home) but they don't seem to care about us a right lot.

I want the promenade to stop being 'improved'. IT'S FINE. Just improve the shops, take down crazy stupid old buildings that are half empty and decaying badly, more support for students and those with personal issues, and stop being overall jackasses.

I upvote your comment :)
//rant over

Also, I have only just woke up, and typed this on the phone (well this sentence is on my computer), so my hand hurts very much and I was tired, so apologies if any of this doesn't make sense.

There are also not enough full-time jobs available in blackpool for graduates.
The part-time jobs (which I want) that are available are few and far between, there doesn't seem to be one place they congregate to post advertisements for jobs. Blackpool council need to put a website up purely for Blackpool jobs and should order or advise every shop owner to advertise jobs on the website.

Fizzy Jerkz. They were these hard-chewy boiled sweet things from Wonka shaped like bottlecaps which you seemed to only find in newsagents and sport centre vending machines. They disappeared sometime around 2002 and there has been nothing like the since.


Fruitang, the fruit WITH THE ANG. They were like Chewits but with sour sugar crystals in them. Orange, apple and strawberry flavour, I believe. 


Cheesy Niknaks. They were the only flavour I liked and they got rid of them. I found some Crunchy Cheetos in Japan which were different from the usual American ones and tasted just like them. Cost something like £3.50/400g bag, totally worth it.

Miniature Polos, in the giant Polo-shaped plastic pack. Orange Polos. The weird Werthers-like caramel/butterscotch Polos. They were going nuts at one point and they were all good.  Holy crap I totally forgot about the citrus ones!


Mint Skittles. Buttermint or whatever it was tasted just like humbug toffee, and the cool mint ones actually tasted different to peppermint and spearmint.

On the other hand, his silence for me also proves that everything Marca has been reporting is absolute garbage. If he really was so furiously demanding a move as they seem to imply, he'd have come and out said something. As has been pointed out here numerous times, all actual quotes from him point to being perfectly happy to play here next year, and I believe they did come after Marca's campaign began earlier in the summer, so its not like he wasn't aware of the interest at the time. Why would he have suddenly decided now that a bigger bid (which, he would not get any of the money of) has *supposedly* been offered that he had to leave right away?

Finally, even if he does demand a transfer, I can't see us doing anything about it. Selling him now, no matter what the amount of money, is essentially kissing goodbye to the champions league. We certainly wouldn't make it this year, with basically no one left in the market that would come in here. It would upset squad members like Paulinho who said right away playing with Bale was one of the things he was looking forward to. Even if we managed to finish 5th, its another season away from the Champions League and unless someone pulled something really special this season we'd be without any true star names, leaving us as an even less appealing transfer destination next year. Selling him, no matter for how much money, at this point, would be an absolute disaster, and the club knows it.

As for the quality of studying at the OU - it is next to none. The materials are brilliant, the support is far more than you'd expect and the whole thing really supports those getting back in to study.

The cons, of course, are - to do it all right and good, you need to fucking seriously sort your time out. If you are not yet the kind of person that finishes a task early so you have free time afterwards, you will need to find that in you or you're going to have a bad time. Mmkay?

Also, as a final piece: I have just been accepted in to one of the top 50 universities in the country, having only a good reference and one (relatively high scoring) OU module under my belt. OU credits can be transferred to full time courses and are actually a great indication that you have your head screwed on.

I hate people getting in trouble for vague threats to the world at large as a joke, or simply making jokes in poor taste.

That being said, I think directly messaging someone puts you past the reasonable grounds of making a joke, and you get what you deserve if the police come to your door. If you sent that as a text message or a letter you'd be in an equal amount of shit.

Of course, it's likely that the rules/laws put in place will overspill into my first category that shouldn't get in trouble. This is where it gets difficult.

Many years ago I crashed my car.

Whilst I was arrange a tow truck to come and pick up my car a Police area car drove past and stopped, I explained what happened, he breathalyzed me (totally clean just standard procedure) and arranged for an ambulance to come to the scene and check me over (again nothing wrong just procedure).

The police officer also stated that he was happy that I hadn't damaged the road or barriers in any way that would lead to the council claiming costs from me for repair - they also count as a 3rd party in accidents / insurance. Whilst talking with him I stated that even though I had Full Comprehensive insurance (which he'd already checked along with valid tax &amp; mot for the car) I wouldn't be notifying my insurance or making a claim to have them repair the car, the officer was fine with that - as stated he'd already satisfied himself that there was no 3rd party involved and no case to prosecute me.

In short, if you're absolutely sure there's no 3rd party that might be able to claim (including the local council claiming to replace a streetlight or sign, etc) then I wouldn't notify my insurance company.

Exercising prudence online, and even developing a bit of a thicker skin, are by no means bad suggestions as a stop gap until we figure out the best way to combat abusive behaviour online.

Then why do you suggest the police get involved?

Would you suggest that a pub landlord not intervene if one of his customers was being verbally threatened with rape? Is that just a job for the police? Is it free speech and a bit of banter up until the point the perpetrator pulls a knife, holds it to her throat and drags her into the toilet? Is it not in the landlords interest to provide a safe environment for all his customers? Does the philosophical argument of free speech win out when it forces people away, silences them and stiffles the debate so that some spoddy little cunt is at 'liberty' to tell people he disagrees with that he's going to rape their mouths shut?

Energy production in the UK is in crisis, this is not related to fracking or our individual production of oil, it's to do with the availability of power generators. We don't have enough power stations.

Between 2004 and 2010 alone there was a reduction in the UK's power generation by **34%** - we're only making 2/3 the power now that we were in 2004, or at least that was the case in 2010, with an increase in shut downs and virtually no building of power plants going on it's quite possibly an even higher reduction.

Imports (of nuclear power from France) are up by 420%, but even the Frenchies can't necessarily provide us with 100% of what we need.

People in the UK need to understand that **we do not have enough power stations** and if we want to keep the lights on we're going to have to basically just plough on ahead and build some new nuclear power stations and a buttload of expensive gas power stations (because we weren't building nukes 10 years ago when we should have been).",0,1375186065,null,0,false,0,cbd8wxd,t3_1jc3uj,t1_cbd8wxd,t1_cbd6zgx,null,1430042127,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

I often wonder if the people who design cycleways actually use them; judging from some of the bizarre configurations I've seen in Glasgow, I'm guessing not.

The points raised in this ""code"" are interesting, particularly with regards to cycling on pavements.  In my experience, it's not something that I actually see a lot of, to be honest.  However, here in Glasgow, many of the designated cycle routes run on unsegregated, shared use paths, were pedestrians and bikes are expected to co-exist.  There are signs indicating this fact, but I suspect, based on the amount of poisonous looks and verbal abuse I get when using them, that many pedestrians are ignorant of this fact.  I wonder if this situation adds to the perception that cyclists are illegally using footways?

Fellow cyclists ignoring red lights is a real bugbear of mine, as it makes it easier for the ""anti-bike"" types to point fingers.

Well, first-off, I would completely disagree with that, and I'm sure if you think about it a little, you do too.

But secondly, that is not what we were talking about. I asked why the OP was reluctant to add the NSFW/NSFL tag, especially as it was requested (and my request was upvoted a couple times).

Simply stating that ""your boss probably wouldn't freak out"" is not any kind of answer to my question, so when I re-iterated my question, your reply about ""it's factual, therefore no NSFW needed"" is still not an answer to my original question.

Now, perhaps *I* phrased my original question badly, so I will re-phrase - Is there some particular reason why a user would be hesitant to add an NSFW/NSFL tag to a post following an (upvoted) request from a fellow forum-member?

Finally, I agree 100% that if we were in verbal conversation I probably might have followed your ""yet it is a fact that makes it safe for work"", but in a written conversation, inflection, intonation, does not come out by magic - that's one of the reasons grammar is so much more important in written language.

true,PirateMud,eng-Bedfordshire,Bedfordshire,"Ok, so I was hired as a trainee electro-mechanical engineer. That was the job title. I went to college one day a week, and the council (when it came to paying council tax) did not consider me to be an Apprentice (which would have invalidated my claim and I would never have even made it).

Ok, so my boss was paying me £4.77p/h (37.5hr week, albeit one day was sending me to college to do a - completely unrelated, but I'll get to that - electronic eng HNC) until I raised the issue of minimum wage (which at the time was £4.98p/h). First job, didn't know my rights, yada yada I should have mentioned it a lot earlier, fair play. This worked out to something like £115/month under what I should have been paid so about £1400 less for the disputed time period.

I mentioned this about 2 months after I failed the college course (you try to learn EE while simultaneously doing a full time technical job in something completely unrelated) and he repaid me the stuff I was owed from a pay rise I was meant to get 3 months into the job (which still came out to under min wage) and then a further rise from when the college course failed to essentially whenever I stopped working there, which took me (finally) up to minimum wage.

Anyway, the entire time I was being paid less than minimum wage but was still in college, he was paying me as if I was entitled to the *bullshit* Apprenticeship minimum wage of £2.65p/h when I was actually entitled to £4.98p/h ([a] I was not on apprenticeship course, [b] I was trained for maybe a month before maintaining equipment on site as a full time service engineer (per se - the companies I was going out to work for weren't aware that I was a ""trainee""), and [c] the Council didn't give my Dad a deduction on his council tax due to me being an apprentice, which means I wasn't an apprentice). So my claim was worth about £650 after the other discrepancies (if his maths was valid, which it wasn't due to it being sub minimum wage) were paid off.

Now here's the rub, and where my case was killed by the Judge (actually female. Resembled a mixture between your grandmother and Judge Judy. Luckily there wasn't an audience...) - when I resigned my former employer paid me a month's pay in lieu of notice, as in, he paid me to work to the end of December while I basically didn't have to come in to work at all that month. This meant that the total he paid me was greater than the statutory minimum that he should have paid me. My point rested on the fact he would have paid that month regardless, and he should have paid the rest at minimum wage anyway during the time I was there.

She said she saw my point, and the rest is of course in my original comment.

As others have said, yes. Getting paid in cash is legal. Whether or not the way *you* are being paid in cash is legal, we cannot tell.

&gt; When I turn 18 I'm entitled to a (marginally) increased pay. But how would I go about getting the rise if she didn't give it to me? As far as I know I don't have a formal contract with her, so there's nothing saying I'm actually employed by her.

Unless your employer has told you that you will receive a pay rise, you are not entitled to one until the 1st of October 2013, as outlined in other comments.

&gt; Similarly, my boss agreed verbally to pay me for school holidays where I would usually work. However because I was away on the last day of the term when I would usually work, she didn't pay me for the holidays. This isn't the first time either, I'm pretty sure she's underpaid me by about £50 total. Is there anything I can do about that?

Were you away on holiday, or away sick? Some employers will not pay you your holiday entitlement if you take a sickie the day before or the day after, because they believe that you are using your sick days as an extension of holiday.

If you are certain that you are being underpaid, start keeping a timesheet. Note down which hours you work, on what days, and keep a log of every single penny you have earned. If what you are paid then does not match your calculations, ask to speak with your boss and have her explain the difference to you.

&gt; What rights am I actually entitled to? I know the minimum wage and whatnot but is there things I should be aware of that most 17 year olds would be clueless about?

The very first thing you must be aware of is the Citizen's Advice Bureau. They can answer all your legal questions, offer advice in financial matters, and help you find help if you ever get into bother.

http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/

Too many people seem unaware of the CAB, so look into them and if you have further concerns about your employer, make an appointment and talk through your issues with a CAB advisor. They can point you in the right direction if they find they cannot help you themselves.

Also check out this page on their website:

http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/work_e/work_rights_at_work_e/basic_rights_at_work.htm

Mostly, though, *never work without a written, signed contract*. A contract is your largest form of protection, and without one you may not even be aware of your employer's policies on holiday, sick leave, and other items.

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","&gt;Any idea what would happen if they couldn't import enough

When supply is lower than demand? Rationing.

Traditionally, the National Grid used to implement [brownouts](http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-brownout.htm), which is a large-scale version of the primary school experiment where you connect lots of lightbulbs to a battery in series, and they all go dim. An intentional brownout is deliberately dropping everybody's supplied mains electricity below our usual 230 volts to conserve power, hence 'brownout' for the colour the lightbulbs went. 

That worked well in times like the 1970s oil shocks, when houses generally only had simple appliances like bulbs and heaters that can easily deal with unreliable voltages. But in the 21st century, it'd play merry hell with anything electronic and complicated, from alarm clocks to TV sets to computers to industrial equipment - possibly even starting fires as nobody knows how most cheap, nasty consumer appliances built by an anonymous combination of the lowest Far Eastern bidders, that may or may not always fully meet safety standards, would react - so these days, intentional brownouts are very, very unlikely to be used in the UK. 

Instead, National Grid engineers faced with too little supply to keep the country going these days would deploy [rolling blackouts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout), which is basically where different areas take turns at having full 230v power for a few hours and then the power's cut to supply somewhere else. This continues indefinitely until the supply increases, or demand drops. These are common in the Third World, where work has to be scheduled around the power timetables unless you're lucky enough to own a fuel-guzzling generator - and most experts think regular peak rolling blackouts are inevitable within ten years in the UK, because we have loads of old stations scheduled to shut down and still very little planned to replace them. We should have been building ten years ago to prevent a gap, and *still* nothing is being done.

Privatisation, woo-hoo. Hey, maybe it'll be good for us, kids will read books and play outside for a few hours in the evening? TV becomes unpopular, nationalisation becomes less of a dirty word, useless corporations are taken out of the country's essential assets. Walking and cycling become essential to daily life with the inevitable panic forcing (technically, unrelated) fuel prices dramatically upwards, going a long way towards solving urban traffic and obesity problems.

(OK, I'm fantasising blindly now. Heck, if you really want to dream idly, maybe preserved steam engines would make a brief reappearance on long-distance railways if things got bad enough - since we still have lots of UK coal but are rapidly running out of power stations to burn it in, lines are being electrified, and old diesel trains are getting rapidly retired for scrap without the preservation movement that's kept plenty of steam engines in great condition.)

And the political pressure to properly fix the situation will eventually kick in, once it's far too late to avoid at least a few years of rolling blackouts every evening. People will wake up to this quite quickly once it's finally started happening. Heartbreakingly, that means people will inevitably die (mostly the vulnerable: winter cold on a far bigger scale, overworked emergency generator failures in hospitals, badly set-up medical equipment in the homes of the sick and disabled, and maybe even traffic lights abruptly going dark on fast junctions...) for lack of electricity, and nobody's prepared to do something *today* to stop that happening.

As for what happens when it first hits the public consciousness: lots of outrage, lots of hot air in the House of Commons, lots of hand-wringing and denial from the privatised power companies and a bailed-out-bankers-style total failure to hold anybody to account for how the situation was allowed to get that bad.

I think the idea is that there are no rules. Anyone with a bigger gun can come in and rule (Chelsea or Man City) and its just a free for all. 

Tampering (tapping up) might as well be legal. Even baseball players have a very strict frame work on when players can hit free agency and have very little power over when they are traded. And that is because the American sports have gone through massive labor fights over implementing structure and rules that simply do not exist in Europe.

Having been a Londoner my entire life, I have commuted since going to secondary school from zone 2 to zone 1 in the city.

I don't remember it being any slower with paper tickets. And why would it be? The machine read the ticket in under a second. Same as with Oyster cards. The hold up was generally with tourists. As it is now. Purchasing took around the same time (excepting online purchases admittedly). 

According to wiki, the contract with the suppliers for operating alone cost £1.1 billion over 17 years (according to wiki). I could not find any figures for how much the actual infrastructure cost. I wouldn't be that surprised if it was in a similar ball park. Bearing in mind that these are (again IMO) completely unnecessary costs for a system that isn't very well run, that is a lot of money. Admittedly I do not know the cost of installing and maintaining Oyster machines vs maintaining existing ticket machines (which anyway still exist).

Please do show me the link that illustrates Oyster cards being more efficient  as I would be interested to see. It was clear that they had their heart set on Oyster from the beginning though. For all sorts of reasons. IMO. 

1) They could fire all the troublesome unionised staff.
2) They could collect a nice database of journeys, personal data etc (not entirely opposed to all of this as it could make the system more efficient. Not entirely sure that tfl, tubelines et al can be trusted though). 
3) Oyster allows tfl to collect millions in fines from ""incomplete"" journeys. And then from the ""help"" lines etc. Not to mention millions in ""deposits"" for cards that are never returned. 
4) Allowed bus travel to become markedly more expensive (way out of line with inflation) in many short journey circumstances. 
5) Allowed people without Oyster cards to be exploited massively (ever had to get a night bus, where there are no Oyster top up machines available?

The Oyster prices were arbitrary in the sense that they were made cheaper than the paper tickets they were replacing without regard to the extra cost of the system being installed. In other words an incentive to take them up for their own sake..",0,1375193724,null,0,false,0,cbdatkc,t3_1jcaaq,t1_cbdatkc,t1_cbdabih,null,1430008410,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,Wedgeface,,WGDAFC,"Was at the game myself, the website makes the performance sound a bit better than it was. Leeds were dominant from the start but Shelbourne are bottom of the LOI Premier division here so it was never going to be competitive. Austin ran the show, with Hunt and Smith always looking dangerous. Zac Thompson was the best of the youngsters, played at right back for 70 minutes then moved into the centre of the park for the final 20. Looked really confident on the ball and was always pushing forward. 

Just wondering if anyone has seen any of the other friendlies. We played a very narrow 4-1-2-1-2, with the full backs providing the width. Mowatt and Hall played pretty good. Hall kind of dipped in and out of the game, could have sealed his hat trick close to the end after taking on about 4 players but shot over. Dawson was a mixed bag, seems very quiet and underhit a whole load of passes, looked really funny standing next to Smith though :)

Austin and Hunt seem to get on well together, they linked up great with Thompson and sliced through the defence constantly. Although they won't be given as much space as that in the league. 

Smith is a constant danger, feed him with crosses and he will score, don't know how he didn't last night, keeper made a great save and he missed from six yards as Hunt got a touch just before he dove onto the ball, probably put him off. He got two assists though, good performance :)

Dear Mr Prime 

Thank you for contacting us.

I understand you were unhappy a trail for the 50th anniversary episode of ‘Doctor Who’ was shown at Comic Con.

This was an exclusive Comic Con trailer, made especially for the ‘Doctor Who’ 50th panel and it has not been released in the US. This world famous international event is an established platform used by all of the major producers. UK fans can look forward to exclusive content over the next few months.

Nevertheless, I’d like to assure you that I’ve registered your concerns on our audience log. This is a daily report of audience feedback that's made available to many BBC staff, including members of the ‘Doctor Who’ team, the BBC Executive Board and other senior managers. 

The audience logs are seen as important documents that can help shape decisions about future programming and content.

Thanks again for taking the time to get in touch.

Kind Regards

Is this the mark of dodgy journalism you're drawing our attention to, or is it an anti-Luddite spiel?  'Cos we've heard the latter before many many times.  How important efficiency is, how it'll make goods cheaper, how we can focus on producing things where we have a comparative advantage...ooh, or is it competitive advantage now?  Since we know if the US had followed the free market rhetoric back then, they'd still be focussed on selling furs and cotton!  

Anyway, of course technology can be used for good, to give people more freedom and more comfortable lives.  The problem is that, under capitalism, it almost never is, it's used to squeeze more profits out for capital.  We work longer hours than ever where workers haven't fought - sometimes to the death but always with blood - to share in the gains, the vast majority of increases in efficiency go to the least valuable, least productive parts of the production equation.

Your first paragraph describes free trade, and indeed it is true that almost all nations have engaged in protectionism so modern cries for free trade in developing nations seem bizarre as history suggests it will harm them, not help them despite the economic theories.

But that has nothing to do with the ability of technology to ameliorate the necessity of human labour.

As for the rest of your post I generally agree. I'm in favour of moving the economy towards a model based on co-operatives as then everyone gains from the increased productivity brought about and so like you say it can perhaps one day be a leisure based society.

But more importantly it is possible to move towards that goal by establishing co-operatives which then trade preferentially with one another to build up a powerful trading bloc, and can really compete with the traditional companies. (They don't have to pay idle shareholders etc. for one thing)

They managed it in the Spanish Civil War before they were destroyed by the jaws of the Nazis and the Soviets and the inaction of the Capitalists. Indeed, Mondragon is still successful now.

It's bizarre to think how few people actually perform truly necessary work - and if the work is not necessary then is it worth this current system that keeps people working most of their lives from cradle to grave?

I have to study Machine Learning as part of my PhD and it's amazing the amount of things that even if it can't outright remove the need for humans, it could greatly reduce the amount of work required and assist the workers. And robotics etc. continues to improve as well - Bertrand Russell thought we could have a leisure based society almost a century ago - now it seems we could have one and still live like kings.",0,1375195742,null,0,false,0,cbdbi3y,t3_1jcaaq,t1_cbdbi3y,t1_cbdb3r7,null,1430008093,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

&gt;Chicago has a murder rate of about 15 per capita.

So? That's not anywhere near the top in the US: 

&gt;In 2011, the last year where records have been tabulated to compare cities, according to FBI statistics, Chicago, with a per capita murder rate of 15.9/per 100,000 residents, ranked behind over three dozen other American cities.

&gt;In 2011, the city’s murder rate was less than half that of the cities of New Orleans (57.6/per 100,00), Detroit (48.2) and St. Louis (35.3). Chicago’s homicide rate was also lower than such unremarkable cities as Ft. Myers, FL (31.7) Pine Bluff, AR (24.3), Dayton, OH (23.3) Rocky Mount, NC (20.6), Gulfport, MS (17.6) and Harrisburg, PA (16.1). Although Chicago has a reputation for being a deadly city, a resident’s odds of being murdered there in a given year are about 1 in 6250. By comparison, a New Orleans resident has roughly a 1 in 1750 chance of being killed in a homicide over a twelve month period. Thus, a New Orleans resident is more than three times as likely to become a murder victim in his hometown than a resident of Chicago.

Someone invited me here, and I am curious about the implications of your methodology. 

&gt;So? That's not anywhere near the top in the US:

I was providing an example to show how silly it is to *only* count murder convictions as murder. 

&gt;Whatever strange math you're trying to spin about conviction rate and relating that back to gun-control is at best irrelevant.

[This is where I got the only murder convictions are counted as murder. ](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmhaff/95/95ap25.htm)

&gt;Homicide statistics too vary widely. In some developing countries, the statistics are known to be far from complete. Figures for crimes labelled as homicide in various countries are simply not comparable. Since 1967, **homicide figures for England and Wales have been adjusted to exclude any cases which do not result in conviction**, or where the person is not prosecuted on grounds of self defence or otherwise. This reduces the apparent number of homicides by between 13 per cent and 15 per cent.

Also, can you at least be civil? The only reason to be rude and attempting to shut down conversation on the issue is if you're scared of what will be found. :) 

edit: [Also, interestingly enough, New orleans only had one conviction for its 162 murders.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/06/usa)

I'd drop a fiver on us to achieve promotion, a tenner to finish mid-table and 20 to avoid relegation.

I think the squad looks quite nice at the back, and will hopefully keep other teams at bay. I'd punt an uninformed fiver on us conceding the fewest goals in the league.

If we moor off with Zamora and Johnson - as now seems unavoidable - Johnson to be the focal point for goals until teams make more effort to blank him out. One in every two for Johnson and Zamora if we're lucky one in four. Two pound coin at the bookies on Zamora injuring his hip jumping for a ball.

If Hoilett plays well, my crystal ball suggests teams in the Premier League swoop for him in January, and even if the club doesn't want to let him go, the guy wants out.

Barton to return to the pitch in September; some wind-up merchant gets to him by pushing his buttons, possibly in a fake French accent, and he gets sent off. A pound coin on him to be the next QPR player to get a red card.

In the January window, the market favours sellers fleecing teams that need cover for injuries and we sell off some remaining dead weight. Moreover if we still have some of this money sloshing around (keeping in mind that 5 million for Hooper must be burning a hole in someone's pocket) we will also be able to go hunting, with a better understanding of team weaknesses. Ten pounds sterling on us scoring 65% of total goals for the season after January following acquisition of a fresh striker.

I say we end up knocking out one PL side out of a cup competition.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The 'work programmes' are a complete joke as well. Yes, they are a better chance at work possibly but their motives for finding you work are not all warm and fuzzy. I was told upon attending my first interview after temporary work that, and I quote ""i was a priority because we won't get our money if we don't find you a job.""

I was offered a work trial at a local hotel and jumped at the chance of employment, a chance to show willingness and to keep the job centre happy. I asked for some details of the job but little was available apart from the location and what time I was expected to attend the placement. 

So, I did attend and i did find the work quite pleasant working at the hotel bar which I'd never done before. Then came the inevitable spanner in the works. Right at the end of the placement, I was told the working hours exceeded 12PM at night and my last bus was before 12PM. So, I told the manager of my predicament and I told him I would like to refer to the work programme before making a decision which he accepted.

I asked about help with travel because a taxi was the only way home each night and the cost would be around £10, which would be nearly half of the wages collected after a four hour shift. They couldn't help me and to be really honest, I didn't feel like going to work for four hours for £14 which would mean that after tax and NI, I would make well less than the dole for a week.

Now this is where it gets shitty. The work programme and my advisor completely ignored me because I'd turned down a job (I never turned it down because I was never contacted by the hotel). I tried phoning up, emailing them and leaving messages to no avail. I kept this up for almost a week and then contacted the job centre to inform them of the situation. I have now been sanctioned because I've 'failed to attend' the work programme even though I've not been contacted and I've been ignored when attempting to open dialogue.

Once the work programme find out you're not a dolt and you've expressed some intelligence and disgust at their motive, they will make things difficult for you and they don't give a shit whether the job they've thrust you into is not financially viable.

I've sent some emails to them telling them that I've recorded all attempts at contact and told them I'm going to make sure you get the same amount of shit I have because they deserve it. They don't care about your personal circumstances, they want you in a job (any job) so they can collect their money, which I found out is £250 for employment lasting a certain amount of time and over £2000 for over six months employment.

A mainstay for the Korea U23 and U20 teams, Yoon has looked good in preseason and has the potential to make the difference for QPR this year.  We transferred out Bosingwa, Samba and Ben Haim.  In my opinion these players were all cruft and I'm glad they are gone.  Armand Traore looks to be leaving the club as well, with offers reportedly on the table for this services.

Moving to midfield I think we are doing alright.  Stephane Mbia, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Junior Hoilett, Jermaine Jenas, these are the types of players who can be prolific in the Championship.  Even though Jenas is creeping up in age, he was a regular for Tottenham and has enjoyed years of PL experience.  Then we have Granero and Samba Diakite who are excellent but appear to be on the chopping block.  It is doubtful that Taarabt would play and even if he could, I don't think his attitude is welcome at the team any longer.  We cannot forget Shaun Derry whose attitude and work ethic has been paramount to QPR's development since 2010.  He may not feature but his presence will hopefully inspire those on the pitch to step it up a level.  Karl Henry, our new signing in the midfield, had a three year stint in the PL with Wolves and seems to have the attitude that a Championship player needs for his team to prevail.  Lastly, Joey Barton is still a member of the squad and while the past few months have been tumultuous at best, he may find himself playing in the Championship with QPR this season.  His skills would be useful, but I think it depends more on his attitude and commitment to the team.

I think most people would agree when I say that a lot of our problems lie at the striker position.  Obviously, signing Gary Hooper would've been immense but that didn't happen so we all just have to forget about it.  We have Bobby Zamora and Andy Johnson, both are past 30 and injury-prone.  Even though they have both gone on record in the summer touting their renewed fitness, if one of them goes down and we are in serious trouble.  Johnson has looked sharp in pre-season and has an eye for goal, together with Zamora I think the two would do well together.  They each have significant PL experience but truly, I think we need another striker, in his 20's, who can take over the brunt of the work.  With Johnson and Zamora supporting a third striker the team would be complete in my opinion.

So, in summation, and if you read all of that, good for you and thanks.  Give us a £3-4million striker and optimistically I think we can win the league or at the least secure a playoff spot.  Redknapp is a great manager and has always had my support.

Not so with BBC Radio Leeds - I'll lose the signal way before the coverage is over.

This also means that I'll probably have to subscribe to LUTV for commentary at home, as well. I've always been lucky enough to have the signal for Yorkshire Radio just extend into my home without having to buy anything more than a DAB radio.

I also feel sorry for the employees of the station who will be losing their jobs.

The reasons why we haven't had any new nuclear power stations built for a generation is due to the discovery and rapid exploitation of cheap North Sea Gas in the 70s and 80s, combined with the failure of the UK nuclear industry to create simplified reactor designs that could compete with US and European models, and the massively expensive decomissioning legacy that has been left as a consequence.

true,k-dude,null,null,"I'm from Leeds so I might be able to help you out a bit, even though you already have a lot of good advice!

**Food**: I know it's an undying stereotype, but restaurant food is fantastic in the U.K and in Leeds we have almost everything.

* If you want something somewhat fancy I recommend the [Fourth Floor Café](http://www.harveynichols.com/restaurants/fourth-floor-leeds/fourth-floor-leeds-cafe) in Harvey Nichols on Briggate. 
* For an authentic style French bistro, I love the food at [Kendells](http://www.kendellsbistro.co.uk/) and the relaxed and intimate atmosphere. For Italian food [Casa Mia's](http://www.casamiaonline.com/casa-mia-millennium) is fantastic. If you want something a bit less European, [Sukhotai's](http://www.sukhothai.co.uk/) is a fantastic Thai restaurant in Chapel Allerton and there's a great Indian around almost every corner. For Japanese, I really like [Wasabi Teppan-Yaki](http://www.wasabiteppanyaki.com/) who can make you takeaway bento boxes at lunch time, and will make you dinner right in front of you, which is always a spectacle. [Wagamama's](http://www.wagamama.com/) and [Yo Sushi](http://www.yosushi.com/) are also pretty neat. 

^This might be slightly biased towards my tastes, so tell me if you like a different type of food. I've never been to Texas, but [Red's Barbecue](http://truebarbecue.com/) is really good, and is how I like to imagine the food is there, so perhaps that could remind you of home.

Also, I've presumed that you're okay for money given that you have a job that is sending you to the U.K, but if you're not and you'd like some smaller, more local and cheaper places to eat, I can send you some of them too!

As for **sports**, for a rugby game you have to go to [Leeds' Rhinos](http://www.therhinos.co.uk/home.php) as they are easily the best team in the country. Regarding football, Leeds United are in the second division, but they do have a great atmosphere and it will be a reasonably cheap and fun day out. However, if you are interested in watching a world class English team, you'll most likely have to travel to either London or Manchester, and the tickets will be harder to come by.

**Day activities** is probably the hardest one. There is a great selection of shops that I imagine your wife would like, but I don't know if that would entertain her for eight weeks. There should be a wide variety of gyms that she could join if she is interested in that, but I know my one requires a three month membership, so I dunno. There are quite a lot of 'Zumba' and yoga classes where she might be able to meet people. 

The library in the City Centre is well stocked and there is a Waterstones book shop if she enjoys reading. Roundhay Park is really nice to walk in, and there are a lot of nice little cafes and coffee shops. If she likes hiking in the country side, she could literally get a train to any of the small villages around here and go for a walk and explore them and the surroundings, if she'd be comfortable with that. As another commenter mentioned there are loads of attractions like the Outdoor Sculpture Park, so again if she's interested, I'd recommend looking them up, but to be honest it all really depends on what your wife normally enjoys doing in her free time. I'm sure whatever she's in to, Leeds will have. :)

A better approach though, since people generally want to be able to interact on twitter, would be to give users the power to ""filter"" the replies which come into their feed. Either by keywords which are manually inputted (""rape"", ""fuck"", ""kill""), preset lists of keywords, or by user specifications (i.e - no followers, a very new account, whatever). 

These steps would enable people to dramatically reduce, if not eliminate, the amount of abuse they see, whilst also maintaining the ability to interact with others and use twitter safely.

I really don't think it's realistic to expect Twitter to somehow be able to stop all abuse, but giving users the tools to simply filter what they see would be very powerful IMO.

One way for wind farm developers to address local opposition is to give the local community the opportunity to invest in the development, giving them a shared ownership of it. Any profits generated from this can be put into a community fund to be used as they see fit.

true,JRugman,null,null,"The key thing that's usually been missing when wind applications are turned down is any evidence of local support for the development. In a lot of cases, comments opposing the development outnumber those supporting it by at least 10 to 1. At the moment I'm helping gather support for a big wind farm development near my home town, but it's a hard slog, because there's a well-organised campaign group that's been set up against it. Right now, there's a 50-50 spit between opposing and supporting comments that have been submitted to the relevant planning committees, which is something. 

If you have enough comments drawing attention to the likely benefits of a development, then it means that they have to be addressed in any decision that is taken on it. Far too often, a development is turned down purely because of it's impact on the visual amenity of an area, with no real consideration given to the wider benefits it will provide and no attempt to weigh up the overall impact. It's also important to challenge the arguments being used against wind turbines (such as in the example you gave) so that they don't stand unopposed when it comes to making a decision on the application.

The political landscape around onshore wind energy means that any new development is always going to have to fight its corner to get accepted, but I don't necessarily have a problem with that, as long as it's given the same treatment as any other kind of development.

A energy grid based around distributed generation wouldn't have the same energy mix as one based around centralised generation. Solar, wind, microhydro and bioenergy make a lot more sense in a distributed system, as there are virtually zero fuel transportation costs so you can install plant much closer to where electricity is being consumed. You can also take advantage of combined heat and power installations, which make much more efficient use of energy sources than centralised power plants. You'd have a much more diverse energy market, with a range of street- and neighbourhood-scale producers all able to supply electricity to the local grid. The demands on grid infrastructure would be much less, meaning less need for large scale transmission lines and sub-stations.

It's how everyone individually perceive values which makes this decision so opinionated.

Torres may have been overpriced, but he's certainly provided more value than players like Mutu, Veron, etc. It doesn't matter what we could have spent the money on - opportunity cost doesn't matter here. The fact is that the purchase was made and has provided value over purchases that have provided lesser or no value which means Torres is not the worst purchase Roman has made.

&gt; ...Tottenham would have a hard time reinvesting the oodles of money they’d get from Bale. However, if they manage to hold onto him for one more season and secure a Champions League spot, that changes everything. Last year there was virtually no difference between Spurs and Arsenal, and while Spurs have strengthened this window, Arsenal has again, at least so far, largely stood pat. And there’s no reason for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy to believe that the same offer won’t be there for Bale next summer as well. So, why not play hardball this year, try to hang onto Bale, and make one more run at the Champions League? If they qualify it eases the burden of finding a Bale replacement, and if they miss, well then they’re in exactly the same boat they are now.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; One, What the hell is ""crazy"" feminism? Could this please be defined?

First of all, this isn't an attack post at all, I'm making a serious effort to explain why men may refer to feminism this way.  I'm a dude, I'm a total nerd and I'm also in the tech field so this is something that comes up quite a bit, albeit with mixed results.  I also think it's great having a mix of genders and sexes and what-have-you.

""Crazy"" feminism (I don't use that term I just know what he's referring to) is the side of feminism that is often just thinly veiled misandry.  Since the feminist movement (in a broad sense) has historically included both gender-equality and anti-male voices OP is using the word ""crazy"" to refer to the more hateful version.  

It would be nice if the overarching feminist movement could produce a vocabulary to make it easy to distinguish between a feminist who hates men and thinks all men are rapists, and a feminist who believes in equality between sexes and genders.  Maybe ""radicalized"" is already that term but nobody seems to use it.

Even if a group of 100 feminists has 90 level headed women; the last 10 who go out of their way to try and 'even the score' by picking fights are having 90 percent of the interactions with men.  It happens with vegetarians too, most vegetarians are totally cool about being vegetarian but there's that small yet vocal contingent (*cough* PETA) that runs around calling people murderers and that's what people remember, especially people who just don't know many vegetarians.  But vegetarians as a group are pretty chill people, and ironically it's this chillness that prevents them from standing up to the most vocal of their group.

To use your phone example, assuming zero warranty, what is the worse purchase - the $50 phone that breaks after two weeks or the $700 phone that breaks after two weeks?

I think he's the worst purchase he's ever made. For the impact on the team, for the way we've built around him, for the complete lack of significant return we've got from him. Mutu and Veron weren't vital to the team in the end. Were their troubles holding us back? Hardly. With Torres we had next to no other options apart from him. His lack of value to the team affected us far more than Mutu or Veron's did. Their failure to live up to their reputations/price tag affected us minimally. Torres' enormously.

true,kopking08,null,null,"While your comment wasn't in response to mine, I don't think many fans would be surprised or begrudged by Pepe going to Barca. Just as many shouldn't be begrudged about Suarez going to Madrid. No matter the history of Liverpool, we aren't in their league right now.

That said, the issue arises when a player does this without tact and puts us in a position of weakness. Both in terms of public image and transfer dealings. 

I'm not saying Pepe had crossed that line or even approached it. But his unique case is that he had a long term flirtation with Barca. It wasn't the same as a verbal transfer request. But I assume he would have expected us to sell him to Barca if they put in a reasonable offer. Even an offer slightly below reasonable (as Barca usually do). 

That being the case, we had no choice but to come up with a new plan. While a player flirting with a big and better club isn't the worst thing in the world, when you have this continually your club begins to look weak and like a feeder club. How much has Arsenal's reputation been hurt, not simply by their lack of titles or trophies, but by the fact that any top club has basically taken any player they wanted from them.

Its made Arsenal look weak. And that may seem like a small thing. And it may not make a huge difference. But when you're trying to reassert yourself, as we are, you can't really go around looking like weaklings. And by having our top goalie, who is both hugely admired and respected by fans, basically reiterate every summer that he'd be fine leaving us for Barca, makes us look small.

That's not shallow analysis, that's how businesses calculate ROI and headcount! Businesses know how much their people are worth and how much they can contribute in ROI to a business.

I'm making perfect sense, you are letting (justifiably) your opinion of his pricetag to affect your judgement. 

We spent 50 million on him but have doubled our money with him here via prize money, sponsors, image rights, shirts, etc.

Compare that to a player like Kezman who provided no return on 16 million.

""You're not making any sense. Yes cheaper signings have provided lesser to no value, so those signings weren't as bad as a hugely expensive signing that provided lesser to no value. It's a simple ratio.""

That's saying Torres has provided the same or lesser value than someone like Mutu. That's simply not true. Despite his price, Torres has provided a nearly 2-1 ROI.

If a cheaper signing has no attempt to come close to what you consider a simple ratio and doesn't perform on the pitch, that's a worse signing. Essentially, why buy crap if you know it's crap. At least something overpriced can return better value, which Torres has...

This is simple. Many of you want to play the blame game on Torres and pin the pricetag on him, yet you all probably hated the pundits for doing it when he first signed.

A disproportionate number of black people commit crimes. That does not mean all black people deserve to be treated as criminals, I'm sure you'll agree. A disproportionate number of Asian people are illegal immigrants, but again, that doesn't mean we as a society should be ok with harassing them and making them subject to special checks just because of their race. Being stopped by an authority takes time, it's stressful, there's a chance something goes wrong (eg you don't have your ID, your passport is expired, you have a name like someone else), but more importantly it's treating a racial group as suspicious and criminal because of the actions of a few of them

So, something small in terms of this kind of victim blaming (saying Amy should fix this issue, making it her fault, rather than Rory, who took the action, who was not told to not take the action again) is part of a whole. It's not like saying that scene will cause rape, but it's a needle that builds a massive haystack of thousands of other similar needles. 

I don't agree in terms of characters, either. Moffat writes trope characters rather than real people, in my opinion, and this carries over to women in particular. We've lost women who are their own person, with dreams and hopes and fears and prejudices who will stand up to The Doctor for individual reasons, and in exchange we have received a swarm of Manic Pixie Dream Girls with no depth. 

I don't agree that men can't comment on feminist issues, I don't know why they'd say that.  Not only can men be feminists, but feminism addresses many of the issues that MRAs take as their campaign, gender issues that are discriminatory and hurtful due to forced archetypal gender roles.

It doesn't work that way.  Casting a Swedish actor doesn't make True Blood a Swedish show.  Charlize Theron doesn't make Prometheus a South African film.  Man of Steel wasn't a British/Australian collaboration.  Lord of the Rings wasn't a New Zealand trilogy.

Nope.

You didn't provide any statistics. You posted a few links and went 'LOOK AT ALL THE CRIME!'. But let's talk about statistics. Let's talk about the fact that [black people are 26 times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/oct/17/stop-and-search-race-figures). Let's talk about how Asian people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched. Let's talk about [how socio-economic status is a far more reliable indicator of tendencies towards crime than ethnicity](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/horr19c.pdf).

Yes, and the main *reason* it's so tricky is because owning a house adds a lot more hoops to go through.  However it's often something that can be in your best interests.  Before I owned, I was a lot more cavalier about moving to my best advantage.  The same for my parents, who moved several times when one or both of them shifted jobs.  

It'll depend somewhat on your career, where you live, your travel options etc.  

&gt;but pretending rent is easier on your wallet

It certainly can be when you need to factor in things like travel costs and the opportunity costs of not being able to shop yourself around as easily (plus the risk you need to factor in about committing to a mortgage) .  And a lot of the reason for the disparity is the effective subsidy for house-buying, which is, after all, what is being talked about.

There are certainly circumstances where buying a house it the right thing to do - I did fairly early myself and it's worked out reasonably for me.  But this isn't something the government should be shaping policy to encourage *in itself*, on **top** of the benefits it may have for me personally.  This just amounts to a hidden subsidy for those who are already established, and against those who are not yet in a position where those benefits and opportunities are all aligned (essentially the young and the poor, making it pretty regressive)",0,1375216557,null,0,false,0,cbdkbp8,t3_1jcgve,t1_cbdkbp8,t1_cbdewv1,null,1430003904,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Threatening to rape someone is harmful to that person, even if you don't intend to carry out that threat. I mean 'harm', not 'offend', in the sense that they could substantially change the way that person interacts with the world (for example, the psychological harm of feeling unsafe to express your opinion, the economic harm of having to buy new locks for all the doors, the social harm of not feeling free to get drunk on Friday after work and the 'externality' harm of unpunished rape threats making it more likely someone will make a rape threat in the future).

The law recognises this, and it is a crime if I threaten to rape someone. *Thousands* of people threatening to rape some is almost certainly *more* harmful, and surely the threat to rape someone is media-independent. If I sent you a message in morse code that I was going to rape you, carried out the crime, then got arrested, no jury in the world would believe it was not premeditated despite the fact morse code is not a standard medium to threaten people through.

I would argue the main reason it's so difficult to move is the loosing of relationships and community you're leaving behind. But that's my personal bias.

From a technical perspective, *if* you have made the decision to move, indeed owning a house makes it more complicated. Though, finding the appropriate rental isn't a simple business either, specially when you have kids and you have to select the appropriate school. In fact, I think we would have to consider that, for a government, having stable communities means it's safer, and cheaper, to invest on infrastructures that will last for a while. If people moved aorund all the time, how would you plan anything at all?

Wages don't matter in this case - the player is signed and on wages similar to what a similar top level player would be on. The argument that we could have spent 50 million on another player with better production would inevitably lead to similar wages being given to that replacement. It's a cost of completing business once the player has been signed.

The case isn't made to bring Fernando Torres to Chelsea by saying ""let's put him on 200,000 weekly to bring back ___ ROI."" It's made by saying ""We can sign Fernando Torres for 50 million pounds vs. signing player B for blank amount to attain ____ ROI.""

The players have to be paid, there's no way around that, arguing one player is a bad purchase because he earns a certain amount when it would be argued a better signing would make a similar amount as well falls on deaf ears.

As far as my figures go, Chelsea earned 60 million euros from TV rights, prize money and participation from UEFA for the winning campaign, not including merchandising. With the Europa league win and European competition last year, that's another 40 million euros+ 

Just from two years of European competition, in which Torres played a massive part, that's 100 million euros right there from UEFA.

Consider the new extended Adidas deal, of which Torres plays a large part. Why? Nearly 20% of all Chelsea shirts sold are Torres 9, and he ranks third globally in Premier League player shirt sales. In just revenue that's over 10 million euros alone from his shirt sales which help guarantee out 25 million euros+ yearly from Adidas.

Consider image rights, minimum of which are negotiated in the club's favor 60-40 in any player contract, we are looking at 5-10 million euros more per year in Torres image rights revenue.

This doesn't include any other sponsors that have upped/reupped with us since he signed because of his global appeal.

I know your reply will be that my figures are shit, but you've failed to provide any, a telltale sign that you know fuck all about the economics of football.

true,Brian,null,null,"&gt;If people moved aorund all the time, how would you plan anything at all?

I don't see how this changes anything for the government, unless you think it's *good* that we optimise certain places and not others.  Personally, I see the postcode lottery as a *bad* thing, and think giving people mobility would serve to equalise areas as it increases competition.  If anything, mobility seems to make it *easier* to handle infrastructure problems, because it allows various things to self-correct easier.  A local labour shortage can self-correct when there's unemployment elsewhere (and vice versa).  Overcrowded schools allows people another option to handle it without the vast lead times that building new infrastructure would require.

&gt;So, change the rules to prevent those well established benefiting from them.

How would this work?  If you increase the benefit to owning houses, those in the best position to own a house, or who would be doing so anyway, are always going to be most able to take advantage of it.  And what is the advantage in favouring such policies anyway?  It's only going to have an effect when it would otherwise be suboptimal, after all - where it *already* makes sense to own, or still doesn't even *with* such policies, it's not going to change anything.  It's only where it changes the payoff sufficient to change behaviour that it has an effect.

Ultimately, what exactly is the benefit to this?  The benefits from owning your house are what people want.  But looking at the ""owning a house"" part and favouring that is missing the point.  The only reason people do so is **for** those benefits, which are either there whether we subsidise them or not, or are *not*, in which case the *actual* benefit is coming from effectively throwing taxpayer money at certain people, while penalising others by creating worse conditions for them - a net loss.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt;Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body.

At least according to Wikipedia.

Granted, it does depend on what you class as suppression. But you can opt out of any and every proposed filter.

There are a hundred things wrong with what the Government is doing, but I don't think it helps to call something censorship when, at the very least, it could be argued quite well that it is not.

It might lead to censorship, but slippery slope arguments are among the weakest you can use, so I simply take issue with Ivashkin's remark that it is

&gt; Better to let the objections on the grounds of censorship build and then support this.

Most of the blogs that generate traffic in the way you thought I meant are just making up stories or perpetuating rumors. Like the Suarez stuff or the stuff with Mickey. They're rumor mongers. That stuff is part and parcel to navigating the football world.

Walsh writes summation pieces. He summarizes some series of mostly documented events. But he does it like what he's saying is more profound than what anyone else looking at the situation would come up with.

Somewhat, it's more complicated than that in my eyes though.  I mean if you and I were workmates (just as an example, roll with it) and we had a falling out and I said to you, in the heat of the moment during an arguement *""I'm going to fucking twat you one if I see you outside work.""* then TECHNICALLY, that's an actual threat of violence, but in reality it's an empty threat made in anger/frustration.  Should I be treated like a criminal as a result?

Whereas say, someone takes to social media, posts someones personal details and says, for whatever reason, *""There's the details, let's kill this cunt.""* - that's a serious incitement of violence, with very real potential consequences.  I don't think these 2 examples are the same thing, or even in the same ballpark.

I realise that rape is another issue, and not quite the same thing.  I mean I don't recall ever seeing/hearing an arguement where 1 party threatens to rape the other in anger, but I hope you get my drift.

I just think it's a dangerous slope to go down if we're not careful (and this is Labour we're on about; they never are and they don't give a fuck about anyone else after the fact) because it won't be long before someone says, in jest, in a gaming lobby that they're ""going to rape"" the other team, and suddenly someone who meant only a silly dig at strangers has an arrest and a potential criminal record.

I just think it's going to ring to most people as alarmist, and cause them to dismiss it, since it doesn't match up to any reasonable idea of what censorship actually means, apart from after a long and slippery slope.

It's better to focus on issues such as how it's going to lead more teenage boys (and girls, but mostly boys), who will be looking for this stuff in order to circumvent the filter, into the darker side of the Internet which they were unlikely to find otherwise. 

I  don't know, I mean, it's easier to use the Tor browser and hide it in a folder on your hard drive than to set up a proxy manually, right? And you will have found out about that browser from somewhere, who knows what that could lead to. It could be something like Silk Road, which you wouldn't want your kids to get into because getting drugs delivered to your house is a recipe for disaster, esp when kids aren't careful with what they're doing. Or it might be something even more sinister.


Not to mention Dad will probably opt out of the filter in half of UK households anyway, so there's just no point.

And it wont block everything, but it will give most parents a false sense of security about their young children browsing the Internet, and dissuade them from actually monitoring their own kids activity.

And it'll block plenty of things which aren't porn, unintentionally, I'm sure.

And that's not even getting into the non-porn filters you supposedly will have to opt out of.

These are the real problems with the filter - calling it ""censorship"" really helps no one. It's not. Stop pretending it is, you only sound alarmist and will turn any potential supporters off, since they'll assume that's the only argument against it, they'll say ""oh well I can just opt out"".

""As a young person who is ready to leave NI as soon as I'm able, I am disgusted with the pathetic politics, narrow-mindedness and backwardness of our institutions and the utter incompetence of our elected officials. I don't believe any of the political parties represent most people and are only voted in by default for lack of better realistic options.
I think all ""unionist"" and ""republican"" political parties should be abolished for a period of 25-50 years, and replaced with non-sectarian parties established upon normal conservative, liberal, etc. lines with an agreement that at the end of the period a referendum would be held on the future of northern Ireland, and no campaigning would be allowed on Unionist, Nationalist or Independance until 1 year prior to the end of that period.
How do you feel about this.""

ANSWER

I'm sorry to hear that you want to leave NI. While there are a lot of problems in this country, I think we need intelligent and progressive young people to help change things. 

I agree with you that the majority of political parties are failing to represent their constituents, and I do believe that the majority of parties are merely elected in because of their colours and the constitutional position they hold. We tend to run every election like a border poll - and it really is holding our country back. 

I don't however agree that we need to abolish parties, or force other parties to exist. At the end of the day if those are the parties that are democratically elected - we can't abolish them willy nilly. 

I think we need to introduce a formal opposition into the NI Assembly to help provide an alternative voice and normalise politics into slightly more left-right divides. We also need to get rid of community designation so that the sectarian trench divides are not instilled into every single political decision we make. 

I also think to a certain extent we need to 'old dogs' of politics to leave, those involved in the conflicts need to give way to those with ideas that aren't cloaked in hatred for the past. As parties such as SDLP continue to give younger people a larger role, I think they along with Alliance/NI21 will start to introduce more normal politics into NI.

Don't leave! We need people like you to make things better!

The fact is the phrase *is* sexist. First off, it carries with it the implications of women being unable to perform tasks or being weak--if you were more of a man then you could do what's being asked of you. Being a man--manning up--is associated with competence. Notice also the up used to imply becoming more manly is an upward motion. Further, it creates this image of being ""manly"" and masculine for men to conform too--by telling a guy to man up the implication is he cannot be a man unless he conforms to a misogynistic image of men being strong and able. Finally, the term also has issues when it comes to people who say do not identify as male or female, or people who are male but act effeminate, etc. 

The people affected by this language are affected by this sort of stuff continuously--this is just a continuation of the same issues.

The fact is this is just a facet of our society. The world is dominated by men on a whole still--white straight men specifically are the group in power. And this group continues to oppress minorities across the board from media to language to what have you. Sexism, racism, all this exists and is systematically perpetuated because we are willing to just say ""oh this is how it is lighten up"" because the people saying that are the ones unaffected by this marginalization!

If the culture is racist or sexist then of course it should change! I don't care if it's your national tradition to throw bananas at a black player and make monkey noises, that shit is oppressive and wrong.

Your vote is what any politician cares most about, more than lobbying money, or what protestors, donors or union leaders think, because none of those things put him in his fancy green bench. Your vote does.

You're welcome to vote for a small party that represents your views, or spoil your ballot, or, if you care so much, set up your own party (admittedly not everyone is able to do this and still feed themselves).

It's just so important to participate in the electoral system. It takes no effort on your part. You don't even need to wait in a queue at a polling station now - I've *never done that*, I just vote by post. You can do that. It's fucking easy.

Voting is the way we have in civilized countries of deposing a leader who has done a bad job. That way nobody needs to suffer for 40+ years and nobody gets blood on their hands.

The thing is, people interpret voting as giving the citizens a way to decide a ruling philosophy for the country, and then they complain that the two largest parties have a broadly similar approach. Surely the only thing worse for the stability of a country is if the very underlying approach to running it *at all* changed every five years. 

Imagine if we had a fully libertarian free market economy with zero regulation for five years and then suddenly turned into a heavily regulated Socialist paradise? I'm exaggerating, I know, but it's the only reasonable way a country can be run.

It's about accountability, over everything. When the country decided Gordon Brown had done a bad job, they got rid of him. That's what voting is for.

Minor temperature rises also damage ecosystems and areas where CO2 is naturally removed, either by algae or rainforests. We have already changed things far too much but it as cycle which will get faster and faster, making the world less habitable.

Obviously, I was right to. After the first goal went in my Dad still tried to convince me it wouldn't happen. But then boom, goal 2 &amp; 3. And I ran around the house screaming. 

Again my parents tried to convince me to go to bed at the full time whistle, but I was having none of it. 

Extra time comes round and I'm huddled on the sofa in a blanket and I can barely watch as they dominate our penalty area. I remember seeing the Shevchenko miss/Dudek miracle save and thinking it had gone in - and we were done. But nope, 3-3, penalties.

By this point my parents had given up getting me to bed. So I just sat in front of the TV, shaking with nerves. God knows how the players felt.  I was so confident we were going to win it after the first 2 penalties each but then Riise missed and Tomasson &amp; Kaka scored and I was like ""Oh crap"". But then it was all good because Smicer scored and Shevchenko missed and we won.

And I was jumping around and screaming and yelling. I felt like a smug little fucker - 1) for thinking deep down we could come back from 3-0, and 2) Liverpool had finally won something big - having had stick from all my friends the past few years.

(I exaggerate, some advisors actually do appreciate you trying to better yourself and volunteering, but just make sure it doesn't 'interfere' with your job search.  Any kind of education and training, however, you have to be prepared to drop at a moment's notice if they find you a job, or even an unpaid workfare place.  Even if you paid for a course to better yourself.

It's really sad how the Jobcentre's been turned from a place to find work into a place to harass the unlucky.

true,Werevark,eccleston,Eccleston,"1. Everybody Lives. Joyous and tragic at the same time, and what I feel is the finest acting of the show.

2. John Smith struggling with dying to become a hero in Family of Blood. 2nd best acting and honestly heartbreaking.

3. The Master facing down Rassilon in End of Time. His pain, his rage, all of it was palpable and awesome.

4. Punishment of the Family at the end of the Family of Blood. Really showed the limits that the Doctor would go to punish wrongdoing and wanton murdering.

5. 11th Hour. My favorite opening episode of any of the new Doctors. Amazing ending monologue from Smith. 

6. Eccleston's Death :'( 

7. Tennant's departure scenes. :'(

8. Rings of Ahkaten. Amazing monologue by Smith. Heartbreaking.

9. Dalek, the genuine hatred Eccleston has for the Dalek really makes you afraid of his Doctor.

10. The Oncoming Storm speech. He's probably the only Doctor who I really feel that from. Genuinely intimidating.

11. the Master dancing in Tennant's 2nd finale to voodoo child. Somehow menacing despite the glee.

11. Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead. Good, scary writing, and a great threat by Tennant

12. Van Gogh :'( 

13. River saying the Rhyme in A Good Man Goes to War. Real gravity in a rhyme. Awesome.

14. Dr. Yana's revelation in Utopia. Scary and awesome acting. 

15.Amy and Rory's departure. :'( 

16. Ending of Pandorica opens. So dark. So good. 

17. The end of Blink. Awesomely spooky.

18. Doomsday. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 

19. Doctor's Wife. Amazing character with Idris.

20. Clara in the Snowmen. Possibly my favorite incarnation of her; perfect mix of sass and savvy. 

21. Girl in the Fireplace. Really nice acting, amazing actress, and genuinely touching.

Respectfully I have to disagree on your point about the weight of words a bit. These words have history behind them and their history is tied to their current use. Indeed their current use and status in society is informed by their origin. We can't simply say ""oh these words are ok now"" and expect the issues they represent and perpetuate to go away. They are marginalizing in origin and they serve to perpetuate the issues present-- these issues are what give these words their weight. 

I don't think we should just say humans will use differences to oppress and throw our hands up in the air. We've made quite a bit of progress in the past and there is no reason to stop now. Further, we shouldn't take the approach of ""just ignore the divisions and the problems will cease"". For example people say race is an issue because we focus on race issues--if we took a colorblind approach we wouldn't have problems. But the fact is our systems and institutions aren't colorblind, and for that matter studies have actually shown colorblind approaches do not stop discrimination. When these issues are present we must point them out and act on them--else we will continue to suffer from this oppression.

&gt;You're welcome to vote for a small party that represents your views, or spoil your ballot, or, if you care so much, set up your own party (admittedly not everyone is able to do this and still feed themselves).

Under a first past the post system, this is absolutely a waste of time.

&gt;It's just so important to participate in the electoral system. It takes no effort on your part. 

Under a first past the post system, it doesn't make any difference if I vote or not. What is your motivation for wanting me to vote for a party I know will not win? It is purely symbolic and changes literally nothing.

&gt;Voting is the way we have in civilized countries of deposing a leader who has done a bad job. That way nobody needs to suffer for 40+ years and nobody gets blood on their hands.

Switching between Nu Labour and Tory is merely an inconvenience to the lobbyists. Those are the two major parties, who represent the same interests. You are delusional if you think that the interests of the business/finance industry have been placed above the interests of the people since Thatcher was elected.  It's not 40 years, but it will be soon.

&gt;The thing is, people interpret voting as giving the citizens a way to decide a ruling philosophy for the country, and then they complain that the two largest parties have a broadly similar approach. Surely the only thing worse for the stability of a country is if the very underlying approach to running it at all changed every five years. 

It's not so much that I want change every five years, more that I want change that benefits the poor/middle class *at all*. The rich have been getting richer throughout my lifetime, and that's just not sustainable without everyone else getting poorer.

&gt;It's about accountability, over everything. When the country decided Gordon Brown had done a bad job, they got rid of him. That's what voting is for. The ""policies"" themselves are meant to be wrangled between the legislature and the executive, with grass roots consulation at conferences.

And this basically does nothing to help people. We have two pro-business parties arguing about how private finance should make the most money out of the people. It's a fundamentally profit driven government and it doesn't really give a shit what people need any more. Con/Lab/Lib are all parties working for private interests, not for the people. They are all corrupt. 

Spoiling your vote doesn't do anything to change that. The whole system is rotten to the core.",0,1375232014,null,0,false,0,cbdq10x,t3_1jcxm7,t1_cbdq10x,t1_cbdo22e,null,1430001171,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Now series 2 they started to have more continuity with Sarah Jane. But it's series 3 and later where they make it stronger. Series 5 I think properly reintroduces the series. The Doctor past regens and history is shown and not simply hinted at. 

At this point calling it a reboot doesn't make much sense but at the start it did. I think that had the show not worked as well as it did then they would have lost the continuity.

I think he's bound by certain events and messing with them certainly has its consequences. I also believe Davies and Moffat did a pretty good job of masking the deus ex machina aspects (much better than the sonic screwdriver) of fixed points and stuff he can mess with.

Cheap tricks notwithstanding I think Pompeii puts his ability to really change things into question. I bring up the Waters of Mars because he defiantly abuses his godlike capabilities. The Gelth are an interesting subject because they're clearly not a fixed point since their predicament was a product of the time war and are therefore in flux.

The Time Lords HAD pretty much complete control over time and kept things in check. Now that they don't have carte blanche it's a free for all and not just the Silence and the Daleks. The Cybermen, Weeping Angels, and even the Master can make some pretty big changes without the aid of a TARDIS.
