It was quite impressive when I saw some Labour controlled council was raging against Tory cuts in their glossy colour council magazine. Must have cost a bomb to produce compared to my villages' photocopied black and white one.

I don't think this is always an issue of opposition-controlled councils though. My council has just gone from Conservative to Independent-Lib Dem control, and some of their budget cuts smack of sticking it to Westminster.

Sounds like burning down the barn to kill a rat to me.

&gt;I'm just saying that it isn't 'logic' at all to assume that getting out of ECHR automatically equals worse human rights.

Logic dictates that since rights are being eroded in America to push certain corporate and political interests the same is likely happening in the UK. Considering that, the removal of ECHR from UK would leave us a) without any applicable legislation b) looking as stupid as the Americans.

So, rather than asking why we should stay in the ECHR the question is why we should leave it, and I believe the reasoning you mentioned is very weak, very very weak.",0,1380494056,null,0,1380494295,0,cchtjz3,t3_1ndg95,t1_cchtjz3,t1_ccht57x,null,1429300760,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"Perhaps but I would subscribe to the idea that democracy and human rights presuppose each other. If we have a form of democracy (which we do) then the people are the ultimate arbiters of power not the government. However to truely be a democracy each citizen must be able to participate. Jergen Habermas defines the Ideal Speech Situation as the situation in which one is able to express his views without coercion and with the ability to be heard and on a nationwide level this is a perfect democracy. When every person can speak (via voting) and be heard equally then we have a democracy. However to protect that we need some basic human rights. You need free expression; freedom from coercion, imprisonment or torture; freedom of association; freedom of religion and thought; freedom from corrupt justice and some level of privacy. 

I would define human rights as those rights which enable us to participate in society. Once these are discovered and recognised we should hold those rights as superior in importance to the government because the government cannot possibly be doing good by taking apart the method by which we secure our democratic system. We give the government power to run the country but we limit their power by retaining these fundamental rights which ensure the people will never lose control of the country.",0,1380494110,null,0,false,0,cchtkkt,t3_1ndg95,t1_cchtkkt,t1_cchrx7z,null,1429300752,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As I said elsewhere, maybe it's just principle rather than burning down the barn. Many people in this country, rightly or wrongly, don't like the idea of others telling the UK what to do. Trying asking your parents what their opinion is about ECHR. A huge number of people that age (prime voting age...) will grumble about it getting in the way of things.

Personally I think Cameron is just pandering to that viewpoint, rather than trying to make an assault on our rights. They haven't even seriously tried to get rid of it, and IMO they won't. 

Not to mention that, citing your example of the US, even a very clearly written constitution doesn't actually protect you if the government really decides to fuck you. I think if Cameron and co actually wanted to fuck us, he wouldn't have to say 'maybe, some day we will get rid of the ECHR.'

true,Conroy_Rascal,null,null,"First year computer science is predominantly in the centre of town, but second and third years are entirely on the West Cambridge site (JJ Thompson Ave.).

The centre-most colleges (proximity to Sainsbury's basically) include (to name but a few): Sidney Sussex, St. Johns, Trinity, Christ's, Magdalene, Kings.

Colleges towards the west include: Churchill, Robinson, Selwyn, and some of the Caius accommodation.

The cycle route to the Computer Lab is pretty good and the bike rack outside is absolutely huge. Around a 10 minute cycle from the centre, although that depends on how many people are about.


As somebody else has said, the facilities at the colleges do not vary much, with all of them having a fair range of accommodation and sports facilities, etc. It comes down to more personal choices, like whether or not you want a large or small college (St. Johns vs. Trinity Hall) or how far you're prepared to travel to the centre.

Most colleges have very few computer scientists. Churchill (always, as far as I know) has the most, with around 6/7. Depending on how the college provisions supervisions this shouldn't really be an issue though. If they don't consider they have the academics to supervise a topic your director of studies will find someone in the lab who can, so you'll be looked after.

Don't hesitate to ask any more questions here or as a pm.

**Edit**: St. Johns and Christ's both have film societies that project 35mm films several times a term. They are run by students, so that might be good if you're into cinema.

**Edit 2**: I think most people play badminton at Kelsey Kerridge (sports centre adjacent to the swimming pool). I think it's a ""Cuppers"" sport, meaning many colleges have teams and they compete. I don't think I remember a college having a badminton court, but would not be surprised if there was one. Several colleges (Christ's and Queen's certainly have squash courts).

**Edit 3**: Inevitably there's a [Photographic society](http://www.phocus.org.uk/) (at university level). Some of the colleges may have there own club/society, though I imagine it would be fairly informal. Cambridge is a beautiful place for photography.

**Edit 4**: This is non-official advice, but I would personally advise against an open application. While it shouldn't disadvantage you in terms of applying or in terms of your education, you might 'end up' somewhere like Girton, which other people weren't so keen on (due to its location). I think you'd be better off applying to the college you actually like the look of, and if they're full there's a chance you'll be put in the pool anyway, so you've not really lost out.

**Edit 5**: I should add that in the first year of Computer Science you'll either be doing some Natural Sciences or Maths. Physics/Chemistry lectures take place at the Chemistry Lab on Lensfield Road (a little south of Downing). Maths lectures take place either at the Chemistry lab, or on the new museums site (very central, near Corn Exchange venue).",0,1380495337,null,0,1380496223,0,cchtz00,t3_1nebp6,t1_cchtz00,t3_1nebp6,null,1429300565,3,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,3

they literally work exactly as well after being put in water. They probably work just as well underwater, aside from the whole water in lungs business. Stop pretending there's a problem, you're not even kidding yourself.

&gt;The breath activated ones are fine, being wet has no effect on the trigger mechanism at all

that's a bingo. 

&gt;And the dry powder inhalers, well they actually need to be soaked for 5 minutes before using them. 

right, the obscure less-commonly prescribed kind of inhaler that you'd be stupid to take on a watercraft would be damaged by water. Clap clap clap.

As to RvW, he's not there to win aerial battles, and we need to stop expecting that from him. You look at Holt and Kenwyne Jones and you can see that's part of their game, whilst RvW is much closer in style to, for example, Torres. His movement is excellent and our midfield need to look for him more. On a couple of occasions Snodgrass and Martin played aimless crosses when RvW was screaming to be played in. I think it'll come, and we'll start making better use of him, but it's not going to happen overnight, and until then we need to be patient with him.

When you fry tomatoes (cut em in half, cut side down), they go through this period when they tense up and get really hard and nasty to eat. You have to cook them beyond that and they'll soften down and you want them almost disintegrating by the time you take them out which they should be if they've been in while you've done the sausages, bacon, etc. 

So many cafes doing full English stick tomatoes in right at the end, and they end up getting left on the plate. Its a personal bugbear. So thats my number one tip. 

Oh, and you'd better have a bottle of [HP Sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Sauce) on hand too. Not a proper full English without it. I dunno if you get it in Canada. If you can't get a bottle in time, get some anyway because it *makes* a bacon sandwich.

Finally fried bread is done in all the fat thats left from frying. Fry it till it's all soaked in. If you're doing it right you can typically do a slice or two in the oil and escaped sausage/bacon fat thats left from a good fry up.

true,IthiQQ,NL,netherlands,"First off, I was somewhat surprised when we received Kakuta, Piazon and Atsu on loan as I understood they are all three left wingers originally (is this correct?).

Piazon: Has been playing quite well so far, mainly as a left winger. Dutch media has reported a couple of times now that this is a player to keep an eye on.

Kakuta: Was our left winger last year, yet barely any playtime this season due to an injury and Piazon performing well on his position. It would be nice if either Piazon or Kakuta is able to play as a right winger because our current right winger (Ibarra) has been playing horribly lately.

Atsu: Has not been able to play yet because he was awaiting a work permit. He joined the group past Thursday/Friday so I expect him to get  playtime either Wednesday or next Sunday. Hope this guy is able to play either as a striker or a right winger because those are clearly the weakest positions in our squad right now.

Van Aanholt: One of - if not - the best left back(s) in the eredivisie at the moment. Makes a mistake every now and then, but a good back for the eredivisie. The main problem I see with Dutch defenders in general, though, is that they are very offensive minded and are not that great at defending itself. He is still a better back than Alexander Buttner though (which isn't THAT hard to be fair) to give you an idea.

Cuevas: I have been told this guy is able to play anywhere on the left side of the field. No playtime so far though. Considering how we have plenty of left wingers, Van Aanholt doing fine as a left back, and renowned Dutch midfielder Theo Janssen playing on the left side of the field, it does not really surprise me that he didn't play yet, but maybe he will get some playtime later this season.

Hutchinson: Has not been able to play yet due to his injury, but it would be perfect to have a defender on the field who actually knows the meaning of the word 'defending' as, once again, most Dutch defenders (actually, most defenders in the eredivisie anyway) are terrible at defending itself. Considering what I have heard from the people who visit the training regularly I expect him to get enough playtime should he recover from his injury.",0,1380499070,null,0,1380499880,0,cchv5db,t3_1ndrda,t1_cchv5db,t1_cchszof,null,1429300016,15,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,15

That said, possession could be difficult to maintain under high pressure, because our shape becomes a bit flatter with this formation - the wingbacks open wide for the centerbacks/mids, but there's not always someone for them to pass forward to. Suarez and Sturridge are great at showing for the ball, but I could see that being an issue in certain situations. 

The formation really gives freedom to our midfielders, though, because if Gerrard goes forward, Enrique or Henderson can cover for him. I think it makes our offense dynamic in that sense. But with Henderson at right back, this situation blunts our attacking ability because he can't beat a man. When Glen Johnson comes back, we can move Henderson into the middle - his work rate in the center combined with Johnson's skill on the wing will really cause problems for any team.",0,1380499691,null,0,false,0,cchvcdf,t3_1negft,t1_cchvcdf,t3_1negft,null,1429299925,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,theanonymousthing,logo,,"**GK**: Joe Hart, really nothing he could do with that villa goal, defense where caught sleeping there and left him in a difficult one on one situation, so really no significant blame attached

**RB**: Micah Richards, strong and a bit more pacy than Zabaleta will hopefully help us control Bayerns fast wingers, however dont mind at all if Zaba plays because he is more than capable

**CB**: Vincent Kompany, do i really need to explain this one? is the backbone of our defence

**CB**: Nastasic, abit shaky against villa but is still a solid defender and has a great partenrship with kompany, just look at the stats at his clearences and interceptions, it speaks for itself

**LB**: Clichy, As mentioned before kolarov is great on the attack but he was caught out a number of times against pacy wingers, like in the derby with valencia (dont get me wrong kolarov still played great in that match), Clichy has the pace to keep up and is more solid defensively 

**DM** Fernandinho: i dont think people give him enough credit for what hes been doing in the recent games, sure its not the most glory filled, noticeable role, but it sure is vital, Fernandinho has been cutting up attacks and transitioning to the counter superbly, just look at the stats on his recent games, by playing this role it frees up yaya to run around box to box in the style we love

**CM/DM** Yaya Toure: An absolute midfield beast, great box to box and great incisive passing, can outmuscle pratically everyone, especially handy when you come up against the likes of Martinez and Dante

**RW** Jesus Navas: Against bayern we're gonna need all the pace we can get, plus provides great crosses and has great tekkers, however it always pains me to see milner not play because he has an amazing workrate and never gives up no matter the score line, one of the most underrated players in the league, however in this instance navas is key

**LW** David Silva: Pelle has  abit of a beautiful problem in the Attacking midfield department, i think with nasri recent form people have forgotten just how much of a world beater and game changer Silva is, fantastic vision and incisive key passing as well as (recently) a penchant for getting on the score sheet, plus he would want to remind pelle how good he is and will be highly motivated

**CF/Secondary Striker**: Aguero, an absolute poacher with great tekkers a powerful and accurate shot and creates so many chances, jovetic has been promisisng lately but against bayern we are gonna need one of our strongest sides

**ST** Negredo, what a beast. extremely powerfull he can outmuscle bayerns defence and meet navas' sweet crosses, is also suprisingly un-selfish and creates all sorts of chances, might take a little hate for this but Dzeko is great but sometimes he looks a little un-intrested, negredo seems always motivated to challenge help out with defense and constantly presses, plus he has an awesome partnership with Aguero

At any rate, it's a tough position to be in with Allen injured - obviously he slots right in if healthy. Still, I think the best option has to be Henderson in the middle with Gerrard and letting Kelly (if fit enough) take the right wing spot. Ilori plays on the left side of defense, and it would be a bit ridiculous to start him in the PL without a cup game or even sub appearance to bleed him in first.

I'd be okay with getting a little crazy and starting Sterling/Aspas up top and shunting Moses over to right wing back, too. Seems a bit silly to move Moses when he's done so well up top, but if we want to really get after Palace, that seems the only option outside of Kelly/Wisdom. Or, if Agger were fit, we could move one of Agger/Toure into the midfield behind Gerrard.

true,ateoclockminusthel,angel,Weeping Angel,"The whole first season of the reboot was quite cheesy. I really struggled to get through it. After a few episodes I had pretty much figured out what the show was going to be like and that it just wasn't very good. Then it started to surprise me. There would be a periodic episode or portion of an episode that was quite good. I'd have to rewind my Netflix and re-watch the scene, paying more attention. By the end of the first season, I was convinced that it was a good show and worth watching.

In the second season, my mind was changed completely. I couldn't believe how good the new Doctor was, even though I had grown to love Eccleston, Tennant was far better. The writing, the acting, the special effects... all of it was far superior. The next few seasons were great, but you really need to watch the first season to fully appreciate them.

By the time Matt Smith came around, I was already hooked on the show. Most people around here prefer Tennant to Matt Smith, but I loved Matt Smith from the moment I first saw him. IMO the show went to the next level with Seasons 5 and 6. I no longer just really, really liked the show, I loved it. I was so close to quitting halfway through the first season and I'm **so** glad that I didn't.

I guess the moral of my story is that your comments regarding the episode aren't really all that different from mine when I watched it. Of course I can watch it now and have a different appreciation for it, but I really doubt you'll regret powering through the first season, maybe season and a half before you fall in love with the show.

Particularly within large cities and town centres we now have a system called challenge 21 where anyone that looks less than 21 is supposed to be asked for ID. The problem that you will have is that not many bouncers are going to know what an Australian driving licence looks like and many places do not like to check passports. 

I would suggest that you carry your licence and just be open and polite to the bouncers, they need people in the bar/club to make money and most door staff are okay so long as you are not an ass. 
Door staff do not have the right to search or detain beyond what anyone else has. Their role is to ensure that the premises is safe thus you will probably be searched on entry to a few places and is you are committing a crime they can use reasonable force to remove you from the premises, if you then fight with door staff they can (and will) detain you until the police arrive. In some cases these powers are abused and door staff have illegally detained people but this is uncommon. 

Within the UK you have no right to enter or stay within a pub or club, you can be refused entry and are not even entitles to know why you can also be asked to leave at any time, again no reason has to be given.

Dress code depends on the club, you will need to know someone that has been before or as most clubs have photos on their websites check them out and dress accordingly. 

The UK in January will be cold, most clubs have cloakrooms where you can leave your jacket but it is not uncommon for people to walk around it T-shirts in the coldest and wettest of weather in the UK.

true,andifall,null,null,"Hey there.

My girlfriend and I were in desperate need of relocation recently and did exactly as you stated. It was hard, but we did it. We're both in our mid-20's. I'll try and give you all the advice I can through the experience we've had.

So, to start off with, we were in a dilemma of getting a job without living there, but we couldn't afford to live there without a job (Catch 22). We had to wait until my girlfriend found a job that was willing to take her on despite not living in the area, promising that she'll move down asap. Luckily we found just that. Thankfully you have friends down there, which means *use their address on your CV*. If not, you won't find a job before getting down there.

With regards of where to move, it's a real hard one. Brighton is known for being extremely expensive to rent. What we did was find an 'interim location'. We rented out a room in a student house in a rough area (Moulsecoomb) and used that location to find me a job until we found somewhere else. Luckily we were only there for a couple of months before we found something much nicer. If you are set on moving straight into a private space then /u/quentinnuk is right; it is about 550 a month or more for a *tiny* space. I would look into sacrificing a small part of your privacy in a shared accommodation until you find your footing in the city.  

Job wise, if you don't mind crap work, go to the seafront. I managed to get a job in a few days by plastering my CV about in the different Hotels/Hostels/Bars etc. You'll find something, but it takes a lot of work even if you just want a shitty job.

If it's left to the match thread then I see no reason for censorship - people will upvote or downvote and there will be self-moderation that way. Considering most overly negative things around here are downvoted into oblivion anyway, I don't think it's much of a problem.

If someone wants to say Henderson doesn't have a creative bone in his body, why can't they? Reply if you disagree, downvote if you're not into that whole reddiquette deal, ignore it if you think the guy's off his rocker. I thought Henderson had a great game in some aspects and was poor as an attacker; if I say that, should I be downvoted? That's just discussion, right?

true,SovietPenguin,eng-lancashire,Pie eater,"This country is on the brink of either losing its public services such as social welfare and social healthcare, or having a very US-style model of these, all thanks to absolute tossers like Osbourne. And the sad thing is, a lot of Brits seem to be buying into it.

Is it any wonder that since Cameron and his cuntish chums got into power there has been story after story after story in the news of people milking the benefit systems so that we're now at the point where ""benefit claimant"" is synonymous with ""scrounger""? And of course these news sources have financial ties with people in government, saying what can and cannot be in the public domain according to these vile fucks on top. Public opinion on people claiming benefits is dangerously swinging to the right, when once it was held up as something to be proud of in post-war Britain when it was still in the social zeitgeist that anyone - no matter how rich or poor - could lose everything over night. Now we have this nation wide idea that people are poor through no one's fault but their own, rather than people being poor through no fault of their own. We've gone from an undeserving to a deserving poor mindset.

Cutting benefits, cutting health costs, increasing university fees, increasing train fares above the rate of inflation: all of these were once paid for by taxation as a sort of trade off. ""Yes, you pay more in taxes as you have higher wages, but in return you get all these stuff for free!"" Now these services are either already private, no longer heavily subsidised by the government, are having huge budget cuts implemented by the government, or are on their way to being privatised. The lower and middle classes gain nothing from this and must realise that now there is no trade off with paying taxes. Higher taxes no longer seem beneficial. The only people who benefit from this selfish and self-serving model are the super rich. 

Cunts, the lot of them. Shame on anybody who voted and will vote again for the tories. Absolutely despicable human beings who are an insult to democracy. Representive of the people my arse.

true,Baljet,null,null,"I fucking love breakfast, it is often the highlight of my weekend(unless I make a roast, ofc). This thread is full of fantastic advice, but here's how I do mine:

Awakening from a drunken slumber I need flavour, I add mixed herbs to my breakfast, these are good old English mixed herbs; sage, thyme, marjoram and oregano.

Oven and kettle go on, tomatoes are halved, beans are opened and hash browns collected from the freezer.

Hash browns and tomatoes go in the oven, they'll take about 25 minutes, you're now on the clock. Strip the label off of the baked bean can, place it on the bottom of the oven.

Make the tea, I use 2 spoons of red label and one earl grey, this makes a pot for 6 mugs once brewed.

Half the mushrooms if they're small, chop them chunky otherwise. Chuck in a lidded saucepan on a low heat with slightly more butter than you think is sensible, add mixed herbs, black pepper and salt.

Place your smokey bacon into a large frying pan on a low heat in a single layer, drizzle with a light oil capable of high temperatures, I use grapeseed. Add a dash of mixed herbs and freshly ground black pepper, leave on a very low heat.

Have a cup of tea and a fag, by the time you return the hash browns will need to be flipped and the bacon should have cooked off all the filthy water they pump it full of nowadays. Give it a flip too and add a little more oil.

Set the table; Ketchup, brown sauce, cruet. Offer tea to others and pop the bread in the toaster so its ready to go.

Plate up the hash browns, beans, tomatoes, mushrooms and bacon, pop the plates in the oven to keep warm. Add about a 5mm of oil to the frying pan and bring up to temperature and put the toast on.

Plunge the eggs into the oil and baste well, oil should be very hot and spitting all over the place, **do not fry naked**, flip eggs briefly before serving, this ensures whites are firm and yolk is runny.

Serve as eggs are cooked, ensure plates are collected promptly as eggs will continue to cook, ruining them. No one should be allowed in the kitchen until their eggs are served and should GTFO again with utmost expedience; observers break yolks.

Fry yourself an extra egg (cook's perks) and leave behind a mighty scene of culinary devastation for someone else to clear up.",0,1380529833,null,0,1380530198,0,cci3d79,t3_1necyy,t1_cci3d79,t3_1necyy,null,1429296111,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think it is sort of like some anti abortion advocates, I'm not sure they want abortion to stop (iirc, anti abortion legislation leads to lots of unregulated abortion practitioners who drink a lot of tea) so much as to eliminate it from the public sphere.

 In Victorian society there was a kind of split world of what actually went on and what people were supposed to be like in public, especially about sex. iirc this is still true in places where this kind of thinking about sex persists, like Iran and Saudi Arabia. I think something similar is true of some people who are against drug legalisation. 
There is also a pessimistic view of human nature (if you let people have more freedom it will result in a terrifying dystopia) and a criminal justice approach to social problems.

true,BitcoinJobe,,IBWT.co.uk - UK Exchange,"Negotiations with our banking partner ended months ago, ironically it turned out to be one of the easier steps (yes its a business account), yes they are ok with the IBWT business model (for various reasons, I can't disclose all the details, mainly because I did not feel the need to record any of my conversations with them). Please feel free to deposit then withdraw the minimum of Â£5 and you will notice the company name upon the account, not some individuals personal name.

This is the mark of the difference (and how you, and everyone can check) between a personal account and a business account.

There's a big list of banks which said 'no', ranging from ""AMAGAD BITCOIN IS THE DEVIL!!!"" (coughb'clayscoughstayawayfromthem!) to ""hmm, what is this bit-bit-coin?"" to ""it sounds very interesting, but we will have to wait for the market to grow/or a public statement from HM Treasury, feel free to get back to us then."" .. also a bit of ""hmm, any other banks doing it? No? well, when another bank does, then maybe we'll follow.""

I'm not going to give a list of names, because of confidentiality (hey, if you want to ask businesses around the UK which banks they've chatted with and who they now bank with, thats your choice, but as to whether all these business will tell a random stranger, I can't speak for that). And because after a while of operation we hope to approach some of the more favourable banks again.

We are still talking to a few banks, as I believe in multiple bank accounts, but mostly because I still want to convince banks of the legitimacy of bitcoin (and viable alt currencies).

It matters both what HM Gov says, and the banks (as you point out, most banks are a private industry, and the gov has no say on whether they allow or disallow bank accounts), but that is just my opinion.

----------

Just to add; 

The main 'issue' with banks in the UK has been that people generally 'operate' their bitcoin sales with 'personal' bank accounts. In every ToS in every personal account (yes, I've checked, but I am human, and prone to mistakes, and if someone corrects me and points out a personal account that can be used as a business account, I will stand corrected), people are expressly forbidden to use their personal account for business means.

For the most part, people in the UK have been blatantly ignoring this, and operating against their ToS (its not against the 'law' just against the ToS of a personal account). Hence the closing of peoples accounts.

If you're operating a 'selling bitcoins' operation from a personal account, then yes, eventually you will be in trouble and have your accounts frozen, there is a crack down going on (but thats just my guess, with my own theories, that are my own).

The other issue that people have faced is fraud, there are a LOT of scammers and fraudsters, especially in the UK. And there are also quite a few people with self-interest (greed, they don't want competition) who attack others (underhand attacks) and get their accounts closed (e.g. selling on localbitcoins to a competitor can result in your competitor reporting your bank account to your bank, this is unfortunately very easy to do).

Gox and sango unfortunately (though I understand why, and wish we could do the same), allowed unverified amounts to be transacted. If you notice Bitstamp is now enforcing full verification also.

I believe in competition and growth, I have tried being as open as possibly so that other people and companies will have the chance to enter this market. Unfortunately due to the aggressive attitude of certain people I'm not favourably inclined to go out of my way anymore, I do come here out of my own free time to try to assist, and I do think that competition = growth, yet some people are trying to stifle this growth (as mentioned). 

Those of us trying to make something in this brave new (bitcoin) world, not only face the challenges of government (which I give to you in open hands), but the banks (as you very well know), unfortunately we also face the challenges of those within the Bitcoin world that attack others (you should see the emails, hah).

It is worth noting that legally, if you are lying, then the Â£1,000 fine for selling alcohol to an under 18 is payable by the poor sap who actually served you, not the shop/pub/club. Please also bear in mind that they probably haven't seen an Aussie driving licence before, so don't give them a hard time if they do say no. They may also refuse to serve your friends. If they serve your mate &amp; the drink is for you, they still get fined. And let's be honest, if the poor sap had a grand going spare, do you really think they'd be behind the bar/checkout?

2. No idea - but they do do it &amp; never get into trouble for it. Friend of mine (I was there at the time - club was the Boulevard in Llandudno) had what the police later called Â£80's worth of cannabis in her handbag. She was searched &amp; detained until the police arrived and then she was arrested &amp; taken to a custody suite. She was later tried and fined for possession. No-one insinuated that the bouncers had been wrong to root through her handbag (if a boyfriend does it, it's dumping grounds) or to detain her until the police arrived.

3. Always err on the side of caution. A lot of little local places have stricter dress-codes than the big named places. There will often be rules about no football colours (Scot's pubs have this rule a LOT), no denim, no track/jog/shell suits, no footwear that could be considered sporty &amp; depending on where you drink, one place turned us down because I had leather jeans on. I was 21, they were skin tight &amp; I had a bloody good figure back then, so we went to the other bar on that street, where my mate got funny looks for having a shirt, trousers and shiny shoes on (bless him, but he had come straight from work).  If you can check out the dress-code before you go, otherwise, play it safe &amp; presume they will be strict about it. If you go to an indie/rock/biker/goth club, don't be suprised if they turn you away for looking a bit 'trendy' (jeans/white shoes). It does happen.

Also sometimes when he gets frustrated infront of goal he gets more and more desperate to score and then he shoots when he should pass, or snatches at chances.

Edin isn't one of the best in the world. He could be if he went on a good run of form, but at the moment he is way too hot and cold, although this season he has been much improved when starting. The stats for Dzecko btw - 7 games (1sub) 4 goals 1 assist. Negredo 8 games (5sub) 3 goals 3 assists.

So from 3 starts negredo has 3 assists, Edin has 1 from 6. Thats why people say he can set up goals, because he does. People blame Dzecko because he can waste opportunites over and over and never score, which has cost the whole team points in the past, If Negredo doesn't score he gets assists - see the United game where he assisted the 3rd and made runs which created the space for aguero's first and gave nasri space for the volley.

That already happens, you spud. Each week you are required to show your efforts to find a job or you are sanctioned and no longer receive benefits. If they have been on JSA for three years that is three years of them successfully showing their efforts to find a job.

As for the training - what benefits will litter-picking bring to the table in terms of training? Last year I was signed on and was required to attend a ""skills for work"" training course of this nature. It amounted to 7 days of paying out of my JSA to travel by public transport over 40 miles to the college it took place at, only to sit in a room for 8 hours after filling out two sides of A4 paper with questions on that amounted to:

""If you are asked to attend an interview, should you 

 1. Dress in pyjamas

 2. Dress in Jeans and a t-shirt

 3. Dress in a collared shirt, smart shoes and trousers, with a necktie?""

As we would have done at home, except for one difference: it cost Â£8 a day to do so, and we weren't able to leave to go and make speculative approaches to businesses in person by knocking on doors with a C.V.

Still though, glad I got my head down and filled out the six or seven A4 pages required to qualify for a L1 NVQ in ""skills for work"". I'd never have found employment without it!

Oh wait, I didn't, and am paying the entirety of my JSA for rent, then working 6 hours a day, 6 days a week logging and groundskeeping and volunteering at seniors' clubs then on to cook and clean for the people putting me up to earn my food and keep. With barely 90 minutes each morning to look for work, in a village with no work and barely any bus services to the wider world.

Reading it through my biggest concern is the capability of the job centre to actually facilitate this, in my experience, the Job centre is pretty much a waste of time and energy for all concerned, so big red flag right there.



&gt;Thirty hours a week for six months of community work such as making meals for the elderly, cleaning up litter and graffiti or charity work, plus 10 hours of âjob search activityâ.

The [BBC article on the subject](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24327470) phrases this in a different way, the Independent omits a choice in activity,

&gt;To still qualify for jobseeker's allowance they will have three options - work placements, such as cleaning up litter; daily visits to a job centre; or taking part in compulsory training, for example, to improve their literacy.

Putting concerns about the Job Centre aside, from a tax payers perspective this markets the benefit system as 'a salary to find work', you are being hired by the state to look for work and like any employer you are expected to meet certain conditions. As long as these conditions prioritize job seeking and skill development over the community service requirements (frankly a section I could have done without entirely) this could help retain, or instil a working routine in people that may be struggling to do that themselves. I know from personal experience self motivation is incredibly hard when you can see no reason to be so.

&gt;A mandatory intensive regime for claimants with underlying problems such as mental health, drug addiction or illiteracy.

This seems to be one of the most interesting parts, quite interesting language used, but it recognises that people do suffer problems that prevent work rather than being lazy or idle, and offers help for those that require it.

A less pricky response : The quote is more pointing out that as we make breakthroughs, the amount of work required to meet our needs decreases. If people have more time to learn, to think, to study things of their own conceit, more breakthroughs will be possible, as well as life being qualitatively better. The level of technology and knowledge we have as a global civilisation allows staggering amounts of work to be done in a fraction of the time compared to a mere few centuries ago.

Consider this. World population was estimated 1 billion in 1802. It is 7 billion now. In the interim, everything that is modern farming has come to be. The green revolution alone *doubled* food output in some places between 1940 and 1960. A single farmer can feed between 100 and 300 people according to a sourced quote in wikipedia.

To make a simple example : In the USA in 1800, 1.4 million people worked in agriculture, in a country of 5.3 million. Now about 4.1 million people work in agriculture, in a country of 316 million. And america is a top agricultural exporter. So it is overproducing, with a consumers:producers ratio of 77:1.

So why is everyone working full time? Why are some people having to work 60hours a week to have shelter and food for themselves and their family. What are all the people that no longer have to work all day growing just enough food to live, doing? We have a vast workforce and technology that is simply mind blowing. Yet, although we're better off than we were in the 1800s... but the gap isn't as wide as it should be.


At this point it seems like work is being made to waste the time of people that would otherwise be unemployed. Pointless busywork because 'I have to work why don't they'. The truth is, noone should have to work a 40 hour week. But we're all insane.

The public generally believe that she works hard and done a wonderful job, unlike our elected politicians. That said, according to Mark Bolland, former press officer for the royal family: ""The Windsors are very good at working three days a week, five months of the year and making it look as though they work hard"". For me, which vagina you came out of seems like a ridiculous way to select your head of state. If the monarchy didnât already exist, no-one would be suggesting we start it. Iâd much prefer a parliamentary republic like Germany, Italy, Ireland etc. Except, Iâd probably stop former MPs from standing. That said, I wouldnât be surprised if the population voted Mrs Windsor back in as president even if we did go republic.

Have a read of it -- almost every article has a governmental get-out clause.

Some samples:

&gt; 2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary: 
&gt; (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection. 

Insurrection being ""a rising against civil authority"" -- so... the government.

&gt; For the purpose of this article the term forced or compulsory labour' shall not include: 
&gt; (d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations. 

And civic obligations are defined by?  The government

&gt; No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:

And laws are ""prescribed"" by... government

&gt; Judgement shall be pronounced publicly by the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or __national security__ in a democratic society

Governments have historically used ""national security"" as a justification for all sorts of abuses.

&gt; There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. 

That's pretty much every get out covered.  ""for the protection of health or morals""?  WTF?

&gt; Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law 

&gt; The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the ...

""Health and morals"" again.

... bored now ... you get the idea.

Essentially: if you're relying on the ECHR to protect you from your government, you are in trouble.  You'd better hope that when the shit hits the fan, you've got some non-EU laws to wave at the jack boots.

Either you can buy a wheel from Raleigh (http://www.shopraleigh.co.uk/Product.aspx?pc=2&amp;pt=262&amp;pg=3063) - appears to be their cheapest rear 10-speed, or you learn to change tyres real quick. Oh, you'll need to buy rim tape and a cassette on top of the wheel. Oh, and you'll need to worry about matching the level of wear evenly on both cassettes to avoid chain problems. - or buy yourself a spanner and cassette removal tool and swap the cassette each time.

So, changing a tyre very quickly is probably going to be your better option.

Take air out of tyre. All of it.

Grab the wheel and place it between your feet, but positioned across your feet. The valve needs to be at the top. You need to brace the wheel with your feet to stop it moving, because you're about to apply some pressure to it.

Using both hands, starting either side of the valve, you need to half-grab the tyre between your thumb and forefinger, but you need to use your whole hand to get some pressure on.

You are going to now work your way around both sides of the tyre in opposite directions with both hands. You are 'stretching' the tyre around the rim, moving away from the valve.

Once you get perhaps two thirds of the way around the circumference, you will be able to pick up the wheel (still maintaining a good grip on the tyre with both hands) and 'push' your hands together.

You will notice a lovely gap appearing between the tyre bead and the rim, right between where your hands are. You can now pop the tyre clean off the rim by pushing it away from you with your thumbs (you didn't let go of the tyre, did you?).

This is the technique we use in the shop, where time=money and we need to be quick. It works.

true,cloew11,num42-away,,"""Fernando Torres should face at least a three-match ban for his spiteful, cowardly assault on Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen and the FA has the power to enforce such a punishment.
The incident, six minutes into the second half, was played out in all its ugliness on video replays.
Torres was chasing another lost cause down the touchline and petulantly tripped Vertonghen. The foul was needless and probably caused by Torresâ frustration at being shackled so effectively by the Belgian.

Referee Mike Dean saw the trip, but his view was not clear of the follow-up by the Spaniard, who grabbed his opponent and appeared to try and press a thumb into his face and scratch his cheek with his fingers.
You could see the spite on Torresâ face and there appeared to be an intention to cause harm. There is no place on the football field for such actions, which rugby sees too often and always cites and punishes with video evidence.
Letâs be clear here â Torres should have been sent off. And as the violent incident was clearly missed by all of the match officials, the FA can now have the incident reviewed by their disciplinary panel, which must surely recommend a suspension.
I would expect Dean to confirm that he would have sent off Torres had he had the chance to see the incident â any select group referee would have done so.

Torres later got his comeuppance when he was red-carded following an aerial clash with Vertonghen.
Thatâs where Jose Mourinho enters the drama. The Chelsea manager is a past master a creating smokescreens to try to cover up wrongdoing from his stars and pointing the finger at Vertonghenâs actions following Torresâs jump at him is merely that.
Mourinho tried to make the Spurs player the villain of the piece, suggesting that he pretended to have been assaulted by Torres.
At full speed it did look as though Torres had jumped into Vertonghen and the defenderâs reaction did not help Dean in determining what disciplinary action was correct.

Video replays confirmed that, in fact, Torres made little contact with the Spurs player, who was  perhaps frustrated at still having to face the Spaniard despite being assaulted 30 minutes earlier. 
The defender should be complimented for not reacting during the first incident. But it is a pity he did not do the same after the second as, by going to ground in dramatic fashion, he gave ammunition to Mourinho, who jumped on the opportunity to apportion blame.
Indeed, I wouldnât be surprised if Torresâ actions at White Hart Lane could be linked back to Mourinho. We know from the past that the Portuguese can draw the best from players by âwinding them upâ before a match.

He likes his players to play with fire in their bellies and that was certainly the case with Torres here as he tried to take the opportunity to show his manager that he is a better option than Samuel Etoâo.
Mourinho had painted himself as a âMr Happyâ when he returned to the Premier League. On Saturday we saw evidence of the old dark arts as he created mischief in an attempt to protect his players.
This will be the first case to be adjudicated by the FAâs new disciplinary panel and it will be fascinating to see what suspension Torres finally faces. I hope justice is done and a suspension of at least three games for violent conduct is served.
I also hope itâs a one-off from Torres, who looked like he was returning to form and should not need to resort to scratching and gouging.""",0,1380542687,null,0,false,0,cci4v7m,t3_1nfl3d,t1_cci4v7m,t3_1nfl3d,null,1429295410,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

Some of your favourite TV programs won't be on TV because studying Drama and Theatre Studies is pointless.

The NHS would be in more dire straits because of the lack of non-medical staff.

High Schools up and down the country urgently needing teachers for non-STEM subjects, effecting children's education in a very big way.  

/u/bioscio has even asked a question on ELI5 about post-Colonial Africa. Without ""useless"" subjects like Sociology or History, for example, no one would be able to properly answer that question.  

Gosh, imagine a country without counsellors and the knock-on effects that will have on mental health, because studying counselling/psychology is useless!  

Imagine a country without Social Workers!

The key point being _powerful_, and specifically Chamberlain's misreading of it.  Stalin condemned the Munich Agreement, which they were not invited to attend, and said the Allies were trying to ensure Germany and Russia fought and that Russia wouldn't fight Germany on her own without Western assistance. Molotov suggested if Russia didn't secure an alliance with the West in short order they'd be forced into a defensive pact.  But Chamberlain  thought Russia was too weak to choose as an ally, and even - perhaps contemptuously - sent their relatively junior negotiators to the Soviet Union by slow boat without the proper papers to negotiate, whereas the Germans showed all the pomp and ceremony calculated to flatter the arrogant Uncle Joe and sent their top brass.

They were resposible for *our* economy, and failed to respond in a way that could accommodate the US bubble, in part because of the no-questions approach with our banks' lending policies (and a total refusal to bother with regulation - at the insistence of the financial genius Gordon Brown), not helped by spend-spend-spend approaches (note how much our debt went up by under them), vote-winner tax raises that did little in reality (like the 50p rate), a complete refusal to even *acknowledge* an immigration problem (to the point of the PM calling people 'bigoted' for even asking about it), leading on to the money they assumed that immigrants would raise (but didn't), a whole slew of 'this'll solve the problem' spending announcements from GB (that didn't), such as the selling of half our gold reserves when they were at their lowest price...faced with all the above, it's actually quite hypocritical to start using words like peddling, absurd and ignorant because the party in power that you don't like didn't sort out 14 years of fuckups in their first two, especially when they have chosen instead to snipe at the current bunch instead of producing anything like a reasonable alternative.",0,1380544924,null,0,1380567318,0,cci58ai,t3_1ndkg7,t1_cci58ai,t1_cci33uk,null,1429295240,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Come on you can't be serious? Look at their statistics over the past 6 seasons in goalscoring and assists - Negredo wins almost every year apart from 2007/8 I think. If you think Dzeko is a better player than him you simply aren't looking at the facts. 

The problem with Edin is that he is too poor in possession of the ball to lead the line for a team who play possession football. He is decent at holding it up, strong in the air and can be a clinical finisher, but his technical game isn't good enough to sustain a regular starting place. Too many stray passes, too many miscontrolled balls that lose us possession. Negredo is quite a lot better than Dzeko in that regard. 

Case in point - third goal against Utd in the derby, Negredo's assist was something that Dzeko could only dream of being able to do.

Add into this that they are already comparatively demoralised after losing Mogadishu, a large scale targetted bombing campaign is much more likely to result in the destruction and disbanding of their organisation.

At worst, we make terrorists hate us slightly more, which is kind of a null point considering they already hate us and are plotting terrorist acts against civilians and are constrained by a lack of military and economic assets, which would be reduced by an attack. We can expect to greatly reduce their military capacity with few to no civilian casualties. At best, we break their group up. This would benefit Kenya, Somalia and the region.

People don't like spending the money because they can't see what they're getting in return for it. I've literally heard, from otherwise intelligent people, that they don't understand why they have to fork out a few hundred quid for ""a few internet searches"". Buying a house is expensive and frustrating by itself, and people are likely to be counting every last penny. Conveyancing costs are something people regard as red tape and bureaucracy.

I'm painfully familiar with conveyancing, however, and know that it involves a great deal of proper work. I'm shocked that any complete transaction could be done properly for under Â£350 and even then it seems cheap. I mean, one negligence claim could do some real damage to insurance..

Personally I detest the bulk online conveyancing thing, it hugely diminishes the work a conveyancer does and makes it sound like a formality. Why would someone pay Â£350+ when someone online will just 'fill in the forms' for Â£99..

Another thing I hate is hidden charges. Firms who advertise a cheap 'price' for conveyancing but fail to mention stuff until the client has signed up. Â£50 charge for filling in an SDLT form, Â£15 postage/stationery, I've even seen Â£25 'contribution to insurance'.

true,BloodyToothBrush,wardr,Hurt,"There was a discussion in /r/gallifrey about this episode that ended up comparing the true exit of the ponds to when they left at the end of The God Complex. Here is a pretty interesting write up of what /u/jimmysilverrims had to say. 

&gt; I think most peoples qualm with how the Ponds were handled is that we already got a splendid goodbye for them... back in The God Complex.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Amy gets over her obsession with the Doctor and stops seeing him as this infallible figure that she always has to wait for. The Doctor gives a heartfelt goodbye and leaves them with a home and a future to make for themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Doctor fakes his death to protect them and decides to drop off the grid. They lead their own normal lives that the Doctor knows he can never have. For once we get a nice (if rather melancholy) conclusion to a companion's story.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; BUT River has to tell them that the Doctor's not dead before the episode even ends and the Doctor visits them for Christmas in the very next episode.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When the Ponds come back in Series Seven A, there's no real reason for them to be there.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They just hang around, the Doctor pops in with the occasional adventure and their inevitable departure looms over their entire last season. They're the old guard just hanging around while the show twiddles its thumbs for half a season.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To, in the end, The angels Take Manhattan contrasts harshly with The God Complex. One departure happened fairly unexpectedly and completed a character's arc, feeling satisfying and different from the other New Who departures.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The other everybody saw coming from a mile away. It was overdone, slammed the last nail in the coffin of the withered husk that is the Weeping Angels concept, and felt like the usual ""they're not dead but the Doctor still must never meet them because of some wibbly wobbly nonsense"" that we already saw in Rose and Donna's departures.
&gt; 
&gt; 


&gt; 
&gt; In essence, The God Complex made me feel for the Ponds without really trying. The Angels Take Manhattan overtly and some might say tactlessly tried to yank for my heartstrings and it just comes out as trying way too hard.

Do you see the difference?

I'm not denying that drug laws need reforming, I completely agree with that. It just winds me up when people try to portray drug users as innocent victims as opposed to just being undisciplined idiots with a lack of self control.

If you die through taking drugs you only have yourself to blame, nobody else. Nobody made you stick that needle into your arm, over and over again until you develop an addiction. Nobody made you buy those dodgy pills off that shady guy in a club toilet. It is 100% your fault, no one else's.

Don't think I'm trying to say that you deserve to die from taking drugs,  or that I have no compassion for people who do. I empathize with how shitty it must be to have a drug dependency. I just think that rather than expecting the government to take full responsibility for ensuring that drugs are provided to people safely,  people should have the personal responsibility to, you know, not do drugs. Or at least do them safely.

And again, just to stop people jumping on the hate bandwagon. I am fully supportive of drug law reform, many problems in society could be vastly reduced by changing existing drug laws.

We moved into a rented flat that had blinds already in place, we hadn't even thought about the blind cords being a hazard, and we didn't know these safety devices existed, we'd never had a house with roller blinds before. 

One day I'm sat in the living room doing work (I work from home), my wife in the kitchen, my son (aged 3 at the time) playing in his bedroom just across the hallway when I hear a scream, which would have been pretty normal for him as he is know to scream and shout a bit, but this was a different scream, it just felt wrong, so I ran in to find him with the cord around his neck crying and gasping for air. If I had put it down to him playing and screaming like he usually does it would have been much worse or even fatal. 

It took just seconds to get him free, but it felt like a long time, the cord was removed and he was fine, we checked him over, he had a nasty mark on his neck for about a week where the cord had rubbed on it, but he was fine if very clingy for a few days.

After a google for safety devices we went out to find some. It was very difficult to find some without having to buy a blind or a fitting kit, and when the hook is fitted correctly it's very difficult for anything to get caught up in them and you can't get the cord free without removing the hook device.

That may be true yes. But there's a difference between proving that drugs can be used safely, and trusting people to actually do it safely.

There's a vast gulf of difference between a few friends smoking weed together, or popping a few pills and injecting heroin or smoking crack.

Harder drugs (Heroin, Meth, Crack, MCat) ruin peoples lives and really, really fuck you up. Providing easier access to these substances really isn't the way forward.

You realise that the number of people abusing the system is fractional, right? According to my memory, at least, but it's somewhere in the region of 0.7-1.5% of all claimants are claiming with no desire to actually work. You don't legislate by the minority.

No, because the legality of drugs stops very few people. They're everywhere anyway. If you're a person who wants to do them, there's really not much of a barrier if you know more than 10 people. Someone will know a dealer.  

Prohibition didn't work in the US and you just had people going blind while drinking moonshine and the criminals ran the whole alcohol industry making millions tax free..

Personally, I think you'd see a decrease in drug use if it were made legal. I have a feeling it would become socially unacceptable to be completely mashed and therefore there'd be peer pressure from society in general not to do it. 

The people who still decided to get mashed on the drug of their choice would still do so, of course, but at least they'll have pure and quality product so they at least know they're not going to do morphine accidentally and drop dead. 

Legalize it, tax it, ring fence the tax income for drug eduction and rehabilitation.

Since I'm off to the warehouse project later this year, and it's likely others on here might also be going there, I'll just leave some information about PMA, since it's a likely candidate for the death last night.

There have been a number of people in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland killed this year by pills which contain PMA. Whether by stupidity or greed, PMA seems to be out there in some pills at the moment so it's best to know how to test for it and what the symptoms are.

Standard Marquis tests won't pick it up (you'll get no reaction at all), however since PMA could conceivably be mixed with MDMA a positive marquis result for MDMA doesn't mean your pill is PMA free. to test for PMA you need the robadope test, which turns red when PMA (and certain other drugs) is present.

One of the hallmarks of PMA is that it has a really long come up (maybe 3-4 hours), but otherwise can feel similar to MDMA. This can lead to people taking more pills since they think that they've got weak pills, when instead they've got PMA. This is extremely dangerous because PMA is effective in smaller doses than MDMA, and has a much steeper dose/response curve. This makes it far to easy to overdose. so for fuck's sake, if your pill has a long come up/doesn't feel strong DON'T TAKE ANY MORE. double dropping unknown pills is a bad idea for similar reasons.

Signs of PMA intoxication can include rapid slurred speech, confusion, vomiting, overheating and muscle spasms. If any of these things start happening to someone who's with you then for fuck's sake get them to a hospital pronto.

As for the actual pills, currently there's no information. Pillreports says that some green pills with a dollar sign on them were found to contain PMA in late July in Swindon, but it's entirely possible that a new press was used for this batch. So be careful, test your shit and try to buy from a trusted source.

Media reports are suggesting that the man who died was from Gloucester, unconfirmed reports that those taken ill were his friends from down there. This is pretty close to Swindon, so it's entirely possible that the pills above are to blame, as the guys could have brought their own from down that way. Nontheless, best to be doubly sure and test and not buy at the venue.

Basically in order to teach at a state funded school (academies, universities and private schools can do what they want) you need to have QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) by taking an ITT (Initial Teacher Training) course. You can gain QTS in a number of ways:

* Undergrad - not needed in your case but there are 3/4 year undergrad courses that will give you QTS

* Postgrad - i.e PGCE this is completely separate from your current post grad degree although having the postgrad degree may help you get in as it means you exceed the entry requirements which are typically an undergrad degree.

* [School based training](http://www.education.gov.uk/get-into-teaching/teacher-training-options/school-based-training.aspx) - you're essentially fitting a PGCE around full time work at a school over a year and get QTS at the end. SCITT and Teach First are good examples of these types of courses.

Have a look at the School based ones if you don't want to spend more time at uni.

Quite strict with ID.  That's because bouncers are licensed and things like that can cost them their (expensive) license.  So it's not in their interest to just let people slide.  There is no issue with international ID.  That's fine.  I've allowed drivers licenses from overseas before.  That's personal judgement though and it can vary.  

No bouncers can't legally detain you.  Especially not on the street.  But can demand to search you and if you refuse then throw you out or refuse you entry.  The reason you see them doing that, and I actually have too is because people don't know that they can't.  Also... person being detained is usually drunk anyway.  Police seem cool with it too, turning up to fight bouncers holding somebody down for them.  Many a time I've held people down for the police.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;Do you see the difference?

I see that you're trying to suggest there's a difference, but I disagree with your analogy. 

Let's try a different analogy then - it's like buying meat from a market trader and taking his word for it that it's safe.

&gt; It just winds me up when people try to portray drug users as innocent victims as opposed to just being undisciplined idiots with a lack of self control.

That's not really what happens though, nor are they the 'idiots' you're portraying them as.

&gt;If you die through taking drugs you only have yourself to blame, nobody else. Nobody made you stick that needle into your arm, over and over again until you develop an addiction. Nobody made you buy those dodgy pills off that shady guy in a club toilet. It is 100% your fault, no one else's.

That's not quite how it happens. I've known someone who got onto heroin because she'd been prescribed an opiate painkiller for an injury and was given a smacky spliff to take the edge off the withdrawal from that. Her fault and choice? Maybe, but not quite the circumstances you're portraying. 

And that 'shady guy in a pub toilet' might have been trusted - even by the 'security' at that pub or club, because he'd previously been known to sell safe and good stuff and had been seen to take his own stuff before to demonstrate it was okay and test it, but unknown to him, something changed in his supply chain. A lot of clubs will have 'official' dealers for the very reason that they don't want a reputation for people dying in them, and the bouncers will chuck out any dealers except for the 'safe' ones. And right or wrong, but some people see this as a guarantee of sorts. 

It doesn't always work, but it does mean that you're slightly uninformed if you just think that there are no attempts at quality control whatsoever and no assurances given about 'good stuff'. But yeah, it goes wrong.

&gt; I just think that rather than expecting the government to take full responsibility for ensuring that drugs are provided to people safely, people should have the personal responsibility to, you know, not do drugs. Or at least do them safely.

We still live in a democracy, so try looking at it this way - instead of people wanting the government to 'take responsibility' and abdicating it themselves, they want to give the government a mandate to look after as many people as possible, and this is another way of doing so. It's altruism, not avoidance.

I don't think it's that much of a coincidence that us and arsenal are at the top as we've had very similar opening fixtures (one match vs a top team, at home). Man City's start is more disappointing as they've also only played the one top side and that was at home. However I still see them as favourites to win the league.

The only problem for us with the way things have started is that the clubs not getting great results now (particularly man city and chelsea) are highly likely to climb the league through the season and fight it out for the title once their huge squads kick in and other teams tire. On the other hand the two teams likely to fall away (spurs and arsenal) have also had great starts and they're likely the ones we'll have to challenge for 4th place.

The linkup between Suarez and Sturridge is only the start. When you think about it, they weren't on the field together all that much last year thanks to injuries/Suarez' sweet tooth. This will only get better, we just need to be patient and support the team through any losing streaks that come.

I think numbers 3 &amp; 4 are nicer than the others, but I'm still not a big fan. They all look a bit Fisher-Price to me, I don't get any sense of heritage or history. 

The 'Fisher-Price' thing sounds kinda harsh, so I'll try to explain what I mean by that. I think it comes from the way you approached the aim of simplifying and making sure the crest can be reproduced well at small sizes. Personally I'd prefer that to be done by simplifying the shapes, while your designs (mostly talking about the ribbons, some of the wreaths, and some of your tower designs) seem to take a different approach and exaggerate elements like the tower outline &amp; the curls at the banner ends into broader/larger strokes. And the result of that is that everything seems so *busy*. I mean, as you quite rightly pointed out in blogs, trying to put the tower and the name inside the badge can be a bit difficult to do without leaving a ton of empty space that looks like something's missing, but I think a lot of your designs go too far in the other direction.

The main theme I find a big problematic through all of them is the tower. I think trying to represent the actual tower is the wrong way to go about it. For me at least, there's no real attachment to the real-life tower. Looking before this season, it's a long time since any Everton crest had more than a passing resemblance to the real-life building. And frankly, it's an ugly building. The towers used from the 70s up until last season didn't look much like the real one, but were much more aesthetically pleasing to my eye (even if a bit fussy with all the brick lines) and I think going back to the tall/narrow form is one of the things they've done right with the proposals for next season (which I don't think are great, but I do prefer over this season's and over your designs).

Of course it does, especially when your job demands some physicality. One-armed people can drive without problems, but that doesn't mean they can drive 'just as well'.

&gt;How you can compare that to a blind pilot, just suggests maybe you need special help before submitting your thoughts

Wow, your apparent attitude to insulting the disabled doesn't last long, does it? Especially considering that I'm not really attacking disabled people in any way at all. Maybe you should listen more and hand-wring less.

&gt;2: in real life people have disabilities and pretending to your kid that they don't doesn't do disabled people, or your kids, or society any favours

Again you disappear up your own outrage instead of addressing what I actually said. I didn't say 'she's disabled, she shouldn't be on kids TV', I said 'why present disability as a dead-end?'.

Employed people on all levels have to budget their salary sufficiently to provide for transport to their work place, very few companies will help with that cost. So looking at benefits as ""salary to job hunt"" there really is no difference but payments would be sufficient to achieve both essentials and transport as a minimum.

That said, people with a history of work/currently employed have a greater degree of freedom to change employment should the costs out way the benefits, which unemployed people may not without suspension of future benefits. The onus is on the Job centre to find suitable placements (again need to hear that the JC is being improved to facilitate all this), but perhaps also on the applicant to work for less than desirable profit. I have personally known people to return to work for being less than Â£1 better off a week, not going to pretend its great but it is the only way to improve in the long term.

In this there is the potential to ""black hole"", where you cannot afford transport to meet the requirements being set, therefore your funding is removed.

When I was referring to 2.5 million unemployed and able to work adults, I was only quoting the ILO figure which is used widely to give a brief snapshot of the labour market in each quarter as this is the period over which it's measured. It's a fairly accurate representation which defines unemployed partly as actively seeking a job. This deliberately excludes those who are not actively seeking, removing the ""daily mail definition"" of lazy.

If you look into it for any amount of time, it quickly becomes pretty clear that the steady group of lazy people is essentially non-existent.
As for waiting for the right job, that's a luxury most unemployed people can't afford if they have no savings or support to fall back on. JSA requires you to take on any unemployment that's offered that they feel is suitable and to show that you are trying to seek employment. It's not the easy to game system that the conservatives are currently trying to convince everyone that it is.

another quick edit to clear up my assertion that the group of lazy people on JSA is small. This guardian article explains the figures in a much clearer way than I could:
http://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2013/apr/24/benefits
It also gives you a source for the data on unemployment benefit if you wish to look into it a little more yourself.

I do believe that the badge that will be chosen will be hailed as the fan's choice and thus validated as a true democratic fans selection. However, the reality is a 3rd party design team interpreted a linear, multiple-choice survey and came up with 3 designs which don't offer any option for alternative input. The train has left the station now buddy and your parcel will reach Everton and I don't see how they will be able to utilize it due to the current process structure.

&gt; They all look a bit Fisher-Price to me

Yes, this really bothers me as well. It was a criticism levied against the 2013 badge, and it is warranted here. You hint at similar reasons, and I think the elements that do it are the thick line weights and rounded corners (which by the way, is where I think the FP association comes from - plastic toys with rounded edges so kids don't poke their eyes out). I think the remedy for this is a broad exploration of different line weights (thinner - less FP) as well as, as you mentioned, different ribbon treatments. Bolton's ribbon is very simple and modern, but with sharp edges resulting in little or no FP feeling.

With more bandwidth I would have explored more from a stylistic execution standpoint, but real life calls. I did have a few explorations with different weights etc. but I elected to present all with the same style, perhaps this was a mistake. My concern was that they would be compared on execution style vs composition, whereas in reality they could all be pushed in a number of different stylistic directions.

&gt; I think trying to represent the actual tower is the wrong way to go about it. For me at least, there's no real attachment to the real-life tower.

I don't entirely disagree, but I've proceeded based on that client directive. I do think that these could (should) be reworked with a significant amount of tower explorations - perhaps some that get away from the ""authentic"" directive.

&gt; All-in-all, I liked most of the concepts you talked about in the blogs, but I'm not keen on your execution. I hope this doesn't come across as too harsh.

Not at all too harsh. In the end, I'm a far more capable branding strategist than designer. 

Even if I was a world-class brand designer, the fact that I am one guy sitting alone until 3am working on this does not bode well for a brilliant solution. Even the best designers suffer from design-blindness at a point - they've been staring at something far too long to view it objectively. It takes a team - directors, strategists, designers who bring different execution styles - to really vet and identify solutions. 

If this were a real branding exercise, these would again be the launching point for yet another round - perhaps pushing on the fronts you've identified. One step forward, two steps back is not unusual, and often a good idea.

Thanks!

This isn't an ASDA head office error or a ""muahaha i'm tricking you"" scenario. This is a human, store level error. All that happened was the person doing the price changes at 6am just never removed the plastic price insert.

That price label is made up of two things (for offers):

1.  A white price label, which is printed off from a mobile printer. 

2. And a separate yellow/red transparent plastic (2 for Â£4) label which goes in front/overlaps the printed white label. (The signs are reused, it's just the white label that is thrown away)

The offer was probably previously Â£2.50 with the (2 for Â£4) insert, but when the price was lowered to Â£2,  the person that printed it off to replace the previous price didn't remove the (2 for Â£4) insert due to tiredness, being 6am, because fuck it minimum wage or they were distracted (""Um, hi, could you tell me where the tea and coffee aisle is?"")

The more our debt increases, and more specifically the rate at which our debt increases is key.  If our cost of borrowing increases that only perpetuates the issue.

Worst case scenario we are unable to refinance our maturing gilts and the government technically defaults. We have avoided that now, but it was a real threat when the latest government came to power.  Labours policy of spending out of the crisis could have been disastrous and the coalitions policy of fiscal responsibility was praised by our creditors.

A country is not a household no, but our debt cannot keep increasing indefinitely and neither can QE without causing inflationary problems.  Where do you think the money will come from?  The most sensible thing to do is reduce wastage in key areas in order to reduce the rate at which the deficit increases.  The deficit will still be increasing, but slower.

I like that the main danger of taking MDMA is listed as:

&gt;A big problem with ecstasy is that itâs rarely pure. You canât be sure whatâs in it and you canât predict how youâll react. Sometimes, there is no MDMA at all. Though a recent study found that in some parts of the country the amount of MDMA in ecstasy was increasing.

So basically, the worst thing about taking MDMA is it might not be MDMA. Lol. 

It also has some good advice for people looking to try it:

&gt;Some people have been known to take another âEâ when they haven't yet felt the expected âhighâ of their first âEâ. The danger then is that both Es kick in at once and youâve got a double dose of effects to deal with.

The odd part is that I haven't expressed one.

&gt;so people should be presented as oddities

Who said that? You did.

&gt;that need fixing rather than as a normal part of the world?

Do you wear glasses? Have you ever taken antibiotics? Why? Why did you feel the need to change? Aren't you insulting people that can't afford them or don't feel the need?

&gt;never mind that the contradicts showing them 'working around their problems'.

Sure, let's make the disabled person drag themselves to that bus instead of using a chair. After all, we wouldn't want to highlight their 'oddness' or cause a contradiction.

&gt;you dont think shes physically up to the job of presenting tv because it took her longer to play cards 

Again, you're saying stuff I didn't say, as well as being another redditor who wants to argue that having one hand is no different to having two.

&gt;what counts a disability anyway? 

The clue is in the word.

&gt;being particularly tall could be. but the cameras dont reach that high, and we cant film them from below because it makes them look terrible, also the sets not that tall. or we could just sit them down.... what a genius work around to that terrible disability.

Or point the camera up?

&gt;but dont worry kids, this strange freak person is only going to be onscreen for 10 minutes and im sure 1 day we'll find a cure for his hideous affliction

You mean like Chewbacca?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; So what you're saying is basically that no disabled person should ever be given a job, because of the 2.5 million unemployed in this country, there's sure to be someone who is more capable?

Wouldn't I have said that?

&gt;You think that we should ""show any viewing children with problems how they can overcome them"", however Cerrie Burnell seems to be managing that perfectly well

That's an unprovable assertion. As I've said already, acclimbatising children to disabilities is a good thing, but I consider showing them *hope* to be more important. How can you confirm that the thousands/ tens of thousands of children watching wouldn't be more comforted by seeing a demonstration of a similar disability being compensated for by science or medicine? You don't begrudge a blind person a stick, do you? What if they insist they don't need one when they obviously do?

&gt;notwithstanding your criticisms.

Nowhere did I comment on her presenting ability, outside of the physicial limitations.

&gt;""if she can do it, if Cerrie can be on TV, maybe I can follow my dreams, too!""

And they can't do that by seeing how their own issues can be fixed directly so that they don't have to worry about accounting for their disability in the first place? They have to stay (for example) one-armed instead?

&gt;Your talk of ""advances in science"" seems to show a woeful misunderstanding of the very nature of disability.

true,Blubbey,null,null,"Now Bale has gone the goals have to come from somewhere and Paulinho is now looking like the player was hyped to be. He can attack well in different ways - passing, movement (driving runs, drawing players away for example) and goals. 3 goals *already* this season, Dembele and Sandro scored 3 total last year. That's definitely helping him. It might not sound like much but if he can get 10+ goals this year that'll be huge for the team.

Sandro looked much more attacking against Villa but that was a severely weakened Villa. In general Dembele and Paul are a well balanced pair, both can attack (Paul more so), both can hold, both can bring the ball out, both can defend more than adequately etc. Sandro is the better defensive option but that's not what's needed, Soldado needs better service then he can start firing them in which Paul can help with much more than Sandro (from previous form). With Sig scoring more consistently so far than last year and with Lamela, Eriksen etc and looking at the games this year I'd take the more attacking option, that's Paul.

Obviously there's still a way to go, the system is quite ""safe"", sometimes you see a pass you'd think they could do but in the end possession is retained instead of chancing it (playing a winger/striker through for example). I respect that, but I'd like to see more chances taken, but again that can still come. I'd love to see Dembele slightly more attacking, taking shots and driving into the box more when he can too.

Having said that I probably have a slightly different take on it to others and I'm sure many will disagree! Personally I think electronic music has become 'cool' in the past 5 years or so whereas before it was much more underground. This has basically led to previously small, underground, community-driven clubnights being frequented by 18 year old students, groups of friends that have no idea who is playing etc - and unfortunately a good chunk of these people just want to go to take drugs and get off their face whilst not giving a fuck about the music that's on. When a type of music associated with drugs becomes more mainstream a lot of drug-inexperienced people will be on board and a lot of dealers will try to capitalise on it the best they can and accidents will happen. 

I saw the same thing happen at Sankeys - when I first started to go 5 years ago the place was always friendly, not overly packed, safe and with a good atmosphere. In the year or 2 before it shut it was rammed every week, full of aggressive twats who just went because it was Sankeys and the number of people out of their minds (including coke, a horrible club drug) went through the roof. Basically stopped going after that and certainly don't miss the place now. The cycle will continue and 'edm' music will drop off in popularity and clubs will be nice places to go once again

Secondly, though I fully agree that drugs like these should be legalised and controlled I have little sympathy for people buying drugs in clubs from people they've never met, not testing the drug for purity first and taking cocktails just to get fucked up.

It is indeed - there's an obvious value in it in getting children used to the unsual, and some afflictions will take longer to cure than others - I just don't see why we can't leap-frog that stage to teach kids the value of science and what it *will* do, not just what it has done, especially when their quality of life is involved.

&gt;Either way, it has no real impact on her presenting ability imo.

Well, I haven't really grasped yet why everyone has gone so Jack Ryan on this; missing an arm doesn't cancel her presenting ability outright, but there are thousands young hopefuls that would all do just as good a job, which leads to the conclusion that she's been chosen to tick the disabled box. All very admirable, but if you take on that responsibility I believe it's then your first priority to bring hope and show solutions to those afflicted with a side benefit of other children then being less frightened of the unknown, not using an untreated disability for the benefit of exposure.

Look at it this way - how cool do you think kids would find if if Carrie *did* have a robot arm? My son would be pretty much convinced she was a superhero.

See what you're doing there? You're actually *defining* their full potential, as if that cannot change regardless of physical/ mental ability. But to address the point - if I'm good at running, and I don't bother, then I'm not living up to my potential. Now, if I don't have legs, and the options are there, am I living up to my potential by treating them as optional?

However, I think that AVB should have been quicker to bring on someone like Sandro when Mata started dicing our ""attack-minded"" midfield.  Dembele was having a MOTM game though, and Paulinho has been amazing all season, therefore, it is hard to justify subbing one of them even when the situation dictates.  I think that bring Chadli on was supposed to bring some more strength to mid without messing with the Dembele/Paulinho chemistry that had been working all game.

Also without Bale we need to create chances, not just 30 yard bombs.  More attacking midfielders are necessary to do that.

The article seems to be predicated on the idea that the ~~devolution~~ independence vote is stirring up some anti-Scottish hatred south of the border and that hasn't been my experience. It leads on the fact the English use Jock as a pejorative. Is that common? Not in my experience. Personally, I'll be sad to see Scotland go from an emotional and irrational point of view; the breaking of a long term relationship is frequently sad. 

However I quite understand why ~~devolution~~ independence is attractive from a Scots point of view and from a logical perspective don't feel jilted.

What you are suggesting would require an extensive structural redesign of the entire ship. It's a very complicated change and the cost would be prohibitive, which is exactly why the coalition govt had to make the humiliating change back to the F-35B. 

It's not just that you need to install the catapults and arrestor gear, it's that the space where you would put this has now already got stuff in it, so you would have to gut the ship and change everything.

Also, nobody is seriously considering a navalised Typhoon, it would cost a large sum to develop and there is no market for it. You already have the F-35B, F-35C, F/A-18E/F/G, Rafale, MiG-29K, Su-33, Shenyang J-15 and HAL Tejas all available to nations with carriers, of whom there are not many. India itself already flies the MiG-29K and will probably buy their indigenous Tejas as well, to say nothing of the fact that the Indian airforce has already decided to buy the Rafale to fulfil the MMRCA requirement.

The thrust vectoring version of the EJ-2000 hasn't been approved either! On top of this you need to strengthen the fuel tanks, landing gear, arrestor gear, avionics, and just about everything else if you want to make the Typhoon seaworthy. The stresses of arrested landing and catapult takeoffs just aren't the same as the stresses put on an airframe by dogfighting. Also, there *isn't* a prototype. There has been a suggestion made, but no real work towards it.

A navalised Typhoon would cost a very large amount to develop, would take years, has very almost nonexistent chances of gaining exports and wouldn't be as capable as many of the alternatives already or imminently available.

No-one else here has a fixation but you - the rest of us have *consideration* for those with disabilities.

It's not about ""keeping"" someone disabled, it's about acceptance of the fact that a disability is for life. In many cases, at least, and certainly in the case of amputees and others with missing limbs.

We'd all be delighted if that weren't the case, and limbs could be grown back in a vat, but that's not reality.

People keep returning to this argument as if our laws are the ultimate guide for morals. There are countless actions that are demonstrably immoral, but still legal. There legality isn't really a good argument for doing them. As for the shareholders, the executives also have a duty to them to not bring the company into disrepute.

Living standards improve generation upon generation. If they do not then one of the major incentives to produce, under the capitalist system, is removed.

Living standards improved for much of the Twentieth Century and that improvement only slowed when deregulation started taking effect.

While it is true that growth can and does happen at different rates it is also true that recessions can be minimised and also the damage that they do can be minimised by strict regulation of markets. 

So if there is a slow rate of growth in the economy there should, correspondingly, be a slow growth in living standards. Instead there is a decline. That's why it is regression.

A hostile environment for illegal immigrations. What is wrong with that? They are ILLEGAL immigrants.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; Well, that's all we can extrapolate from your statements about Ms Burnell's ""capabilities"" and ""more suitable candidates"".

Which I was making to point out that she wasn't chosen on ability alone, hence I think I have a valid viewpoint on how disabilities are presented. You could always ask questions instead of intepreting my statements to fit with your assumptions about my opinion. It'll probably be quicker.

&gt;Have you asked Ms Burnell's audience about her abilities? I mean, presumably your kids watch this show - have you sat down with them and asked them if they like her? If they think she's a good presenter? 

I'm not sure they like her any more or less that the others, but they asked about her arm, and we told her some people are just born like that. I told them about robot arms, and showed them a youtube video - and they immediately wanted to know why she didn't have one. How do you explain to a child that someone *chooses* to live with one arm?

&gt;You have astonishing confidence in science and medicine

What makes you say that? Are you suggesting that no astonishing discoveries have been made at all in the past ten years? Or that this will not continue? Regrowing ears/ eyes/ lungs? Disease treatment? Or are they all pointless if your specific malady can't be cured right now?

&gt;and, as I've said in another comment, no idea about the realities of prosthetics. 

You're still using the present to dismiss the future?

&gt;There is nothing ""obvious"" about other people's needs - part of training to be a doctor or a surgeon is that one should listen to the patient.

Listening is not the same as being ordered or dictated to by the patient. Ask any nurse how children react when they walk for the first time in prosthetics....and now I think of it, stop applying adult problems and attitudes to them.

&gt;Your claims that you know more about disabilities than the quadruple amputee reading your words is just astonishing.

I didn't claim that, so well done for being so astonished. You really need to start quoting unless you just like typing. Are you asserting that all quadruple amputees are guaranteed to be so for life?

&gt;We'd all be delighted if that weren't the case, and limbs could be grown back in a vat, but that's not reality.

Again, you're using the now to dismiss the future. I'm not sure how many ways I can explain that this isn't just about the now. We're not talking about adult viewers but child ones.

&gt;Because you should know that that's science fiction, and science fiction doesn't always come true

Who was it that said that Science Fiction wasn't if, but when? For example, how long ago would you have said that the partially-formed eye, grown from stem cells, was science fiction?

&gt;Your talk of ""robot arms"" places a great deal of faith in your ability to predict the future.

Right, because the already existing videos for all to see will remain a niche and have no future at all. Robot exoskeletons (again, already in existence) will not be developed in any way at all...

&gt;Perhaps you we can develop some robot empathy or optical enhancements for you, because you don't seem to be very good at reading what disabled people have told you.

Really? Count how many times I've had to point out that you're not actually referring to what I've said, or how you're talking about the past and this is really about the future. I'd say you've illustrated how some people can't move past the now, disabled or no.

All I'm saying is that we should listen to disabled people and see if prosthetics are helpful. 

Cerrie Burnell has been rejecting prosthetics since she was a kid because she finds they get in her way and hinder her. (Many amputees have the same experience.)

Are you saying she's kidding herself? Because that's what it looks like.

It looks like you talk about ""potential"" and ""hope"" when it suits you, and now you're going to talk about what example disabled adults should set for disabled children.

You're telling disabled adults, who have lived through the experience of being disabled children, how they should present themselves in the media to disabled children.

covers the reasons why our political class is really against it.

&gt;The Elephant in the room
Whilst it is claimed that JK Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book in Edinburghâs Elephant House cafÃ©, many reports discount this. It was in fact written partly at a different cafÃ© called Nicolsonâs, now the Spoon restaurant on Nicolson Street. It was frequented by Rowling because it was owned by her brother in law. The writer stayed for a time with her sister and brother in law when she first arrived in Edinburgh.

I did know this however. I'm always surprised by how shamelessly The Elelphant Room promote themselves as the one and only cafe she wrote at (she wrote at many but mostly her sister's one).

It is borne upon the governing bodies to provide sustainable growth. Successful governments of all stripes have failed to do that. People can argue the toss if that growth is being allocated fairly, but selling each other houses and handbags at grossly inflated prices is bound to end up as a mess.

It is not, in itself, a bad thing.

The actual problem is the methods and mechanisms of creating this environment. If they create lots of problems or cause many injustices, it *doesn't matter* that the vague idea behind the policy was a good one. In this case, the obvious worry is...well, the appeals process exists for a reason. I'm not sure I trust the system to treat people fairly.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt;No. No. No.

Actually, yes.

&gt;What you are suggesting would require an extensive structural redesign of the entire ship.

Not at all. If you were paying attention, it requires only traps installed on the ship. *Not* cats, as with a 30 knot headwind, the Typhoon has enough power to take off in the space of the deck. At worst, that's taking the ship to 30 knots. Mostly it'll just be turning into the wind and 10-15 knots.

&gt;Also, nobody is seriously considering a navalised Typhoon, it would cost a large sum to develop and there is no market for it.

Sorry, there's a prototype two years in development already and India is seriously considering it. Google this if you don't believe me. It's quite far into development and is a serious contender for the UK's back up plan, should the F35B not happen.

&gt;The thrust vectoring version of the EJ-2000 hasn't been approved either! 

The software's already developed, which is the hard bit. The hardware's been in development and offered as an option for export versions for a few years too. Conformal fuel tanks that fit on the fuselage have also been developed, as has some other fairly exotic jamming and data link electronic stuff that's not been fielded yet.

Basically, both of these upgrades are just waiting for a customer anyway.

&gt;The stresses of arrested landing and catapult takeoffs just aren't the same as the stresses put on an airframe by dogfighting. 

What you're missing is that it wouldn't need catapult takeoffs. Arrestor gear has been retrofitted to various aircraft before and isn't a significant issue. Even the F117 was modified with tailhooks.

&gt;Also, there isn't a prototype. There has been a suggestion made, but no real work towards it.

Again, go check your sources. 

&gt;A navalised Typhoon would cost a very large amount to develop, would take years, has very almost nonexistent chances of gaining exports and wouldn't be as capable as many of the alternatives already or imminently available. Pursuing it would be insanity.

Not really. It's at least two years in development already with thrust vectoring done and a tailhook being the only bit left to sort out which is not a major issue, has export interest, and when considering the costs, you've already got a logistics chain and trained technicians and pilots. It would probably involve upgrading 20-30 existing Tranche 1 RAF Typhoons, which would cost considerably less than purchasing alternatives.

It *probably* won't happen, but it's not actually such an insane idea, could almost certainly be fielded before the F35B, and crucially **because it wouldn't need catapults** and because of the existing logistics chain, would be cheaper than any of the alternatives you've mentioned.

The only thing that would need adding to the carriers is traps. They're designed for them anyway, and that's old and tried and tested technology. 

So, it's not such a silly idea at all, really, and I'd be surprised if it hasn't been a backup plan all along that hasn't been talked about much for fear of possibly derailing the F35 buy.

Dont just use  his age as a way for you to rationalize Chelsea and Mourinhos decision in letting Romelu leave on loan.

And about Torres, so he did well vs Spurs, but didnt score a goal or an assist, but looked ""lively"" so he is starting to hit form, but lukaku who comes straight into a new club, scores on his debut (second time he has done that with a loan club, West Brom last year) then scores 2 more the next match and its still currently only halftime in the match and he is not good enough? He is not ""in form"" like Torres? It really angers me when I see people trying to argue loaning out our best player in our weakest position is somehow good for us and him. It isnt. The only people its good for so far have been Everton and West Brom. 

The last young striker I remember us having was a guy named Daniel Sturrdige, I remember we loaned him out a couple times as well, never got game time though, Torres was also ""about"" to hit form during that time as well, even though Sturridge scored 8 goals in 12 appearances at Bolton which was the club he was loaned at. So we just kept on selecting Torres and he left, look how that fucking went. And if you try to fucking say that Sturrdige ""didnt fit our system"" then nobody fucking does because between him and Lukaku you basically have almost every type of attribute you would see in strikers.

I don't think she is - she appears to be accepting it because she's never known anything different - but how she deals with it personally and how it's presented onscreen are two hugely different things. If someone had only ever heard mono, and you found a way to let them hear stereo, would you find it puzzling if they insisted that there was no need because they couldn't see a use for it? Now how would you feel if they were a TV presenter giving the impression it wasn't necessary?

&gt;Your point also suggests that Cerri perceives her disability as a problem, which is presumptuous.

Her disability *is* a problem. Her perception of and ability to deal with it doesn't change that.

&gt;So, if everyone is aware that there are solutions to her 'problem', have you considered the fact that she does not see it as a barrier to her job and that she has chosen not to wear a prosthesis??

How she has grown and adapted has helped shape the person she is, and she may not want to change that. But while she may not consider it a barrier to anything, that doesn't make it so.

""Assault with intent to resist arrest"" dates from the 1860s and ""Assault on a police constable in execution of his duty"" is the current equivalent in England/Wales/NI, but in both cases the aggravating factor is essentially that you are acting against the lawful actions of the state.

That is quite different from saying that the same offence, by the same offender, should be treated differently depending on the employment of the victim.

My main problem with the idea is that it elevates some members of society above others. Individuals obviously have opinions about which members of society are more ""valuable"" than others, but I do not think that is something the state should participate in - particularly when it is based on employment.

Some members of the armed forces go above and beyond what is reasonable to ask of them. But the same is true of paediatric cardiac surgeons. IMO, these cases should be treated exactly the same way:

* An assault on an 18 year old.
* An assault on an 18 year old, 1 day after he joins the army.
* An assault on a 32 year old soldier, currently in the SAS.
* An assault on a 32 year old ex-soldier, 1 day after he leaves the SAS.
* An assault on a 46 year old paediatric surgeon, who has operated on hundreds of children.
* An assault on a 46 year old homeless man, who has drunk his life away.

These examples are obviously artificial, but I think they show the difficulty that Labour will have in legislating this in a way that goes beyond simple electioneering.

true,hexapodium,null,null,"That's perfectly sensible (though compelling people to do it via unemployment benefit seems a touch harsh - forcing people into the breadline or rent arrears is an overreaction). What's not sensible is when these mandatory work activities occupy a job which otherwise would have to be done - any private sector, and quite a lot of public sector, placements satisfy this criterion. If a council took on a compelled worker to perform the job of a paid one, they get that labour ""for free"" (not quite, since the worker is 'paid' via JSA at below minimum wage and has no employee rights) and so can make a cost saving by eliminating the job which the unpaid worker does. Naturally, market forces will thus tend to eliminate that job as long as a worker whose reservation wage is lower than their paid worker's exists. 

The net result is that one additional person is unemployed, and the net quantity of wages paid falls because there's now two people on JSA, not one person on JSA and one person on at least minimum wage. This leads to a depression of living standard in our two-person microcosm, does nothing to help the government balance sheet (in fact it becomes worse, since JSA is centrally paid as opposed to a council worker's wages paid locally), and over time reduces aggregate demand, exacerbating the problem.

In short, the only thing mandatory work placements *should* be doing is work which is strictly economically useless: having zero net impact on present productivity. Any productive work will naturally tend to depress average wages in that sector, because it will compete with paid workers. Keynes' hole-digging would do, but his intentions were quite different. 

If you want to make claimants ""work"" for benefit, the thing to do is give them high-quality vocational training in needed sectors, which will improve their prospects for actual employment. You do it for free, and you keep paying them benefits until they find work, so that you can shape economic growth by stabilising wages in certain sectors through labour surplus. Then if they do find work, they're in a position to take it, and incentivised through market forces rather than government punishment.

No, I didn't say *I* should dictate anything. Your link led to;

**How can you confirm that the thousands/ tens of thousands of children watching wouldn't be more comforted by seeing a demonstration of a similar disability being compensated for by science or medicine? You don't begrudge a blind person a stick, do you? What if they insist they don't need one when they obviously do?**

 I was using a stick as an example of something that helps someone with a disability and how that differed from a robotic arm that you were saying was optional. Please, just cut and paste instead of linking, then you'll be able to attack what I'm not saying right next to it.

&gt;and accused disabled people of being self-deluding.

No, I used one example where to back up the opinion you'd have to demonstrate how having one hand is no different having two, which is just stupid. Again, please cut and paste. The fact that you're avoiding doing so and have misquoted (and taken out of context) my statements twice via links in the first sentence suggests that you know full well you're doing this. It's not working, and you appear to be desperate to be a victim to the point of taking offence on behalf of all disabled people that you've extrapolated from my comment about a single person who could easily afford a state-of-the-art/ cutting edge robotic one. Grow up.

&gt;All I'm saying is that we should listen to disabled people and see if prosthetics are helpful. 

Absolutely. I wasn't attacking disabled people generally, no matter how many different ways you appear want to insist I am. But the disabled person's opinion is not the only one, and in many cases not the right one. Unless you, of course, want me to give them special treatment and simply accept the patients' opinion as fact, which I thought was the opposite of the goal (which is that disabled people are no different from anyone else, surely).

&gt;Cerrie Burnell has been rejecting prosthetics since she was a kid because she finds they get in her way and hinder her. (Many amputees have the same experience.)

Indeed, she has adapted to using one arm.

&gt;Are you saying she's kidding herself? Because that's what it looks like.

I'd want to know more. [Prosthetics are a bit better than the ones available 20 years ago](http://www.nature.com/news/rewired-nerves-control-robotic-leg-1.13818), I see more value in promoting where they're going rather than dismissing what's available now. Again, just because someone has adapted over thirty years does not change two hands being better than one. And robotics make a big, big difference. Someone with one eye can function perfectly well, but it's not insulting to assume they'd prefer to have two if they could.

&gt;It looks like you talk about ""potential"" and ""hope"" when it suits you

Where does it look like that? Where does it 'suit' me and where does it not? I used the word hope because it's better than pretending the present will dictate any possible future with no leave for devlopments in science or medicine - sorry if that's offensive or insulting to you. You used the word potential and then asserted that didn't change regardless of removing or keeping a disability (or at least, you haven't addressed it).

&gt;and now you're going to talk about what example disabled adults should set for disabled children.

We *are* already were talking about that, more specifically what examples disabled TV presenters (and TV channels) set. It was, er, in my original comment.

&gt;You're telling disabled adults, who have lived through the experience of being disabled children, how they should present themselves in the media to disabled children.

It's amazing isn't it. To think, she was employed by a *non-disabled person*. How could they possibly *know*? How could they imagine *which* disabled person should get the job? Who are *they* to decide? I mean, they're a seperate *species*, aren't they? I bet a non-disabled person developed the robotic arm that feels, too - how *dare* they.

You could do a badass Wolverine one, but I expect that would be classed as a weapon :-)

I do understand the premise, and agree with it - I'm not saying there should be nobody disabled on the screen at all - but once it occurred to me that we should be preparing children for the world in ten years time, I couldn't stop wondering why we aren't taking advances into account. The messages you list would all still be projected, but you'd be bringing hope rather than gently letting down. A doctor telling you that 'you can still lead a full life' is completely correct, but the 'still' gives away everything about the situation - and an early battle-armour arm might get you picked on, but kids like that would pick on you with no arm anyway, cbeebies or no. And even if the child has to wait ten-to-twenty *years*, they'll know it's *coming*.

I know reddit cures cancer ever week, but to give a parallel we're going to cure HIV before long - the immunisation stage is almost here. So do we still tell people 'you've got this, and no matter what you do it's going to kill you but you can delay that moment by a number of ears if you follow this strict diet and lifestyle plan', or do we tell them 'you need to follow this strict diet and lifestyle plan, possibly for years, to stay alive long enough for the vaccine'? We're close enough (with HIV, at any rate) that I see nothing wrong with giving people that kind of hope, because it's not false. Likewise, isn't it a good thing to encourage children to treat any afflictions as something they have to put up with for the time being instead of forever?

As soon as they can repair spinal columns to the point of any functionality, be it through stem cells, myelin repair or what have you, a lot of permanently chair-bound people are going to be walking again.

This is the part that worries me. Many of the major cases of people successfully appealing against deportation, like the Qatarda case, were because of things like them being at risk of facing torture, or evidence gained from torture, in the country they are being deported to. By trying to remove their right to appeal, the Tories are basically being compliant in torture. You can't on one hand claim to be supporting Human Rights, and on the other blatantly disregard peoples Human Rights just because you dislike them. 

And if they are so blatantly going to disregard the rights of people they don't like, I can't see them being fair if they write up a British Human Rights Act.

I'm sure she copes admirably - but the key word there is *copes*. And when I say 'function', maybe I should say 'do anything that involves using two hands at once'. I'm not being callous, just examining the harsh reality, what can be done to amend it and how we present disabilties and treatments to children. Just because one person finds peace and is able to function well enough does not mean that nobody else would like the option and with kids, you have the risk of making them assume that her choices based on rejecting the technology of the past (and up to a point, today) are the *only* ones available.

&gt;Your basic complaint seems to be that she isn't a cyborg.

My basic complaint is that she's presenting disability as if it isn't something that has be addressed - which, of course, technically it doesn't...but then you can survive with one eye, so how many one-eyed people would like two again? So since her disability is something that *can* be treated I'm left wondering why that isn't presented too, in the context of giving disabled children the sense that there might be something wrong with them but that's just for now instead of forever.

 To be fair,  I suppose *I'm* a cyborg. I have a steel/ titanium bone replacement in my middle-ear. It made my hearing work well enough again, but I have to fight the urge to find and kill Sarah Connor.

&gt;Identifying and recreating a suitable base to replace Faslane and Coulport would be highly problematic, very expensive, and fraught with political difficulties. In particular, it would be difficult to find a site that satisfied the requirements for the co-location of the submarine base, the warheads depot and the facility to marry the warheads and missiles on to submarines that adhered to the safety requirements. (Paragraph 45)


http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmscotaf/676/67608.htm

&gt;  We found it difficult to establish what it would cost to replicate Faslane and Coulport elsewhere. Most witnesses, such as Professor Walker, thought the cost would be huge: 

&gt;..

&gt;When we asked the Ministry of Defence if they knew how much it would cost, Nick Harvey MP, then Minister for Armed Forces, said: ""It would be a very challenging project, which would take a very long time to complete and would cost a gargantuan sum of money""[69] He told us that a recent upgrade of the facilities at Faslane had cost Â£3.5 billion and ""If we were to replicate it somewhere else, that figure would be dwarfed by whatever that would cost""

Probably because (in london) there are people from everywhere all over the world daily.  American, Japanese, European tourists, immigrants in way more numbers than up north etc... so when northerners come down to London, and many many do, they're not that exotic.  They just fit in.  Nobody makes a fuss.  

Yet when I go up north, as I constantly do for work, it's like I'm a strange alien for being a Londoner.  Lots of joshing and so on which I don't mind and laugh along with but it wouldn't happen down south.  So many people are from so far away that Oh you're from Leeds? isn't a big deal.  

I also think people up north are very confused about economics of the divide.  The south is ""richer"" is distorted by the city and the billionaires within the capital.  That doesn't mean the average southerner is better off than the average northerner.  Far from it.  Some of the countries worst boroughs are IN london.  But try telling a northerner who believes the south is spoilt and rich and so on that... it's very annoying.   Especially when they don't understand the sheer cost of being alive in London.  

Funny thing is, I'm moving to Manchester in the new year.  So we'll see how that goes.  I'm already browsing way bigger apartments for the same rent I'm currently paying.  Madness.

My own generalisations are thus.  Northerners party harder.  Lose their inhibitions more, and get far more drunk.  Whether that's good or bad depends on who you're asking.  They all seem pretty pleased with their clubbing scene and Londoners really don't.  Miserable pretentious show-off up-itself clubbing scene in London. Not worth bothering with.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"If you can find me a decent source on him being forced out or crying about it, I'd love to see it. Because I've seen those assertions as well. From random Twitter users. 

Consider what Walter Sabatini (Roma's director of football) had to say on the Lamela transfer:

&gt;âIt was a painful sale for all of us. At the beginning we didnât think we could sell Erik and we didnât want to,â he said at a press conference.

&gt;âThen some new factors came into play and as time went on we started to consider the eventuality. A club made him an offer that we didnât and couldnât match.""

&gt;âRather than trying to win a war that we probably wouldnât, we opted to sell. When that Italian club offered him â¬3.5m a season, as well as a â¬2m commission to his agent father, we knew we had lost the player.""

&gt;âHis people started pushing for a renewal and that is when I started moves to sell him. Had we begun negotiations sooner then we probably could have sold him for an even bigger fee.â

Now of course Erik didn't try to force his way out of Roma and indeed it sounds like money and his representatives played a big part in the move, but I haven't really seen anything even half as credible that suggests he was forced out of the club. 

Even if the greedy American ownership decided to cash in against the player's wishes--even if he cried about leaving a fantastic club in Rome--he's a young ambitious professional footballer who is not the type to sulk. I'd be more worried about Erik fucking off to Madrid in 3-4 years than whether or not he's got the sads right now. 

The questions about Lamela are almost entirely because of his shy demeanor in interviews and inability to speak a lick of English. I think most people who have followed his career can tell you he's not a bubbly guy like Lewis Holtby, but on the pitch he is very passionate. 

His time will come. He's the biggest young talent in our squad--and yes that includes Eriksen. ",0,1380582618,null,0,false,0,ccihtqy,t3_1nfqm3,t1_ccihtqy,t1_cci5utu,null,1429289173,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

Intersango, bitcoin-24.com and even the current second largest exchange Bitstamp.net are all UK companies registered in England with companies house. From a UK regulatory point of view it's completely irrelevant that some of their bank accounts are in Poland or Slovenia - they are all UK legal entities and these UK legal entities are the bank account holders.

The problem all these exchanges (except bitstamp so far) have run into is with their bank accounts being closed. Intersango went through numerous UK bank accounts (at least 3?) before finally retreating to their one remaining bank account in Poland - which still operates. Mt.Gox used to maintain a bank account with Barclays, but it was closed. Bitcoin-24 had it's Polish and German bank accounts closed. None of them have ever had any problems with HMRC or the FCA (to my knowledge). The reason all these UK bitcoin exchanges are banking in eastern europe is because the banks in the UK won't let them have bank accounts here. It's really as simple as that. It's not because they aren't compliant with government regulations or don't want too comply or anything like that. It's that the banks just close their accounts and don't even have to provide an explanation as to why.

I'm much more interested in your negotiations with [mycashplus](http://www.mycashplus.co.uk/business/default.aspx) What assurances can you offer that your account won't simply be closed too? You've talked a lot about your dealings with the UK regulators, but since in the long history of UK bitcoin exchanges they have never caused any problems for anyone (afaik) - I'm much more interested about how you'll avoid simply having your account closed as that seems to be the real problem faced by UK bitcoin exchanges.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;isn't enough of a demonstration that you can overcome disability?

It's proof that you've adapted and can cope quite well - I'm not even sure it's something to be 'overcome'.

&gt;What more could she possibly do to show that it's not been a hindrance in her life?

I'm not sure she has to do that. That's not the point I'm making.

&gt;Jesus, I remember the Daily Mail fuelled outrage when she started, thought that had been well and truly put to bed by now.

Which was about, if I recall, parents not wanting their children to be frightened by disabled people. Not sure how that's connected with my comment.

EDIT: So, to summarise - disability means adapting, and having nothing to prove, and any comments about the issue have nothing to do with the daily mail....and yet all those statements are apparently incorrect, according to someone who doesn't want to say so openly.

You apply for a place in any school of your choice, however, priority will obviously be given to living within the designated area for that school. You will be allocated a school (they are guaranteed a place somewhere), and you can appeal any placement. [Info here.](https://www.gov.uk/schools-admissions)

All children 5-16 have a free place in school (for state schools - ""public school"" means a private school in the UK...confusing, eh?) but you may have to pay transport, meals and uniform. Grants and reductions are available, which have to be applied for to the council where you will live.

Go to the [UK education website](https://www.gov.uk/browse/education), as well as the council for your area, some useful information.
