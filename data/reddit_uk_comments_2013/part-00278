I have dropped some things, (like the reply ""Whatevs"") Normally because I feel that there has been an impasse reached and there is no point continuing. 

The 18k bucket collection was responded too. I shall quote myself, I will double line it 

&gt; &gt;As an aside, that was an example of the work of a fundraiser, not a comprehensive list. 

It is somewhere up there.

No one pays 18k for someone to exclusively arrange bucket collections. However they do pay people 18k to do a role which *includes* the organising of bucket collections.

Anyway

&gt; Money is money, their accounting team may come up with a budget for the admin and mailshots but the income is all the same colour of cash, and suffering across the world is equal whether it is down to an oppressive regime illegally clearing people off their land for the fun of it, or an oppressive regime clearing those people off their land because they've been put back in power by funds from an oil company who wants to put their new pipeline there to pay dividends to the charity that will then go and help those displaced people. Slice it how you want, it's all the damn same. 

And again, you are missing my point. I have at no point defended charities investment in markets. Nor have I attacked it as an overall concept. I may have some knowledge of charities but I do not know enough about financial markets to make that judgement.

Yes it was in the original video, but so was marketing as a form of investment, and my video was in response to you complaining about receiving mail.

And that is the kind of investment I have been talking about this entire time. Printing a poster is an investment. Sending mailouts is an investment. Because you do it in the hopes of a financial return.

I am no longer going to reply to anything you say about investing in markets because it has nothing to do with what I have been talking about. It might even be something else I have not answered so far because from the way I have been reading this it has gone to me something like.

&gt; **Me**: ""I don't have a problem with charities spending money on marketing""
&gt; 
&gt; **You**: ""But what about the arms dealers""

(I am sure from your perspective it has gone **you**: ""arms dealers are evil"" **me**: ""but fundraisers are okay"" ) 

&gt; Charities are using that income to fund their aggressive and unethical marketing and behaviour, becoming part of the economy instead of outside it. 

Aggressive? Probably. 

Unethical? This is an extension of the argument over whether or not this is a net gain for a charity. If we assume it is (which is where I stand) then I could almost argue it would be unethical to fail to send them out, as that is what may cost lives in a disaster.

&gt; They even have their own sector skills council, but you don't have a problem with this. 

Here my knowledge is lacking, assuming a skills council ensures those that work in the sector have the skills needed. No I don't I would much rather they got the best they can be than lose out because of a lack of skills.

However, perhaps I have misinterpreted what a skills council does, or perhaps the charitable sector one is corrupt. I don't know. (Google didn't help me much)

I would also argue that it should certainly not be for-profit

&gt; You don't have a problem with ""professional"" fundraising even though it means a few get big salaries built on the voluntary work of the many.

**Big** salaries?

Anyway. No I don't. I shall point out again that I am a volunteer in several charities. And that all these charities also employ people and these employees include fundraisers. I don't feel that these people are getting a salary off my back, I feel they are facilitating the work I do. Allowing me to perform my role.

&gt; You can't believe that charities could do the work they do now without this income investment and aggressive marketing because you don't want to

Demonisation of the unemployed - the cost to the exchequer of jobless benefits is far, far less than the uncollected tax of fat cats and industry, but fuck us, right?

The attempt to redraw electoral boundaries to make it easier for the Cons to stay in power

The outright deficit lies of Osbourne

The proposed (and incoming) censorship of the internet

The intended withdrawal from Europe, including the big fuss currently being made about 'evil immigrants' and the need to redraw the free movement across borders within the EU.

true,Prancing_Unicorn,tardis,TARDIS,"I almost started to like Amy near the end of her arc, when she was a little more mature, and she certainly had some endearing moments, but overall she was so goddamn aggravating I could barely sit through some episodes. While I can appreciate Rory he was often reduced to a comedic prop or a tool in some bullshit Doctor love triangle they tried to push and so I wasn't in love with him. I agree a lot of the show hinges on the companions, and so those two sort of annoying people put Matt off to a bad start for me. 

Why couldn't we just have taken young Amy as the companion. That would have made a great series, The Doctor travelling with a chubby little Scottish girl in a nightie. Those two had some decent chemistry, they were fun for that intro episode. Old Amy and The Doctor didn't really mesh for me.

I quite like River, but her plot is dumb and I think I mainly like her because of her intro with Tennant. I could do without that whole tardis-baby-big-bang-2-silence-dissapearing-stars-weaponised-River plot season thing. It didn't work, it had little effect on the story as a whole, and it confused a lot of people. Blergh.

And omg Clara I didn't even realise she was a companion she just sort of melts into the background. Her story set up could have been really cool but when it was revealed I just sort of went ""Oh"". 

I think Moffat has a problem with just stating that big plot points have happened and expecting the audience to accept them and move on. He never really gives them any weight, preferring to use his time to make the doctor dance around and say dumb things.

""Rory waited two thousand years"". Oh okay. Are we going to see any of that? No? A montage maybe? Youre just gonna say it happened? Cool.

""The universe exploded"". And you'd just saying things again.

""Clara exists at every point in The Doctor's history"". At least we got a montage of her edited into old footage in this one. But seriously this is a major plot point that could be expanded to several seasons, and he's just throwing it in and running on.

""The silence have existed on earth for years"". Fucking show don't tell, Steven, that's basic storywriting.

I bought San Miguel 'Fresca' because i like normal San Miguel. It's fucking awful. Now i have 3 beers i wont touch. I had some Bitburger as well which is excellent german lager. Next time i'm just buying that.

Tomorrow im going to meet some friends to go a brewery shop but the present i want to buy for them is sold by the shop. Do i go there earlier and give it them as they arrive, or buy it while there and give it to them when we leave ?


I have to work monday and tuesday next week but nothing will happen cos no-ones in the office. Reddit all day it is! There wont be anyone in the office.
My work desk looks [like this](https://twitter.com/JamesPictures/status/412907652683804673/photo/1) right now.



I wish i was closer to my sister but she lives in Frankfurt and has been there so long she's very german now. We dont have any common interests. I get emails from her like 'your parcel arrived' &lt; entire email contents. It makes me sad. She's having a baby soon. 


Christmas will be weird and boring. It sucks these days. My mum threw out her last desktop computer and now i just get bored shitless with nothing to do while i'm there. I bought xmas present for my mum's cat but it hasnt arrived at work yet. 3 presents still have to turn up by 3pm on tuesday or i will be mad.





I dont get chatted up at all... (Well, i got flirted with by a cute canadian lady at the work xmas party but she has a boyfriend anyway so meh), so i wouldnt really mind.


I need to call a robot and pay it 3.2 grand to clear my last debt off. The stupid voice recognition never damned works and the real people arent available till next week now.


I really need to fix the slow leak in my car tyre before i drive north for xmas but i dont know/trust any local garages around here. I could change the wheel to put the spare on but my road is hilly as fuck and finding a safe place to do it is tricky.

3) Not really sure what you're after here. You'll find taxis and buses will probably be more than you're used to. (Taxi for about 6 miles after a night out £25-£30). If you want to ask more specific questions I'll try to answer them. 
4) A lot of people hit the town on the weekends, Friday night is always busy as is Saturday. Saturday tends to be more of a dressy night though. The majority of my weekends are spent at the local pub. 
5) There is plenty of music, theater and comedy happening around Bristol. You should check out what's happening at the Hippodrome, Colston hall, The old vic, The Anson Rooms, O2 Academy.  I had guitar lessons whilst I was at school and now have no contact with them. Therefore unfortunately I can't recommend anyone for guitar lessons, although you should definitely take it up.

true,deltopia,mcgann,McGann,"You know, the thing about this show is that the character has so much range -- you can play the Doctor so many different ways.  The 9th Doctor was probably closer to the 1st than many of his successors; he was much more no-nonsense and impatient.  The 10th really didn't have too much dark side, but he did get a little self-obsessed, and he was so quirky, he reminded me a lot of the 4th (who had a famous speech with his companion Sarah Jane, ""I'm a TIME LORD, Sarah... I walk in ETERNITY!"" that reminded me a lot of Tennant's ""Lord of Time"" thing in the Waters of Mars episode).  The 11th Doctor has the silliest facade covering up so much darkness, he reminds one of the 2nd Doctor -- and I do think that's deliberate; you see Matt Smith doing his hands the same way that Traughton used to.

So, yes, 11 is very different from 9 and 10, but he's not untrue to the deeper history of the character, and it's not so bad a thing to have those aspects brought back  in.  I'd like to see 12 go back to something a little closer to the 3rd Doctor -- something a little more swashbuckling, maybe willing to throw out some Venusian aikido when the occasion demands.  But he could be an innocent, like the 5th Doctor, relying on his companions as near-equals, or a dreamy-eyed romantic like the 8th, or even something new.  Or he could just be a Valeyard.  No telling.  But that's the great thing about the Doctor; there are a zillion different ways to go, none of them really implausible.

Over a thousand-odd years of adventures in time and space, unavoidable genocides, countless nightmares, atrocities, betrayals, tragedies, miracles, families, and who knows how many loves lost, you have a character that can be nearly anything because nearly anything could be its defining influence.

1. Some players stick too close to the player. So close that they watch the player and not the ball coming at them. Then they fail to leap in time to do anything about it.

2. Some players only watch the ball. Skrtel prefers to grab his player so as not let him out of his sight. 

Ideally i think players should just track the ball irrespective of opposing players moves. But its important when doing that, that we win the ball. Even that i feel is 50/50. Maybe we dont attack the ball enough. I dont know how much a keeper is responsible in helping out his ball-watching team-mates(maybe migs doesnt do enough on that front).

Overall i've gone over this several times in head and i'm unable to pinpoint a solution.

true,ProfSSBEncyclopedia,tardis,TARDIS,"Part of the Doctor's essential charm is his paradoxical ability to be both the ubiquitous everyone, able to fit seamlessly into any situation and integrate himself just as though he was grown there, and the polar opposite - a complete outsider that sticks out like a sore thumb. He achieves this much like a chameleon - lizards don't go everywhere, but this lizard can blend. His extreme knowledge of every culture everywhere and everywhen in the universe makes him the perfect immigrant, and yet he never relinquishes his own magnetic sense of self that makes him the character we know and love.

If there was ever any character in all of fiction that were allowed to go blundering into another universe's fiction, the Doctor would probably fit that role best; few others can be as ubiquitous and yet as unique as he. But part of that strength comes from his writers; done well, the Doctor is everything I have described him as, but done poorly and it would definitely feel like he's being shoehorned even within his own series. The key point here I suppose would be mood, since the practical aspects of the setting don't seem to matter that much. Instead what seems to happen is that, true to the nature of a time traveler, he often twists the setting to suit his appearance. If you throw him into a medieval adventure story, it suits him well because he's an adventurer too. But throw him into a typical horror-movie situation, ala ""Hide"" from Series 7, it still becomes a Doctor Who horror story with the requisite sci-fi elements, not the typical gore-fest. It's almost like Doctor Who has its own distinct genre-flavor.

So in conclusion, I'd welcome his appearance in just about any setting I've seen - but it's just that it'll end up being a Doctor Who story just because of his strength of personality. I'd imagine a Wholock episode being one with Sherlock as guest, rather than the other way around.

true,agentspymonkey,cyberman,Cyberperson,"I felt the same way for a really long time. He seems goofy, shallow and carefree, as if all the things that were weighing on Tenant don't affect him anymore. What I eventually realized, though is its just a shield. He acts that way as a coping mechanism, he's trying to run away from everything. When he lets the shield down every once in a while you really get to see whats going on, and how old and tortured he actually is. If you're only on the fourth episode you haven't seen any of these moments yet, and honestly the 5th season isn't all that good except for a few episodes, like Vincent and the doctor and the finale. Later in the run you really get to see what's going on in his head. In the 50th anniversary its more powerful than any other episode, and you actually find out why he acts so differently. In that episode they call Tenant ""The One Who Regrets"" and Smith ""The One Who Forgets"", because he's trying to move on from the Time War and everything else and be a different person. He is the next step in the Doctor's life and his recovery process.

Also, I think Matt Smith really grows as an actor as it goes on. In the beginning I was underwhelmed, but in the most recent season, his acting has absolutely blown me away (Especially Nightmare in Silver). 

Basically, it takes time to adjust to every new doctor. 11 is a different person than 10. Tenant was my doctor too, and I refused to accept that anyone else could ever take his place. I hated Smith from the beginning, he was different and goofy and I never bothered to think about why. But as the seasons went on, the person under the shell shows through, and I started to like him. And now, after the last season and the 50th, I love him as much as I loved Tenant.

So do tough it out. it will get better. But it will get better faster if you really pay attention. Think about why he's so different instead of just getting mad at how different he is like I did. If you think about him as the next step in the Doctors life, instead of just the same exact person with a different face, I guarantee you'll come to love him as much as I did.

I'm not saying we can win the league, i'm saying we didn't get to where we are by luck, which is what this subreddit is so resistant about. this team IS good. this team is the product of 3 years (i'm counting Kenny's tenure, because he bought Suarez, Hendo, Sterling and Jose) of team chemistry and foundation, and we're still not done yet.

don't say we haven't embarrased anyone. it may have been ""lesser teams"" (they've beaten ""better teams"" mind you), but the last 8 wins have had at least 3 goals, and 5 of them have had 4-5 goals. The form we are in and the mentality that Rodgers has instilled in this team leads me to believe that we *will* give Chelsea and City a run for their money home or away. We've proven it before with shittier teams. And even if we lose, I don't believe it will be an embarrassing loss. Unlike the mentality of this subreddit I don't believe we will be played out of the park.

remember, this is a race. city and chelsea have lost games from lower half teams too. City lost against WHU, Cardiff, Aston Villa and Sunderland! They've fucked up far worse than we have, and we've played those teams out of the park! Their saving grace is showing up against United and Arsenal.

Chelsea lost against Newcastle and Stoke (teams we have beaten convincingly) and Everton.

Who's to say our rivals won't lose again to ""crappy teams"" in the future? all the teams will stumble, but in the end, the one who stumbles least gets the trophy, and so far, we haven't stumbled much.

I think that is the secret to good set pieces - find the weak point and exploit it with a good delivery and good movement.

All in all though I think the fact that Liverpool have conceded seemingly as many goals from set pieces as from open play bodes well for them moving forward because teams can realistically only score 1 maybe 2 goals from set pieces in games and if Liverpool continue to score 3,4,5 goals they will continue to keep winning. This is like how Stoke are considered a to be strong at set pieces when in reality they score fewer goals from set pieces than other teams but a larger percentage of their goals come from set pieces simply due to the fact that they don't score much, hence their set pieces are more dangerous than their open play (note: this is a completely unsubstantiated claim but is something that I have casually observed watching them play a few times against Liverpool and a few other teams)",0,1387697468,null,0,false,0,ce7lkn1,t3_1te9z0,t1_ce7lkn1,t1_ce7220j,null,1428032149,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I have already addressed this. pick another redditor who would do the verification, someone you trust. I wouldn't be involved at all.

here is the deal: if you prove

a) that you are a current employee and coach at Liverpool football club

based on a proof criteria that i set carried out by a third-party redditor who is trusted by the community, I will do two things:

1. transfer you $1000 in bitcoin

2. write a self post apologizing 

my proof criteria wouldn't be very difficult. what do you have to be afraid of? free $1000 just for doing your job!

&gt;  report me to the club and the only thing i have safe guarding me is TRUSTING you!?

This is exactly my point and why your story doesn't add up. The club **must** know who you are, you have given out enough information here for them to figure it out. Even some people here guessed who you could be (or more accurately, who you are pretending to be) based on the info.

It is impossible to believe that a club that carried out a watch hunt against a parody blogger for leaking info would not be going after a 'coach' on a popular internet forum who posts a dozen internal things a day, hints at who might be on the bench, etc.

the reason why they aren't after you? because they know you don't work there.

There are only 20-30 coaches at the club, picking the person who graduated at your time from the team you said you played with, etc. would be very easy.

You aren't hiding your identity from the club, you are hiding your *real* identity from the other users of this sub.

There is no way that you can convince anybody that the club don't know you are here, that is just extremely silly. 

I suggest you find a new cover story for why you can't use or post with your real name.

edit: in the extra 13 seconds I just spent thinking about it, the more convinced I am that you have given yourself away by claiming that the club don't know you are here. I mean, really. reddit isn't exactly a small place and this forum isn't tiny.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;So at first, the Doctor says Amy and he can't get to the time period that Rory has been taken to, because of the level of time distortion surrounding it. Then he and Amy do it anyway, because they essentially slingshot in from another time period. Oh, and River was able to get there despite the distortions because of her own time device. But never mind that.

River's vortex manipulator leaves a much smaller footprint; a motorbike through traffic, she likened it to.

&gt;Later, the Doctor tells Rory that he is going to be trapped in a fixed point in time, which Rory and Amy solve by creating a paradox. The Doctor then speculates that the paradox destroyed that particular timeline, but WAIT- one of the Angels survived...somehow.

It barely survived, but there were quite a number of Angels, so it's not too improbable that at least one was left.

&gt;Not only that, but it manages to send Rory back in time...to the place that was supposedly erased from history by the paradox.

It sent him back in time, but not back to Winter Quay. 1930s New York still exists, it wasn't gone completely. He was sent to the New York that existed without Winter Quay after the paradox took effect.

&gt;Not only that, but now the Doctor is certain that they can't go back. Rory is stuck in a fixed point in time. Did that stop anyone before? No. Does River still have her wrist thing? Yes.

Their original travel there had polluted things even more, and a paradox added onto that means that he's right; going back would be a very bad idea.

&gt;Would the very act of Amy's going back there not alter this ""fixed point""? Yep.

No. Rory's future was fixed but Amy had a choice; her future was still in flux until she chose one way or the other. That's why her name didn't appear on the grave until she went.

&gt;Could they have got back to an earlier point and prevented all this?

No, because that would create yet another paradox and do considerable damage, which the Doctor even said.

&gt;Couldn't Rory and Amy just jump off the roof again, and create another paradox?

No, because there was no roof to jump from. Winter Quay unhappened. They didn't go back there when they ended up back in time because it didn't exist.",0,1387701369,null,0,false,0,ce7meid,t3_1tfc8s,t1_ce7meid,t3_1tfc8s,null,1428031762,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

I've got to disagree with that.  If someone said they were a British solidier, you'd assume (rightly) that they fought for Britain, to defend or widen British interests.  I think the same applies to ""soldier of Allah."" 

&gt;to violence by a radicalisation process. 

A specifically *religious* radicalisation process, which they often are. 

&gt;Perhaps you should go into detail about how religion is the cause? Because so many people say ""it's religion"" without offering any explanation of the role religion has to play.

It specifically and repeatedly states in its core text (by it I'm talking about Islam, but it works for any of the Abrahamic religions), that believers should kill / destroy infidels; i.e those who have a difference of religious opinion from you, those who are deemed a threat to your religion.

&gt;What you are in effect doing is blaming Islam for not being pacifist - point to a civilisation that is.

Islam is not a civilisation. Civilisation exists *in spite of* this kind of bullshit.   

&gt;What I am saying is that there are a host of other factors,

Sure, but if you're willing to believe the crap that religion heaps on by the bucket load, and you learn to bury the basic thinking and questioning skills that would have you repudiate that nonsense, well, you're on the path to being capable of justifying anything. Sure, being stupid with a propensity to violence helps, but religion gives you a way to express that and feel good about it. 

&gt;But they fit the profile of individuals who are primarily motivated and driven by political and psychological reasons

It's interesting that you'd separate political and religious problems in this context.  Many believers, both Islamic, Christian and Jewish see the current struggle in the Middle East in purely religious terms.  As for psychological problems, well yeah; but I'd argue that's true of most devout believers.

&gt;I'm not certain why, but there is a horrible trait among many that a desire to understand

Understanding is fine; tip-toeing around the fact that religion is violent garbage shouldn't be part of that understanding though. 

&gt;Assume that Islam is the cause of violence? What's your response? How do we prevent extremism? I'm all ears.

It's not the only cause of violence obviously.  Removing religion would not magically engender world peace.  It's one less reason for us all to kill each other though.  

As for removing it; let's start by banning free religious schools that are allowed to teach any old bullshit they like; let's specifiy that if the Church wants to give money to the public school system, it's done for reasons of charity rather than indoctrination.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"I think that at the moment Suarez is absolutely worth Bale money if for no other reason than he is better than Bale and just as valuable to his club. However having said that if Liverpool could sell him for like 80 million and use that money to bring in two or three legitimate world class players then I would absolutely willing to let him go.

I mean look at the players that BR wanted to bring in this summer: 

Diego Costa - rising star striker, already top level and only 24 (a true game-winner)

Mikhitaryan - clinical attacking midfielder with a goal-scoring drive and creative capacity (also a game winner)

Willian - underperforming at Chelsea but one of the best wingers in the game at the moment (think Sterling in 5 years)


If we could get three players of their quality that could fit the Liverpool system of play we would have both quality and depth all over the pitch. Keep in mind that while Suarez is playing out of his mind currently he will drop off at some point this season, he likely won't finish much above 30 goals despite his ridiculous start, and once he has fallen back down to earth we will all be wishing for some more depth in the squad. Also keep in mind the toll of a long season without squad rotation, remember how Tottenham a few years ago almost finished top four with Van der Vart, Modric and Bale but ran out of steam in march and april due to cumulative team fatigue? That might very likely happen to Liverpool this season and kill off any title hopes in the final months.

Look at City and how they have 5 game-changing attackers starting every match for them (with 2 or 3 off the bench if necessary), if one of their stars loses form there will be others to pick up the slack. Liverpool don't have that but they might be able to achieve that goal if they cash in on Suarez when his value is at its peak. Granted I don't want to become the next Arsenal with a squad of almost-players but I think that BR is a better developer of players than Wenger and has greater capacity to turn good players into great players (exhibit A: Henderson).

However if Suarez does stay, and if FSG give BR 2011-Kenny-Dalglish-esque money to spend, and if he is able to bring in one legitimate big-name player (see above) and maybe a couple role players then I think Liverpool might reach a point where they can become title contenders with their current squad of ""nobodies"" much like United did in the past under Ferguson.

As for a number I think £80 million is a lot of money and anything above that would be icing on the cake, even £60 million would be a fair price but at that level if I'm Liverpool I say thanks, but no thanks, he's worth more to us than to anyone else

On corners we could try setting up a wall that inhibits player movement - I've seen teams use a wall to pen in the keeper with good effect but why not use that same concept to stop the runners. We can then use our better aerial players to mark space the behind the wall. Also being a bit more physical on defense would help, on corners all fouls are called in favor of the defense so as long as you make it a 50-50 tangle by the end you will get away with it (also if a striker gets crunched on the first corner of a game they might pull back a bit on ensuing free kicks etc., which is another added benefit of being physical).",0,1387704161,null,0,false,0,ce7mwog,t3_1tfcko,t1_ce7mwog,t1_ce7jvu4,null,1428031526,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

* [keegan is a newcastle legend, not liverpool, because whatever](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1tcg3m/liverpool_legend_who_doesnt_get_mentioned_enough/ce6p7uh)

It isn't just because you made two mistakes in two comments in 12 hours, its because you followed them up and didn't retract/apologize until you were called out. 

Further, it isn't just these two comments. They just happen to be the latest two. You constantly make factual errors. All that changed this time is that some people felt like calling you out, whereas 99% of the time they just let the circlejerk continue. 

I've only read around 15-20 of your comments, and almost all of them, as soon as they delve into a topic that requires a little bit of knowledge, have factual flaws contained in them. The latest two you edited and apologized for only because they were pointed out, that is why I won't point out more - because i've noticed that you make up your arguments as you go based on discovering what is true (like feeling your way around in the dark). I don't need to help you in that.

there is no way you are a coach at the club. your writing simply doesn't convey the level of intelligence or knowledge that the job would require. you pass only because more knowledgable people have moved on and don't bother anymore, and the people that do still believe you don't know enough to know better.

even the people from outside this sub who dropped in yesterday came, rolled their eyes, and then continued on their way. 

I really don't need to be convinced. I don't really care if other people are convinced either, I - and many others, know the truth. The challenge is there for you to pick up whenever you want, but we all know that you won't/can't. 

re-iterated again:

 * pick a trusted reddit member, or two
 * send them proof, something solid like phoning liverpool and asking for you, you taking a photo at the lfc office, etc.
 * if you do this, I send you $1000 and apologize, and we all go on knowing that your story is true, and that its liverpool who have hired a totally incompetent person who runs his mouth on the internet as a coach. 

I know you won't take this challenge, and you know that as well. your only way to continue this charade is to continue characterizing people who don't believe your bull as being on a 'witch hunt' and running for the guilt trip factor (oh no, they are abusing me! but I didn't do anything! (ignoring how you abuse users who don't agree with you, such as in the two example threads)).

the only other option you have is what you did last time - when the pressure becomes great, pretend you became 'fed up' with being challenged and delete your account, resulting in people 'begging' to get you back. 

I think you should take up verification proof with one or two redditors or stay quiet. 

edit: i'll get this on the record now. my bet is that he plays the 'people are hating on me, therefor i'm going to quit' card, as he did last time - even though nobody was actually messaging him or hating on him. he will then come back a couple of months later and everybody would have forgotten what the original fuss was about. there is zero chance he does the challenge, or is transparent in any way.",0,1387704496,null,0,1387704964,1,ce7myqm,t3_1tenr3,t1_ce7myqm,t1_ce7mqrn,null,1428031499,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

true,thaumatropia,null,null,"I definitely think so, and I hope that this becomes a consistent thing.

Although my cynical side thinks that this- along with his goalsplosion- is just Suarez putting himself in the shop window. I think it was telling that very few clubs approached Anfield looking to buy Suarez over the summer, and the one that made a serious offer was basically trying to get him for 50% off. My impression is that most other clubs weren't interested in picking up such an egregious troublemaker, even if he does score a ton of goals. Top clubs can find a lot of guys who can score a ton of goals, and also don't bite opponents or hurl racial epithets. 

So while I'm sure this is likely a sign that he's growing and maturing as a person, I'm also sure this is purely professional- both to make his time at Liverpool less dramatic and more productive, and also to make himself appear to be a more attractive asset to, say, Real Madrid. 

And you know what? Great. **As a professional this is exactly what he should be doing**.

Incidentally this is also why I think he signed the new contract- not to make a long term commitment to the club but rather to allow Liverpool to demand something closer to market value for him. The shitty thing about his tantrum last summer wasn't so much that Liverpool was under pressure to sell, but that they were under pressure to sell *cheap*. The player clearly wanted out, there may or may not be a release clause, so a lot of LFC's leverage flew out the window. Now, when Real Madrid come calling next summer- and they will- Liverpool will get a nice fat paycheck for him. Unless, of course, they do finish in the Top 4, in which case, yay Champions League!

true,[deleted],null,null,"The two biggest parties are the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, with the Liberal Democrats slightly behind.

Conservative Party (a.k.a. Tory): Currently in power led by Prime Minister David Cameron in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Right wing to Centre-Right. Pro-free market, pro-business with strong privatisation tradition from the Thatcher era. Has a lot of internal factions: traditional Conservatives will be against gay marriage, newer Tories will be for it. Somewhat Eurosceptic (not in favour of the EU), some members advocate for the UK to leave the EU, others want to reform it from the inside. Not entirely convinced by immigration, which is where a lot of the disagreement with the EU comes from as the EU allows citizens from poorer Eastern European countries such as Poland and Romania to move to the UK visa-free.

Labour Party: Currently led by Ed Miliband. Traditionally socialist and democratic socialist, but since the 90s became less opposed to free markets due to Thatcher's influence in a political shift known as New Labour. Traditionally used to have strong links to trade unions, not so much since New Labour. More supportive of keeping benefits and the welfare state strong. A bit sceptical of privatisations.

Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems): Led by Nick Clegg. Very centrist, socially liberal, pro-EU. Tends to be pragmatic. Opposed to what it considers to infringe on personal freedoms (ID cards, CCTV). Somewhat pro-free markets but still wants a strong welfare state.

Now there are dozens of smaller parties, but the bigger ones are UKIP and the Green Party.

UKIP (UK Independence Party): New kid on the block. Led by the very controversial populist Nigel Farage. Somewhat of a single-issue party: it is opposed to everything EU. Main policy is that the UK leaves the EU, a popular opinion in the UK which resulted in David Cameron promising to have a referendum on the issue sometime in the future. Has expanded to include other policies but it is still very fragmented: disgruntled Tories who don't think the Conservative Party is Eurosceptic enough, libertarians, very right wing xenophobes opposed to any kind of immigration, even some traditional left-wing Labour supporters who are also anti-EU.

Green Party (Greens): What you'd expect from a Green Party. In favour of environmental policies with emphasis on renewables and against nuclear energy. Generally leftist.

Now there are some regional parties which I think are worth going into. As a disclaimer, I'm English so they aren't part of my political life.

Scottish National Party (SNP): Led by Alex Salmond, First Minister of Scotland. Wants Scotland to become independent from the UK, for which it reached an agreement to hold a referendum in 2014. Centre-left. Biggest party in Scotland at the moment.

Plaid Cymru: Somewhat SNP's Welsh counterpart but much less influential than the SNP. Has a Welsh separatist faction but generally wants more Welsh self-government but not full independence.

Mebyon Kernow: Minor party in Cornwall, a region in the southwesternmost part of England. Wants a Cornish parliament like the one Wales and Scotland have.

Then there is Northern Irish politics which is a mess (see The Troubles) as it does not align at all with British politics but very generally parties are separated on nationalist grounds: Irish nationalists/republicans want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and join the Republic of Ireland in the rest of the island, Irish unionists/loyalists want Northern Ireland to stay in the UK (republicans and loyalists are the more hardline, militant position of both sides). Nationalists/republicans are Catholic and generally left-wing, unionists are Protestant and generally right-wing. Sinn Féin is the biggest republican party, SDLP is the biggest nationalist party, and DUP and UUP are the biggest unionist parties. There is a lot of blood on everyone's hands.

The other party which I think is worth mentioning is the British National Party (BNP), led by Nick Griffin. It is a far right party very opposed to immigration and what it considers to be the islamisation of British culture and society. Has racist tendencies. Very traditionalist so opposed to homosexuality and in favour of being tougher on crime. Is a very small party but is disproportionately in the news and public conciousness because they are a bunch of pillocks.",0,1387709021,null,0,1387715157,0,ce7nnrn,t3_1tfvnw,t1_ce7nnrn,t3_1tfvnw,null,1428031175,16,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,16

The second, I would agree that Keegan is associated with Newcastle more nowadays. Why? Well its similar to the Owen situation where he went abroad. A lot of fans see players leaving as a betrayal and this damage his reputation.

Then when he returned to England he played for first Southampton and then went to a 2nd division team, Newcastle. Bit suprising that he would do that given his stature which ended up with him becoming very popular at Newcastle.

Then of course the real reason Keegan is so associated with Newcastle is the success he had whilst managing them, coming close to the league title and playing in such an attacking manner! He was so popular there he actually went back to manage a second time (and there were protests when it was rumoured he was sacked)

I can put a PC together from a pile of parts in less than 30 minutes, and most of that is routing cables.  Figure it'll take you about an hour the first time.

Unless Rose isn't deemed healthy enough or if we want to finally give Walker a break, back line and keeper is a no brainer:

Walker - Dawson - Chiricheș - Rose

I think the only safe bet is Capoue, because Southampton clearly won't be a park the bus kind of contest.

If minimum wage was raised all of a sudden it would certainly put the economy into a temporary recession but one which it would recover from, lower earners spend a higher percentage of their paycheck which goes back into the economy, creating jobs. Whereas if minimum wage stays low money is simply further concentrated into the upper echelons who put a proportionally smaller amount of their wealth back into the economy creating fewer jobs.

true,Rivid-Stuff,null,null,"&gt;It isn't a witch hunt. That term is for a period of moral panic where blame is appropriated without evidence but with mass hysteria. The opposite is happening here. As far as I am concerned the onus is on elevenreds to prove he is who he says he is.

Sorry to get pedantic here but that's just wrong, definition for witch hunt is:

&gt;a campaign directed against a person or group holding views considered unorthodox or a threat to society.

I admit its not a perfect fit for what you are doing but its pretty close and just felt appropriate given the context.

&gt;I've told him that if he can prove his identity to a trusted redditor that there is $1,000 in it for him. Even if he doesn't want the money and just wants this over with, he should still do it - let all this rest.

Do you not realise how ridiculous that sounds? Its like the 12 year old who starts asking for peoples address so he can come round and fight them.

&gt;At least then the next time it comes up another user can say 'I know elevenreds works at liverpool, he is cool, i met him/saw him at the club/saw him at a game etc.'. Notice nobody here says that, while at other subs users who are associated with the clubs or are close to the clubs and/or supporters clubs have people backing up their identity? There is a reason why nobody is backing up elevenreds ..

This isn't the first time its come up and he has had to defend himself, but it all just seems to trivial. What does he get out of pretending to be involved with the club? you can't really say respect as people like yourself attack him over inconsistencies, his opinion doesn't really carry any more weight that that of a regular poster (which he is anyway) and its not like he claims to be leaking sensitive information, the two posts you highlighted are comments anyone could have made.

&gt;[The potential for further practical and viable hydroelectricity power stations in the UK is estimated to be in the region of 146 to 248 MW for England and Wales,[4] and up to 2,593 MW for Scotland.[5] However, by the very nature of the remote and rugged geographic locations of some of these potential sites, in national Parks or other areas of outstanding natural beauty, it is likely that environmental concerns would mean that a large number of them would be deemed not to be suitable, or could not be developed to their full theoretical potential.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity_in_the_United_Kingdom)

You have to remember, that there are far more coal power stations and they are generally an awful lot bigger than their nuclear counterparts. Drax, for example (which is now multi fuel) is absolutely colossal.

Most of the exisiting nuclear power in the UK is first or second generation, and very old and rickety. Heck, we even still have an operational Magnox reactor. Basing the logic of future reactors on the leaky old crates of the past is nonsense. Coal power, however, is very much current generation. Even with the addition of catalytic converters and slurry systems that modern coal plants have, they are still very polluting indeed.

The point being, that if you had two power plants of identical installed power, living 2mi from a Nuclear one would be much less concerning than living 2mi from an equivalent coal one.

&gt;coal plants were equal to or higher than doses for people living around the nuclear facilities.

&gt;individuals living near coal-fired installations are exposed to a maximum of 1.9 millirems of fly ash radiation yearly. To put these numbers in perspective, the average person encounters 360 millirems of annual ""background radiation""

Coal power is advancing in technology:

If you want to talk about future nuclear power, you should compare it to future coal power.

true,Olliemon,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire/Derbyshire,"Absolutely - but I take it from the perspective that no matter how clean and efficient coal will ever be, you will be still burning and exhausting things that will contain ionising radiation and other carcinogens etc. Even the cleanest of burning still has byproducts. While it is obvious that nuclear power creates wastage, it isn't ejected into the air around it. I suppose in future there could be mechanisms by which the waste gases from coal energy wouldn't be exhausted, but that won't be in this or the next generation.

My point being that whichever way you look at it, a coal power plant would be more directly damaging to the persons and the environment surrounding it than an equivalent nuclear plant - and even if it is just a few millirems here and there, it is notably more than it would be otherwise (unless you live in a radon rich/granite rich region).

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Actually, the real problem is that carbon isn't priced into anything we use. It's extraordinarily expensive to reduce energy use in the UK housing stock. We have the oldest building stock in the world. To retrofit a house for a 60-80% carbon reduction will cost £40-50k (sometimes more when you start digging around and revealing structural problems. Slapping a bit of lagging in the loft, installing energy saving lightbulbs and double glazing simply won't cut it. You need well designed external wall insulation, underfloor insulation, high performance windows, air-tightness testing, mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, high performance appliances....and if you're feeling really flush, some sort of on-site microgeneration.

Even if we decided that was the goal, there simply aren't enough skills in the industry to deliver it, let alone money to pay for it. 

The payback of each of these measures individually goes beyond the lifetime of the actual product. Double glazing has a payback of 90+ years. External wall insulation is about 25-30. Why would a homeowner drop £12k on insulating their walls when they'd never get a return on the investment (the average person moves home every 7 years). Which comes back to the fact that none of us really pay for the carbon we emit. Energy is too cheap for any of this to make sense.

Most of these accidents are just cock-ups. The one you've linked there is just legitimate user error, I don't think it is fair to use that as an example of the issues with nuclear power, but rather how mistakes with nuclear power potentially have greater implications.

Furthermore, it is my understanding that the nuclear waste is treated in terms of grades of safety. If this stuff left the site it such a manner (in oil drums) and based on the logic it contained residue etc, it is logical to therefore assume it is low-grade waste, such as mildly radioactive things like used gloves etc. Hardly a Chernobyl incident, I think you'd agree.

I agree with you in the sense that it cannot be completely safe - but I think it is reasonable that given the new design of nuclear power stations and the *exceptionally* stringent safety procedures surrounding modern nuclear activities, that it should be considered at least as safe as coal power.

You don't install it in a house in say 2009 and then claim the allowance for that house every subsequent year.

true,lotsofjam,null,null,"The logic that, “People were not aware of them but they are now. So there is more demand” is flawed. I would like to make 3 points.

 First problem you have is that this is one of those statements that cannot be proven wrong, much like asking if something does not exit. If more are being built, then surely it’s because there is a greater demand? How about proving that the food banks were needed before the tories came into power and to the same degree because THAT statistic would back up this argument completely. If you are interested in the numbers, from 2009 which has 40,000 food banks around the uk to now, 500,000 in 2013. 

 Second, and this is a fact, people living expenses have increased while wages have fallen so that kind of leads me to think that people would need these more. Average wages have fallen 8% since 2008.

Thirdly, it’s much harder to get benefits these days because of the changes to benefit laws so more people needing food banks would make sense in that case. These are not people who want to live for nothing. You need to be in a real dire situation to go to a food bank. 
Can one of you please provide proof that backs up this argument in some way? Because from what I see so far, it has zero proof but there is evidence to back to the argument that there is a real demand for them now more then back before 2008. 

Back on topic for a moment, the fact that these tories were laughing and Ian snuck away from the debate is fucking sickening. Absolutely sickening. These people should not be in government if they cannot take these things seriously. The way they go about this, they seem to assert themselves above them and laugh makes me blood boil. Their lives have no more worth then the people they are laughing at, they just have more money. 

Scum.


EDIT: I think I have found the name of this type of argument. ""Specious Reasoning""

""Specious reasoning is an argument which seems to be followed by and described with valid points, but which is in reality misleading or false. The proof used in these lines of reasoning are often speculations that could be possibilities but are in no way actually backed up by any evidence or truth. Specious reasoning can give great comic effect and is used often in television and movies to add levity to caricatures of conspiracy theorists and cast members that are meant to be viewed as ignorant or uneducated.""

&gt;If you open hundreds of branches across the country

This alone raises all sorts of questions. *Why* are charities opening hundreds of branches all across the country? Are they suddenly (in these times of austerity) flush with extra cash compared to ten years ago? The underlying assumption (stated by Lord something or other last month) that people will always take free food, irrespective of need) presupposes that these charities are sitting on positively bounteous resources and are having their generosity abused by people who aren't strictly penurious.

&gt;increased awareness

This is more of the same, from my perspective. Twenty years ago, I had never heard of a Food Bank. Ten years ago I was vaguely aware that certain charities provided stop-gap food parcels for people who were flat out broke. Now they're seemingly everywhere, everyone knows about them, and while I agree they do good work I'm not at all happy that what keeps families from quite literal starvation is charity. I am not seeking to diminish the good work these charities do, but the entire point of institutionalised welfare was to replace patchy private provision of subsistence level benefits with a reliable nationwide system which wasn't subject to the vagaries which attend charitable trusts.

&gt;Labour refused to allow job centres to refer people to foodbanks

This was a poor decision on their part, but again, it's perverse to claim that the Tories have done something *good* by washing their hands of the destitute and referring them on to private charities.

Sherwood got a bit lucky that Dembele got injured because our back four looked desperate for cover and Bentaleb executed that nicely when he came on. Defense looked off it a bit, but understandable with the injuries they've had.

Other than Dembele, midfield was decent. Sigurdsson and Lamela never really got too involved despite good work rates, Eriksen confident and sure of himself on the ball and even defending a bit more than he usually does. Chadli was fantastic and should have added an assist.

What else can you say about Adebayor? Here's hoping his form continues beyond this ""impress the new boss"" period. Soldado showing what he can create on and off the ball with goals surely to come.

true,cetyl,flair7,,"Notes about todays game:

* 3 points away to Southampton is a great result, many teams will go there this season and come away with nothing to show for it.
* So it wasn't a controlled, careful, considered performance. We needed goals and we needed 3 points. I'd take that any day of the week.
* So we got a bit of luck for our goals, but lets not forget we practically gave them their two goals as well.
* Vastly improved second half, I can only presume Sherwood got them fired them up.
* I hope we'll get a somewhat settled team now, we need that. Sure a couple of players who are out will come back into the team/squad, but I don't feel as if there'll be as much rotation as with AVB.

Some thoughts on the players, I'm not going to criticise:

* ADEBAYOR - Enough said.
* Chadli - Much better than Lamela. I know there are a lot of fans of Lamela on here but Chadli has come into his own the last couple of games. Liked him on the right.
* Bentaleb - Looks like we have a player on our hands. Very composed for a young player, great vision and passing as well.
* Soldado - Yes, I know he missed some chances but two of our goals came from him dropping out wide. His touch and link up play is world's better than our other alternatives. He'll get his goals, he made his runs today and he got picked out. He'll be frustrated with himself but I think he'll also feel relieved with how Sherwood likes to set up his teams.
* Eriksen - So he was playing out of position a bit, but he had one of those games where you don't appreciate what he was doing because it wasn't always immediately obvious.

Pass to Siggy! Many times he was wide open and no one would find him with the final ball. The man has proved he can finish! 

The second equalizer was 100% Lloris' fault. Really had no business coming out like that.

I thought Vlad was really poor today. He kept allowing Southampton to play that weighted ball behind him, leaving Dawson to come help. His positioning worried me throughout the game. 

Soldado MUST finish at least two of those chances. However, it's good to see him getting more looks on goal. Hope to see him convert soon. 

I want Dembele to do well, but he cannot play as a DM for us. Not a knock on him, it's just not where he thrives (much like Paulinho behind the striker role). When Bentaleb came on, I definitely questioned the move, but the youngster played very well.

I'm not sold on Rose yet. He did some good things today, but I still think Spurs could upgrade there (Luke Shaw anyone?).

I'll have to watch again, but I forgot Eriksen was even playing in the second half. Looks like he still needs some time to settle. 

Adebayor! Take a bow. What a performance. 

I know this is all a bit pessimistic (it's the perfectionist in me), but I was extremely happy with the result today and look forward to West Brom! COYS

The real reason that there is such a trade deficit in the UK isn't because we buy loads of foreign stuff, but because we just don't employ enough clever people. All of our doctors and engineers and scientists bugger off to other countries where there are better jobs and so we have a complete lack of cutting edge industry.

Trade deficit as a whole is good for a developed economy because it makes the currency more solvent (an issue that places like Switzerland are having), but I agree that we need to make more things.

From a personal perspective, an awful lot needs to be done by government to incentivise small, high-tech industry such that we can keep on top of the game.

Another thing to take into account is that a lot of these companies producing these products aren't really from one country or another, they are part of multinational conglomerates.

I have never once seen a non-Muslim working in any of these shops. I have been to many more areas that are much the same - London, Birmingham, Bradford etc. So I don't think it's an unfair assumption. The same goes for takeaways with Pakistanis and Bangladeshis with takeaways. In the last decade I have seen more than 1,000 people working in these takeaways and Muslim owned shops - and not one white face.

How many Muslims do I think use this rule *at the moment*? Very few. Then again, how many burkhas did I see in the first 15 years of my life? None. How many do I see *every single day* these days? At least 3. It always starts like this - Muslims and their sympathisers pretend that these changes are ""no big deal"" because only a small number of Muslims do it, then slowly but surely larger numbers of the community start doing it, then all of a sudden it's pretty much mandatory and Muslims are harassing other Muslims for selling pork in the supermarket. I barely saw a single hijab in the first 15 years of my life and now Muslims pressure other Muslim women to wear it at all times.   (This is the part where you pretend this doesn't happen, and it definitely won't happen this time ;))

watch him next time against a team coming forward with quality and you will simply see the same thing, him performing badly because this is his defending quality, not because he had a bad game

But they're not refusing to do the job they're paid for. Their employer has decided that the job they're paid to do includes and option for not selling certain products. Which is similar to the situations I mentioned.

I'm all for calling out people with silly religious beliefs, like not eating certain foods because their gods tell them not to, or wearing certain clothing, or all sorts of other religious rituals...

But I'm also all for employers putting in place policies which make the lives of their employees a little easier; not making them choose between their religious beliefs (however silly) and their job.

So in this case, I can say that while there are reasons for not eating pork and not drinking alcohol (I don't drink alcohol either), I think doing so because a book tells you to is a bit silly.

I have said i would love to see us try a 3 man midfield with 2 advanced CM's and a deep holding mid.  Pairing Siggy with Eriksen would allow Siggy to be a threat in attack without putting the creative responsibility (creativity isn't Siggy's strongest feature either) on him and we know that he will work in defense.

Alternatively you could deploy him just behind the striker in a support striker role, i don't know that he has the creativity to reallly flourish in that role but paired with a striker like Ade he would get his chances in and around the box.

Personally, when all our wingers are healthy i don't know that Siggy brings as much to the attack as the others.  He tends to play very narrow (today he was a bit better) and doesn't have the true pace to stretch the defense on his own which puts a great deal of pressure on the LB to provide the width.

He actually reminds me a bit of the issues we had with Dempsey last season where we just seemed to be force him into the lineup in slots that are not playing to his strengths.

 Its not that Siggy is a bad player (i actually rate him fairly highly) its that his strength is his ability to shoot and score in and around the box and if that is the case we have players who can bring more to the table on the wings and (when healthy) Eriksen/Holtby can bring more creativity in the middle of the pitch.",0,1387731156,null,0,false,0,ce7s3w7,t3_1tgr1h,t1_ce7s3w7,t1_ce7rsaa,null,1428029100,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Okay, UK power usage per day=[From wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_Kingdom) Avr=36GW.   Peak=60GW.   
  Or from this link about 85GW is the total(?). They don't source so...

So this link says we are getting 16GW from 12 reactors each(?) at 5 sites. The english sucks and I'm guessing its wrong because wiki says we get 11GW from 14 reactors *today*, providing about 20% of power.  I'm going to guess it means 12 reactors between 5 sites.    

Edit: I looked a little further and it seems we will be closing most of the existing plants within the next 20 years. They also seem to take 10 years to build. So this nearly seems like we would just be replacing the existing plants than pushing for more.


Anyway. Add 16 to 11 we get 27GW. Probably approaching half. These new reactors might be replacements for old ones too.   

Power needs will increase in the future, so maybe its not that big a problem anyway. 

So yeah, so long as it is 12 reactors total instead of 50 it seems no problems on the baseload.

Let's put aside the fact that the person making this offer vastly over-estimated my abilities and social standing.

One reason (among others) why I didn't take up the offer was that, while I was smoking the odd spliff, I was aware that it can give people problems. Someone might get some kind of problem from weed that I'd sold them, and as I'd be profiting from that, some kind of guilt would transfer on to me.  

Now I don't know if this ethics was correct. I don't even know exactly how much harm could have really come to anyone had I sold a few fiver bags to people. But. I think I can relate to the people who don't want to serve alcohol to customers, in this case, and I don't think I'd call them 'selfish', exactly. 

I make no comment on the legality or business sense of this, or on how widespread it may or may not be. I'm just saying, there are reasons why you might not want to sell alcohol to people, and they might not be 100% scientifically accurate reasons, but they're still based on the idea of not wanting to enable people to harm themselves with the product you're selling them.

true,SashaCD,null,null,"I don't know why the stone became the favoured measure for human body weight in particular. Weights for most other purposes have historically been in pounds, quarters, hundredweights or tons as far as I know... 

If I had to guess I would say: one stone is 14 pounds, which is a normal weight for a young baby, and ten to twelve stone is a normal weight for an adult man, so the scale fits pretty well with human life and growth. I think knowing your weight down to the last pound is perhaps a rather an exaggerated level of accuracy - if you're over a hundred pounds, each pound you loose or gain is less than 1% of the total is really neither here nor there. If you lose or gain a whole stone the difference will be noticeable. 

As to why people keep using the stone for human weight now, I would guess it's because the all our folk knowledge about weight is now denominated in stones and pounds... if you tell me you're a man of average height and you weigh 150lbs, I have to stop and think if that's a lot. If you tell me ""just under 11 stone"" I think that sounds a reasonable weight to be. 

I'm not a cultural anthropologist (v. rare that someone has to say that!) but I'm guessing the metric units that are more successful in becoming part of ""folk knowledge"" are the ones that are commonly provided from a scientific source (e.g. the Met Office weather forecasts which give temperatures in Celsius) and fit easily into a human scale and experience (most outside temperatures in the UK are between 0 and 25, rarely above or below.) 

Shoes are sold in a unit-less number size ""8 or 8 and a half"" as are dresses, but produced to specifications written using centimetres. 
It's worth noting though that using the unit-less dress size in the UK the number is 4 to 6 greater than in the US. 
Men's pants (or rather *trousers* ) are sold using inch measurements for waist and inseam. 

If people are really interested in this sort of thing, might be worth 1. reading up on wikipedia, but aslo 2. try reading 'Watching the English' by Kate Fox (an actual cultural anthropologist) she doesn't deal with weights and measures, but there's lots of other detail in there that might interest non UK people who regularly watch UK television / consume other media.

The Christmas tree, the Yule log, wreaths, candles, the very date itself (which used to fall on the Winter Solstice, long before the Gregorian calendar was adopted), gift giving, holiday cards in verse, wassailing (or just plain getting drunk with holiday cheer), holly, mistletoe, kissing under the mistletoe, the “12 days” of Christmas, eating a feast, even hooking up at the office party — pretty much none of these had anything to do with Christians. All were pagan winter holiday rituals without a shred of connection to the baby Jesus whatsoever, before the church decided to file off the serial numbers and declare such traditions their own. Ironically enough, the biggest Christmas tradition that today’s traditionalist religious leaders tend to decry — Santa Claus — is one of the few that arose directly from Christianity itself (there really was a Saint Nicholas, although all the “magic elf who gives naughty and nice children presents” trappings were added later).*

true,GreatZapper,null,null,"I'm head of languages in a secondary school, and a German specialist with a German language degree from a UK university.

Leider stirbt Deutsch als Fremdsprache schnell aus.  There has been a huge rise in Spanish over the last decade or so, at the expense of German, and teaching posts are few and far between.  If you were able to get Qualified Teacher Status (QTS, which you would need for the vast majority of schools over here) you would find yourself almost unemployable as just a German language teacher.  You would, at the very least, need some French, and have to be prepared to teach a timetable that is predominantly French with some lessons of German.  While there are still some pockets of German teaching (mostly in independent and/or grammar schools) there will be increasingly fewer jobs available.  The likelihood of a school needing a German and History and/or English teacher is almost infinitesimally small.

I understand the position in universities is similar, and many German departments have shut down in recent years - and, indeed, according to recent figures, around 40% of all university languages departments (not just German) [are facing closure](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/17/language-teaching-crisis-universities-closure).

The one way in *might* be something like a [Foreign Language Assistant](http://www.britishcouncil.org/languageassistants-fla.htm), although with the shrinkage in teaching German the opportunities for this might be limited.

Languages are now compulsory in Key Stage 2 (7-11 years old) as well as 3 (11-14), so there might be some growth in years to come, though my guess is that primaries will upskill their own teachers and use the expertise in the feeder secondaries to help, rather than employ languages specialists.

true,danped,null,null,"My thoughts on the game/team at the moment:

1) Adebayor is now our first choice striker. Neither defoe or soldado have had a performance anywhere near the quality that he has shown against WHU/saints.

2) Soldado is simply not that good. His build up play is decent but missing the target with those 3 chances in quick succession was absolutely SHOCKING. If i had my way i'd sell him back to a spanish club for as much money as we could get and buy another striker.

3) Midfield wasnt amazing today Eriksen looked good on the ball and he has a fantastic range of passing. Sig was a bit out of the game. Dembele didnt look fit. Lamela hasnt set the world alight yet but i do see alot of potential in him. I think we need to persevere with him and build his relationship with eriksen up.

4) Defense wasnt fantastic. Rose should not be our first choice LB IMO hes simply not good enough. Chiriches didnt have his best game. Dawson looked ok. Walker is fantastic but i feel that he wasnt on the same wavelength as lamela. Lloris was shaky but i put that down mainly to the defense.

5) I think this 4-4-2 system could work possibly. When fit I would play Walker chiriches vertong BAE(if he comes back) Lennon Eriksen sandro Lamela Adebayor Soldado. I think there is alot of quality in that team that could potentially have a credible shot at top 4 THIS season.

6) Overall today was a great result and one that i didn't expect if im honest. I really hope Adebayors form continues, it needs to for the sake of the team. We wouldnt have won today if AVB was manager so i still believe it was right for him to go.

All it shows is that Brits are prepared to go overseas with their cash to buy something which could **in principle** be bought here. I'm not suggesting people don't have good reasons for seeking those services overseas - I'm saying those are pounds sterling, earned in the UK that people take to another country and spend, investing in someone elses healthcare service. It's bad for the UK especially given that effectively the **only** source of investment in British healthcare is from the government via taxation into the NHS. If anything what this research shows is that we need to break down the barriers to people buying these services locally. In some cases (e.g. Dignitas) those barriers might be legal... or as you implied financial. I suspect though that in the vast majority of cases it is actually simply a matter of supply. There isn't a sufficient enough marketplace for advanced private care here so people seek it elsewhere.

UUP (Ulster Unionist Party), used to be the big party back in the day, (second largest unionist party, third largest overall.) economically centre right wing, reasonably liberal but with a christian influence. Has in the past been politically aligned with the Tories, officially and unofficially. During the last general election had a pact with the Tories fielding joint candidates under the banner UUCNF.

DUP (Democratic Unionist Party), largest party, is a unionist party. Centre right economically but less so than the UUP. Fairly authoritarian, (pretty much told what to think from higher ups, how do you become a higher up you'll have to ask the higher ups.) Strong Christian influence, the party founder also founded a new denomination.

 The Alliance, neutral party in regards to union debate, links to the Lib-dems. 

Sinn Fein, largest nationalist (separatist) party. Socialist, like to display themselves as liberal but all evidence shows that they are very much authoritarian. Political wing of the PIRA.

SDLP (Social Democratic and Liberal Party), second largest nationalist party (used to be largest nationalist party) centre left, somewhat liberal. Unofficial links to the Labour party. 

There are smaller parties

TUV, traditional unionist voice, nearly a one man band led by Jim Allister QC, in practice the unofficial opposition to the stormont executive sending light onto some of the shadier aspects of the DUP/Sinn Fein team. Jim was voted as the best MLA in storming in a cross community poll.

Between this and botttled_water's comment, I'm seeing an ... interesting way of putting things. 

First, like it or not, Islam cannot really 'only be described as Fascism': for one thing the main ideals of Fascism – racial superiority (a *Herrenvolk*) and total devotion to the leader (or to the state or to the *Volk*) – are both contrary to Islamic teaching. 

If we don't like something, unless that thing is Fascism, calling it Fascism is only going to muddy the waters. 

Secondly, nowhere in the Koran does it explicitly state 'people should be thrown off a cliff for expressing their love for each other'. Mohammed did not turn up in Mecca saying 'Right guys, listen up - from now on, if you ever express your love for someone, bang, you're getting done over. Who's with me?' 

You might as well say that 'Christianity is a religion based on the idea that Jews are child-murderers', or that 'Hindus believe your life is meaningless'. When we do this we essentially over-write our opinion about the religion on to the religion itself. There's plenty to argue about in the text itself, surely, without letting our blurbs get in the way?

Probably cheaper and infinitely less risky then buying from some shady tout website, but still.

You might be in luck! I've just remembered Fulham. They have a neutral section next to the away end. There'll be loads of reds in there and you can buy the tickets though the Fulham website. Our game isn't on sale yet but their game against Saints a fortnight earlier is, so I reckon they could go up soon. 

My only concern is that they used to sell neutral tickets to LFC, Utd, Arsenal and Chelsea as a job lot. That's going back to 2004 though, so things may well have changed.

I don't really know why people do this when their actual policy can be attacked just as any party's policy can be attacked.  They argued that the austerity that everybody moaned about so universally was austerity lite and that it should have gone far deeper.  When David Davis criticised George Osborne for not going into it *more* severely UKIP agreed.  As for cuts you should see what they intended for the civil service at the MOD!  It was truly brutal. As in tens of thousands of jobs.  They noted that the Israel Defence Forces provide a service for a military their size with a civil service of around 700 and that they'd spoken to people within the department that something along similar scale could be done in the UK.  The MOD has a civil service of other 50,000.   The term decimation doesn't even come close, and they weren't the only civil service department to be viewed.

Remember, they're the party of limited central government and instead localism.

There was an attack piece in The Times that said there was a blackhole (£110bn IIRC) but it was all on the premise that all the spending would happen on day one, whereas the actual policy was that it would have to be phased over 10 years!  That's pretty dishonest reporting.

Part of our strategy under Rodgers is to have Coutinho available as an outlet when we win the ball back.  That way, we can play through him on the counter.  Whatever you make of his performances recently, he is undoubtedly our best option for this.  No one on the team holds the ball on the dribble as well as he does, and no one can pick a pass quite like he can.  He isn't particularly good at defending anyway, so it's not like we're losing that much.

Also, I know Hendo has been doing brilliantly of late and Coutinho's been struggling a bit, but on balance Coutinho is legitimately a cut above Henderson when it comes to vision, dribbling, and passing.  Perhaps several cuts above.  (Don't get me wrong- I do like Hendo, but Coutinho is far better with the ball at his feet.)  Further, Henderson is much better at defending and pressing the ball anyway, so we ask him to do that instead of being free as an outlet.

The whole ""speaking out against immigration is racist"" thing is so 90's.

The fact the lib dems are pretty toxic these days, and that the next election looks set to be fought on a ticket of living standards and immigration makes Clegg and Cables comments even more redundant. Whether you agree with it or not, there is an abundance of data that says a lot of British people **are weary** about the current rate of immigration and that their votes will be influenced strongly by it. Cameron might well be onto a big vote-winner here, and if polls are anything to go by the conservatives could do with a few popular manifesto policies because ""5 more years of austerity"" probably won't win the next general election. 

**Tl;dr:** Cameron is posturing on what could turn out to be one of the most popular conservative policies at the next election if polls are anything to go by. Clegg and Cable continue to indicate the lib dems are slipping comfortably back into electoral irrelevance.

You need a talisman, and right now, Suarez is the only guy in red who can fill that role.  If LFC can make a run at a title and bring in a couple of good signings (a winger, and a left back, maybe a holder to supplement Lucas) you have the start of one of the better clubs in Europe, that might entice Suarez to stay.

Buying a bunch of above-average to good players with the money Suarez would bring in won't help any aspirations of a title.  

The youth and the price of the buys that Rodgers has brought in are encouraging; but a Suarez sale would bring those falsely confident smiles we saw on Spurs fans' faces.  I think Rodgers is smart enough to know that as of right now, Suarez is irreplaceable and that's a good thing.

He is a inferior in literally every situation, and a liability on corners and crosses. All those awful sloppy goals we were conceding early last year when he was in goal and the ball was bouncing around on free kicks and shit? That's what Friedel brings these days. 

Lloris and Friedel will probably be directly to blame for the same amount of bad goals each season, but unlike Friedel, Lloris will win points on his own. 

I really can't even believe we're having this conversation. Let's drop probably our only true world class player after a couple of mistakes in favor of someone with no future as a player.

We might not have the best side in the world (or even the premiership) but by god does Brendan get the best out of them. I actively enjoy watching Liverpool play in a way I have not done in a very long time.

Players come into the side, players go out of the side. But what does not change to any great extent is the way the team are playing football and the style of football. And the great thing is we can only get better. The players in the side will improve and any players coming in just need to adapt to the way Brendan has got Liverpool playing.

That takes time to acclimate to (as we've seen so far). Right now, it's a risk not worth taking. We have to go with the tried and true. From the two matches I've seen Sherwood managing, we look like vintage Tottenham. That is what attracted me to the team initially, fluid and quick attacking football.

Also, the youth must be involved. What's the point of having an academy if you can't the youngsters that come out of it? I really love seeing the youngsters going head to head with the titans of the premier league. It's good for confidence, good for development. But we seem so scared to utilize them, and it sucks because I feel like they're the ones to make a real impact on the game simply to prove their worth. Look at Bentaleb today, and Frederick's not too long ago. Just glimpses of what our academy has to offer.

Dalglish was a magician. He averaged around a goal every 1.5 games for Liverpool, totally outshining the legend he was bought to replace (Keegan). I wasn't alive to see him in his hayday, but I've seen enough replays and footage of it to know how good he really was.

Rush was a goalscoring machine. Part of our magnificent 80s team, he was probably the best striker in Europe for years on end. He was a much more limited player than Dalglish, but it didn't stop him being absolutely lethal in the box.

Fowler was a poacher, and one of the best around. He was nicknamed ""God"" among Pool fans, and with good reason. You could always count on him to get goals. He played with us during our decline from the form of the 70s and 80s, but he was a truly amazing striker who loved the club.

Owen was, at a point, the best striker in the world during his time here. He was clinical. His pace was frightening and once he was set through, you never doubted the end-result. It was unfortunate how things ended with him and us, but judging solely on when he was here, he was truly a great.

If you've supported the reds for five years, you would have seen Torres in his prime. I would rate him as one of our greatest strikers, despite only being here four years and leaving for Chelsea. Again, he was a lethal striker with frightening pace and ability.

Overall, I think Suarez is a better overall player than Torres, Owen and Fowler were. I think he has a way to go to prove himself a better player than either Dalglish or Rush. You have to remember, these were players that were a key part of Liverpool's dominance of world football (akin to the Barcelona of a few years ago, or the Ajax of the late 60s/early 70s). Rush is our all-time leading scorer and Dalglish is largely regarded as our best ever player.

Everyone has such incredible togetherness, there's a system of playing that's coherent and adaptive, and belief in what's possible -- TRUE belief, rather than the half-hearted hopes of 2+ years ago. It's almost at the point that supporters will be annoyed if we don't win the league this year. 

Personally, I just want to see continual improvement across the club, not just the team. That's what will bring silverware and long-lasting success to Liverpool. Other teams can buy success (ManCity, Chelsea), and I'm sure many of us have envied their ability to do that. But money dissipates, but class lasts. Nothing against City supporters -- it's working for them, and I'm glad for them. But I'm also glad that Liverpool is taking the alternative, harder road in the hopes of success over the long term. Our club can dominate this league for years, if this kind of growth and improvement continues, not occasional flashes.

This is hilariously simplistic. Yes it is, but there is a limit to how much of it we can construct, and it's a low one. Here's the government's own climate change calculator - which is awesome by the way, check it out:

http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways/11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111/primary_energy_chart

See what happens if you turn wind power, offshore and on, all the way up to '4' (which is the maximum possible build: 60,000 turbines). See how much extra energy that gives you. Now knock nuclear power up one step (1 being no new commissioning) to 2. That's 13 reactors online. It gives you about the same max output and a far higher net output.

Either of those options supplies about 1/3rd of the UK's power requirements. The difference is that after 60,000 turbines you've built on every single viable piece of land and sea for wind power. There's a hard limit. Nuclear? No such problem.

true,Stukya,lfc99,,"Iv'e supported Liverpool for well over 20 years now (29 years old and have never seen us win a title). In that time we have always had 1 top draw game winner, Rush, Fowler, Owen, Gerrard, Torres and now Suarez. So i'll attempt to explain what i thought of them.

**Rush** - **346 goals** Was in the twilight of his career when i first started supporting Liverpool but just a natural goalscorer who made his own luck.


**Fowler**  - **183 Goals** My hero as a kid. On his day he was the most natural finisher i've ever seen. Just check out his [4 minute 30 second hatrick] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bowtKlXfi0w).  Every single 1 on 1, every single penalty you were sure he'd score. He is referred to as God for a reason.


**Owen**  -  **158 goals** My grandpa had been going on about this  player called Michael Owen who was in the youth squad for years (he knew about him through a family connection). He was saying that he will be the next best thing and boy was he right. Owen took over where Fowler left off. Except he had electric pace. He was more of a superstar than Fowler, he was to Liverpool, what Messi was to Barca when he first came on the scene. 


**Gerrard** - **162 goals** In my eyes the greatest player we have ever had. I'm too young to have seen King Kenny play but Steven Gerrard has given me some of my greatest memories. Zidane called him the best midfielder in the world and i agree. Originally he was all about those famous 40yrd passes where he would land the ball on the exact blade of grass he aimed for. In his day, giving him a shot on the edge of the area was like giving him a penalty. He was probably the best player in the world in his prime. Don't forget he carried the whole team for years.


**Torres** - **£50 million lol** Great player, great goals and a cunt. Is probably gutted that he didnt stay to play with Suarez.


**Suarez** **the skys the limit** You all know what he can do. He has the finishing talents of a Torres, the excitement of an Owen and the love of the fans like a Gerrard. Hes the most skilful player i have seen since Mcmanaman, the best free kick taker we have ever had. We don't know what the future holds but his name can rightfully be mention alongside any of the Liverpool greats. 


In my time supporting Liverpool the kop has always found 1 hero to pin there hopes on. I cannot speak about Dalglish but hes probably only second behind Gerrard in the Liverpool's greatest ever players list. 5 years ago i would have said there will never be another that is as good as Gerrard. Now i'm not so sure. ",0,1387751983,null,0,false,0,ce80iwd,t3_1th08l,t1_ce80iwd,t3_1th08l,null,1428024664,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

If those are your requirements, in about 20-30 years when this new generation of nuclear power stations is being decommissioned and solar's efficiency has increased, presumably you'll be a solar proponent?

Nuclear proponents are curious beasts and smell (not accusing you of this; more the whiff from the government as described in the linked article) of astroturf. Nuclear really is a great technology; that's why forward-thinking countries like France and Japan and Germany adopted it in the 1960s.

But today, nuclear is - you know - just *okay*. Yes, there have been efficiency and waste-management improvements since last century - and no, it's not likely we'll have a tsunami or earthquake in Britain. It's certainly better than other non-renewables like coal, oil and gas (nuclear waste is probably a better deal than just spewing shit into the air).

But really forward-thinking countries are looking at going completely renewable. And every time I speak to a nuclear fan, I'm *always* wondering, are you actually excited by the technology, or are you a shill?

So if you guys showed up and someone was already watching the Chelsea game on the large screen I can see why they choose not to switch tvs. Some might not agree but if I was watching the liverpool game and a group of Chelsea fans showed up and the bar made me move to a smaller tv, I would be annoyed.

OP - I'll be at burgundy watching the game as I have no doubt it will be on the big screen. The only down side to burgundy is that it's a little pricy for a bar but even then I can't complain as the food and staff are both great.

true,RomanAbramovich,RU,russia,"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/22/chelsea-jose-mourinho-stability-12-years

&gt;José Mourinho has set himself the ambitious target of remaining Chelsea's manager for another 12 years despite returning to the club on his ""worst contract"" of the past six seasons.
The Portuguese will seek to extend his mastery over Arsène Wenger's Arsenal to 10 games at the Emirates Stadium on Monday as the visitors attempt to hoist themselves above the early pace-setters. Wenger is entering his 18th year in charge across the capital, longevity envied by Mourinho who has noticed a more long-term approach in Roman Abramovich since returning to English football in the summer.

&gt;Mourinho signed a four-year contract worth around £10m a season, considerably less than he was earning at Real Madrid, to oversee a Chelsea team in transition. ""Realistically I hope at the end of those four years we sit, analyse the situation and that will be the point where we both – club and me – are happy to carry on or happy to separate,"" he said. ""But I would like [to stay for], say, 12 years. I'm 51 next month. I'd say 12 years, and then two to go to a World Cup with a national team. I would prefer the Portuguese national team. England second [choice], yes.

&gt;""The best way to [run a club] is to do it with stability. For the players, if you want to help them grow up, you do that much better with stability: in ideas, philosophy, model of play, style of leadership. This all comes from stability at the highest level: with the owners and board and, after that, the manager. The second line of the hierarchy. That stability is very important. You look, for example, to Manchester United and everybody feels David [Moyes] will have his time to do his work in a calm way. I think that's fantastic.""

&gt;Abramovich had been through five permanent managers and two interims since that divorce from Mourinho in 2007, a turnover that has not checked the flow of trophies into Stamford Bridge. He returned for Mourinho in June and found a manager eager to take on a very different kind of project, and on relatively reduced terms compared with those he had enjoyed with Internazionale and Real. ""There were a lot of teams [offered to me] who could be successful immediately in my hands,"" Mourinho said.
""I had Real Madrid: I left them because I wanted to, not because they wanted me to. I had other clubs in other countries where it would be easier to go and find an 'easy' job immediately. If I was here for financial reasons, I wouldn't be here getting a lot less money than I had at Real Madrid, where I had three more years on my contract.

&gt;""I didn't come here because the job was easy, or because I had a team ready to attack the title, or because I was coming here for the best contract of my life. It's the worst of my last six years. I'm here because I love the club, I love the project. It's a different project.""

&gt;The manager expects the team at his disposal next season to be ""phenomenal"" after their development this term and further additions next summer. Yet they remain in contention to win the league this time and can go joint top if they defeat Arsenal. Mourinho's once acrimonious relationship with Wenger has improved in the years since the pair last clashed in the Premier League, their verbal sniping having prompted the infamous accusation that the Arsenal manager was ""a voyeur"" in October 2005.
""He was speaking about Chelsea all the time, always making criticisms and jibes, about the money and this and that … it was too much,"" recalled Mourinho. ""At this moment he's totally focused on his team and his club. He's not looking to us. Peacefully, we are living without any kind of problems. I don't regret [the comments]. These are football fallouts, not personal fall-outs. Football fallouts you have today and forget tomorrow. I'm not big friends with him because, to be friends, you need to be close and time to develop that relation, but we have a lot of respect for each other.""
Asked whether a manager would have been permitted to go eight years without claiming a trophy at another club of Arsenal's stature, Mourinho added: ""Maybe Arsène was also loyal to the club in many periods where he could leave to go to other teams, and for sure he had these moments in his career. And he always decided to stay. When a manager is loyal to his club, there is a natural reason for the club to be loyal with him. They deserve each other.""",0,1387753284,null,0,false,0,ce812kl,t3_1thja6,t1_ce812kl,t3_1thja6,null,1428024274,17,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,17

While on paper our accomplishments over the last few years are amazing, I really think that last time I felt like we were a top top team was probably 2010 with Ancelotti's double winning team. Since then I've felt like we were a much scrappier team that has to grind out results, as opposed to being a team that just destroys everything in it's path. 

I think winning the Champion's League has blinded some people as to how mediocre (compared to the other teams we often get compared to) we've been since '10. While we deserve every trophy we've won since then (and don't let anyone ever tell you differently), you have to admit, there is a big difference between the way we won the Champion's League and the way it was won by Bayern and Barca in recent years. This may sound odd, but I think the team we fielded against United in the '08 was the better of the two teams that have gone into the finals even if you were to ignore all the suspensions from '12.

You are right, we've been a very successful team in the last few years and I am extremely grateful for that, so let me rephrase what I originally said.

Also, this isn't /r/relationships, but have a chat with him and explain it's getting you down, and why. It'll be tough, but it'll get a weight off your chest and he'll be supportive and helpful.

Lastly, this sub will be really helpful with practical advice, but in honesty, there's more to life than physical stuff. Your relationships and people close to you are worth much more than physical tokens. :)

I thought Mignolet would do that with Reina before we loaned him out, we need a LB to do that for Enrique for example. I reckon when he's back, Flanno could be challenging Johnson for his place at RB (considering how well he's been playing out of position and how mediocre Johnson has been). Suso will come back and challenge Coutinho. Suarez won't be challenged by anyone, let's be honest. And our centre backs have plenty of competition.

A player to come in and challenge Lucas is probably better, really. Because it will push Lucas to try and keep his place in the team.

*  No.  They have demanded that their job role changes to suit themselves, and M&amp;S have rolled over.  This is unacceptable and sets a dangerous precedent.

true,miniguy,eu,European Union,"The european union based that statement on the fuel requirement of the current (and quite old) reactor designs that are used throughout the world; you see, most reactors run on a mixture of uranium 238 and uranium 235. Uranium 235 is not horrendously common and makes up about 0,7 percent of natural uranium. Normal commercial reactor designs use somewhere between 5 to 15% uranium 235 in their fuel mixtures with the rest being 238, which means that you will have to go through a whole lot of natural uranium to increase the percentage of 235 to usable levels. 

The problem therein is the fact that used nuclear fuel is mostly unused, unfissioned uranium 238; for the most part, uranium 235 is the only part of the original fuel that actually undergoes fission. but it is not like we can process out the unused 238 from the used fuel; that would be prohibitively expensive, not to mention dangerous with the existance of the quite radioactive fission products that resulted from the fissioning of uranium 235. 

So where do we go from here? an efficient solution to the problem would be to simply put the used fuel in a fast breeder reactor, which are capable of burning uranium 238 by converting it into plutonium 239, which is hella fissile, resulting in a much higher fuel utilization. alternatively you could slowly phase out existing reactors with generation IV thorium reactors. a thermal-spectrum thorium reactor would not have any bigger problems with reaching a 100 percent fuel utilization in comparison with current reactors 5-15 fuel utilization(not counting the potential fuel lost in the refining process). adding this with the fact that thorium is about as abundant as lead; it would be a pretty good deal.",0,1387758996,null,0,false,0,ce83je8,t3_1tgajd,t1_ce83je8,t1_ce7vrgj,null,1428022994,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Then there is the fact that a 'CNR' majority will take at least a decade to translate into a majority in the electorate.

There are other factors, of course. 

The polls showing that around half of nationalists are happy to stay in the union don't convince me. There's a kind of shame and reluctance to talk about anything associated with the Troubles (including Sinn Fein and reunification) from the more moderate Catholics, but that doesn't stop them actually going out and voting for SF. 

On top of that, I'd say the majority of people are unaware of the demographic changes taking place. So for many, a UI is an idea that simply isn't plausible, not with a unionist majority. When the scales eventually tip, suddenly the implausible becomes a possibility.

All of that said, common sense tells us there will be Catholics who won't support the idea, but it'll only be a very small fraction of that group that'll actually go out and vote, most will abstain.

I think there'll be more 'undecideds' from the 'Protestant' camp than most people expect too, mostly from Alliance's voter base. The quality and strength of the two campaigns will decide what way those people vote. 

Just my opinion, but I think the 'reunification' side will easily win there. 'We need to stay with Britain so we can keep getting subsidies' just doesn't really cut it against the chance to develop a real economy in NI to bring us up to par with the south (which would happen by necessity, us being 29% of the population of Ireland, rather than an easily ignorable 2.8% of the UK).

Then there are the external factors, most importantly the issue of Scottish independence. It might not happen next year, but now that it's a mainstream view, it won't be going away. If I were to bet, I'd say it's a sure thing within the next 20 years. Once that happens, there are two possibilities that could push NI to reunification: either Wales decides to go for independence too or England itself chooses to tear down the union and rid itself of its two leeches.

So, to sum it up, I don't think 2030 is likely. By 2040 is more likely, but not highly, but by 2050 I think there's a very strong chance (2049, maybe? 100th anniversary of the Republic of Ireland Act). My reasons being that: the Catholic population will overtake the Protestant one in a few years, but I don't think it'll be an outright majority for another 10-15, add another decade for the electorate to become majority Catholic/Nationalist. That's around 2040, and you'd need a few more years to offset those who would abstain or vote against it.

It seems like a long way off unfortunately, but it's within my lifetime at least.",0,1387759435,null,0,false,0,ce83qbn,t3_1thgzl,t1_ce83qbn,t3_1thgzl,null,1428022839,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2
true,LFCfanatic999,lfc99,,"More importantly, the Premiership has now banned leveraged buyouts as a method of buying football clubs and I believe other leagues have followed suit. Basically, its just buying the club with the club's assets as collateral so you don't have to put any up. Also in doing so, you incur massive interest so that basically you're club starts out 15-20M pounds in debt even before the season starts. So if it goes tits up, you walk away clean while the collateral (club) goes to shit and disappears with creditors and lawyers sawing up what's left. The Cowboys were in some deep shit where they even signed on PIK loans which is basically the last roll of the dice since they accrued massive, massive short term interest (25%-35%) designed to be paid off quickly for a quick profit by the lender.

I think Liverpool were the last club bought by a leveraged buyout, but not the first.

His ball retention and availability completely make him as a player and yes he doesn't do much else but he doesn't need to. Those attributes plus his energy have brought balance to the midfield and allowed the superb, fluid football we're seeing at the moment.

I'm not saying he's the sole reason, but he is a big part of us being on this current run of form. He came in against Norwich after that horrid game at Hull and since then we've scored 17 and conceded 3.

Allen's like Modric but without the experience and cutting edge (for now), he keeps the ball ticking over and he has to or the team/move stagnates. He's often the player that makes the incisive pass from in front of our back four to in front of the oppositions. The pass before the assist type deal, but that's hard to see when we're playing sides we're on top of for long periods. Even though he'll likely give the ball away a few times you'll see the benefit vs Chelsea and City because they'll be harder to break down than our recent opponents.

He is free to carry his control to humiliating extremes, regulating, if he feels like it, the clothes you wear or how often you go to the bathroom. With a few exceptions he can fire you for any reason, or no reason. He has you spied on by snitches and supervisors, he amasses a dossier on every employee. Talking back is called ""insubordination,"" just as if a worker is a naughty child, and it not only gets you fired, it disqualifies you for unemployment compensation.

Today, nuclear is better than all of the alternatives. It doesn't need to be perfect to be the best option, because none of the others is perfect either. A PWR still produces relatively tiny amounts of waste compared to every other power source. It requires a small fraction of the steel and concrete needed for wind turbines, a tiny fraction of the land. Modern PWRs are more reliable than any other power source (except perhaps hydro where there are very large reservoirs, which we don't have). It doesn't involve industrialising huge swathes of our most beautiful countryside either, which I know some people are OK with but lots of people aren't. Offshore wind is still ridiculously expensive, and even the most optimistic goals put forward by the offshore wind industry are to achieve costs of around £100/MWh, still more than even the first new EPRs. All evidence from countries that have built nuclear reactors before suggests that if more are built they'll be less expensive than the first ones - if only because of the construction experience gained. Every argument that can be made for the economics of wind power improving can be made for nuclear, and more because we're not running out of good sites like we are for wind.

true,o0Johnny0o,,Belfast,"I don't think there's a lot of balance here.  It's using a neutral palette to deliver very biased, misleading arguments.  Plus, the representation of Unionists (cut to rioting) and Nationalists (cut to Civil Rights Protesters face Loyalist violence) should tip you off.  Also the terms ""these are the facts"" and ""you can't argue with this"" are banded about very liberally which shows a distinct lack of open mindedness.  

These, along with the fact that they used one of those dead behind the words text readers make me think it's just a young teenager that doesn't understand that it's an incredibly complex issue.

The arguments here seem to be based around fundamentally flawed ideas:

1) Protestants are dying off whilst there is a predicted boom in Catholic births.

2) Those that deviate from the Protestant = Unionist / Catholic = Nationalist model are so insignificant they're negligible

3) Catholics will hold a higher percentage of the educated classes.

4) Demise of DUP and rise of Sinn Feinn.

5) Unpopular figures in loyalism will alienate unionist voters.

6) The UK doesn't even want N. Ireland.

7) A united Ireland is a peaceful Ireland.

----------------------------------------------------------

1) Both Catholicism and Protestantism are both dying off.  At the last census, there were *relatively* more Catholics than Protestants.  I would be interested to see if the impact of the various scandals in the Catholic Church down south have had such a profound impact in Northern Ireland.

2) See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/15eczg/how_the_queens_speech_is_advertised_in_ireland/c7lt3ud) I made a while ago. Basically:  Whilst Protestantism is dying off, Unionism is really rather healthy.

3) See 2.  Plus Northern Ireland still suffers from a brain drain, so is banking on 'educated votes' is a bit of a flawed concept?  Do more educated even prefer a united Ireland?  Is there a correlation between level of education and stance on the issue?  Honestly, I don't know.  But neither does this guy.

4) Unionist vote has always been split, hell it was far worse than it is today.  It doesn't really matter how many parties there are that are unionist, what matters is how many many house votes there are in Stormont that have declared either Unionist or Nationalist.  I sincerely doubt there are areas where it's so close between Sinn Feinn that a split Unionist vote would matter.  You also can't have ""more influence"" on the border poll, it's enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  In fact, in theory you could have Stormont with a majority of Nationalist parties but without the mandate from a border poll, couldn't move to unite Ireland.

5) No-one's going the argue that the rise of people like Willie Frazer are an embarrassment to Unionists.  But are you going to see Unionists start voting for a united Ireland over it?  I don't think so.

6) The entire next section is entirely conjecture pulled from the air.  Then cites Stephen Nolan interviewing someone as equally misinformed as himself.  [So here's a picture of something equally as valid and relevant](http://i.imgur.com/PnNqR9C.jpg).  Same as section 3; I don't know but neither does this person.

7) Goes on to suggest a united Ireland is going to be a utopia...

What I find really sad about this is that the world has much more pressing problems than trying to reunite a country (eg energy and food).

Not to mention that if the country was re-united based on the recent flag protests do you think these people are going to lie down and accept it? After all they are apparently uneducated ""thugs"".

If this were to occur within a generation of people then the wrong message has been sent. As it would appear that violence works .... So the only thing that I would see happening here if it were to be re-united would be another 30-50 years of troubles. With the sides reversed.

What is much more likely to occur is an independent state....

Something that the video did mention is that religon is a bad indicator. Which must be obvious since Ireland is the country that is apparently dropping religion faster than a hot potato at current.

Doesn't sound likely to me, more like a worst-case abuse scenario for the particular principle in question, a scenario that would very rarely come up and probably not be taken seriously. (There's a difference between 'I don't want to sell alcohol because of my religious views' and 'I refuse to serve black people because of my religious views', which is that one is a real thing some people think and the other is not.)  

I dunno. I just think that (within this thread) lots of r/unitedkingdom seems to live on a weird angryplanet where everyone is constantly stroking their beard/burka, coming up with schemes to be let off work or disadvantage shoppers, demanding, and being given, utterly heinous and outrageous liberties at work ... a force of evil unleashed, all because of this blindly idealistic and absurdly ridiculous religious acceptance idea. Bit of a Joseph Conrad atmosphere. 

Some Muslims, probably a very few, in one chain of shops, are exempted from selling pork 'n' alcohol. To be clear, a minority of a minority of a minority (Muslims/who are M&amp;S staff/who beyond not wanting to consume, don't want to sell the products). There seems to have been some poor handling of this where customers have to queue up again – perhaps, although no-one's brought any hard evidence of that happening. 

Within seconds, the thread fills up with people saying Islam 'can only really be called Fascism' and most of the top level comments are spitting feathers about the absurd ridiculousness of it, or arguing that *you do what you're bloody well told and if you don't like it you can fuck off* (I always imagine some kind of national-service era brigadier saying this when I see the sentiment appear online). 

Then add some 'Their objections are meaningless!' atheism in there and voila, a not very helpful response with little attempt to think about *why* these people might not want to serve alcohol (hint: Britain has a massive drink/violence/teen pregnancy problem which we ignore when we want to tell Muslims off for not drinking) and why these people might have ended up working in jobs they have some degree of problem with (hint: we're in a recession) in the first place.

Those same people are likely to not trust the people criticising UKIP or BNP because they'll be told those people are just shills for the big parties. 

It's much of the same effect that sent large parts of the left-wing flying into the arms of various dictators starting with the Bolsheviks: Then large parts of the left were so used to the establishment flat out lying to them that when the mainstream press for a change told the truth about the Bolsheviks, it was easy for their supporters to insist that it was all lies.

In other words: Don't cry wolf.

It doesn't help that political correctness have made it near impossible to have a reasonable debate about immigration where you start by accepting that a lot of people are scared and address their concerns without first calling them racists and pissing them off.

I'm an immigrant. My ex, my sons mother is a British citizen, but an immigrant, and she's black. Our sympathies certainly are nowhere near UKIP or BNP, but at the same time it is understandable to me why a lot of working class and even some middle class people in the UK are scared about immigration. It is not immigration per se that scares them, but change, and unemployment. Many of them have parents that were fucked over badly under Thatcher, and unemployment is a real an big fear ingrained in whole families.

We have neighbours that sympathise with BNP, sort of, maybe, when the wind blows the right direction. But it's always ""but not *you*"". They have immigrant friends. They have black and asian friends. These friends, and their neighbours, are all *different* somehow: The problem is not race, nor really immigration, but ""those others"" who they only know from the Daily Mail, who steal their jobs and rape their women and scrounge off their benefits. They can't really verbalize who those ""others"" are. 

But that gambit only works for the BNP and UKIP because Labour and the Lib Dems and the Tories are absolutely terrified about actually dealing with the fears of these people in a way that gets regular people to trust them and/or that won't insult them.

Then there's the ambiguity about the phrase 'people of the book', where sometimes Jews and Christians are meant to be just as good as Muslims but sometimes not, and we can do a little dance about that too. 

Then we can do yet another little dance about how in practise plenty of Muslims are friends with plenty of non-Muslims and so don't seem to be 'forbidden' in any practical sense, which is what you implied, even if these verses are in the Koran and even if they *do* apply to all unbelievers ever. Round and round we can go, you won't like Islam any more at the end of it and I won't join in the anti-Islam campaign by the end of it.

then they're not just an unbeliever, and that isn't the one bone of contention; it never is, in fact, when members of a religion say they don't like unbelievers. 

It would all be much simpler if it was, but unfortunately there's a kernel of ethical value (correctly or not, the believers genuinely reckon the unbelievers are up to no good) which separates the religious dislike of unbelievers (where it exists) from mere ingroup/outgroup slander.

It's this concept of race which divides all races, not just Whites and Non-Whites.

Crap video. UI because demographics and because loyalists are dumb? Meh.

I'm a bit fed up of the demographics as the argument in and of itself. It will be there in the background, but it's more an enabler (less people dismissing a UI out of hand) than a force for unity in itself. 

There is almost an element on inevitability where a UI is concerned, but the demographic bit isn't it. We're in a UK that serves London and SE england first and foremost. They will, at some point, start making decisions that are very, very bad for us even if they are 'good' for all the voters around London. Leaving the EU? Forcing cuts on us that undermine the large public sector here? Can't get our corporation tax cut so that we can compete properly with the RoI for investment? Housing policies that make zero sense when applied to NI?

Some of those are happening or starting to happen now.  

People will ultimately vote in their own self interests, nationalism be damned. At some point our interests and the interests of London will not be aligned, and if a border poll just so happens to occur during one of those periods? Just has to happen once and thats it.

Of course, 2030 is a while off, and anything could happen. Noone saw the disaster that was the last decade coming (apparently).

The 08-09 season seemed as if it might help cover-up some of the mess and make things at least appear rosy again with a PL title on the horizon but that didn't quite pan out either as we all know.  However...

We wouldn't be in the positive situation we are now with stable ownership, great manager, top of the table, and LFC seemingly getting back to it's core values and winning ways had they not gone through that bit of turmoil.  Could it have possibly been done sooner under different management?  Absolutely yes, but that still doesn't detract from what we're thankfully starting to build now.  I coincidentally went through a rough patch during that time as well and have been a firm believer that without a bit of adversary, struggle, and consequent strength you'll never realize prosperous times or have the same appreciation for them when they do come around again.  

Without going into too much detail it took countless unforeseen circumstances for me to get where I am today personally.  I'm a drop in the bucket compared to a massive club like Liverpool but if they hadn't gone through the same type of situation we might not be in the position we are now.

On top of that, it will make #19 that much sweeter when it rolls around which thankfully now seems to be coming much sooner than later!

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"If your referring to Abu Qatada then just FYI he had not broken any UK law. He has never been successfully charged of anything in the UK. He was tried in Jordan in asbsentia for terrorism charges based on evidence obtained by torture. As his wikipedia article summarises:

&gt;""In 2008 the UK Court of Appeal concluded ""that his 1999 conviction for terrorism was based on evidence extracted through torture"". At Abu Qatada's 2012 SIAC hearing, Mr Justice Mitting observed that the evidence presented by Jordan against Abu Qatada ""seems extremely thin"". 

There's no doubt he believes some despicable things. No-one disagrees that he had to be stopped, that people like him must be prevented from spreading their insane ideas before an unstable, naive Muslim takes them seriously. But the question of how to kill an intellectual contagion like Islamic religious extremism has to be achieved without destroying our own traditions of freedom and fair trials free from executive influence. There wouldn't be any point in fighting those that aim to destroy us if we dismantle what we are defending in the process. It reminds me of [the film Mouse Hunt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcNMWo7e4Fc) where the protagonists destroy a priceless mansion by going to extreme and impatient lengths to catch a tiny nuisance. We can laugh at them but it's basically what the Labour party did for 9 years after 9/11 and what the Conservative party want to continue to do. Again, I'm not saying we shouldn't fight extremism and fanaticism wherever we find it but we have to do it through the institutions that have worked for centuries to do just that.

French is definitely available, and so is Spanish. I was thinking to apply for a teaching assistance position in the UK inbetween my degrees, which would enable me to work in a British school for 6-10 months. Most likely I would assist German classes. With Spanish as a third major, I could go back to the UK after another 2 years. By then, about 4 years should have passed and maybe the job situation for German teacher will have improved.

Re: Gerrard, I'd say he should be subbed out at halftime or very soon after for Allen. But although he's not what he once was, I still think we're better off having him in the team, if for no other reason than that he makes any and all set pieces we get way more dangerous.

Re: Enrique, I could see him and Flanno switching based on whose form is better at the moment. But as great as Flanno has been recently, and as baffling as Enrique can be sometimes, I still think he's the better player right now and he offers more going forward (Flanno's amazing goal aside...)

Re: Sakho, I'd say a similar thing with him and Agger; play whoever's in better form at the time. But that certainly seems to be Sakho at the moment.

I think that community outreach work that some mosques have been doing lately could make a difference on these issues.

true,TheCheshireCody,adipose,Adipose,"Honestly, that season just plain sucks. It's full of false drama, terrible illogical decisions and the writers just pulling this out of their asses. The last season was not much better, to be honest.

The show, from the very beginning fifty years ago, has been about imagination much more than about logical consistency. The problem is, with the 'reboot' there was a new emphasis on continuity and story arcs, until the writers and producers decide that something they've previously written didn't mesh with what they want. There's a giant spider in the middle of the planet, around which the planet was formed? Gee, you'd think the Silurians would have noticed that at some point. Or maybe one of those two races would have noticed the tunnel through the planet that we saw in Torchwood.

You could look at it as a challenge by the writers to outdo themselves. You wouldn't have thought they could do worse than 'Fear Her', until the one with the giant space whale. And then they beat that one with the giant Steampunk wooden robot (I think it was the climax of 'The Next Doctor') , then the mutant Daleks, then 'Let's Kill Hitler'. No matter how bad an episode is, they always manage to make a worse one, which is an impressive feat in its own right.
