I seem to have a lot of faith that FSG will return us to our former glories, maybe it is unfounded, over confidence, but I believe it.  Football goes in cycles, United won't always be at the top (no matter their spending power, if Ferguson stepped down in the morning, their rebuilding program would need to be extensive.  He has that squad punching above their weight and has done so for his time there), City will be up there for as long as money is pumped in but that is in no way a certainty and they don't have a great world fan base with excellent merchandising potential, Chelsea's money from Abramovich is actually a loan from him and if he ever decides to recall it there is no way they have the infrastructure to repay that, Arsenal are very well ran and will be up there for quite a while.  I've been a patient Liverpool supporter since I was knee high, it's been a painful few decades with more downs than ups, but I believe if we can be patient our time will come and it will be all the sweeter when we do lift the league trophy again, and I want it won the Liverpool way.

He isn't, but I'd argue he's scrutinized far more than the others you've mentioned, which is really part of the point.

&gt; What the Suarez incident does to the image of Football through the video, pictures etc being circulated is certainly perfectly allowed to have an effect on their judgement.

Letting the media have any degree of influence on the punishment sets a dangerous precedent for me. The severity of an incident doesn't always scale with the media reaction, so there's bound to be unfairness if the FA allows that to affect their judgments.

TL;DR I would guess those against same sex marriage see marriage as something that developed out of their religion/way of life, and are trying to protect the version of that way of life that they are familiar with.

I don't happen to agree with them (I don't disagree strongly enough to object either) but I can see their side of the argument. There's a lot of shit to put up with in the world, religion is just one of those things people use to control the type of world they experience.

In Richard Weikart's 2004 book From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics and Racism in Germany he claims:

    Darwin clearly believed that the struggle for existence among humans would result in racial extermination. In Descent of Man he asserted, ""At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races.""
 He was merely noting what appeared to him to be factual, based in no small part on the evidence of a European binge of imperialism and colonial conquest during his lifetime.""[17] Darwin's passage, in full context, reads:

    The great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies, which cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species, has often been advanced as a grave objection to the belief that man is descended from some lower form; but this objection will not appear of much weight to those who, from general reasons, believe in the general principle of evolution. Breaks often occur in all parts of the series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees; as between the orang and its nearest allies—between the Tarsius and the other Lemuridae between the elephant, and in a more striking manner between the Ornithorhynchus or Echidna, and all other mammals. But these breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have become extinct. At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.[8]

I am saying that someone who hates people from India because they are from India are not racist.  They are something, something sad and pathetic, but not racist.

If someone calls you a ""fucking Paki"" *because* they are racist, then it's racist.  It's the intent in the epithet, not the epithet itself. For example, in the South of the US, calling a black man ""boy"" is very, *very* racist.  There's nothing what-so-ever racist about the term ""boy"".  It's the *use* - the intent - that determines whether or not someone is a bigot and what sort of bigot they are.

So, to address your example directly, if someone calls you a ""fucking Paki"" in the mistaken belief that you are Pakistani and they are resentful of Pakistan and its people over something to do with the war in Afghanistan ... that's not necessarily racist.  It's stupid, it's unfair, and it bullshit, but it's not necessarily racist.  

(As an aside, I'm an American ex-pat and when I first got here I heard people refer to other people as ""Pakis"" and, stupid me, I thought it was just shorthand for Pakistani, literally, and had no idea it was an epithet.  Sort of like calling someone a Brit.

The only line that comes close is paragraph 80-83 about the Ashley Barnes case. They decide, somewhat arbitrarily that this is a more sever case, which in turn requires a more severe ban than the 6 matches handed to Barnes.

By a photographer named Yousaf Karsh, apparently Churchill was in a rush and Karsh took away his cigar to get that look from him.

""When he finally got Churchill seated in the chair, with lights blazing, Churchill snapped “You have two minutes. And that’s it, two minutes.” The truth was that Churchill was angry that he had not been told he was to be photographed; he lit a fresh cigar and puffed mischievously.

Karsh asked Churchill to remove the cigar in his mouth, but Churchill refused. Karsh walked up to Churchill supposedly to get a light level and casually pulled the signature cigar from the lips of Churchill and walked back toward his camera. As he walked he clicked his camera remote, capturing the ‘determined’ look on Churchill’s face, which was in fact a reflection of his indignantcy. Karsh recounted: “I stepped toward him and without premeditation, but ever so respectfully, I said, ‘Forgive me, Sir’ and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant I took the photograph. The silence was deafening. Then Mr Churchill, smiling benignly, said, ‘You may take another one.’ He walked toward me, shook my hand and said, ‘You can even make a roaring lion stand still to be photographed.’”

I guess, in theory, the BoE could just roll out a new note without any higher review at all but I highly doubt that has ever occurred yet.    

Keep in mind many government functions in this country are run on the basis of tradition and gentlemen's agreements. Just because there is no act which says government has to sign off on new issue notes doesn't mean that unofficially it doesn't happen.

true,satanspanties,,President of the Official Stellar Tortoise FC Fan Club,"1. *Discworld* series. Always the Discworld. Just awesome in every way. Anything else Pratchett has ever written too.

2. *Alice in Wonderland*/*Through the Looking Glass*. Two of the first books I read over and over.

3. *The Complete Winnie-the-Pooh*. For nostalgia, more than anything.

4. Roald Dahl's *Tales of the Unexpected* and others of his short stories. Some of the best short stories ever. Think how messed up his kids' stories are. Now write them for adults.

5. Jasper Fforde's *Thursday Next* series. PogoTwig has given a bit of a summary elsewhere in this thread.

6. *Ark Baby* by Liz Jensen. Also *War Crimes for the Home* and *The Ninth Life of Louis Drax*. Actually kind of messed up too, but excellent story ideas and plot development.

7. The *Harry Potter* series. Millions of people can't be wrong!

8. *A Short History of Nearly Everything* by Bill Bryson. Non fiction. It oversimplifies a lot of concepts, but I'm yet to find a better book for inspiring wonder about the planet and the universe we live in.

9. *The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy*. First book only. I feel the series goes increasingly downhill, but it does start so high.

10. *Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal* by Christopher Moore. Wonderfully hilarious, although perhaps not for the devoted Christian.

Nowadays, like you say, so many books cross over genres, it's getting difficult to know where one genre ends and another begins. One book can contain elements of sci-fi, fantasy, romance and mystery, and not not seem the least bit contrived, in fact, be all the richer for it.

I'm quite a Sci fi and fantasy fan, other recommendations are Hyperion, the lies of Locke lamora and the book of the new sun. A little different but also good is flowers for Algernon, buy my advice is to avoid forewords as my copy has one that spoilt the ending and I read it before the book like a mug.

I think I've read all the discworld books, love them, particularly Vimes and the Wizzard that is Rincewind. I also have an unhealthy fascination with Bernard Cornwell's books, be they Sharpe, Arthur or Starbuck.

LoTR I enjoyed reading, the hobbit not so much, one of the few books I never finished. I tried it in year four and couldn't get in to it, but I read LoTR a year later and loved it. I don't know why that would be though and I should retry it I think.

GoT the show is good, and I assure you I watch it entirely above board... But, whilst I enjoy it, for people who haven't read to books it can be very confusing and hard to keep track, at least according to my friends. I find though, it is like the series and many other good books, it needs reading three times.

You certainly need to define the purpose of government if you wish to do this.

I don't think the economy is one of the government's most primary roles, for example. I think the economy is something that happens when citizens trade and do business, and that it's the government's job to meddle in that as little as possible (although I recognise that meddling in the economy is necessary, in a modern state).  

I consider citizens' welfare to be a more primary role of government. 

If it's possible to judge political parties or policies objectively then I'm pretty sure you need to lay down some ground rules first - the *objectives* you're trying to achieve.

true,ThePhlogist,,Barkeep! Something local and barely drinkable on the double.,"I normally have enough reading of uni related stuff to basically preclude me reading any fiction or other books. However during term time I had to write an essay on the book 'Eichmann in Jerusalem' by Hannah Arendt. Despite being a title on philosophy it not too heavy going. It is a compilation of court reports Arendt did for the New Yorker magazine about the trial of Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi who orchestrated the holocaust. She splices parts of the trial and insights into Eichmann's character with stories from his past and his career. It becomes a history book for those interested in that but a well written one with an analytical bent as she draws conclusions on the nature of Eichmann's evilness. It's only about 250 pages so it's not too long and if your interested in history it's very interesting. 

Fiction wise I have the whole saga of Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy ready to be ploughed through over the summer. I have never actually gotten round to reading the books despite the various forms of media I've consumed the story in. Also Christopher Hitchens' autobiography if I get round to it.

The inquest, as important as it is, is defined as a fact finding exercise. Those aren't my words, those are said by the coroners themselves up and down the land daily.  There are no criminal consequences directly from an inquest.

If an officer is potentially in the shit at an upcoming criminal trial; they would be foolish to throw away their defence and consequently their script, prior to criminal proceedings.   Everyone in this country, police officer or not, has the right to a fair trial. The concern here is that they may not be afforded this right should they give evidence.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; The accounting is highly dubious (8.7p for an egg, but only if you buy a carton of 30?

You don't have a fridge ? Eggs can be kept anywhere up to 6 months. Not that it's necessary, a family of 4 will go through 30 eggs in a week.

The article is trying to point out the wastefulness of ""ready-meals"" and takeouts, when with a bit of common sense and basic ingredients bought in bulk, you *can* live frugally. There's a whole damn subreddit dedicated to the topic.

&gt; Why stop at a pound, BBC? Supermarket own-brand vegetable soup can be had for 15p per tin. Own-brand bread can be had for 40p per loaf. Why not specify a bowl of soup and slice of bread for 10p per portion?

Why not ? If you are short of money, is that not a sensible solution ? No, far easier to waste your time (and money) on internet connections and fancy cellphones, so you can moan about the government ""starving"" you out.

&gt; Why not just tell the poor to pick fruit from hedgerows

We used to go blackberry picking every summer when we were kids, and my mother made jams that would last for 6 months. I don't see a problem with that either.

Seems like no one wants to lift a damn finger to help themselves these days, and expects it all handed to them on a silver platter. Talk about entitlement culture.

true,thefamilyatomics,lfc99,,"This is never going to happen with Carra retiring at the end of the season, and in a way I agree that it shouldn't. But I'd like to see Wisdom (and Kelly this summer when he's fit) play beside Agger at CB. To me he has everything we're looking for besides experience. He's shown that he has almost the speed and ball playing ability you need to play RB in the premier league, but not quite the attacking ability you'd want there. But you don't need that last bit for CB (leave the box-to-box CB stuff for our great Dane). He is huge, strong and has a massive leap in him (check his debut goal). We could play our high line with confidence that both our CBs are available for passes and can recover quickly in transitions and balls over top. And, you know, maybe defend a corner or two.

In him and Kelly, I'd say we have two potential world-beating CBs. And you only get experience by playing. If that means a loan next season, so be it. But I think in these last 4 meaningless games, Wisdom should get his shot.  

Of course, I understand the desire to buy our next cb (as long as it's not a certain Welshman, although a left-footed backup for Agger would be nice). I just think we could use the money we save here to purchase some FB cover (maybe steal Insua back from Portugal?), a backup CDM who's more of a bruiser/box-to-box type (Sissoko would have been perfect and so cheap apparently), a better RW (from the infuriating depths of last season/pre-Jan this season, Downing has improved tremendously, but we need better than him in the starting XI), as well as steal Ajax's CAM away from BVB.

tl;dr: Wisdom should start tomorrow instead of Carra to see if we can spend some of the summer money elsewhere.

On the other hand, I could see it as the same situation as when he absorbs radiation and has to regenerate. In those situations, something inside of him is starting to destroy his body so he begins to regenerate to cope with it and prevent death. The zombie virus would work the same way. It begins to cease bodily functions and cause death to the whole system so that the virus and jump start the brain and control it itself essentially.

Firstly, you are perfectly able to display a P&amp;D ticket or permit on your bike, the same way you would display your tax disc. No one will go looking around where you keep the disc except the person going to give you a PCN because they need your RFL serial number as evidence. Think that's unfair? Welcome to life buddy.

Secondly, outside London you almost never find councils that require you to buy a ticket but busier council or private run car parks will require payment or don't allow bikes at all so always check the time plate, if you live in a decent city they will have RINGO which let's you pay by mobile so the 'I can't display a ticket so ill never buy one' argument won't work.

On street you're going to get a PCN if you park like an idiot, if you don't park wholly in a bay you'll get done for being incorrectly parked within the bay markings, if you park on the pavement you'll get done by a CEO for being adjacent lines or a police officer for obstruction. When parking is free all around don't park on the bloody pavement, just make everyone else look bad.

true,Deserak,null,null,"I both agree and disagree... On one hand, I love the idea of perfectly ordinary people stepping up and becoming something more, and with Clara already being some great mystery there's less room for that to occur (As some others have pointed out, there is still room for development with her, but it's not as obvious, particularly since we've already seen episodes of her fully developed in various ways).

At the same time... You can't rinse and repeat the same character arc over and over without it getting dull. Each character needs something unique, a special twist on their story. Rose was in love with the doctor, and he returned her feelings but for some reason couldn't admit it or act on them. Martha had a thing for him, but he was still caught up on Rose, so she wound up leaving because she knew it wasn't going to happen. Donna had a completely nutreal relationship emotionally, but was just amusing (Characters played by comedians always have a certain charm to them). Amy had met the doc as a little girl, so grew up waiting for him and was more than happy to run off with him &amp; her boyfriend when he showed up again - they where also living their own lives at the same time as traveling with the doc, which the others didn't.  Now Clara's twist is the fact that she shouldn't really exist, and the doctor wants to know what the hell is going on.

Also, in all fairness, the doctor only ever choses to travel with people he considers brilliant, important and extraordinary. It's what makes him look at them and go ""Yeah, I can hang with you,"" compared with all the people he runs into on his travels but DOESN'T offer to show all of time and space to. The main difference now is this; usually, the doc sees something in someone, they travel with him, and over those adventures they're able to show what the doc saw in them to begin with. By the time Clara came along, he was tired of losing people, so he wasn't looking anymore, until she pulled something that should be impossible and got the doc's interest. The main opportunity for character development is really how she reacts to the doctors emotional disinterest - he's already admitted to her that the only reason he's traveling with her is because she's ""The only puzzle worth solving.""

If all else fails, just focus on the fact that there's a lot more room for the doctor himself to have character development with Clara, where as every other series the focus has been almost entirely on the companions with the doc himself barely changing apart from new incarnations...",0,1367048077,null,0,false,0,c9nms6u,t3_1d75ne,t1_c9nms6u,t3_1d75ne,null,1431411566,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

Paranoia itself is surely natural, going way back to the dawn of humanity, however now we have numbers and abstract thought. We need not base our decision on what we feel to be true but rather what we have evidence for. If a distant ancestor believes that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator when it is just the wind (a type I error), he is more likely to survive than if he had believed that the rustle in the grass was just the wind when in fact it really was a dangerous predator (a type II error). Natural selection would often favored those animals most likely to assume that all patterns are real as the cost of making a type I error is less than the cost of making a type II error and because there is no time for careful deliberation.

You don't seem to be familiar with History at all. The targeting of civillians began in Germany long before the war started. Then throughout each nation invaded by the Germans civillians were liberally targeted once the military was broken. The blitz went on for a while before we had aircraft capable of really going to Germany to bomb anything and it escalated once the US came in with more long range bombers to help the RAF. Churchill escalated in 1944 simply to try and end the war sooner. No different that the first war which starved Germany out to end the war sooner.

Targeting civilians is immoral on that we agree but if you only target the military that isn't in populated areas you'll find yourself with very few targets since civilian industry was switch, like it was in the UK, to war production.

3. There was a protest from the church that resulted in a parades commission determination, the band may have felt like this was an attack on their culture (whether it was or not can be debated) and elected to rub it in.

The band in particular shouldn't be hired again by that lodge for a while, and normally when such events happen there is a compliance procedure that takes place, that goes to the county, then district and then lodge, however given that this was in Belfast how much was given to this is questionable, but given that the covenant parade passed without incident, it appears to have been dealt with.

A minor point on the pronunciation of 'accent'(others may disagree/I could be being a little over the top), but generally it's pronounced with the 'e' part being more of a 'u' sound, and the emphasis is usually at the start of the word, so it would be it would be 'AK-sunt' instead of 'axe-CENt' (the capitalisation being where the sound emphasis is being placed). I'm not an expert of language, and don' know the correct way to write sounds but I hope it's easy enough to understand.

Also when you say ""things like that"" (43ish secs), the end of the sentence slips away back into a more American accent before you start going back into your native accent, I'm not sure if that was done on purpose to show a transition back to your native accent or was actually a slip up (from speaking quickly?).

As I repeatedly said, these items are not mentioned again in the entire article. The article covers 5 days. It's not simply throwing away what's not used that day.

&gt;But of course what actually happens is people put it in the fridge, freezer or cupboard to eat another day.

Yes, they do. However, there are BBE dates to consider. Food does not keep indefinitely.

[Courgettes](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=259415602), 3 days.

[Peppers](http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/groceries/index.jsp?bmUID=1367054578889), 7 days.

[Ham](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=276308312), 8 days.

[Scones](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=258288079), 3 days.

[Eggs](http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=265388457), 11 days.

&gt;Also some people cook dinner for more than one person. 

Even cooking for more people will not remove the wastage. The 500g pack of spaghetti will serve 5 people. That leaves 4.75 wasted courgettes and peppers.

The only way to get £0.00 wastage is to not follow this article at all. If you have courgette on day one, you'll be having it on day 2 and 3 as well. If you buy a pack of 30 eggs, you'll be eating more than 1 egg a week.

And if the article actually demonstrates spending more than £1 a day on food and throwing food away, it does not demonstrate (as you claimed) how to feed yourself for £1 a day.

If I were a transport minister presented with this it'd be a 3 second rebuff on the grounds the author doesn't understand what he or she actually wants.

Not saying this to be a dick, it's just fundamentally flawed and cannot possibly succeed as a result.  Vehicle excise is NOT used to repair roads, so the weight and damage argument doesn't work.  It isn't technically called 'road tax' for that reason (government cop out of you ask me).

Now, if the author were to rewrite, citing the 100g/km threshold for free tax in cars, then specify bike emissions (I believe my R6 is 70ish, for example), this might hold some weight.  The downside of this is I need to take my bike three times to take 4 people (or would if it actually had pillion pegs etc), so again it's another easy rebuff unless you then involve single vehicle occupancy statistics.

The problem we have as bikers, is that bikes AREN'T particularly efficient.  My 2.5 v6 petrol car regularly does more mpg than my bike, for instance.  Yes I use it differently, but it shouldn't be physically possible for an engine four and a bit times the size, on a vehicle weighing almost ten times as much, with countless additional items to waste fuel such as air conditioning, to do better mpg with four times the people on board.

If cycling facilities (including, but not limited to the Cycle Super-highway idea) were improved everywhere from a central pot then in my mind a number of things would happen...

* Less tax paying cyclists would be killed (or injured enough to stop them working). More tax is paid as a whole, everybody wins.

* Cars would spend less time stuck behind the cyclists who can't go fast, this would decrease the length of time spent pumping excess bad stuff into the atmosphere from your exhaust, stop everyone (driver &amp; cyclist) becoming irritated AND reduce journey times, (ok, not by much, but according to Tesco, every little helps).
* Encourage more people to cycle. I can't cycle to work (too far &amp; not safe), but even if I could, I wouldn't, having been hit by a bus when I cycled to/from work in Edinburgh. I now only cycle for fun &amp; far away from the roads, I am not alone.
* [specifically aimed at easy access/cheap cycle rental schemes in big cities] this would help people who can't afford the initial outlay of a pushbike to get into cycling &amp; provided it is cheaper than public transport, allows more people to spend their money on things they actually want to buy (you know like food &amp; housing) therefore rescuing the economy!

However, I do believe that proper insurance should be available for people who commute by cycling - you have to on a motorcycle - partly to protect themselves &amp; their bike, but also to protect the pedestrians who are likely to walk out in front of them (it happens to cars too, and it's harder for us to stop! But I digress)... I think cycling insurance should be more widely available &amp; I would bring back the cycling proficiency tests (doesn't have to be compulsory, just more wideley available).

I'm not talking about accidental ""collateral damage"", I'm talking about the deliberate targeting of civilian areas **where there was no industry whatsoever**. That was Churchill's escalation. He enacted massive bombing campaigns of purely civilian targets to ""break"" the enemy. Knowing the wife and kids are living in hell is pretty bad for troop morale, and that's *if* they are still living. In Dresden for example they deliberately avoided industrial areas and went for the housing. There was no military gain whatsoever.

The landlord has to give **reasonable** notice (24 hours unless otherwise stated in your tenancy agreement) argue that he needed to access the property as an emergency or that you allowed him to enter. He can probably get you on the last two (I've never seen a landlord not being able to weasel their way out) and even if you think he didn't your first action is not ""bar him from the property"" as the comment above said. You need to verbally ask him to stop, written letter to stop etc. Even if the landlord is in the wrong (and he is) unfortunately you cannot just take someone to court/have them arrested.

You can argue harassment but to be taken seriously you'll need to prove that the landlord is being **unreasonable** which is why I said keep a diary and the escalation of the actions you have taken. Notice that in both circumstances there is no set period or criteria under which you can take your landlord to court, it is incredibly difficult to take landlords to court and for it to be worthwhile - if you lose you will also have housing related debt which bars you from council accommodation in some areas and probably be found intentionally homeless.

As an aside the police will not attend a reported trespass unless its something specific like squatting and this is covered in another act which I can't remember the name of. The police should attend if there is likely to be a breach of the peace i.e your landlord has locked you out and you cannot retrieve your belongings, otherwise trespass is usually dealt with under an injunction - again though, this is not a case of trespass.

A thinly veiled way of calling me a noob? Actually my school days are long behind me now and I've read countless history books off my own back but you know because I have a slightly different opinion I am a child who learned poorly.

You pointed out the reason that Dresden was bombed 
&gt; He enacted massive bombing campaigns of purely civilian targets to ""break"" the enemy. Knowing the wife and kids are living in hell is pretty bad for troop morale, and that's if they are still living.

Exactly pretty much the same reason V1 and V2 rockets were so effective, little warning. 

&gt;In Dresden for example they deliberately avoided industrial areas and went for the housing. There was no military gain whatsoever.

This is a fallacy there was large industrial out put in that city though much of the bombs fell in residential areas more so that those fire bombing was relatively new though not really an excuse.

I'm not for a second saying I agree with the decision to bomb the city and I don't agree with whitewashing the worst parts of him from history by any means but I still stand by my view even if he was just a symbol.

&gt;He was an anti-semite racist

Please, that was an extremely common view at the time and he was already an old man, should we also chastise him for his comments about women or the poor? He held the country together during the war something which Attlee simply couldn't have done. Either of our feelings about him 70 years on don't really matter to history or what happened at the time.

They shouldn't be. The police are who we trust to enforce justice, they have to be held more accountable for their actions than anyone. You say you would never drive drunk, well I would definitely never fire an electricity-based weapon at a man covered in flammable liquid.

You can't selectively enforce laws.

Ever done something stupid while intoxicated that you would never ever do in a million years sober? You're disabilitated by substance that changes and influences your actions. 

Being mentally ill... Its a little like that, because the connections or chemestry of the brain aren't working properly. Only you don't get to decide when it influences you or why it flares up. 

You literally are not responsible for your actions. There's REMORSE after doing something you know is irrational. That you were defeated by your illness in a time of vulnerability.

And the stigma of being mentally ill in this society... That we're all apparently monsters? No. Fuck that noise. We're normal human beings. We don't want to hurt anyone. 

In most cases of violence, the individual in question just wants to be left alone. They've told someone that something is going to happen. Often pleading to be admitted or held in a cell for 24 hours or something.

But its almost always brushed off. Or you're comitted long-term. You lose your autonomy, your self-respect, you're put on medications that destroy your sexual drive, motivation, energy levels and make you a stumbling overweight zombie that sleeps 16 hours a day. 

And you're not allowed to say no. That isn't your call to make.

And the purpose of the police? To protect and serve.

Police are TRAINED to deal with situations like this. Person does something irrational? They're probably mentally ill. Or intoxicated. They're probably very scared and in a very very dark place and need protecting from themselves. Either way, they're TRAINED to deal with that.

This guy suffered in hospital for five days with THIRD DEGREE BURNS because a man with a weapon let his adrenaline and his fear overcome his rationality and his training.

Whether he was mentally ill? We'll never know. But they are TRAINED to deal with situations like this rationally and sensibly.

Plus, how fucking scared do you have to be of another person with adrenaline pumping not to suss that petrol + spark = nasty flames?

You have to be FUCKING STUPID not to make that link. Or maybe you're under the influence of a substance. Or you're frightened yourself and therefor irrational.

Either the cop was too scared (in which case, they shouldn't be on the streets) or mentally ill or intoxicated or too stupid (in which case they shouldn't be police in the first place -- because the police - people in a position of RESPONSIBILITY are the LAST people you want not to be of a sound mind and judgement at all times).

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt; &gt; This is a fallacy there was large industrial out put in that city though much of the bombs fell in residential areas more so that those fire bombing was relatively new though not really an excuse.

No, it's not. They [deliberately targeted the civilian areas and avoided the industrial ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#Military_reasons). They didn't even target the rail or bridge networks. There's been much debate over this decision &amp; the bombing target plans are available in the public domain so if you doubt what I'm saying you could go and check for yourself. 

&gt; Exactly pretty much the same reason V1 and V2 rockets were so effective, little warning. 

The guidance systems for the rockets were so utterly rudimentary that they could not target specific infrastructure if they'd wanted. A 100% weapon of spite from a cornered animal. 

But that came long after. The point was that we were the first to choose to deliberately target the enemy civilians, [it was the British plan all along](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_bombing_directive).

Here is an official  British Air Staff paper from 1941 explaining their strategy:

&gt;&gt; The ultimate aim of an attack on a town area is to break the morale of the population which occupies it. To ensure this, we must achieve two things: first, we must make the town physically uninhabitable and, secondly, we must make the people conscious of constant personal danger. The immediate aim, is therefore, twofold, namely, to produce (i) destruction and (ii) fear of death.

One of the earliest ""successes"" of this approach was the [bombing of Colonge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Millennium#First_1.2C000_bomber_raid) in 1940, no military targets were outlined and the only ""legitimate"" damage was to a barracks. One of the principle aims of the attack were the propaganda value, both at home and for the enemy. Eventually this approach was shot down by the American's when they signed up a year or so later, they then [rewrote the plan to only be military and economic targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_directive). But before long they were back at targeting civilians again e.g. Dresden. 

What surprises me is that you are so surprised. :-)  If you look at British colonial history it's the same pattern. WW2 just brought aerial bombardment into the process, saves having to send an entire regiment half way around the world to burn their villages by hand! Old Winston knew all about that from his dealings with the Kurds post-WW1 in British Mesopotamia!

&gt;  that was an extremely common view at the time and he was already an old man, should we also chastise him for his comments about women or the poor?

To a degree, yes. The true ""great"" people in history are the visionaries who progress us away from such anachronisms. 

&gt; He held the country together during the war

Staff came in, asked which people it was, and then proceeded to do nothing but shine a torch at them quickly, then I was told that if they did it again theyd be kicked out.

Salsa Bar is in the same general area and is really cheap but can get VERY packed and is TINY.  

Frankensteins is good if you want to have a bite to eat along with your drinks at the start of the night, but Tron Bar is cheaper and they have cheap food too.  

I'd start off at Tron and head down Cowgate/Grassmarket way and see what clubs/bars tickle your fancy. ",0,1367063557,null,0,false,0,c9noj86,t3_1d7mm0,t1_c9noj86,t3_1d7mm0,null,1431410741,1,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,1

Most people don't think past the ""oh it'll save our heroes from dying"" aspect and instead people need to think about the politics and PR of drone usage.

Police officers have previously commented on these boards that their options for restraining, disarming or protecting themselves from an assailant using non-lethal force are actually fairly limited; you can kill with a blow from a riot baton, even if it’s not a blow to the head,  (i.e. Ian Tomlinson). A Taser is often the safest way of an officer restraining an aggressive individual, as long as the proper oversight is maintained in its application.

In this instance we don't know at this point why the police officer used his Taser, or if he was aware that the suspect was covered in petrol (even though that appears unlikely).

It seems likely that he will be charged with manslaughter, or if things are considered more serious, he might also be prosecuted under the health and safety at work act.

true,Crommy,null,null,"Our development squad is actually coming on pretty well, having come top of the U21 PL Group 1 (which runs August - December), finishing above Arsenal and West Brom, including beating Arsenal 4-1 and Everton 5-1, and currently sitting 4th in the U21 PL Elite Group (which runs January - May), below Tottenham, Man Utd and Liverpool.

The current crop of players does have some promising players, despite a  dry spot from the academy over the past couple of years. Here's my picks:

**Dan Potts** (LB, 19): son of Steve Potts, has already featured in the senior side 4 times last season, 6 times this season ( although he had that concussion in the last game against Arsenal), his positional play seemed good, and his play on the ball belied his 18 years of age (only had his birthday recently). Could do with strengthening up a bit, but seems a solid left back.

**Jordan Spence** (RB, 22): I've gone with Jordan next because he primarily plays as a right back, and in tandem with Dan, could occupy the full back slots for the next decade. Has captained the England youth teams at every level. Bristol City liked him enough in 2011 to loan him again for the 2011-12 season, before Avram Grant recalled him from loan as cover. Has stagnated a bit, but hasn't been provided with any real opportunities either on loan or in the first team since. Which is annoying, because he's now 22 and is ready to at least try to step up.

**Robert Hall** (Winger, 19): spent most of this season on loan to Birmingham before injury has hampered his season. 7 assists in 13 games for a team currently sitting in 10th is great evidence of a promising player. Also scored 5 in 10 in the Development squad.  Can also play as a striker, but definitely more suited to the wing.


I'd also say Raphael Spiegel, Sebastian Lletget, George Moncur (son of John) and Elliot Lee look promising, but I a) don't know enough about them; b) don't feel they've played at a high enough level yet to make a proper judgement.

1) There is a difference between force policy, and the law.  The law is immutable, and always right.  Force policy is guidance, that can be overwritten based on the individual case.  Police officers aren't expected to know how to swim, and so most forces don't tell officers to [save people who are drowning](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7006412.stm), but you'd still probably do it.  Similarly, you wouldn't use a taser if somebody had explosives strapped to them, but you might still do it if you thought that was the only option to stop them murdering a crowd full of innocent people, on the balance of probabilities.

2) We have no idea whether or not discharging the taser caused the burns, or the fuel to ignite.  We know he "" sustained serious burn injuries"" shortly after police arrived.  Odds are, if he covered himself in fuel, I'm assuming he also had a way to light it, like a lighter.  It's entirely possible he lit himself on fire, or the officer decided to taser him specifically to stop himself doing so - deciding he was more likely to survive a taser discharge than a lighter.  Maybe the officer wasn't told about the fuel by control, maybe his radio was out of signal during that message.

I'm not saying he's innocent or competent, but we have no idea what happened for the time being.

At the moment we have Johnson who is brilliant at breaking up play and keeping it simple, and Tettey who can burst forward with the ball, but neither have a good range of passing, like Fox.

Biglia can pass, he's strong in the tackle but can also act as a deep lying playmaker, helping us break teams down and maintain possession, something we're sorely lacking at the moment. We need someone capable of playing a killer ball from deep, Carrick at United is a very good example of this. Now someone who is as strong as an Ox in the tackle and can pass like Carrick is a £30m player, so we're not going to get someone perfect, but someone like Biglia is a class above what we currently have.

I don't think we should stop at 1 DM signing either. By playing a formation that requires 2, we really need 4 in the squad for competition/cover, and Howson is not a DM. So I'd like to see a cheaper player like Bridcutt from Brighton come in too (depending on whether they promote or not). Bridcutt when I've seen him is just a class act in the championship. He's more a Johnson than a Fox type DM, but his positioning is first class and he probably passes slightly better than Johnson.

With 4 DM's (Tettey, Johnson, Biglia, Bridcutt) we've got options to play Bridcutt and Johnson when we're just looking to stifle top 5 teams, or a Tettey-Biglia combination would work wonders against those in the lower reaches of the table. We'd be able to much better tailor the personnel in that position to suit the game, rather than the ""1 size fits all"" approach we currently have as there's no options beyond Tettey and Johnson in that position.

But more importantly, Xabi would be such a super sub when we need to kill a game. There are very few players in the world with more positional sense than him (we have another one in Lucas). His specialty is controlling a game with distribution. I can really only remember one game where we passed the ball for fun up a goal for the last 15 minutes of the game. Xabi can come off the bench to do this. 

And he can teach our young CMs a thing or eight. Although I'd like to see us get a young Toure/Sissoko/Masch type back up for Lucas, and if I had to choose between Xabi and a this hypothetical player, I would choose the latter. But also Xabi is very handsome.

The comparison is not a valid one, both in severity and intention. It is a canard beloved of Reddit, that no one is perfect and so any crime is fine, but it doesn't make any sense.

A man who commits repeated, intentional acts and faces no censure for this is not someone who should be pitied, who made a mistake or is just misunderstood. It is someone who has shown a repeated and callous disregard for others, matched with a repeated and callous urge to commit such acts. 

Such a person is a danger to society, to that wife and to those kids. Their victims deserve closure, and wider society needs the assurance that there are actually lines that it is forbidden to cross.

Really, I am struggling to think of a single conception of justice that doesn't demand some form of censure in this instance.

As per the DWP guidelines - it's actually rather difficult for a person to be denied hardship payments. In the instance of the examples you mentioned?

The person usually in receipt of JSA, but under sanction, would be able to apply for a hardship payment. The only possibly exception would be if they failed to attend a meeting with a decision maker to review the sanction - and even that is pretty extreme, and I might be remembering the guidelines incorrectly. 

The applicant would need to demonstrate how the removal of their JSA renders them vulnerable - which for anyone who doesn't live at home with parents is pretty easy¹. Provided they did this, they would receive a hardship payment.

At that point, they'd need to appeal the sanction. Provided they were successful? They'd get the JSA they lost during the period covering the start of the sanction, and it's removal **minus** the hardship payment, back.

As for ESA? I believe the above would also apply to someone who is on the Work-Related Activity Group, and then finds themselves sanctioned.

Having been sanctioned, assuming that the person isn't dealing with an absolute arse of a JCP, this should also trigger contact with a local food bank. From experience dealing with people who've been sanctioned in the past? The sanctioned person might need to remind them of this.

None. Welcome to the current (broken) state of our countries benefits system. People - particularly those who've never signed-on, consider the JCP to be a magical place, where people unfortunate enough to find themselves out of work can access wondrous resources, and will find themselves back in work in little to no time.

The JCP is the bureaucratic enforcement arm of the DWP. That's not to say for one second that there aren't good, kind people working in these organisations - clearly there are, but for the most part the JCP exists to ensure people in receipt of welfare are meeting their obligations - however arbitrary they are.

Why do you think the PCS (Trade Union) are so worried about the mandatory use of Universal Jobmatch - it's a tool to not only sanction thousands of people automatically, but it *significantly* reduces the need for physical job centres - and the staff who work in them.

Why do we need hundreds of JCP branches, employing thousands of members of staff, when unemployed people will be spending thirty odd hours a week using an ""employment resources"" such as UJ?",0,1367074351,null,0,false,0,c9nqf08,t3_1d7pys,t1_c9nqf08,t1_c9nqap7,null,1431409854,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Some generic tips are:

* Make sandwiches for uni. If it's easier for you, make a lot of them every few days and put them in the fridge. It's much easier to avoid eating out if you're not hungry. You can save about £3 a day this way.

* If you feel like you need to buy something that you don't need urgently, wait a month and see if you still think it's a good idea. 

* I may be the odd one out with this, but I generally plan my budget daily. As in I know I have £300 per month after rent and bills, so that's £10 a day. If I go over that amount, be it for shopping or going out, I need to have a few days where I only spend £5. It may not be for everyone but it's worked well for me.

* It's pretty easy to say ""don't go out much"", but that can be a challenge if you're a social person. If you can convince your friends to have nights at each other's houses/dorms rather than out at clubs and pubs every weekend it makes a huge difference on everyone's spending (£5 a drink compared to £1 a drink).

* This depends on where you're living, but get a bike. In London, a zone 1-2 travelcard for a student is £80 a month. By cycling whenever I can I spend about £10 a month on travel and get free exercise.

You want to avoid buying snacks, lunch, and drinks when you're at university because a chocolate bar and bottle of coke from a vending machine is not a good deal. That amount could buy your dinner, and most of a pint in a pub.

Learn which products are regularly on offer, and take advantage of them. Excluding milk, my breakfasts were half price for months of a time thanks to a little bulk buying. Also try to buy treats like chocolate when they're on offer and ration them.

I dare say a lot of this is down to them applying for jobs they don't actually want or expect to get, so the effort isn't put in. And should they hire a suit for the day? What sort of appearance issues are we talking about?

If it's their first job how much should they know about ""basic work etiquette""? If it's some menial job with no prospects why should they want it other than the money? They can't say they want some experience to move on, that looks like you won't stay very long.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm thoroughly disappointed with that game. I have a hard time understanding why the team can't perform in a game like this. Wigan played well, but not good enough to warrant anything less than a beating from us. They weren't lucky, they weren't magnificent, but they weren't bad. We however, were. 

The whole season is on the line, and we throw a game against Wigan away. 1 point is not acceptable. 

There are a lot of the players that I'm irritated by, but mostly I'm disappointed with AVB on this one. He needs to make sure to set the team up right, so that they will go out and do their absolute best. Wether the opponent is Manchester City or Wigan Athletic. He failed to do that. 

Once again, he played Kyle Naughton on the left back, which I've never liked, because no matter how good a game he plays, he's not a left back, and he'll never be. BAE is just better on the left back, even though AVB apparently doesn't think he fits in well. And what makes the selection of Kyle Naughton even worse, is that we play the game with 2 right footed players on the left.

We've seen so many times that we aren't good enough to play this narrow of a game. Teams have it way too easy when trying to keep us out. The only thing that's kept us from being way out of contention for CL places when playing narrow has been Bale banging in goals from 30+ yards. 

I'm shocked that AVB doesn't seem to realize these things, that fans on this subreddit can point out every day for you. I know that he sees the players much more than us and knows them better, but much of our problem is very clear to people who have seen more than a few of our games.

true,cstross,null,null,"On drinking: the drinking age in Scotland is 18, not 21. (That's for buying beer/spirits in pubs or supermarkets -- younger folks can drink in restaurants or at home under parental supervision.) You may need to present ID (driving license, passport, or proof of drinking age) if you appear to be under 25. Scotland has a vibrant pub culture -- we use pubs as a social thing the way many Americans use churches. If you're old enough to drink in the US, you may notice that beer in Edinburgh is about half to two-thirds the price it is in New York, and virtually all pubs have cask-conditioned ale of a quality that's quite hard to find in the US. (Currently: £3.20 to £3.50 a pint for cask ale. Compared to $6-9 in New York, for a smaller pint.)

On driving: the driving age is 17, and don't even *think* about it in Edinburgh. The city predates the automobile by around 800 years, and parking hereabouts makes Manhattan look easy. Also, gas costs around US $10 per gallon. And if you're under 21, forget being able to afford vehicle insurance. However, Edinburgh is compact and mostly-walkable, we have excellent public transport in the shape of Lothian Buses (but don't ask about the trams!), and you probably won't need a car at all.

Weather: as noted, in midwinter we get only 7 hours of daylight. It seldom snows (although in 2010 we got socked in by unprecedented blizzards) but it frequently rains, and umbrellas won't help -- it's usually windy. Be prepared to layer up and have a good outer waterproof layer you can shed if the sun comes out. Temperatures in November-February typically vary in the range 0 to 5 celsius, possibly going sub-zero at night, but during an unusual cold snap it can go down to -10 to -15 at night.",0,1367080009,null,0,false,0,c9nrwli,t3_1d3j7b,t1_c9nrwli,t3_1d3j7b,null,1431409080,6,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,6

Games involving clubs fighting relegation (and Wigan in particular) often go either way. Equalising late on and the nearly moments at the end of the game show that we have character, a trait missing in recent league run-ins. 

This does not take away from the fact the performance pretty poor. On a brighter note Huddelstone played a significant role, Defoe looked sharp and Lennon made an appearance.

true,WobsJack,lfc68,,"Hi. Sorry to bring bad news but the tickets are sold out. Sorry about that. If it's at all possible with the dates, tickets for Fulham v Liverpool (May 12th) are possible to get hold of, albeit a bit more expensive than usual due to high demand. 

http://www.viagogo.co.uk/fulhamfc/Sports-Tickets/Football/Barclays-Premier-League/Fulham-FC-Tickets/E-465161

Keep in mind though those prices are a LARGE mark up from tickets directly from Fulham. You'll have to sit with Fulham fans as well but that's not too big a deal. Depends how much you're willing to pay to be honest! I'm not forking out 60 quid (£10 handling fees on top of basic price) for the cheapest ticket! Anyways good luck! Also keep in mind these 3rd party sellers only sell the odd seat that is available so sitting together is probably impossible unless you purchase tickets in the higher price brackets.

Good luck on your exams from a fellow London student !",0,1367080405,null,0,false,0,c9ns0nj,t3_1d7zgu,t1_c9ns0nj,t3_1d7zgu,null,1431409028,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

&gt;Q:When the show re-launched, original showrunner Russell T. Davies talked about being influenced by Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Is the show still being influenced by Buffy?
&gt;
&gt;A:I think when you start on a show like that... You are looking around [for things to compare it to]. Where does it sit now? What is like this now? What can I give as an example of this? Buffy is a good example: it's young-skewed, adventurous, funny and irreverent. 

...so he's certainly seen it. And it's not just me - wikipedia summed up reviews on the silence being compared:

&gt;Some reviewers noted favourable comparisons with monsters from American fantasy series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ""the Gentlemen"" from its critically acclaimed fourth season episode ""Hush"" (1999). Mike Moody for AOL TV wrote of the Silence, ""They're pretty damn scary, and they remind me of The Gentleman from Buffy. (Anything that recalls Buffy is a plus for me.)""[15] A Television Without Pity reviewer described the Silence as monsters which ""look essentially identical to the Gentlemen from Buffy.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"My thoughts, in no particular order:

**1)** Our fullbacks aren't good enough in tight spaces. If we're really going to play this 4-3-3 with inverted wide players, we need much better play in the final third from our fullbacks. Walker is fast and makes good runs at times but he's also incapable of combination play or early crosses or dribbling. He's out of control and unless he's getting played in behind he has no ideas.

On the left neither option is trusted, and one is right-footed. The other isn't an overlapping fullback at all.

**2)** Be careful what you wish for in Defoe. Had a bright first half in terms of movement but once he fell out of the game for a while he pretty much gave up on making runs. Utterly useless player when he's just standing around waiting for something to happen. This is what he did the entire second half. We have no good option up front right now, but Defoe is and always has been more effective coming off the bench.

**3)** Huddlestone, while excellent today, slows us down to a crawl. He was black Pirlo, creating chances and passing an excellent 91 times, but most of the time we switched off between going nowhere and trying hopeful passes in behind. There was no link play at all and no speed in attack. Our wide players looked confused and uncomfortable playing that high up the pitch, and they were taking turns dropping back. 

**4)** Scott Parker was a poor choice in this formation. We basically started the game with 2 midfielders who aren't good incisive passers and then Huddlestone who can create but the chances are usually pretty low percentage from long range. Our 3 forwards were isolated and while we were tidy in playing around Wigan, we didn't have anyone in that space to link the play. Dembele's injury didn't help in this regard as he was ostensibly the player who could have done this.

**5)** Dempsey is not so useful when we don't cross the ball at all. When we're trying to play intricately and rely on playing through a team, he's just not good enough with his feet to facilitate it. Towards the end of the game he received several passes into feet which if not for his horrid control could have been turned around the corner to Bale or JD who were both lurking on the shoulder of defenders. 

**6)** Without Dembele, teams don't have to respect us in the slightest. We literally have zero central midfielders capable of wriggling and turning out of challenges when Mousa isn't on the pitch. I suspect 70% of Parker and Holtby's passes once they were on were immediate backpasses because they can't turn under pressure at all.

Overall I really had a bad feeling that if we did revert to that 4-3-3 we would have issues, and unfortunately we did. If you look at the goals we scored against City, one was a great cross and a mistake from them, the other was a mistake from Nasri which gifted us a 1v1 and a great finish, and the third was a break when City were trying to come back into the game. 

AVB's changes last week certainly won us the game, but I'm not so sure it was enough to justify starting with something we haven't done a lot of. Today we desperately needed a midfielder in the hole IMO, to give their central midfielders something else to think about. Every pass received by our midfielders was in front of Wigan and it was so easy for them to close us down. There was no one exploring that space between the lines.

true,yourfriendkyle,num19,,"He doesn't work because he has no positional sense. Parker's idea of defending means that he just runs around after the ball, wherever it may be. 

Compare that with Sandro, who is much more of a positional defender, able to read the play and make simple interceptions and tackles.

When Parker plays with Dembele in a two man midfield, it severely hinders Dembele's ability to move around the field and dribble defenders, as he has to stay more centralized to take protect the defense when the ball is turned over. Parker worked well with Modric, as Modric, while a mobile midfielder, was more of a passer and so could remain intrinsically central.

He could work as the runner in a 3 man midfield, but his dribbling and passing are mediocre and far too safe/backwards. Holtby has the same physical intensity as Parker, but can dribble and pass far better, and so is a better fit. 

Essentially, Parker is an old school English midfield enforcer trying to play a more continental tactical game. He is far too old to change much of anything, and so looks out-of-depth in our squad, whereas he would probably be fine playing for Norwich, West Ham, West Ham.

Edit 1.5: what is the doctor going to give up? The TARDIS?

Edit 2: so that's the swimming pool. Also, what's up with this creature following Clara!

Edit 2.5: Eccleston's voice, fantastic.

Edit 3: that thing on the wall where the door was looked like something from portal. Also, what does Clara mean by 'so that's who'?

Edit 4:  Were all the old control rooms deleted?

Edit 4.5: Okay, I mean it, what the fuck are those monsters and why is The Doctor sorry?

Edit 3.5(I forgot it): those creatures have Ood eyes and what is the TARDIS doing to Clara? 

Edit 5: if Clara touched the past doctor would she get erased from time like what the cracks did?

Edit 5.5: Disregard my previous flesh comment.

Edit 6: Is the TARDIS going to talk this episode?

Edit: 6.5 was Clara half of a conjoined twin at some point?

Edit 7: I think Clara's going to die again in a week or two.

Edit 7.5: Fuck, the cracks are back.

Edit 8: She knows his name and he's just deleting the whole day.

Edit 8.5: two doctors at once. Nice.

Edit 9: The middle brother, the captain looks like Joseph Kony.

Edit 9.5: NEXT TIME: the doctor has a hard time explaining his new Clara to the ones who saw the old one die. Watch as the BBC reuses the same old house set again. Marvel at how much New Clara looks like Clara Poppins and think about how lucky he is not running into himself and Victorian Clara.

&gt; I dare say a lot of this is down to them applying for jobs they don't actually want or expect to get, so the effort isn't put in. 

I've had to apply for jobs I didn't *want* or expect to get in the past - this is nothing new. Not an ideal situation but it does teach you something valuable about how to apply for work etc. Unfortunately in today's job market, if you're not prepared to try and look interested then you can count on the job going to someone who can. 

&gt; And should they hire a suit for the day?  

Again, without details, it's impossible to say. What about smart trousers and a shirt from a school uniform? Are they arriving in jeans and a t-shirt with no effort made? As with my previous statement - if you can't bring yourself to try then you can be sure there's someone else who can. 

&gt; No chance of any training being provided then?

Again without details - hard to say. But it could be that employers are looking for skills like sincerity and professionalism - just as much as any true skills needed for the role. Alternatively they're looking for skills which ought to be there but aren't being taught correctly - therefore applicants aren't educated properly to standard.

I'll have to rewatch, but I think that was also Susan, Ian and some of the other early companions and Doctors in there.

As for the episode in general, it was a fun episode but with two main problems; there wasn't much (or any) Clara/Tardis interaction. Given the stuff in the previous episodes, I was hoping there'd be much more there.

Secondly; the reset. While cancelling the episode is sort of necessary (given what Clara leant) it is always an unsatisfactory conclusion, as it means that all the character development gets wiped... the Doctor coming to the conclusion that Clara is just Clara, Clara learning about how dark the Doctor can be and so on. All wasted.

*Edit*: Rewatching; about 13:45 in. Starts with Susan's line from An Unearthly Child about her ""making up the name from the initials time and relative dimension(s) in space"", then there's the Third Doctor's line about the Tardis being ""dimensionally transcendental"", then it gets muddled with different layers, but I think there's a Fourth Doctor line, after that the 9 line about the hordes of Genghis Khan, and then it's too blurred for me to make out.",0,1367087080,null,0,1367103371,0,c9ntyxd,t3_1d81wm,t1_c9ntyxd,t1_c9nsme2,null,1431408107,53,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,53

I was too tense to really enjoy the match. I've been feeling sick all week thinking about it. Pre-game atmosphere was good and the ground filled up quickly and the Tempest End was heaving.

I don't know how we weren't winning at half time. It's been the story of the season for us, playing well and having nothing to show for it and I was afraid this would be it. We deserved the lead when we took it but it was once again fucking sloppy letting Fleetwood back in. The ref and one of his linesman were appalling, failing to give blatant decisions right in front of them (including easily a dozen clear handballs) but confidently giving anything they didn't have a clear view of. I'm amazed we actually got the penalty, especially having seen since on the telly that it was a little soft. Thankfully Midson kept a clear head and tucked it away and we held on for the 3 points.

However, on fans is another matter. I think that it's one of those kits that just doesn't look good if, say, you're wearing an unzipped jacket over it. On my way into the ground, I did a double take when I saw a fan go past me in a Leeds-only area, because I thought he was wearing a Brighton home kit.

As for Vincent and the Doctor, it's about van Gogh, as you could assume. It's with the current Doctor, the 11th, and his first companion, Amy Pond, who I also dislike. For this one episode, the writers actually captured her softer side, and if you search this subreddit, you'll see there are a lot of posts about how people cried in the end. van Gogh, as you probably well know, well insane near the end of his life and eventually killed himself. I'm pretty sure when the Doctor and Amy visit him, it's like 6 months to a year before he dies, though I'm not sure. Anyway, it's a very heartwarmig yet sad episode too.

He could be carrying anything).

In addition, as much as he's a nice guy... he locked the Time Lords up with the Daleks.  All of his family, and presumably a bunch of friends and people he might have looked up to and admired... he sent them all in to something that he described as hell.  And when given the choice, he did it again.  The Doctor might act like an idiot at times; he might act naive; he might act like the ultimate pacifist.  But he is an insanely dangerous person.  And the Daleks might be egotistical, but they're not stupid - they know what he did.  They probably know more about what he did and how than we do, so they would probably be concerned about just going in guns blazing.  Plus, there's always Time Lord tech that we don't know about but that the Daleks do, and I'm sure that the Doctor has taken some measures to make sure that they can't just kill him by shooting him (he has gotten shot a few times, but he either regenerates or he wasn't really shot... and despite saying he doesn't know what will happen to him and all that, there's easily the possibility that he does know some of what will happen in his future.  I mean, he is a time traveler, and he does admit that he lies.)

If they were to team up with anyone, it would be to get rid of the Doctor... which they did at one point (and they failed).  They're not very likely to team up with him or his companions unless it's a temporary alliance to further their own goals through subterfuge, but the Doctor is not very likely to help them (he's just as paranoid about them as they are of him).

I lived in Stanmer Court in my first year and my mates lived in Northfield so I regularly cycled the tour de campus. (as I like to think of it) It takes about 10 minutes from one end to the other even with people walking in the bike lane so I wouldn't worry about being too far away in Northfield.

That said, if I were you I would choose Swanborough because it's a great campus location, very close to the co op and your lectures which will make it that little harder to avoid the 9ams. It's not as secluded as Northfield and you will see the regular buses out your windows but it's still quiet enough and not distracting in there.
 Swanborough has heated towel racks I hear which is another bonus! Plus in Swanborough you have the chance of being in one if the two flats with a TV :) 

All that said though, if i had the decision on accommodation all over again I would choose Brighthelm because it's cheaper, the layout is nice and friendly, (like a shared house instead of a flat) and you get washers and dryers in each house which will make your life so much easier.

I tried looking for more links, but fortunately we don't have that many shootings where the police is involved.

&gt;... That doesn't mean that the Police ordinarily follow a shoot-to-wound policy, and I'm certain they don't.

Please tell me more about how the Norwegian police routinely aim at the torso to neutralize suspects.

The list you used is a good example of when a taser can induce death, but I don't think anyone is denying that claim. It just seems these are abnormalities and are an exception to the rule.


Taser isn't a safety net that is always used correctly and will always be effiencent, but for the vast majority of usage it is used correctly. If you could compare the amount it is used and the deaths that it caused you'll see it's an extremely low amount of death caused by it.

Police in the UK aren't routinely armed and when officers come across something like someone with a knife, gun or potentially fatal weapon, it's an incredibly handy option. It could even be as simple as someone who is bigger and stronger than the officer.


I know many PCs who have done taser training and they say it's one of the hardest courses to do and has a large fail rate on the exams and practicals. The reason for this is because they are so strict that that they are ensuring PC's know when and how to use them properly.

Lewandowski: I think he's really good, but perhaps a bit overrated. His performance against Madrid was amazing, but stepping back he still has to prove himself a little to be one of the best. That being said, he's probably the best fit for our squad, due to the quality of his link-up play and other attributes. In addition, he's yet to peak, so he'll probably get better. A good option since people seem to think he won't cost as much as Falcao (and his age).

Gomez: The other Mario at Bayern has been really good, but this one should feel frustrated at his lack of playing time. I think people forget how good he is...last season he scored 40+ goals. It's harder to see how well he'd mesh with the team, but thing with Gomez is that he seems to score no matter what (when he plays well). Most importantly, he'll probably be the cheapest option. If Bayern want to move him, they'll be in a weaker negotiating position.

I would not object to any of these players coming to the Bridge. If I could have my pick right now, I'd probably go for Lewandowski. I think that Gomez is a more realistic option.

Part of me suspects that giving the French a dirty trombone and a few long term trade agreements is a nice way of letting them down gently, especially as they share a natural distrust for the anglo-american worldview (natural western allies), and are the main challengers to the UK at the moment for the Yuan deal.

I dont know... maybe the chinese have the mindset of a spoilt child and are punishing us for meeting some old geezer..... by dishing out multi billion deals to french companies at short term notice...(??) or maybe the multi hundred billion Yuan trading industry is the real issue here....?



anyway, the guardian is a terrible newspaper, of the same level as the mail but just from a different perspective.

by not even make cursory reference to the Yuan issue, the author is either reflecting their own unsuitability for the position they hold, or insulting your intelligence.

A big thing to consider about Northfield however that no-one's mentioned is the almost complete lack of any mobile reception.

If you want to move from one surgery to the next, your digital notes are printed and collated with your hard copy notes. These are then given to a medical notes summariser (a layman role; no medical qualification) who decides what is medically relevant and then copy types everything into a new document.

The new document of your summarised notes are then sent to the new GP by post, or to a distribution and holding warehouse if the GPs are in different areas. When the new document arrives at your new GP surgery, a second summariser takes the new document, decides a second time what is medically relevant and then copy-types into their computer system and files the rest of the paperwork locally.

The NHS has no concept of data protection or security best practices. They are an on-going joke, and the only reason everyone's medical records haven't been wholesale hacked and dox'ed is because (1) most things are still kept on paper (even e-mails - figure that one out...), and (2) because the complex nature of their content management systems obfuscate what's actually going on.",0,1367099331,null,0,false,0,c9nxjee,t3_1d8jgu,t1_c9nxjee,t3_1d8jgu,null,1431406426,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Nobody in our area had two cars, so most women had to walk to the local shops, almost every day. So the shop keeper's knew every customer by sight, a lot of shoppers knew each other. Certainly there is no way a man could have stolen a child, you just didn't see men pushing prams, ever, and a woman stealing a child would have probably been challenged.

Now the whole street is much more busy, the traffic is a nightmare, there are a more diverse range of shops (it was a scandal when the first ""Bistro"" opened), and it serves a larger number of customers who tend to go there less often. And of course people are much less likely to get involved if they see an adult with a distressed toddler.

It feels a lot less safe, but I actually think it is less safe. It would be much easier for someone to kidnap an unattended child or baby there.

Anyway, the definition of adultery I've found is ""voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person of the opposite sex"" (unless the other person is part of a legally-recognised polygamous marriage - but we probably shouldn't let UKIP know that those exist - they'll find a way for saying it's evil and all the EU's fault). There are all sorts of cases defining terms, and laws on things like accepting it (by staying with the adulterer for 6 months) and it is all rather messy, but basically, people can only commit adultery with someone of the opposite sex.

Of course, this applies in a current marriage as well; if a married man or woman has sex with someone of the *same* sex, that doesn't count as adultery for the purposes of a divorce.

And this is yet one more reason why it's really, really important that we don't torture people we capture _how ever much of a towering shit they might seem to be_ and it's really, really important that we don't let our “allies” torture our enemies on our behalf either. 

Qatada may well be a turd on the scale of the Shard but if we don't uphold _his_ right not to be tortured then we are hanging a “torture me” sign around the neck of everyone who works under or for the British crown. The situation sucks, and may be unfixable, but the nudge-nudge, wink-wink approach to rendition and torture as tools against terrorism that we've played along with before now will only create more of this madness.

We can all see what Ade, and Scotty, did for us last season, they were both absolutely superb. Similarly, both have shown some really great football at times this season. BUT, Ade is out of form, whilst Scot is showing his age.

I don't see why we should turn on our own players because of this. That makes no sense.

If there is a player who is not good, and has never been good, and will never be good for our club, then we will criticise him, AND WE HAVE. With the likes of Bentley etc.

Plus, if it's a matter of booing Scotty over a poor game when he's played his heart out in every single game since Sandy was injured, or trying to get behind him, and showing him support. I choose the latter, because I'm a good person, and moreover, a good Spurs fan.

true,sychian,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I'll hit these in order:

* The Doctor mentions that he disables the whatsit shields that would have protected the TARDIS from the mag haul. This was done as part of making flying her simpler for Clara.
* Agree on this one, I wondered the same thing. Best guess is that the TARDIS tried to ""eject"" both of them, but couldn't get Clara out as she was trapped under that debris.
* They didn't start as letters. It was only obvious after a pretty good while. And since she had already seen it as just a ""regular"" burn, she wasn't really paying attention to the shape—which was upside down and backwards, right? It took the Doctor seeing it for the first time to realize what it was.
* This is quite common in TV show hide-and-seeks. Just assume the creature couldn't see that well.
* Tricky was the one telling them to do that. Since he was human, he was probably a bit in shock.
* Good idea. Why not just listen to the Doctor and not touch? :-)
* He had other reasons. Mostly that he knew the engine room should be there.

I got a bit of a Scooby-Doo vibe as well, but I think it was somewhat intentional (like in The God Complex) especially when they were in the TARDIS-created labyrinth.

And the thing they threw through the rift was a mag haul reset. The Doctor took it from the brothers when he first met them.

There is too many centralised powers in Stormont and it's time that changed to give regional governments in NI more power to control their own affairs. 

I'd also have a lot of respect for Lady Sylvia Hermon MP - once again, North Down. She has always had a genuine concern for North Down and the people in it.

I figured out how much money a fortnight I need to live comfortably, and any amount I get paid over that gets transferred into a Cash ISA I have for savings. 

If you're looking to buy something, try taking a week or two to decide whether or not you really need it. If you get games often, pre-order and get the double reward card points Game offer. I've collected about 
2,000 in the space of a couple of weeks, as you get them when you trade in games as well as buying them now, so I always trade in games relatively quickly after completing them to get the most money off the next one I'm after.

I mean, draw your own conclusions, but I kind of felt he was racist after a few of things he's said.

He's very good at tarring everyone with one brush, and picking on rare issues you usually see as Daily Mail headlines. Then there's the constant un backed up sources etc etc etc.

That's the thing. Tasers + petrol is the kind of thing that a primary schooler might _think_ would cause ignition, but in real life, rarely would.

In most cases, the taser probes will be firmly lodged in the skin, so no spark would be created, additonally, liquid petrol does not ignite easily, only the vapours do, so if the probe were firmly lodged in petrol-soaked clothing, you won't get ignition.

Basically, for this to happen, you have to have someone who's been soaked in petrol long enough for significant vapour to build up within the clothing (i.e. it's starting to dry out) and the probe has to get caught in clothing instead of making it to the skin.

Sure, firing a taser at someone covered in petrol is risky, but the risk is far lower than you might expect. I'd be surprised if ignition occurs in 1% of cases like this.",0,1367106600,null,0,false,0,c9nzmrl,t3_1d7ht8,t1_c9nzmrl,t1_c9npjyf,null,1431405376,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,Omblae,UnionFlag,Surreh - Honda Hornet CB600F,"Sure. 

There's no limit on the max capacity of your motorbike, the only limit is based on power (no greater than 47hp) and weight (no more than 0.2KW/kg). You can buy a more powerful bike than a 47hp and restrict it, but you cannot do so if the bike is more than twice as powerful as 47hp. So you can get a bike which has 94hp, then limit that down to 47hp and that's fine but you couldn't get a bike with 100hp as that is more than double the original power.

 There are loads of bikes which fit into this category, the weight requirements are also based off the power of the restricted bike, so take that into consideration when looking up the specs of potential bikes. The Honda hornet JUST scrapes in (the earlier models anyway) at 94HP but with its high-revving I-4 engine, a more safe bet is an SV650 at 74hp or so as it'll be more usably torquey power. If you wanted to buy a racer, there are lots of 400CC race bikes you can pick up which fit all requirements and are apparently a load of fun to ride - and a couple of the old CBRs and the GSXR Srad just scrape in to the boundaries albeit with ridiculous insurance.. 

Compared to the CBT? It's harder because the CBT is pretty damn basic. But not too hard at all really, it's basically really fun - I had a really fun week learning about the bikes and motorbiking and got really in sync with my learner bike (a completely knackered GS500 with just about everything on it dented/scraped) so felt pretty confident. If you've had experience with a motorbike for a year then you will be absolutely fine, there were some guys in my class who'd never ridden a motorbike before who took the class and passed first time. The Mod 1 and Mod 2 tests are a bit of a pain, as splitting them up kinda means two days of worry prior to them and lots of scope for losing test fees but they are both necessary I suppose so you just have to deal with that - the Mod 1 test is really quite simple if you have practiced (which any decent bike school will definitely do) and know how the bike handles. One thing I was told by my instructors was that you should be able to get up to the speed required for your various manoeuvres without looking at your speedo and to keep your body soft and malleable and don't stiffen up on the tight, slow stuff so you're getting the maximum manoeuvrability of the bike. 

Mod 2 test wise, be aware that shoulder checks are necessary ANY time you're changing position. The best thing to do if you have any access to a bike (or even a push bike) is practice them relentlessly so they're second nature. For example, wanna pull out round a car on the road? Mirrors, shoulder check to the right, move position round the car, mirrors and shoulder check to the left back in. They're kinda over-kill sometimes but it's more to prove a point that you feel naturally obligated to use them - because they are SO vitally important. One of the guys I was doing my training with had just got on the road for the first time when he did a shoulder check, major to minor only to see a black Merc come flying down the wrong side of the road right past him. If he'd not have looked, there would have been a horrific accident so always do those checks! 

But yeah, it's a whole load of fun for a week and I'm actually looking forward to doing my A licence in a couple years to train up my skills and chill out with the instructors (motorbike instructors are generally really hilarious and chilled guys to be with). Plus the more you enjoy it the more you get in sync with the bike and the better you get at actually handling the bike - makes it much more likely you're going to pass your tests with ease.

We're not talking only about ""this instance"", though.

You said that you've ""never been convinced that statutes of limitations exist for a good reason"", which you followed up with ""I don't think someone who escapes justice and hides from the truth is rehabilitated. That is the action of someone who still doesn't think it was wrong.""

These are *absolute* statements, which imply that a bad deed should *never* go unpunished.

From what we know of Mr Clifford, the previously published recordings in which he's offered to interfere with justice on clients' behalf, and his public statements following his arrest - well, I didn't intend the hypothetical scenario I described to refer to him. I said ""some dude who fucked up years ago, or who maybe did something malicious and/or greedy, and he feels bad about it and he knows it was wrong and he'd never do it again.""

[I have stated in another comment here in this thread that I would be disinclined to apply statute of limitations to these kinds of crimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1d5zbs/max_clifford_charged_with_11_accounts_of_indecent/c9nekkk)

&gt; It is a canard beloved of Reddit, that no one is perfect and so any crime is fine, but it doesn't make any sense.

I'd love a citation on that. It certainly appears that the only person spinning this line is you.

&gt; Bombing refugee centres

Controversial? Yes. Legitimate? Maybe. Refugee centre? No more than anywhere else was at that time. Dubious perhaps, but hardly the greatest or most memorable act of brutality conducted in the name of war to come out of 1939-1945. I'm not really sure you can use it as an example to beat our modern forces with.

&gt; Corruptly invading countries on false pretenses

Well, the jury is still out on that one. But there is a huge distinction to be made between politicians deciding to invade a country, and the good conduct of the forces in doing it. Inb4 limited examples of prisoner abuses in Iraq, which may or may not have happened, and have largely led to prosecutions. 

&gt; shelling cities into submission

Ah yes the opium wars - a great example of gunboat diplomacy from 2 centuries ago. It isn't really fair to dredge up acts from the past, and subject them to our modern moral virtues. This was how things were done in the 1850s, it isn't how they are done now.

&gt; It's guaranteed Cameron &amp; successors will be using drones to execute whoever they don't like within a few years.

Killing high profile enemy targets has never been the British way. You know in the second world war there was a plan developed to drop 2 snipers into Berchtesgaden to kill Adolf Hitler. It was decided against as cowardly (and in all reality by that stage it was felt he was more of a drain than an asset to Germany's military operations). 

I think you are correlating the way the US has used drones to circumvent Pakistan's territorial sovereignty to how our forces may use them. If you look at defence analysis papers and the current thinking of the RAF you couldn't be more wrong - they simply don't envisage them in this way at all.

S1: 14 episodes on Earth or in Earth orbit.

S2: 7 on Earth, 3 in far-away space, 2 in a parellel Earth, and 1 in both space and Earth (Girl in the Fireplace)

S3: 10 on Earth, 3 not on Earth.

S4: 8 on Earth or dealing with an Earth crisis (Looking at you, Stolen Earth and Journey's End), 5 not on Earth.

S5: 9 on Earth, 4 not on Earth, with one of the four taking place in the TARDIS.

S6: 9 on Earth, 4 not on Earth, although some of those on Earth ones were in really weird places or in alternate universe Earths.

S7: 6 on Earth, 4 not on Earth, so far. From what I can tell, at least one more episode will be on Earth, possibly all three, which would keep it in line with S5 and S6. 

Specials: 7 Earth, 3 not on Earth, and 1 that takes place roughly equally.

There is a good pile of lore I have been shifting through) By knowing his name, someone has the potential to go back and find him before he was the doctor and remake him.

true,Rubix89,tardis,TARDIS,"It's hard for me to rank them because I really like them all in different aspects, especially when being able to look back at their time on the show as a whole.

1. To remark on Rose, I'd say I like her a lot more now than I did when I actually watched her for the first time. After learning more about The Doctor himself and the dynamic he has with his companions, it becomes clear how Rose is a really tragic character. As The Doctor explained with Amy, the traveling can tear people apart from their normal lives. It becomes an addiction unless they're somehow grounded to something that have waiting for them back home. Rose didn't have that and fell into a huge addiction with The Doctor. It's possible The Doctor even recognized this but couldn't help but overlook it because of how lonely he was after the Time War. I feel for her now, but I do admit that it's still frustrating how much importance Davies placed on her. This is what hindered Martha's stay as a companion and partially the show itself.

2. Martha gets an undeserved bad wrap. As you said, most of her time with The Doctor was top notch. However, after the big blowout we got with Rose and the lead in to The Doctor's depression over losing her, the show made Martha feel like the ""replacement"". That should *never* be the established persona of any companion. The show is about moving on and beginning anew. Martha was unfairly put in Rose's shadow.

3. Donna was a very fun companion. I agree some of her episodes were hindered by bad writing, but I think she picked up the show as much as she could with her performance. I liked the idea of a companion that was, finally for the new series, not utterly in love with The Doctor. They were just looking for a good time, and I think that brought a welcomed sense of relaxation for the viewers.

4. I admit I have my ups and downs with Amy. I love her a lot because of her growth. At the beginning she was falling into the similar pattern that Rose did, becoming addicted to the traveling and blind to her life back home. The Doctor nipped this in the bud, but it was still a push pull relationship even when Rory was there. However, looking back it becomes very clear how she slowly grew out of this naive state of worshipping The Doctor into a person of value who knew what she wanted with *her* life. She was finally able to see that she had Rory and a life waiting for her when she was done with The Doctor. The angels event was the push they needed.

My one biggest critique about Amy though was how much she *thought* she knew The Doctor. I guess it's understandable since she grew up making up stories and a particular image for him, but for the fans that knew him better than she did it became pretty irritating. She acted as though she knew him inside and out from the get go and even up until the end he had kept so many things from her.

true,user_schmuser,null,null,"2nd year at Abertay. If I could give you any piece of advice it would be avoid staying in opal at all costs. The rooms look nice enough but during the summer t's like living in a furnace. Dundee's a nice enough city during term time. It's not really somewhere I'd choose to spend a lot of time in when the students have gone home. It is quite a nice balance between living in a city and a town though, you get to know the place pretty well pretty soon.

Night life is good. Abertay Union is good during freshers week(make sure you go to the school disco). After freshers it's only really good for a few pints/game of pool/food. Dundee union is packed pretty much every night and drinks are dirt cheap. Tuesday is the big night, SKINT, in Dundee Union; £1 entry, free cloakroom and all £1 drinks (though most nights the prices are pretty similar anyway). Avoid Fat Sams if you don't want to get started on. Liquid is fun but more expensive than the union and everything is sticky/broken. The underground is fun but small so only really good if you're going with a big group. 

As for saving money just go to the wellgate shopping center (like 2 minutes from the uni). There you'll get the usual iceland, home bargains (I could not believe how cheap this shop was when i came over), B&amp;M bargains etc. Plus farm foods is across the way where you can get 2 kilos of frozen ""chicken"" for like 8 quid. Actually tasted surprising nice and it got me through my first year of uni :P

Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of Martha. Not Terrible, but nothing special. I did not like how they wrote her crush on the Doctor. She says he doesn't notice her but he shows her Shakespeare, Daleks, and the End of the Universe. Plus, she moaps about it after Rose(practically his girlfriend) has been sealed in another universe.

I love Donna. I think she has great stories (Silence in the Library, Sontaran Strategem) and I enjoyed her relation with the Doctor. She also has the best ending of any companion.

Amy. Not much too say about her. I thought she had too many one-liners and ,because of this, we lost some of her character. Still, good though.

I was never sold on that idea, because he'd never shown the ability to do that prior to being in the TARDIS, and his plan would have been so much simpler to enact if he'd had that ability all along.

Now a name, well, that is trickier.  His name is him.  Something that doesn't change.  Something that isn't redefined over his long life by his actions.  Something all Time Lords seem to revere.

1. Why would what happened in the Utopia episode stop him from getting to the library? The era's in which the TARDIS could explore were locked, not the TARDIS itself.

2. If The Master is in the Time Lock, he couldn't be the creator of The Silence. He has no access to the rest of the universe, that's the point of the Time Lock. The only reason it was breached before was because of The Master himself was used as a homing device of sorts to lock on to but because of his presence inside of it now, he can't use the same technique unless he went back into his own timeline, in which case it would render all of his efforts as pointless.

3. The Master's goal in enslaving Earth was to create a new version of Galifrey, there is absolutely no reason to assume he would destroy it. I have no doubt he would hurt people though, as he took his revenge on Rassilon, but his motives suggest that he just wants control, not destruction. To prove my point, in The End Of Time he could have killed every human alive but instead decided to control them by making them clones of himself.

4. Moffat had nothing to do with The End Of Time apart from the post regeneration scene.

I do love the idea of ""Silence in the Library"", that's genuinely a brilliant observation, although i do fear you're putting too much emphasis on the library in the TARDIS because the episode ""Silence in the Library"" does contain both a member of the Silence in the Library.

2. The White Point Star only worked because it could connect to The Master. Do you remember the drumming in his head? Rassilon and the Time Lords put it there, it was essentially a signal they could lock on to, and by sending out the Star, they could create a bridge. Without another signal to lock onto, The Master could never replicate that method. Also, the only reason the Time Lords could lock onto the signal was because The Master had just cloned himself and magnified the signal 6 billion times.

3. Up until the episode End Of Time, i don't think The Master or The Doctor had any idea that the Lock could be broken, this is why The Master tried to recreate a planet he believed was dead.

They didn't make it out of the same materials as the original coat and it photographs differently. [The original is Alcantara which is similar to suede](http://imgur.com/a/h2Mqv). The Abbyshot replica is a darker wool. The wool actually makes it a lot better for actual use, it's a *very* nice coat.  

The Baron Cotton also is a bit weird in photography. The blue pinstripes are the correct width, but because they are not actually woven into the material, they appear much stronger than on the real suit.

Because there's a basic fact here, none of the small parties have the organisation or stability and longevity of the three large parties. Nor do any small parties tend to have the same level of experience.

Why does this matter? Well the problem is, if you wanted a centre opinion, you'd be one of the three parties. The smaller parties tend to have something either very niche or slightly one direction off in the political spectrum. When this occurs you're likely to get people with more extreme views.

Now this is when less organisation comes into play. Monitoring, acceptance and consistency will always be far worse in the less-established parties, because they really aren't in the same league. This means a number of things:

- Less established policies

- A few more wack jobs

- A less stringent and strict party line

- A general divergence in views in the party.

The reason this annoys me is everyone always call for less of the big parties, while standing on the smaller parties every time a slip up made that is much less likely to occur in, what are  really, the professional parties.

England got lucky because there wasn't CNN in their time. An oil painting of the Indian Massacre isn't as shocking. Reading about Danish invasion and the highly religious bow-down society you guys had in text form is boring. Nobody wants to read about massacred nuns. No one wants to read of thousands of Mercian and Saxon villages being burned to the ground as raped women scream in the background. While religious fucknuts twiddle thumbs.  While King Edward turns to the invading danes, and screams 'Show me your wrath, shoot me from point blank range if you please. God will protect me' and shortly after takes all 50 shot arrows straight to the chest.

No one wants to read about all this being preventable by King Alfred while he chose to just pray, give all his money to the church and churn out a measly 1/16th amount of the ships the Danish had. Don't worry, he says, we will name them after Archangels.

No one has time to make jokes about being ass raped by every other culture in the Eastern Hemisphere until the only living remainder of the Briton race was shoved into that corner you call Wales and mock everyday. And how after this, the newly formed 7-8+ different breeded mutts formed an Empire to take their rage out of on others as weak as them. None of this is mentioned.

And I'm sorry. I used to and slightly still do like the UK, which is the only reason I know this over others. But recent events has made me start throwing stones as well as you. People in the UK forget we have an entire quarry to throw. It's just buried under 500+ years of dirt that nobody cares to dig through.

**A good example of this irony is found in the fact you act like you hate the French, but are actually BRITon's because of BRITANNY,France.

And then, again, another soon to be Frenchman civiliZed you in 1066. and, Once again, were turned into a religious cult by the French years later. Sucking at the teet of French Christianity**

It's like you people act like the 100 year war just reset all of your history and THAT's when you become England. Nobody wants to remember when you were Anglisch. All of that aside, modern UK is a very very very different place, almost not even the same at all.

Whoever John Hurt has been cast as, I don't think it's going to be as epic as people are imagining it to be.  Fans have insisted that the return of The Valeyard is ""just around the corner"" for years and I just can't see them bringing back a one-time villain from one of Doctor Who's most unpopular eras.

There are actually a lot of themes going on here besides the Clara.

You have all the of the rose references

You have the books (The Doctor Reading a book that Amy wrote, Later Clara reads a different book by Amy Pond which is an adventure that The Doctor has not had yet (I think, sometimes its hard to tell, it's all a bit wibbly.) that stars Clara under a different name. I do recommend reading Summer Falls.

I think the biggest on is Doctor Who? Which has shown up more in this last season that ever before. It seems like it is referenced in almost every episode. I would even go so far as Doctor Who is the biggest arc this series, and will end up being what is considered the larger story arc. Learning about the Doctors past is pretty major, considering it has been 50 years and we still don't know his name.

 1. You don't know what timeframe these recordings cover, nor how selective the playlist is. There's a big difference between that being every recording of a Muslim gang attack in Europe since 2006, and that being just 8 incidents of a few hundred that took place on 14th January 2013.

 1. As humans, we're really bad at dealing with large areas of land - these incidents took place all over Europe, which is a big place; even if they did take place all on one day, that's spread across around 4 million square kilometers of land, and 500,000,000 people. You see more drunken incidents just by going into a town at nightclub kicking out time on a Friday night.

 1. Finally, and this is an issue specifically with this reporting, the article elides the difference between Muslim and Asian/Arab appearance. The ""Muslims"" are identified as such not by religious symbols, or a choice of clothing associated with their religion, but by the fact that they're not white, and not African black.

true,111111222222,null,null,"You've kind of forgotten that while we are **British** We're actually, generally: English, Scottish, Welsh or Norther Irish. Each with their own distinct culture. I would also point out that until the 1550's Brittany was actually Roman (Like England and Wales), then it was brought into the fold of English rule, then relinquished as the kingdom divided.

The UK has always had a history of being invaded, in fact we've been invaded so many times that our people have such a diverse genetic background it's hard to decipher what it means to have a *British* race. In fact there isn't one in the way we can think about race. Further to this the Empire added even more genetic stock into the mix. We're pretty good at not committing genocide, it has to be said. 

Yea there have been some stupid leaders, yes there's been wasted money, yes there have been atrocities but I ask you this: Name **ONE** single country that hasn't. 

Unless you're going to name some really obscure island nation in the pacific or the Atlantic or something you will not be able to. 

We've been around for well over 1000 years as a united nation. The US has been around for a 5th of that and what was born in blood has only continued in blood. Simply put the US is full of fat, warmongering, uneducated idiots. 

Do you want a recent example of this? Take the Boston Bombings for instance. They CLOSED and entire city to hunt these guys down, and when they found them they shot them, all while the cameras were rolling. 

Let's take a minute here, even if they did or didn't do it:
 -There was literally no trial, just a death sentence - an execution without just cause - an execution of a civilian without just cause. This is a war crime. 

 -You fucking gave them what they wanted: National and international. Fucking. Attention. Well done, bravo. No one else cares. Do you know how we deal with terrorists? Like any other criminal. We put them in prison. Because they're not freedom fighters or anything else, they're criminals and they are treated as such. 

The USA is a country full of idiots, run by fucking idiots. There's a reason they're the butt of the joke when it comes to nations.

And now for a personal attack: You sound like an ill educated neck beard atheist who's currently sitting in his parents (or maybe his own) basement. 

Guess what fucking sherlock, there are a lot of atheists in the UK at the moment but thinking: ""Hurr durr people were fucking stupid for believing in jesus 1000 years ago duuuuuuuurrrrrr"". Really? NO FUCKING SHIT! It was a THOUSAND years ago. And even today, people can believe what the fuck they want! Hell you fucking believe you're intelligent by spouting some cherry picked examples. 

You are, quite simply: A self important cunt with no direction in life, who can only ever hold himself as high as his country because that's all he;s got going for him. 

But maybe I'm wrong, perhaps working in a hotel offers career opportunities I've never even thought of such as: boss desk operator or top room cleaner. Perhaps if you really were intelligent or even clever you could think of a way to not play so many video games an maybe do something productive.

TL;DR

You're a fucking joke. You're country is a fucking joke. Your mother is a fucking joke, everything you say is a fucking joke. Fuck off you cunt.

We sold Fletcher, Jarvis and Kightly for a combined 27+(?) million, and invested 9(?) back into the club in the summer, instead choosing to sink 19m into the stand

I know you guys all know this, but our manager appointments have been nothing short of tragic. If we knew we weren't going to get a new manager, and instead giving the job to Terror Connor, why didn't we just stick with Mick, who had a proven track record of success in the Championship.

I love this club, but hate the direction it's been taken by the terrible 2. At this point, I'd say get rid of those 2, Saunders as well (Although, who knows what he can do for us in..League 1 :(  )
