I suppose packing him off to Russia would be awfully beneficial to you guys, as the CL teams there have deep pockets. Suarez would probably reject any move to Russia. More realistic destinations would be Real Madrid, Bayern, Juve, etc. Bayern it seems is holding out for Lewandowski. Juve just purchased Tevez and Llorente. Madrid is hard to read, but I'd consider them more after Bale than Suarez as they have Morata and Jese in the pipeline (which would help the new Spanish rebranding effort--similar to us and our ""British Core""). 

If you would truly want him to leave the PL, you'd have more options at the £30m level as some lower level contenders in the CL might be interested. However, he'd probably only want to move to a major league, probably Spain or Italy. I'd see clubs like Inter and Atletico Madrid being interested for a lower price tag, yet Suarez could still nix a deal if he deems the destination club not big enough for him.

All in all, it seems like he'd be likely to stay in the PL barring any major injuries at top-spending clubs.

But, it was totally serendipitous.  As a kid in America, I loved the Grenada TV versions of Sherlock Holmes on PBS that were often showcased in their Mystery series.  I would spend summers at my grandparents and was always a night owl.  One night after Sherlock Holmes was over, an episode of Doctor Who came on and the theme song and title sequence caught my attention.  See, back then on Saturday nights, PBS ran the whole serial of Doctor Who, so it it was a 6 part one, you got them all at once, edited together.  Sometimes it would be something like 2 and a half hours long.  Anyways, this was how I encountered Doctor Who and my Saturday nights were occupied for years this way.  I eventually got to see everything from Pertwee to McCoy this way and the movie with McGann was just a blip.

true,omgfloofy,null,null,"First: People here in the US have to pay for upper tier cable packages (Usually between $80 to $150/mo) to actually have the chance to get BBCA- and not all cable providers here even have it available.

Second: I don't think it's a case of 'we don't want anybody to see it' as most people seem to be jumping to. Moffat's words were, if what I've heard is correct, because he argued with the BBC to keep the trailer at the convention- after the audio of the Sherlock series 3 trailer leaked, the BBC was about to pull the 50th trailer. Apparently, he argued with the BBC over the phone before the Doctor Who panel to keep the trailer there in the first place. He probably can't do that all the time.

Third: 7000 people =/= all of the US. There are many of us who are here in the US that want to see it, but we didn't go to SDCC to see it. And you know what? I'm okay with that. It's like I said above- SDCC has a lot of exclusives that never make it online: Lost had a bunch of parody videos at each of their SDCC panels that have never been shown online. As a big fan of Lost, it makes me sad that I won't see them (they're not even on the DVD sets), but you know what? It's something for the people who attended SDCC.

Fourth: Who funds the Doctor Who panel for SDCC? If it's like last year and the year before, it was BBCA- they paid to have the guests flown in and everything. The American funds went into getting it to happen. Also, the BBCA has only been able to really support the show for the past three years because previously, someone else had the rights to it here. (What's now the SyFy Channel.)

It's a big kick in the teeth for the people who waited in line and were part of the group that were fortunate to be there if the trailer was just put up online immediately.

It's designed for men and women who, perhaps, stay at home to look after the kids, people who aren't able to work, people who have decided not to work, and people who have left work completely but still want to be active in a trade union environment.  

**Community membership doesn't provide workplace representation, since it's for people who aren't working.**  If you are a student WITHOUT A JOB then this is okay for you - but I seem to remember you suggesting you wanted part time work.  If you join as a community member, you won't get assistance if you have a workplace problem.

If you're working under 21 hours per week, you would need to be on 'Core' or 'Core and Ancilliary' part-time member; this would cover you for all workplace issues, and is £1.47 a week (£6.37 per month by Direct Debit).  

If you're working less than 10 hours per week, you can join as a Low Hours member for 50p per week (£2.17 per month).

Does an MP really have that much sway with the police? Even if he does, why would he be so concerned with someone who called him a coward rather than the people who were pelting him with rocks?

&gt;as a full time royal he can contribute nothing to the world.

Total nonsense, the royal family in their role as royals (serving as diplomats, in the army, patronising organisations who do good works, the arts and other causes etc) contribute a great deal. If anything is ""unfair"" its that they can contribute so much more not so much less.

&gt;and if you think a full time royal can contribute more to the world than you or i you lack ambition and drastically underestimate what i intend to contribute to humanity

Without power your ""intentions"" are pretty meaningless. If you think that you have more power (or even can, in one lifetime, acquire it) than someone who has all the social connections to the most influential people in not just the UK but the world, controls vast wealth, has a world renowned and respected status as a birthright, then you are very much mistaken.

All of that points to the fact that what you are really doing is limiting ambition to what can be achieved in one lifetime by one individual. The royal family is evidence of how much more can be achieved if you extend ambition beyond that across the generations. By definition such an extension means that family members are restricted because at least part of their life is spent on the goals of the family and not individual goals - but what can be achieved is so much greater.",0,1374912741,null,0,false,0,cbbagzy,t3_1j269y,t1_cbbagzy,t1_cbb2od5,null,1430318738,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,sneakyi,lfcflame,,"No-one even cares that man city, chelsea etc. have massive investment from owners. It's big news for a season or two and then the clubs are established at there new level.

Look at the investment in facilities and playing staff at city. The owners stay in the background, hire the best staff they can to run the club and give the club the best chance to win trophies.

Hardly a bad model.

It's great that FSG are making liverpool a more self sufficient club and balancing the books. Especially after our disastrous previous owners.

They have not, however, invested hugely in the team. Most money spent on players has been taken in from players sold.

They are doing well by the club, mostly likely, in order to balance the books, increase revenue and sell the club for a tidy profit in the medium term.

Nothing wrong with that, though if we want to get back to the top we need huge investment in the first team.

If you think always having youthful potential and a nice system of play will do it, i'm afraid your wrong.

We can improve, get closer to 4th place, but anyone who thinks we are breaking into that party this season, especially if suarez goes is deluded.

We need the first team strengthened by real quality now. I don't think FSG will spend the money to do it properly.

The new stadium cost Arsenal a lot.  The stadium itself cost £390m and to this date the project in total has cost £470m, the amount of money spent on transfers alone by Chelsea and Manchester City is more than that.

But there were additional costs too.  Arsenal had to build quite a lot of property for the council and due to bad luck it was all built at the most expensive time to build and sold at the cheapest (before the property bubble burst and after it burst).  They also had to take a hit with front loaded, long term sponsorship deals, which have been obliterated consistently since then.

They played the long term game and built a stadium at huge cost (because they built it in the middle of London rather than on the outskirts on some horrible industrial estate).  Unfortunately due to the financial meltdown that period ended up lasting *much* longer than anticipated back in 2003 and they had to improvise to tide the club over till new sponsorship deals came in (It was more or less an absolute necessity to sell Hleb, Adebayor, Nasri, RvP etc.).

You're misunderstanding what the Lloyds and Barclays product do. They *don't* require you to borrow or get gifted a load of money, put it in a low interest bank account and pay tax on it.
 
Basically what happens is your parents as 'helper' put their deposit into a Barclays savings account. You put your 5%+ into the property and your parents put their 10% into the special account. The bank lend you the 95% you need to buy the house, and the parents' 10% just sits in Barclays, earning interest *for your parents* just like if they kept it in their own bank account earning interest. After 3 years they can have it back. Of course, they pay tax on their interest just like they would if they had it in a normal savings account. 

At the moment, your parents' cash might be in ISAs or something paying zero tax, so it might be a lower return than they would have got for themselves if they weren't involved in this scheme. Certainly lower in the long term than investing it somewhere with some risk, like stocks and shares etc. But the gross pre-tax rate on the helper account is quite competitive for a savings product (Base rate plus 1.5% at Barclays, so currently 2%). 
 
If you defaulted on the mortgage and got reposessed, and there was a shortfall on the sale proceeds of the auctioned off house against the mortgage balance, your parents would be at risk that they would lose some of it, as the whole point of them helping you is that the bank has more security than if they just went ahead and lent you 95% without this backup account. But you're not planning on missing your mortgage payments...

But basically this plan means that you only need a minimum 5% invested in the property. Your parents will not be named on the mortgage or have an interest in the house. *You* will need to be on the mortgage (which you would want to be anyway, as you would want to be on the deeds of the house and you can't be if you're not responsible for the mortgage). The bank would do it as a joint application even if they assessed your income as zero for the purposes of affordability.

The downside of your situation is that although you can do a mortgage application on a joint basis declaring your income as zero, that sometimes comes out with a lower loan than if you had done a single application. So it might be 4.5x salary or 3.5x joint salary which is obviously worse where one salary is zero. The exact multiples may depend on part of the country, absolute amount of earnings, loan-to-value etc and vary between lenders. 

But if you want a stake in the house it is *much* better for you personally to be on the deeds and on the mortgage than to just give him money and write a trust document to say that he'll give you some of the proceeds when he sells his house. Of course if you break up and the house has gone down in value and you want to walk away, it's much better to *not* be on the deeds or the mortgage.

If your parents are willing to gift you cash it would make sense that they give you the 5% (plus whatever your share of house-buying fees and expenses is) so that you can go into the deal with the same share of the deposit as your bf. Then you have a 10% deposit between you which gives you access to more mortgage products -HSBC, Chelsea, Skipton, Yorkshire all do 90% deals. If you can get better rates you might still want to use the Lloyds or Barclays ones with your parents putting more of their savings at risk, or you might want to take the whole 10% from your parents and go for an 85% deal somewhere at better rates. But you may not, new low-deposit mortgages are opening all the time. 

Nationwide do a 'save to buy' mortgage for FTBs where you open an account with them for a minimum of 6 months to save up some of your deposit, and at the end of it they give you a 95% mortgage and potentially some cashback depending on what you'd saved. I used the account but eventually just did a regular mortgage application with 15%+ deposit at decent rates and closed the save-to-buy account.

Finally, ignore the comments from /u/willmorgan about capital gains tax and CGT, this is a complete red herring. You don't pay CGT on receiving money as a gift. CGT is a tax on capital gains. Like if the parents bought shares for £100 and sold them for £100,000 making £99,900 gain. The legislation just says if you give away the shares valued at £100,000 you would still pay the taxes. So the word 'gift' is used in the legislation but is nothing to do with parents giving you cash, nor depositing their own cash in their own Barclays Helper account as part of a mortgage product.

The only relevant bit of tax relating to gifts is Inheritance Tax - if your parents had property (less debts and mortgages) and other net assets worth a very large amount of money when they die (say £700k), when they die the value of their estate that exceeds the limit will be taxed before you and others can inherit it. There are some special rules to stop people avoiding the tax, that if they gave away big chunks of cash in the 7 years before they die, a portion of that cash is added back into the calculation. 

So, it is something to be aware of if they thought they could give you loads of cash now to avoid death taxes later. But I presume they were not thinking along these lines, and in any case it only applies to straight gifts and not loans and certainly not Barclays or Lloyds helper savings accounts.

Bottom line you do **NOT** need to spend money with an Independent Financial Advisor for this. There are no big complicated tax issues. Some IFAs are also mortgage brokers or affiliated to them, but mortgages are a small subset of what the typical IFA gets involved with. 

You may want to use an independent mortgage broker if you are struggling to find someone that will lend to you in your 'one employee, one self-employed with minimal history, at a high loan to value ratio' situation. But there are mainstream products out there that would probably be fine. And if your parents are willing to put their cash into the deal (and not want it back for a long time, so they can tell the mortgage company it's a gift without reservation), you have a decent deposit for a first-time-buyer. If your parents are not willing to gift the cash, only put it into your deal temporarily, your choices are more limited but still exist.",0,1374916797,null,0,1374917447,0,cbbb2g5,t3_1iy4pr,t1_cbbb2g5,t3_1iy4pr,null,1430314246,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

1. Hannah Poling had an underlying cellular disorder (Mitochondrial disease)
2. Hannah Poling was given 5 vaccines on 1 day because she had fallen behind in her vaccination schedule
3. She already had encephalopathy which having 5 vaccines (vaccines mimic a person getting a disease) at one time caused a high fever.
4. That fever exacerbated her original condition and caused some brain damage, which mimicked the symptoms of Autism. She doesn't have tradition autism because it has also caused seizures.
5. They were compensated because the court concluded the vaccines trigged further damage due to having 5 in one day.
6. The vast majority of Autistic people do not have mitochondrial disordered or get 5 vaccines on one day.

This is a complicated case and a single case caused by a multitude of factors. Every large scale study has shown that vaccines don't cause Autism.

Here is [a link to a study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604170207) of around 5500-6000 people.

[This study involved the data of 14,700,000 children](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3/abstract;jsessionid=0274A8E3A13E183901F34B0B1597BC16.d03t02) and found no link between vaccines and the following disorders - autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gait disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections.

There has not been a single scientific study apart from the one Andrew Wakefield did (which I have already explain why that was completely flawed) that shows a link between vaccines and autism.

The reason it looks like it does is because Autism presents around the same age you get vaccinated but correlation does not mean causation. 
Here are some lovely correlation graphs that don't mean a causal link.

Unless you are talking about ""hard"" science fiction (where the point is to explore the implications of scientific ideas using the people and events as plot devices rather than in pulp sci-fi where the those ideas define the scene &amp; plot devices for the human story to evolve in and around) there really isn't much difference between sci-fi and fantasy which is why many fantasy writers and fans complain that sci-fi used to get a much higher billing in bookshops (Pratchett, Rowling and the recent resurgence in interest in Tolkien have forced that to be redressed somewhat).

For a couple of specific examples: You could easily rewrite the Doctor as some variety of wizard rather than an alien, or the various demons and half demons in Buffy as an invading alien force who snook in and made their base underground to hide while they got up to strength.

If we stray a little further off topic the first StarWars is pure fairytail: lost prince who doesn't know he is the prince yet is trained by an old master of the mystical arts, and they employ some rouges to help them save the princess from the evil wizard. Later they destroy the wizards tower (an event during which the rogues ""come good"" and are instrumental in saving the day), but the evil wizard survives to plan his revenge...

There are trees sacrificed in the name of science fiction where the main plot is more concerned with political intrigue and the tactics of war than the tech - GoT is no different but instead of some ancient offensive technology the lovely blond one has dragons and instead of an invading army of unfeeling aliens/robots/what-ever the big threat all the fighting factions will eventually have to join together to combat is zombies.

As someone who as studied virology (can you claim the same?) small pox is virulent and couldn't be controlled by quarantine for one very simple reason, *you are infectious before you start showing symptoms*. The reason we were able to eliminate smallpox via vaccination (it's a similar reason we were able to eliminate the animal disease rhinderpest) is because unlike a lot of other diseases it is only found in humans. This means that there is no 'pool' of the disease found in other species. Vaccination made it so because so many people were immune the smallpox virus that it could no longer sustain itself.

Not the big pharma conspiracy. There was no profit in keeping smallpox about. There were no treatments for it so big pharma wasn't making a profit either way. The smallpox vaccine was cheap and easy to administer and worked.

Polio is still prevalent in places where anti-vaxxers have scared people not to get the vaccine. This stems from there being a contamination in a batch in 1960, which could have caused some cancers but there is no real hard evidence that it did. In fact a study [by the National Cancer institute](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187182) showed it didn't and [another in Sweden](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9776244). Again this was contamination not the vaccine itself.

There is no evidence that the vaccine causes sterility (most of the UK would be sterile if that was the case) which is the main story told to people to hinder the eradication of polio. Also people say that the vaccine caused HIV to move to humans in the 50s. Actually HIV moved into the human population in the late 1800s so that is also bollocks. 

I know the real story of vaccines since I've studied it. Do you have any evidence apart from bad youtube videos.

One of, but certainly not *the* first. There were a number of shows that did in a much less significant way (I'm not counting Doctor Who as the gradual collection of canon material was unplanned, organic, and in places very self contradictory because of its organic development), and the first to try it in a big way and succeed was probably Babylon 5.

Before B5 DS9 was as episodic as TNG - the prophets could have turned out to be something more akin to Q (part of the scenery, making significant appearences but not driving a wider narative so much) and I very much doubt the domion war  was planned out in any detail fromt he get go. Once B5 showed that a larger story could be told, would be accepted by enough of the audience, and wouldn't put off too many of the less committed audience, DS9 started to look a litle old-hat and audience figures dropped. The lack of strong continuity wasn't the only thing audiences disliked about DS9 though - there was also complaints of it being very passive (sat waiting for advanture to come through the wormhole) so there were other significant changes around the time too. As well as the background arc being strengthened and further developed as a driving force for the show (rather than background detail for a more ""anthology show"" format), the Defient was intorduced near the start of S3 so the crew had a route to being more proactive in finding adventure to base episodes on.

**tl:dr;** DS9 is fondly remebered for its last couple of seasons (and rightly so) more than anything else, and they are quite different to how the show started. Had significant changes not been made from S3 onwards it would have died before getting there and be remebered as ""that TNG copy/spin-off that didn't work as well becaus emost of it had alreayd been done"".",0,1374919345,null,0,false,0,cbbbduo,t3_1j2ako,t1_cbbbduo,t1_cbajvf3,null,1430314098,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

I'm not saying that the gag reels compares at all to the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, but I'm saying that to show that people will show things at a convention (Pacific Rim, The Watchmen, and several of the Marvel movies are all guilty of this) that will not be shown in their exact form after the event. The people at SDCC got the treatment to see something that was for them.

I think the tweets and what was said before were miscommunication: one hand doesn't know what the other is doing. I think people are looking to find a finger to point and since Moffat is the one who said the warning, he's easily vilified as being the bad guy here. I don't think he's that at all. I think he's honestly warning people, because the BBC got really angry over the Sherlock kerfluffle.

I know the convention scene, and I've been to many conventions over the course of many, many years. This isn't my first rodeo with that. But SDCC is on a very large scale where major film companies, game companies, TV production teams make their major announcements at now. So this is kind of leaning towards an industry convention that allows the public to be there. Anyhow, regarding the exclusivity thing, the same can be said the other way around, anyway- don't get butthurt over the fact that they got an exclusive trailer.

true,Boiiing,null,null,"Property is a geared investment. 

Say your house costs 100 and you put in 20 and borrow 80. If over 15 years it becomes worth 200, you pay back the 80 and you are left with 120 for yourself. So the house went up 2x and your investment went up 6x. But if house price went down to 75 and you needed to sell, you'd find that the 25% decline had produced a greater than 100% loss of your investment.

So ordinarily more gearing is more risk because the small change in prices leads to a larger personal share of profits or losses.

With the government scheme they are giving you an equity loan, not a loan that's fixed in ££. If you borrow 10% from them and the house price goes up, they get the upside. If it goes down, they get the downside and you pay them off a smaller amount of money out of your exit proceeds.

So basically this scheme is allowing you to have access to a larger/better house than you would have otherwise been able to afford, for minimal extra cost and without you personally taking greater risks. What's not to like! 

The money you're not blowing on mortgage interest on the extra bit of the house allows you to save or invest your spare cash in a controlled way to build up a nice pot. Of course, if the house doubles in value you don't get the doubled money on the bit the Government financed, and when you move to your next house of equivalent size, you realise the money you were putting in the bank account isn't as much as you'd like and your standard of living might drop. 

You have to remember that although you've been in a great place, you did only have a small deposit, so if the value doesn't change much and you've not been putting much away in the meantime you will still only have a small deposit when you move. So when upsizing later you need to buy yourself back up to a 15-20% deposit level for your current house *and* and then look at raising a deposit for your next move up. It would be easy to have a false sense of security and not be putting enough away for the future.

Bottom line, yes it is in theory good for the people who take it and it is good for housebuilders who can ask prices they wouldn't have otherwise been able to ask, and it is good for mortgage companies who have a larger pool of people able to take lower-risk mortgages.

The government pumping free money into the housing market is helpful for the economy because a) people on the scheme with lower mortgage bills, or b) homeowners outside the scheme with generally inflated house prices who can remortgage at better rates or take more personal loans with reckless abandon, will have more money to spend on the high street and pushing more money around society creating growth.

It is of course very unhelpful for anyone who is not a homeowner and doesn't get the free cash out of their property because they don't have one.  House prices are artificially high at the moment compared to long-term averages because mortgage interest rates are super low and if you have a deposit you can get cheap finance to buy to live or buy to let. Of course, if the rates go up from 3% to a more normal 6% and everyone's mortgage bill goes up by an extra £5000 a year, people will get a shock, but for the moment they are sitting pretty and many have taken fixed rates to lengthen the timescale in which they can prepare for the shock.

If you don't have much of a deposit it's difficult to get on the ladder, thus the government help for FTBs to give them a chance. 

Arguably a better solution is to keep it unaffordable and not provide FTB support so that the market will reduce values over time to a level that is affordable. But this is less politically acceptable, thus the support to keep the feelgood factor going. This has to stop and reverse at some point and when combined with high rates will be bad for house values in anywhere without a chronic undersupply of houses (central londoners will be fine). But as a prospective buyer on the new scheme, the government is taking the downside risk on part of your property so that's pretty handy.",0,1374920390,null,0,false,0,cbbbidr,t3_1j0ueb,t1_cbbbidr,t3_1j0ueb,null,1430314039,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

Young people have always looked at porn, of course, but what 11 year olds can get through Google image search is much more extreme than what yesterday's 16 year olds found torn up under hedges. They are growing up thinking that what happens in porn is normal and that's storing up trouble for the future.

The government setting up some kind of porn ~~and thoughtcrime~~ filter is an attempt to deal with it by making porn harder to get, but until sex education and parents stress that *what happens in porn is made up and people never ever have to do stuff like that if they don't want to* then it's only addressing the easy half of the problem. There is also an undemocratic situation where they start blocking stuff they wish wasn't in the public domain (like lists of MPs' expenses).

true,Boiiing,null,null,"They won't be shifted, that's not how the UK lifestrategy ones work. They come in different flavours from 20% equity to 100% equity and they maintain those allocations. You can hold whichever one(s) you want. If you decided to reduce from 80% to 70% equities you could sell some of your 80% one and buy some of the 60% to balance out to whatever split you really wanted. 

For what it's worth, I only use the 100% and use cash or other types of funds to provide the lower risk component as I have no faith in buying gilts and investment grade corporate bonds at these prices through a tracker (compared for example to buying a strategic bond fund with active managers monitoring the markets and making suitable asset allocation decisions).

Also, in terms of platform I use TD Direct for my ISA and SIPPdeal for my Sipp. Both have a range of Vanguard funds, different pricing structures in terms of account maintenance / platform fee. Charles Stanley are cheaper than TD Direct now but the difference is only £50 on £50k. Sippdeal and Hargreaves Lansdown are (currently) flat fee based rather than percentage based so relatively better for larger investors. The best choice for you may depend on what if anything you want to hold alongside them in your ISA wrapper or SIPP wrapper or unwrapped. Example Hargreaves would charge you £24pa per lifestrategy fund but also 0.5% on your shares, investment trusts, ETFs up to a limit while TD wouldn't charge anything for the standard stockbroker stuff like shares and ITs and ETFs.

One final point as others mentioned, the 100k minimum for going direct is really designed for institutions going direct - if you're using a platform, that platform will already have 100k minimum between all their other customers and will let you in for £500 if you want or even less if contributing monthly.",0,1374921196,null,0,1374921920,0,cbbbluv,t3_1iqqcs,t1_cbbbluv,t1_cb7qcnb,null,1430313994,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

That's a good thing, isn't it? Innocent until proven guilty etc etc.

Plus your argument seems to presume that the majority of illegal things like child porn are found at ""www."" domains. When really they're going to be hidden on things like TOR and other messageboards. So the filtering the government currently employs isn't for that; instead it's being used to play whack-a-mole with Torrent sites at the behest of corporations (and is totally ineffective anyway).

The other side, that people don't seem to be saying much, is that things like child porn are already illegal. There's at least a reason for the government's pro-censorship stance on such subjects. Porn, in general, is not...so why are they trying to censor it? Censoring legal content is pretty damn authoritarian.

true,Ooer,null,null,"I have some advice for driving in the UK for an American (as I have done both). 

Firstly, if you are on country lanes or back roads (usually known as B-roads) the national speed limit is 60mph, but that does not mean you can do 60mph the whole time. They are single carriage roads with lots of unpredictable turns and hairpins, watch out for 'SLOW' being printed on the road and other warning signs.

Don't worry too much about driving on the left, you will be surprised how quickly you wrap your head around it. Just take care when turning out of T-junctions (intersections) and make sure you're going to the right-hand side of the road each time. If in doubt take your time and look for other cars.

Motorway driving is far better here that in America, 99% of people will generally stick to the slow lane (or at least the middle lane) when not overtaking which allows for the faster cars to get by without any undertaking being required.

I know America has a few roundabouts (you may know them as rotaries) but if you are not familiar with them then it is worth just taking them slow. As you approach make sure you are in the correct lane if there is more than one, there are usually signs or road markings saying which lane you should be in for which turn. You always go clockwise around a roundabout, and the rule is that any car approaching you from the right has priority, so you should not be pulling out in front of them. This means that once you are on you do not need to worry about other cars pulling out, just indicate before you get to your desired exit and make sure no car has attempted to undercut you (again, very rare).

Just checked the comments and good call on the automatic, that will free up a lot of your concentration for when you start out.

Hope you have fun here!",0,1374922586,null,0,false,0,cbbbru8,t3_1j577w,t1_cbbbru8,t3_1j577w,null,1430313917,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9

true,roobens,lfc87,null,"You've pretty much stated something that's been lurking in the back of my mind for quite awhile. Whilst Suarez was invaluable to us before January when we literally had no other proven strikers, he was less effective once we signed some new talent and the system wasn't quite as orientated around him, and as you said the signal-to-noise ratio in terms of his shooting and goals was really rather poor. For every Suarez goal I celebrated, I lambasted his wastefulness and poor finishing on several other occasions. Furthermore, some of the performances we put in when he wasn't present were very good indeed, and we looked a lot more like a unit (although toothless at times).

All that said, there's no denying that Suarez is a world-class talent who brings an extra dimension to our attacking play. It's just that his particular individual style doesn't really complement the style the team is trying to implement as a whole, last season at least. If we do end up keeping him, then I hope this is something that can be remedied in the coming season. If he goes then hopefully we can add some two or three more rounded players that fit into our system more intrinsically.

However, going back to your initial post, I would still not sell him to Arsenal or take the ""highest bidder wins"" approach to facilitate this, because a lot of these gripes are made under the assumption that he'll play in the same unintegrated fashion as he did for us last season, and will therefore have a somewhat negative effect upon Arsenal's play on the whole. This isn't necessarily true; both Arsenal and ourselves *are* capable of getting him into synch, it's just that he got used to being the fulcrum of all our attacking play in the first half of last season, and therefore continued to play like that. If Wenger/Rodgers are intelligent, they'll utilise his talents much more effectively within the team next season. Therefore if he has to go I would rather he go to Real Madrid, even if it's for slightly less cash.",0,1374922693,null,0,false,0,cbbbsb9,t3_1j4cjd,t1_cbbbsb9,t1_cbb533t,null,1430313910,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; This is just a silly slippery slope argument. 

Which in the case of surveillance and interception is completely and totally valid and provable through the growth of surveillance-related legislation introduced since the first labour term in 1997 ranging from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act through to the Police and Justice Act etc.

The slipper slope argument is even more valid when it it taken within the context of schemes such as [Tempora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora) and praise for TalkTalk's HomeSafe censorship, outlined as the type of censorship the Government [wants to implement](http://www.ibtimes.com/uk-porn-filter-censorship-extends-beyond-pornography-one-isp-fighting-back-1361379) by the Open Rights Group (the UK equivalent of the EFF), which goes way beyond porn.

Just because it has a .co.uk domain doesn't mean it's based in the UK.

From [here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jul/08/secret-tribunal-orwellian-fantasy-prism):

    In order to challenge a secret surveillance system, and to demand the government explains why it is spying on British citizens, one must apply to a secret tribunal that does not make public its proceedings or the reasons for its decision. It may seem like an Orwellian fantasy, but this is the stark reality of the British legal system.
    It's called the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), and it has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the clandestine surveillance programme being carried out by the government. Created in 2000 with the passing of the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, and operating outside of the public's knowledge, the secret tribunal is now in the spotlight with the Guardian's revelations of GCHQ's access to Prism as well as its own operation Tempora.
    when Privacy International informed the foreign secretary that it intended to challenge such practices in the British courts, the government's lawyers notified us that we could not bring such a claim in the administrative court, which would be the normal route. Rather, we have been forced to take our concerns to the IPT. It shouldn't be a surprise.

&gt; You don't know what is

I would put it to you that it is you that doesn't know what a surveillance state is. In gathering this information to make counterpoints and support my position, an unknown proportion of my traffic has been recorded and will be retained for 3 days by an agency that operates in secret and is largely unaccountable (you can sing IPT all you like, but Tempora was signed off by a secretary of state and will be therefore found legal). The metadata from my collection of data will be stored for 30 days at least by the same agency. I can't leave my house without being spotted on CCTV (thanks to the council who have CCTV in my street) but I feel I'm digressing. We are in a surveillance state.

true,FootballMythbusters,null,null,"I think that with Arab money coming in (the silly-money PSG and Monaco) kind, we'd lose a lot more than we'd gain:

* Long-term management: do we want a new manager every year, or the insanity that has been Chelsea over the past few years? I like Rodgers, I want to give him the chance to develop a long-term project. We can achieve just as much with sustainability and improving the team incrementally each season.

* Promising youth: All those youth players that we love and want to see? They'll never get a chance again. We'll never see another Gerrard, or Carragher, because we'll always be buying established players before we give them a chance. There will never be another Scouse player (or even an academy player) playing for the club as long as a multi-multi-billionaire owns it.

* Anfield, and the redevelopment. Given the speed at which these projects usually tend to take place, they'll probably immediately look to build a new stadium, and we'll lose Anfield.

* The Aggers, Lucas', Kuyt's, Xabi Alonso's of the team - over the past few years, we have had a lot of great players (who were bought for relatively cheap prices) come to the club to play for the club. I will always remember Kuyt, Alonso, Luis Garcia, and the way they still hold the club dear. Say goodbye to this, and hello to players that chose us because we paid more than City or PSG, and say goodbye to them once they get offered more by those clubs.

* The scouting team: We hired our scouting team from Man City because they were pissed off they were going un-used. They were giving Mancini cheaper alternatives and he wasn't listening - instead he was just buying the big name. But would you rather have a player that comes because we're one of 7 teams offering silly money, or because we're the only team offering him a contract - as with Coutinho and Sturridge - and all they needed was a place where they could play. I'd rather have Coutinho that Lucas Moura, I'd rather have Sturridge than Negredo. 

Yes, I want us to compete. But I want us to do it like Man Utd. Long-term manager, incremental improvements every year. Yes, they spent money, but not like Man City or Chelsea, and the money they spent they earned from establishing themselves as one of the biggest clubs in the world.

The thing is, we don't actually *need* Arab money. We are already an established brand. Just look at the insane scenes in Jakarta or Melbourne and everyone can see we're one of the biggest clubs in the world, despite being a mid-table team for the past few seasons. All we need is to get that 4th spot, and I truly believe it will come under Rodgers. The moment it does, we're back competing for top talent anyway, but with a great academy, great scouts, and enough money from FSG and CL that we can compete for a top player every now and then anyway, to supplement the good work that goes on in the youth and scouting. It's just a far, far better way to do things, but the best thing about it is it's **sustainable**. If every year we have to fork out another 200k a week to buy a big player, or sack the manager because he only won the CL, then I just don't know how much joy I'd actually feel if it takes 6 managers on the scrapheap and 500m in 2 years just to win the league.",0,1374926121,null,0,false,0,cbbc7wm,t3_1j5c7k,t1_cbbc7wm,t3_1j5c7k,null,1430313708,73,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,73

true,circuitology,eng-kent,Kent,"&gt;How can you distinguish between a video of an actual rape and rape porn?

I don't think that's important in the slightest. If you're going to emulate something then the idea is that you are convincing. Or else why bother?

The bottom line is that if the person watching believes that the content they are watching is being performed by consenting adults, however convincing it may or may not be, it should not be on the watcher's head to not watch it or face legal consequences. Rather it should be on rapists heads to not commit real rape and film it, and it is the source of the content that should be looked at, not the destination.

&gt;With films, its easy to know when an a scene of a guy getting shot is fake, and a clip of a guy getting shot is real. 

It is? I know that if you showed me certain scenes from certain movies in the context that they're real, I could believe that they are. The fact that you know you are watching a film in the first place is what usually makes you feel comfortable that it's not real. The same goes for porn. It doesn't matter how convincing it is, if it's real, go catch the people that made it, if it's not, leave everyone involved alone.

And yes, prosecutors do have to follow the CPS guidelines. Its their job to do so, and is the criteria they use when deciding what cases to prosectute. Prosecutors in England and Wales have very little autonomy.

Kier Starmer Director of Public Prosecutions, agrees that this is an issue that goes beyond guidelines for prosecutors:

Social media is a new and emerging phenomenon raising difficult issues of principle, which have to be confronted not only by prosecutors but also by others including the police, the courts and service providers.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"&gt;Yes, my point was that if there are prosecutions then the guidelines don't have any effect beyond that, so if they don't reduce prosecutions that is not enough of a measure in itself.

The guidelines are the basis upon which prosecutions are taken. If the guidelines say no prosecution, then no prosecution happens.

The problem here was ALWAYS over zealous prosecutors. They were the ONLY party who go to make any decisions in this whole sordid period.

The judges had no meaningful say, because they were not being asked to find guilt, just to apply the sentencing guidelines for crimes for which the defendants had admitted guilt.

This application of the law had neither been tested at trial, nor by appellate courts. Given previous cases it is fairly likely such convictions would either have not happened, or ultimately been found unlawful, either by the Court of Appeal, or SCOTUK.

The only malfunctioning part of the system was that prosecutors were using their position to charge inappropriately, and bully naive people who were frightened of the horrific negative publicity they would have faced and of the criminal justice system generally, into making unnecessary guilty pleas.

Unless they wanted to face trial, and all the publicity and abuse that would ensue, once the prosecutor made their decision these people were screwed. Now the prosecutors have been clearly instructed not to do that.

&gt;The fact that offensive remarks may not warrant a full criminal prosecution does not necessarily mean that no action should be taken. 

If they don't warrant a prosecution then that's basically the end of things as far as the criminal justice system is concerned. There may be relevant action by social services, charities, councils taking civil action.

Magistrates, and they have some say because, again, guidelines. Guidelines are meant to fair exactly because they are only guidelines. Yes, magistrates have highly controlled powers and can't just go off doing whatever they like.

&gt;This application of the law had neither been tested at trial, nor by appellate courts. Given previous cases it is fairly likely such convictions would either have not happened, or ultimately been found unlawful.

Whilst I mostly agree, that is fairly sweeping. They have the right to some legal counsel. Yes, people do tend to just admit, but scroll down to the end of the first part of that post (linked to at the end: http://megapi.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/on-freedomtooffend-part-i.html) you'll find extracts of the magistrates guide.

But it does not last forever and the mark of a great winger is one who can adapt his game.

Lennon has more tricks than Townsend and he has much more of an eye for a pass. At this moment in time I would argue that Lennon is twice the player. However Townsend has bags of raw potential and his directness can be devastating.

This might be no more than a good easy way to test what pupils have learned in a history or english lesson - fill out this multiple choice test in the last 5 minutes of the class.

These kinds of tests are, I believe, proven to aid learning, similar to the way you do maths exercises. You teach the subject, test it, go back over a bit of it in the next lesson, and the repetition and testing helps the subject matter to stick.

Obviously you can do just the same kinds of mini-quizzes on pen and paper, but marking them manually takes longer than the pupils just entering the answers directly into a computer, so this way the mini-quizzes are performed more often. 

If you want to teach IT (and I agree we should be) then computers are what should be used - we really don't know what these iPads are being used for, but they may be the ideal platform for quick simple stuff which nevertheless reduces teacher workload.

I am not arguing, by the way, that parents should have to pay for these - surely they should be paid for out of the school's budget on a cost-value basis. If they improve the school's results, then the school should be paying for them.

But it's really too easy for us to criticise when we don't know how the iPads are being used. It's ridiculous to say ""we didn't have that in my day, so they shouldn't need it, either"".

Players I feel are comparable: 
Coutinho (Cazorla), Aspas (Giroud), Lucas (Arteta), [inconsistently] Enrique (Monreal), Martin Kelly (Sagna/Vermaelen), Henderson (Wilshere), Wisdom (Sagna), Toure (Koscielny, Mertesacker/Vermaelen), Brad Jones (Szczesny)

It remains to be seen just how good they will be, but Sterling, Alberto and Ibe could certainly be on the level of Walcott and Cazorla given time to develop (and all three have impressed with the glimpses they've given of their gifts).

Who on Arsenal's Bench besides maybe Podolski (why is he on your bench to begin with?) is worth mentioning at all (especially in regards to the offensive side of the ball)?  Ox?  Aging Rosicky?  You have Carl Jenkinson and an inconsistent Gibbs.  Liverpool will have Sterling, Alberto, Aspas, Sturridge, Henderson, Downing, Coutinho, Allen and Borini all competing for a handful of starting spots, with only 3-4 of them getting the nod.  Ideal lineup would be a 4-2-3-1 with Enrique, Agger, Skrtel, Johnson, Lucas, Gerrard, Suarez, Coutinho, Alberto and Sturridge on the field, leaving Aspas, Henderson, Downing, Sterling, Allen and Borini competing for 4 bench spots while Kelly, Toure and Jones take the other three.  Your bench is pretty much fixed with little competition at any position, little depth outside of defenders and no standout super subs.

The only reason Arsenal *were* in 4th and Liverpool *were* in 7th is because of managerial stability.  Congrats, you barely got 4th with a manager who has been there for 17 years even after bringing in world class talent in Cazorla and Podolski and retaining Walcott while playing the exact same system you have been for years.

I agree with your view. I despise the way these HR people consider their ""craft"" to be some kind of pseudoscience of matching people and finding if a person has the ""correct"" set of personality attributes despite the fact the candidate doesn't meet any of these people they will have to work with and the pressure of the interview can make people act abnormally. They might as well measure the shape of the candidate's head and compare it to their charts. But unfortunately they make it a popularity contest, that is the game we must play.

Imagine if positions really were given on merit. We'd have decent leaders. The person trying to push online censorship would understand how the Internet works. Your manager would be better at your job than you are! Instead the popular/loud people get chosen and we end up with Claire Perry pushing technology policies (as a recent example). It's a shame.

* Agree Coutinho above everyone except Cazorla, who I think is a notch above Cou (only a small notch, and look at the age difference again)
* I think Arteta clearly loses to Gerrard but not so clearly to Lucas -- Arteta is pretty damn good. Though consider Lucas has been capped by Brazil (many times) while Arteta hasn't scratched at Spain's national team.
* Agger clearly better than any Arsenal CBs but would rate Skrtel lower.
* Ox ranks alongside Sterling, both with somewhat similar potentials.
* I don't think we can fairly rate Aspas or Luis Alberto against any Arsenal sides, yet. I am really excited to see what Aspas can do, though.
* People don't rate Henderson because of his original price tag and because they haven't watched him progress IMMENSELY under BR -- still not sure he is clearly above Wilshere but I think he can/will get there.

I was talking about RVP, which was last summer.  Was Arsenal still so far in the weeds monetarily that they couldn't stand to lose £24 million?  I understand what happened with the stadium, I really do.  But if one summer after you sold your best player (again) you are able to spend £40 million on a ""vile rat,"" then maybe Arsenal should've took the RVP money on the chin and kept him from going to another top 4 club.

Hicks &amp; Gillet - dickhead owners that rightly should be criticised for, firstly, sacking Benitez and then for hiring Hodgson.

FSG - rightly sacked Hodgson (for a multitude of reasons), gave Dalglish a chance (it didn't work out - he did OK, but he also blew their big cash injection, and giving him &amp; Comolli more money would have been a mistake), and have now hired their man Rodgers for a long-term project.

Abramovich - oil baron who sacks when he wants, regardless of success, doesn't plan for the long-term, and picks transfers himself.

They are not comparable. And it's not about whether the chopping and changing affects success - it's about the fact that so many managers and players are just pieces in Abramovich's game. Chelsea is not a club, it has no fans with a real say in what happens, it is Abramovich's plaything. I don't want that for Liverpool. H+G and FSG are not comparable to him in any way.

EDIT: Upon re-reading the post, you hit the nail on the head straight away with your second sentence.

A bill of rights is to protect people from their governments (exactly what's going on in cases like that under discussion); we have the law for protecting ourselves from each other. The ECHR specifically puts governmental exceptions into every single one of its protections.

A _real_ bill of rights starts by saying that the government may make no law that contravenes the rights it enumerates.  Therefore any bill of rights that references the law is already broken; a bill of rights comes before you make a law. 

In short: the ECHR guarantees you nothing.

---

Some samples for you...

### Article 2: Right to Life

&gt; Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in
&gt; contravention of this Article when it results from the use of force
&gt; which is no more than absolutely necessary-
&gt; 
&gt; (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or
&gt; insurrection.

""insurrection"" being ""A rising against civil or political authority, or
the established government"".  So your right to life is only valid while
you aren't disagreeing with the government.

### Article 4: Slavery

&gt; For the purpose of this Article the term ""forced or compulsory labour""
&gt; shall not include: 
&gt; 
&gt; (d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations. 

... and my ""civic obligations"" are defined by whom exactly?  The
government you say?  In that case I am not protected from slavery am I?

### Article 5: Right to Liberty

&gt; No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases
&gt; and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law.

It's getting tedious now isn't it?  I can't be deprived of liberty
unless the law says I can be deprived of liberty.  Who, other than an
officer of the law, is likely to attempt to deprive me of liberty?

### Article 8: Right to privacy

&gt; There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise
&gt; of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is
&gt; necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national
&gt; security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for
&gt; the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or
&gt; morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

That's quite a list of exceptions.  In particular note ""the economic
well-being of the country""; and ""protection of health or morals"".  Those
two are sufficient to cover pretty much any excuse the government wants.  ""We were spying on you to make sure you weren't eating crisps or watching porn"".

### Article 10: Freedom of Expression

&gt; The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
&gt; responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions,
&gt; restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law

Freedom of expression ""restricted by law"".

As a few people have commented during the Far East tour, it looks like Brendan may have decided Kolo is good enough to be more than just a squad player and can be part of our first choice CB pairing with Agger.  He also seems to feel Skrtel can be rehabilitated after his loss of form last season.  With Kelly back it looks like Wisdom will now play CB, when he plays and has even jumped ahead of Coates in the pecking order.  

I think things look good for our defence.  Our big problem last seasonat the back was aerial threats in the box and that's an area where Mignolet has much better stats than Reina and should have an effect.  Kelly's back as RB cover, another left back and we will be sorted.

We still need on more attacker.  We have a lot of attacking players with potential but fewer who are proven.  A frightening proportion of our prospects hang on Coutinho maintaining his form and Sturridge staying fit.  One more quality attacker could make a monstrous difference to our campaign.  

I don't think Ben Arfa's the answer - he is a flying machine but too often he gets his head down and just runs at a defender and loses possession.

true,ruedtheday,null,null,"I wasn't trying to get you to sympathise, I was explaining what the *long term* plan for the club was and why certain decisions were made/necessitated.

If you take the RvP situation as an example, what you call a 'long game'/'long term problem' is very much *not* long but in fact short!  There were two options and both of them involved losing RvP just one of them involved not receiving a transfer fee and paying an unsettled, unmotivated and disgruntled striker for a year extra.

Keeping him wouldn't have even solved Arsenal's problems last season as they had major issues with unforced defensive errors, not scoring goals.  Either way, the club was losing RvP and would need to buy a top striker this season.

Could the club have taken the hit financially?  [Probably](http://www.arsenalreport.com/finances/) (as an aside, as you can see the debt *isn't* gone, there's just a new shirt spinsorship deal that dwarfs the old one) but it's really beside the point, it was bad footballing business to keep him, which isn't the case for Liverpool and Suarez.

Suarez has years left on his contract and is far better than any one/two/three players Liverpool can hope to attract.  Liverpool with Suarez is much more threatening than without.

p.s.  The comparison I made isn't laughable because it's both true and accurate.  Both have been taken over twice and both times have had large sums of money spent on them.  City much more so than Liverpool but I wasn't comparing the scale.  After City and Chelsea Liverpool are the third highest spending team in the league on transfers since 03/04!",0,1374944575,null,0,false,0,cbbg9ci,t3_1j4cjd,t1_cbbg9ci,t1_cbbfdj0,null,1430311823,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Your argument WAS the source. The only other point you made in your post was about this sub and had nothing to do with the financial standing of the royal family. 

&gt;Would you like to provide the other half of the information, seeing as I'm unsure as to how we'd even measure what they supposedly ""earn"" for us. I would absolutely welcome those figures.

I don't have the faintest idea where to find such figures, so no I'm afraid. The official figure of what the crown estates earn is well over £200 million, but that's skewed as obviously the crown estates would still make money if the royal family no longer existed. That also wouldn't take into account tourism benefits from events like royal weddings, jubilees and coronations.

You claimed that evidence is 'heavily to the contrary', so I'd like to see some evidence that is heavily contrary to the claim that the royal family pays for itself.

true,ElephantStone,eng-GreaterLondon,Islington,"&gt;Your argument WAS the source. The only other point you made in your post was about this sub and had nothing to do with the financial standing of the royal family. 

No it wasn't. My argument was that there is no evidence to suggest that the royal family are a net gain, and if anything the evidence was to the contrary - the source was evidence supporting that argument.

Please don't tell me what it is that *I'm* saying, and maybe google the words ""source"" and ""argument"" before dictating my own beliefs to me, thanks.

&gt;I don't have the faintest idea where to find such figures, so no I'm afraid. The official figure of what the crown estates earn is well over £200 million, but that's skewed as obviously the crown estates would still make money if the royal family no longer existed. That also wouldn't take into account tourism benefits from events like royal weddings, jubilees and coronations.

The Crown Estate belongs to The Crown i.e. the British State, not the royal family, so that quite literally couldn't be less relevant. And you've failed to provide *any* evidence whatsoever in regards to actual figures, and predictably fallen back onto the ""tourism"" argument that's *always* trotted out in these discussions, again backed up by absolutely nothing.

Regardless, here's some evidence to suggest the tourism argument is absolute tosh:

The [top 10 most popular tourist attractions in London](http://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/sightseeing/tourist-attraction/top-ten-attractions) house precisely 0 royal family members.

[Here](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/feb/23/british-tourist-attractions-visitor-figures) are some more figures that suggest that the royal family has little-to-no impact on tourism in our country.

&gt;You claimed that evidence is 'heavily to the contrary', so I'd like to see some evidence that is heavily contrary to the claim that the royal family pays for itself.

They cost us, by their own heavily biased figures, £38.3M a year, and up to over £200M by other estimates. As I said, I absolutely welcome any actual figures showing what they allegedly ""earn"" us, any at all, in place of the usual baseless prattle that is presented here.

&gt;I think the real answer is we have no idea whatsoever, at least until some in depth inquiry which has the power to really delve into the matter takes place. 

We have a pretty good idea, based on the enormous amount that they cost us every single year, year in year out, but I wouldn't object to an inquiry, either.

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Warnock

--------------Green

Norris------------------Murphy

--------------White

---McCormack---Varney

Our defence is going to be woeful this season (Lees seems to be the only player capable of marking efficiently, from what I've seen) but any changes will weaken it until Byram returns or we bring in someone else.

For midfield, I've gone with a diamond. I think that Eddie Gray is entirely right when he says that we can't go with a wide 4-4-2 because we don't have the wide players to make it work and the centre will get overrun. We need to make it difficult for teams to play against us, so we'll pack the midfield.

Norris is the best alternative to Austin on the right; Tonge is way too slow, with the turning circle of a speedboat. Murphy is on the left purely to accommodate him, as there is no where else to include him. I think that McCormack is best up front (although he can drop back if necessary), so I've started him there while White has looked better in the middle than on the wing, as he won't be simply marked out of the game. Varney has looked better at doing Hunt's job than our Noel, in my opinion, and I just can't see him being dropped.

That's how I would go about it. However, I'm pretty sure that Norris won't feature and I can't see McDermott leaving Hunt on the bench. Eddie seemed to think that Varney might start on the left (which would mean Murphy on the right), which would be interesting to see but I'm not entirely convinced. In which case, Hunt would be up front - probably with Smith while McCormack would be in the hole.

Hopefully we can get something out of the game, but I have to say that the team is much weaker with Byram and Diouf injured and Austin suspended.",0,1374948353,null,0,false,0,cbbhedm,t3_1j615d,t1_cbbhedm,t3_1j615d,null,1430311292,5,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,5

I am, and I do. There's no need to become derogatory. I was pointing out, again, that you can be tracked by multiple methods. Just because you cannot fathom them, does not mean it cannot be done.

&gt;Guess again. It makes me minimise the likelyhood of being identified when using them.
	
Oh, so you're an online anonymous anomaly that they would have trouble pin-pointing and profiling?

&gt;The difference between this and other forms of commication that they may be spying on, is that this provides easy to manage evidence of political views linked direct to me. Discussions on forums are linked to my IP, which is an unreliable way of indentifying people, but more importantly they require a massive amount of parsing to detect political views. An algorithm would need to be incredible intelligent to shift though every word linked to an IP and determine political views from it. On the epetitions site, they can merely categorise each petition with a trait, then everyone that signs it gets that trait on their profile. It makes collecting data computationally easy.

I don't think ""easy to manage"" is something they would scope in. Discussions on forums are not just linked to your IP, they are linked to your username (and email address usually - most sites are not like 4chan). A massive amount of parsing to detect political views? I don't think so, keywords and regex can be refined very easily. Tagging epetitions with a trait is obviously very easy, and also just as easy to evade by signing non-popular conservative petitions as well (if the former is a left view), therefore it is better to assume they have more sophisticated methods.

This all comes back to your view on that 1 website profiling people. I think this discussion has provided a better profile of you and your views than signing that epetition ever could.

So Moyes is more familiar with Man U culture than Pellegrini is with City. Secondly, it will take time for City's new players to gel. New squad members, especially ones that are coming from other leagues, will need time to adjust to the league and integrate with the veteran City players. Lastly, Man U won the title last year and City is coming off of a struggling season. Will Nasri, Silva, and Aguero play at the caliber that they are capable of? At least United have the constant that is Van Persie, assuming he stays healthy. 

I think people that are rating City so high are looking strictly at their team on paper .. and I just can't see City winning the league with a new manager/philosophy and as many new players as they have acquired. The title will be between United and Chelsea IMO.

My friend and I had a quick chat with Sama, we just told him that he played really well (he was fucking boss) as he signed some autographs.

Look at the competition around us. Why are the owners trying to do this on the cheap. It won't work.

Too many people buying into a carefully managed media performance.

Fsg want a return on the club. They don't give a fuck about football. They are american baseball people.

When was j.henry last at anfield?

At least man city's arab owners regularly attend games and seem to have a genuine interest in the club they bought, will also staying out of the media. 

People need to look behinf the easy lip service in the media from Liverpool's owners.

Liverpool fc are one of the biggest clubs in the world. FSG can't or won't invest enough to get us to our historical position.

So what you're saying is La Liga is not competitive because Real and Barca have better financial backing and can abuse that leverage.  And that's different from what I originally said... how?  Because the money doesn't come directly from a wealthy owner (and instead through ""tv money"" as you allege)?  Real particularly amassed most of their money at a time when they were in significant debt with good business deals from the sale of property/land, including with the city of Madrid, and had been criticized for focusing on capitalizing off the brand ""Real Madrid"" rather than focusing on the team's performance (particularly during the ""Los Galacticos"" era).  But hey, they were always in Champions League, so no one who complained back then should've cared!

Your entire third ""paragraph"" only serves to highlight the fact that at this point, you think it's impossible for Liverpool to win trophies without ridiculous finances at their disposal similar to City and Chelsea.  So no matter what players we bring in and how well coached they are, we'll never be competitive because FSG isn't capable (or willing) of losing millions of dollars on a regular basis and thus manage their finances more responsibly.  That says more about you than me.  I'm not on any ""soapbox"" as I'm not calling for a change to the new ""standard"" (not that I'm the only one who disapproves of such spending to begin with).  I just don't want to see a team that I love compromise its integrity for the sake of chasing trophies that aren't guaranteed to come just because some rich owner has money to blow.

I refused to use a service which required a paid subscription. I am told those are often better (as the users are more serious, having invested their own income and all). So, the following anecdotes are related to OK Cupid, a free service I used. Depending on what site you use, YMMV.

I met a girl, who after one date, texted me that she wanted to be a ""Good little girl and please your cock,"" which was far and away not something I was into, but hey, I guess I could've been laid.

Plenty of people want to message online but will never have time to meet in person. I suppose some of these are the 'catfish' types, others are probably just nervous. I won't message anyone more than a week if they refuse to meet. I'm not looking for a friend by correspondence.

And then the usual problems: people who post 10 year old photos of themselves, people who are married but list themselves as single, people who are looking for sex and carrying several strains of interesting venereal diseases...

Anyways, of the ones I have met, I have had terrible luck. Either they turn out to have their lives and minds in some significant disarray that I'm not prepared to jump into, or they for one reason or the other are disinclined to see me a second or third time.

In a perfect world we would buy a proven striker and a young guy who can act as an understudy, unfortunately we can't afford both so we have gone for the proven striker.

Poleon was used heavily because he's our only ""winger"" (I quote that, because he'd probably say he was a striker forced to play wide).  

We kept mis-hitting passes, over-hitting balls and making our own players chase simple passes - which always makes things more difficult.

Nurnberg were, by comparison, much smarter with their possession.  Much tighter and with better distribution.  

Brian was very assertive in the post-match interview that he knew for certain what his starting 11 and full 18 would be next weekend for Brighton, so I guess he saw what he needed to.

I see Sterling and Borini as potential gamechangers.  Sterling for his pace and Borini for his being the only out-and-out striker in our side whose natural talents are forward movement and finishing.

Stabilizing players would be Kelly and Hendo.  Kelly is a much more reliable defensive right back than Johnson, and can come in to shore up the back line if we are nursing a slender lead.  Hendo (or Alberto, I think) can be subbed into one of the three attacking midfield positions to offer more discipline and outlet play, to replace one of the three starters who are more creative, free-flowing players.

You bring up a really good point about hidden internet that exposes the government and enforcement agencies lack of relevant legislation and lack of desire to do anything that may actually tackle the issue. That's a different argument though.

You are also correct that what should be filtered is also already illegal. This is much like many drugs being illegal but the borders agency still stop getting their hands on them before they get done for possession.

To be honest though, I'd be grasping at straws to come up with a good reason for an enforced filter for legal content. The closest comparison I can come up with is that it's a bit like the watershed on TV but in this age any solution, ala configuring filtering on your router would be better than signing a porn register.

Damn, admitting defeat on an internet debate!

Well, it is *foot*ball.

&gt;Isn't a great passer, average vision.

Isn't a bad passer either. And that's not really of huge importance for an attacking wide player. We don't complain about Borini, Ibe, Sterling, Sturridge or Downing's passing, and Ben Arfa is on a similar level to all of those in terms of passing.

And I'd disagree entirely with ""average vision."" I've seen him pick out some great passes over the years.

&gt;Makes his name on long winding runs or shots from outside the box. 

This is correct. And if he was playing as a wide player it's exactly what you'd expect. Running with the ball at his feet he's one of the best in the league. Defenders are scared of him. He's a match winner. He's capable of pulling something fantastic out of nowhere.
 
&gt;isn't the player we need.

I don't understand this. We definitely need an upgrade on Downing. If Suarez stays, him and Coutinho will fill out the two other attacking positions, leaving one left. I can understand you worrying about his injuries but to say he's not a decent player doesn't make sense. He's certainly better than Downing.

If you're into coffee there's the Edinburgh Coffee Jam once a month. It's for coffee geeks (whether they work in the coffee industry or not) to get together and have some random coffee related fun. Happens once a month, check the Edinburgh Coffee Jam facebook page fir event updates.

Similarly there are beer / wine tasting events around the city. Great Grog (facebook page and website) is a good place to start for this. There's also an Edinburgh rum tasting club, check that phrase in fb to find their page.

Lastly, October/November is Enchanted Forest season. Google for Enchanted Forest Pitlochry - it's a bit outside town, but not too far. Tickets are available in advance now and it looks awesome (haven't been myself but fully intend to next year, will be unable to this year).

Real got huge sums of money of the government for there training grounds etc because they are backed as almost a spanish national team competing with the basque barca.

Hardly shrewd business deals.

I don't think we can make it back into the CL without large investment. In the first team. Neither does Stevie G or obviously Suarez, torres, mascherano or alonso. 

You obviously understand the game much better than they.

You don't have an argument, just piecemeal parts of one.

On this side of the water many would agree with me.

The game has evolved like it or not.

I don't want to see my team left behind, as we currently are.

Maybe you do.

As a true red I would never say your last comment to another LFC supporter, nomatter there opinions.

Truely classless

Edit : the spread of wealthy owners increasing the EPL can only be a good thing for the league.

Barca and Real get the huge majority of tv money ( limited to 2 clubs! )

&gt; [...] *owner of Beaufort House where the pupils stayed, said: ‘We ask school parties to keep fizzy drinks, sweets and chocolate in the downstairs areas and only allow bottled water in bedrooms.*
&gt;*If we get a bad review because there are sticky marks in the rooms, we lose business.’* //

So basically the story is they agreed a contract that unwanted behaviour - such as breaking the accommodation's rules - would cause the child's parents to be called to collect their child.

The hotel enforced a policy of no food in rooms, this was it seems made clear to everyone as part of the signed charter (see below). The girl broke the accommodation's rules on food in rooms and so the policy agreed was acted on.

IMO this is the correct course of action [given this report to be factual]. You can't maintain discipline by stating the consequences of unwanted actions but then failing to follow through. 

Moreover in these sorts of situations if the school wish to continue using the venue they have to be hard-line on specific behaviour the venue demands of them.

The Mail mentions removing a suitcase lining, not ripping out a suitcase lining, suitcases sometimes have lining that can be removed and replaced without any damage (for structural support or to enable cleaning). 

The [Telegraph mention in passing](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10191979/Malala-Yousafzai-is-tougher-than-anyone-in-The-Apprentice.html) that:

&gt;*This outrage* [the midnight feast breaching hotel rules] *(added to “misbehaviour” on the beach) led the school to call Holli’s mother to make the 160-mile round journey to take her home.* //

So there is certainly a part of the story not being fully reported, that this was an extra infraction of the rules. This suggests leniency was used but was met with continued [albeit perhaps quite minor on behalf of the pupils] disobedience.

The [Express](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/416112/Choc-girl-kicked-off-class-trip) has no useful info and appears to be the worst report of all of these. The Mirror adds some information:

&gt;*""The rule about not eating in the rooms is a guest house rule and is clearly stated on the charter all pupils signed.”* //

I suspect the mother sent the poor girl with chocolate in her bag. It seems the most likely explanation.

However ...

&gt;""they opened and read a letter home""

This is absolutely unacceptable - if true and not authorised by the parents - that they should open a sealed letter addressed to someone else.

Causatively associating crime with drugs ignores other factors such as personality, living circumstances, family and associates, for example.

The attribution that drugs must be illegalized so that uncommitted crimes may be prevented is as fatuous as preventively incarcerating black people because proportionately they commit more crime than white people:

Race|Population Percentage|Percentage of specified race in prison population|Proportional difference between specified racial population and expected prison population

A drug's legal status is not a good indicator of [its harm to others](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm): alcohol is by far the most socially damaging drug and magic mushrooms are not linked to any social harm, yet one is [punishable by up to 7 years](http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/magic-mushrooms) imprisonment and the other freely available.

Once someone oversteps the mark and commits property or violent crime, by all means throw the book at them, but to assert that a drug must be illegalized so that future uncommited crimes may be prevented is absurd. Most drug users are not criminals: [3 million Britons consume illegal drugs in a year](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/sep/28/drug-use-age-popular-cannabis), and only a small percentage of those commit burglary or theft to fund their habit. The actual figures are unknown, but [approximately 50%](http://www.tdpf.org.uk/MediaNews_FactResearchGuide_prisons.htm) of property-crime is anecdotically attributable to sourcing income to fund a drug habit:

* ""*Almost half of arrestees (46%) who reported using drugs in the last 12 months believed that their drug use and crime were connected. The most frequent connection cited was the need for money to buy drugs.*""

Some illegal drugs such as cannabis are not even associated with property or violent crime: the Lambeth cannabis depenalization test resulted in ""[significant reductions in five non-drug crime types](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpimr/research/depenalization.pdf)"", owing to the police being able to focus their efforts on actual victim crime.

Stigmatizing every drug user as a potential criminal, and imprisoning them because of that assertion, makes a mockery of civil liberties and is [logically fallacious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent).

Criminalizing drug addicts is also [anti-scientific and anti-medical](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9822091/People-who-take-illegal-drugs-shouldnt-be-treated-as-criminals.html): drug addiction is evidentially treatable medically - and not criminally, which [increases the number of drug addicts](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0001.htm#13070275000006) -

true,Tetzel,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt; A women who's main literary achievement is writing a novel about how important it is to find a rich man and marry him.

Er, that's really not what it's about. Her novels were satire on the sentimental novels of the 18th century. The first line of P&amp;P is:

&gt;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

This opening line sets up the satire of the whole novel, where characters like Mrs Bennett are attacked and, well, ridiculed, for their notions of marrying for economic security. Mrs Bennet is mad on Mr Collins, but Elizabeth rejects him (if she married him it would save her father's property) and instead ops for Darcy, but that's only after he goes above and beyond to show how much he loves her (don't forget that she rejects his marriage proposal once.) In the end she overcomes her prejudice about him (he's an arsehole because of the lending money rumour thing) and he overcomes his pride (his arrogance that he puts on turns everyone off him, but it actually covers up his niceness and in the end he swallows his pride and drops the charade.) The whole point of the novel isn't 'find a rich man and marry him', and if you read it and really took that from the novel I suggest re-reading it with the fact that it's satire in-mind.


Also, she's one of the countries most celebrated authors, and has shaped the face of fiction in immeasurable ways. She's one of the most popular authors in English Literature history. Why would a characters actions in one of her books diminish her achievements in the world? Even if the boo was just straight up 'get married to rich blokes,' it's a contested position because of the 'death of the author' and all that.

&gt;Give a heroin addict free access to his required drugs and he won't commit as many crimes^[1] 

But not as little as someone clean- the study compares people being treated with people not being treated, and didn't include a control. 

And, like the article says, this is at the taxpayer's expense and you could call it extortion- Why should everyone else be forced to pay for your drug habit, in order to stop you from committing crime against them? why not just not take the drug in the first place?

&gt;Causatively associating crime with drugs ignores other factors such as personality, living circumstances, family and associates, for example.

I don't think it's necessary to prove a causal link between having to have an income when unemployed and unable to think straight, and propensity to commit crime. It's pretty self evident that even if the drug in itself doesn't affect your willingness to steal, the cash flow you need for the habit will do.

&gt;A drug's legal status is not a good indicator of its harm to others

Nope, which is why I said some should probably be legal and some probably shouldn't. Heroin would be the latter though imo

&gt; 3 million Britons consume illegal drugs in a year...   
The actual figures are unknown, but approximately 50%[9] of property-crime is anecdotically attributable to sourcing income to fund a drug habit:

But 0% of people who don't have a habit are committing crime to fund theirs- unless there are numbers on how often addicts commit crimes compared to non-addicts that doesn't mean much. If you took it to the extreme and said that the 50% of crime that was committed to fund the habit wouldn't have happened otherwise, and the rest of the crime is happening at the same rate as it does for people who are clean, you could say that addiction on average doubles the chance you commit crime.

&gt;Some illegal drugs such as cannabis are not even associated with property or violent crime:

Again, some should be legal and some shouldn't. 

&gt;Stigmatizing every drug user as a potential criminal, and imprisoning them because of that assertion, makes a mockery of civil liberties and is logically fallacious[

Eh, maybe. Yet again there are some drugs that I think should probably be legalised, but on the other hand there are some where it's impossible to claim there's no link to crime.

&gt;Criminalizing drug addicts is also anti-scientific and anti-medical: drug addiction is evidentially treatable medically - and not criminally, which does not solve the addiction rates as sharply as medical interventions.

Yup, and I fully support making it possible for addicts to get treatment without any personal cost or punishment, no matter what they're on. Doesn't mean I think the drugs should be legal in the first place though.

- Man United won't ""fail"" but will not retain the title, this will be a bit of a transition year. They still haven't signed anyone who will remotely improve them. I can see them finishing anywhere from 2nd-4th (depending on our and city's form).

- I know we say this most years...but this transfer window so far at least, has really given me hope that this is our year over Arsenal.

Political alignment doesn't seem to make much difference to the opinions but you can see that yourself in the full results. 


Breaking it down into countries there were 35 responses from Australia, 40 from Canada, 149 from the UK (123 England, 19 Scotland, 5 Wales, 2 NI), 3 from other Commonwealth Realms and 122 from Non-Commonwealth countries. 


**[Should the Monarchy be abolished after Queen Elizabeth II's reign has ended?](http://i.imgur.com/FGmJnP5.png)**

No country seems especially for abolishing the Monarchy, except other Commonwealth realms, but really there's not enough response to draw any conclusion. Australia is from these results much more divided on the issue than other countries. 

[**Would you prefer Prince Charles forgo becoming King in favour of Prince William?**](http://i.imgur.com/fauXFi4.png)

Most countries have a majority supporting Charles becoming King, though New Zealand is a bit more divided. 

[**How do you rate the Monarchy?**](http://i.imgur.com/XorRg6t.png)

Again, Australia is split pretty evenly between favourably and unfavourably whilst most other countries tend to think favourably of the Monarchy or neutral.

 Why they don't have a PC on every desk, and some sort of tablet or e-reader for every child instead of out of date textbooks you have to share between you is beyond me, a school only needs to buy 3 copies of a text book and they can share it between 30 students and in the case of a lot of the classics they are free anyway.  

Civil service offices manage all this well enough, I don't see why schools should be any different. *Christ* having a basic word processing program on a £100 PC and the ability for the whole class to send the work right to the teacher's PC and to store it on a usb drive has been doable for donkey's years at this point and yet many schools have failed to implement even this.  

Back when I was in school in the early 90s we were always given the line ""you won't carry a calculator with you every where you go"" which would have been true enough in the 80s but even by the 90s our casio watches had calculators in them.  At this point if all the technology fails we won't all need to know how to do complicated maths by hand, we will need to know survival skills and it's perfectly obvious to everyone but the department of education that computers are not some sort of fad.

However, Bale has said nothing about anything. He seems happy at the club, his girl seems to be happy out in Cardiff, he seems to have very good management around him and surrounding him (to note it is widely accepted that his management team is actually very close to Levy and ENIC), and he recently became one of the faces of BT Sport and Under Armour (fair amount of speculation that UA would potentially be involved in providing funds to help provide his proposed raise), the team is improving and he is playing in one of the biggest cities on the planet in arguably the biggest league in the world. There is a great deal for him to stay with us, and i hope he does.  But he hasn't come out and said anything one way or another.  We aren't privy to what is being said behind the scenes, maybe he does want to go, maybe he doesn't.

I just want resolution. If he wants to stay, fantastic lets make the run at the top of the table.  If he wants to go, well shit that sucks, but lets take the opportunity to redefine the ""special relationship"" with Real, take the massive amount of money and hold them to sell us players at non-premium pricing. Stack up the team and run with it.

I love Bale, and wouldn't want to see him go...but i love Spurs more, no one is bigger than the club.  Settle it one way or another and lets hit the ground running.

That said, if Real did make a bid of €100m and we turned it down flat and they are still throwing up offers, then they are a hell of alot more desperate to make this deal happen than us.  By turning down €100m and all the media attention that is drawn to that, what it effectively does is raise the price on Bale. 

That is an amazing thought, we may have actually increased the price on a player who had a record setting transfer offer made for him by turning it down and having Real run to the press with the story.

If that is actually the case, well shit...Start with Di Maria and Coentrao (with assurances from their people that they would sign) and then we can negotiate on the price because according to the current lay of the land Bale is poised to be the first £100m player and we don't value Di Maria and Coentrao at the same level as you.

But this story is bullshit so it is all for nothing, time to move on.

Chelsea and City will still likely get the top two spots, but Chelsea's midfield hasn't been much improved and just doesn't have the strong CM group Mourinho sides are typically built on. They don't have so many new faces to integrate which will give them some advantage, but I think City just edge them for the title with Aguero and Silva reinvigorated by Pellegrini and Jovetic beasting his debut season. Milner will be among their best players, surprising some by regularly keeping new signing Fernandinho out of the side, but Navas will be a bit of a disappointment.

If we keep Bale we take third from Arsenal but it'll be tight, and neither of us will be too far back on second as the league is won by a record low point total.

United suffer a poor start, struggling to make the top half of the table after eight games, and never quite recover despite a good run around the new year, eventually getting pushed close for fifth spot by Swansea and Liverpool.

Bonus points:  
City and United make the CL quarters, saving Moyes' job for a season, Chelsea make the semis, Arsenal out in the group stage.

Unfortunately, as hard as it is to say this, people often have a knee jerk reaction and call for stupid shit. There's already things in place to stop people obtaining items like this and others but it's basically individual choice whether you take a substance or not. More education is the only other thing I'd suggest and maybe stricter penalties for shop owners who sell stuff like this to underage people.

Apart from what I mentioned, anything else is going too far like a total ban and it effects the vast majority of people who use it normally like me, who use it to fill up lighters.

true,pandanomic,num23,,"* Chelsea doesn't win the league. I honestly don't consider Mourinho that good of a coach, for the sole reason that he's not self-disciplined, and in turn it shows in his squad's discipline. He just copies what he learned from van Gaal (which works very well), but when things go south (bad morale, injuries, etc), he isn't that good at managing it. A good way to think about it would be that he does well with good players, but I think if you put him with QPR last season, he wouldn't have faired any better than 'Arry. 
* Spurs get top 3 as long as we don't lose more than 1 of our starting midfielders (dembele, paulinho, sandro) to injury at a given time. Top 2 if everyone stays healthy + luck
* City gets 3rd or 4th, they haven't been a *team* since 2012
* Liverpool gets top 5, top 4 if they keep Suarez and get a winger
* Man U gets top 3
* If arsenal doesn't sign a better striker than Giroud, they miss top 4 and Liverpool finish above them
* Swansea is a bit dark horse. Bony is a monster, but it will be interesting to see how he transitions to the premier league. If he continues his form from last season, I could see them pulling an Everton and knock on the door of the top teams.
* Winner of the league comes down to two sets of teams. On one half, you have teams like Man U, City, and Chelsea, that are with new managers and new players. If their managers can keep morale up and keep their teams cohesive, it'll be quite the dogfight with the kind of talent they have on the pitch and bench.
* On the other side, you have teams like Liverpool, spurs, and arsenal, that have formidable starting 11's and great returning managers, but not very much depth at key positions. Their success is dependent on minimizing injuries and mitigating the damage when they do happen.

When it comes down to it, if I compared every team's best starting 11 on their best day, this is my top 7:

* Chelsea (CSKA London has too much talent)
* Tottenham (assuming Soldado is for sure)
* Man City (lots of talent, but they don't have enough cohesion)
* Man U (Fergy was amazing at bringing out the best in his players, I just don't see Moyes matching that level with the current squad)
* Arsenal (Firepower is a north london issue. Spurs have solved it, Arsenal's still sitting on their war chest for now)
* Liverpool (Sturridge/Suarez/Coutinho is exciting, but a weak defensive midfield and defense costs them possession against top-table teams)
* Swansea (On the rise, but really need a creative AM)

Arsenal have to be the most concerned at this stage of the transfer season. Every other team is coming back with equal or better squads, but they haven't done anything yet except sign that young kid.",0,1374989837,null,0,1374990155,0,cbbtp88,t3_1j6ufw,t1_cbbtp88,t3_1j6ufw,null,1430267827,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,cstross,null,null,"Free university education -- and it *was* free, in my day, in the 1980s -- but with a limited number of places and a high barrier to entry. A lot of state comprehensive schools didn't offer A levels, or even the O levels required as preparation for A levels, which were the gateway to a degree level education. Kids sent to them had no role models, mentoring, or career guidance that would put them on course for an essentially middle-class education: the proportion going on to higher ed was vanishingly small, and one side-effect of this was an us-vs-them cultural divide between the students and their (university educated, middle class) teachers. 

Another factor is that educational credentials weren't required for many jobs in the way that they are today -- not until the late 1970s ended the ""job for life"" tradition and working apprenticeships vanished down the plug-hole (transferring responsibility for vocational education from the private sector to the state sector).

Shocking though this might sound to 21st century ears, *a piece of paper saying you have a degree doesn't actually mean that you're suited to a job*. Go back to the late 19th and early 20th century and such engineering giants as Sir Nigel Gresley or Sir Sidney Camm (go look them up) left school at 16 and started out as draughtsmen.

(The credentialism exemplified by the insistence that everyone gets a piece of paper to ""prove"" that they've got an education goes hand-in-glove with the social mechanisation and lack of trust that Pilger was complaining about in that article. But that's another rant ...)

And the biggest factor of all was social tradition -- the working class contempt for those seen as getting ""above themselves"".

There are many documentaries that cover the same ground. By no means is that film the be all and end all. But the idea is that drugs are the biggest economy going in the poor neighbourhoods where they are rife, and when you've not nothing to lose (or when jail is a better reality than your day to day life) then you're going to get involved in the only thing that makes economic sense to you.

Drugs aren't the problem. Drugs are the symptom of something that runs a lot deeper (inequality, poverty, racism). And the current system makes criminals out of people who don't WANT to be criminals but can't find a viable alternative to sustain themselves.",0,1375003839,null,0,false,0,cbbvwj4,t3_1j5khg,t1_cbbvwj4,t1_cbblhxm,null,1430266800,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt;why not just not take the drug in the first place?

I love how you want to criminalize perfectly innocent people *before* they even decide to cause harm

&gt;I don't think it's necessary to prove a causal link between having to have an income when unemployed and unable to think straight, and propensity to commit crime. It's pretty self evident that even if the drug in itself doesn't affect your willingness to steal, the cash flow you need for the habit will do.

not everyone who needs money is going to steal, it's pretty self evident that you have never encountered a drug user, the lions share of them are harmless and have a moral compass

&gt;But 0% of people who don't have a habit are committing crime to fund theirs- unless there are numbers on how often addicts commit crimes compared to non-addicts that doesn't mean much. If you took it to the extreme and said that the 50% of crime that was committed to fund the habit wouldn't have happened otherwise, and the rest of the crime is happening at the same rate as it does for people who are clean, you could say that addiction on average doubles the chance you commit crime.

you could say that, but the term ""anecdotically"" usually means they have just decided it was the drugs, with no actual proof of it, same as you are doing now. The actual figures are unknown, that means we dont know how many crimes drugs actually affect.

&gt;Eh, maybe. Yet again there are some drugs that I think should probably be legalised, but on the other hand there are some where it's impossible to claim there's no link to crime.

even if there is a link to crime, shouldnt we be punishing the criminal, and not people with a higher chance of commiting the crime? otherwise we need to lock up anyone from a lower socio-economic background",0,1375003840,null,0,false,0,cbbvwjb,t3_1j5khg,t1_cbbvwjb,t1_cbbob3s,null,1430266799,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,tjuk,eng-somerset,Somerset,"The media is a mess with info about this policy and the reporting of it seems conflicted and confused. I find the principal of this policy incredibly concerning so I wrote to my Don Foster who is my local MP. He has been a senior Liberal Democrat for a good long while so my assumption is that he would have at least some idea of what these proposals would actually entail. 

His full response is below. Mostly waffle but what I found interesting is that a pre-selected opt in will **only apply to households with children in** (how the hell they intend to implement this I am not sure - what happens if you have filters off and 9 months later have a baby - do you get a congratulations on the birth of your child would you like us to block porn now letter?). 

From what I understand about how talk talk implemented it is opt in for existing accounts (i.e. if you signed up to talktalk a year ago it is off unless you ring them up and ask for it to put on) but if you are setting setting up a new account it will prompt you during the signup (i.e. when the internet is installed and you log on for the first time?) 

&gt; It is obvious that as a Government we must try and take action to make the internet a safer environment. I accept this will be a hard task due to immense nature of the internet and it is definitely not a task about invading people’s privacy.
 
&gt; The issue is that there are people who use the internet as an instrument for distribution of images that are not suitable for children or, even worse, involve children. This is what action needs to be taken against and that is what the Coalition Government is going to do.
 
&gt; Regarding the former, the Liberal Democrats believe that the internet has been a tremendous force for good in society, and we will always fight to maintain the free, open internet that is fundamental to a democratic society.  Adults are entitled to watch whatever legal material they want, without government interference.
 
&gt; However, there is a serious problem with young children accessing material that is meant for adults.  This can be distressing for children, and parents rightly want help to keep their children safe.
 
&gt; **That’s why the coalition is determined that all internet users should be required to decide whether they want adult filters turned on or off.  *In households with children*, the option to use filters will be pre-selected and parents will be directed to support and advice on internet safety.**
 
&gt; We are not asking internet providers to install network level filters of legal material, which have been rejected by our independent child safety experts and parents alike.
 
&gt; Regarding the latter, child abuse is a sickening crime, and the coalition government will do all it can to clamp down on the illegal distribution of vile images.
&gt; We are bringing agencies together to work more closely with the police, introducing a single database of illegal child abuse images, and putting pressure on industry to redouble their efforts too.
 
&gt; Thank you again for contacting me. I appreciate you taking the time and effort to inform me of your concerns.

I'll rephrase that: If you can show a causal link between *any and all* classified drugs, and halving your propensity to commit crime, I'll believe you. Otherwise there's no reason to believe around twice as much crime is committed by addicts. 

&gt;even if there is a link to crime, shouldnt we be punishing the criminal, and not people with a higher chance of commiting the crime? 

The legal system isn't perfect and we can't catch and sentence every criminal in the country- putting yourself at a 100% increased risk of being criminal, by personal choice, is a good indicator you're at increased risk of being a criminal.

&gt;otherwise we need to lock up anyone from a lower socio-economic background

Yeah no.there are too many of them, they aren't literally twice as likely to commit crime as the middle class, and they aren't deliberately choosing to be poor.

Prior to the internet, there was a great deal of censorship. For example, up until the mid 1990's it was difficult to access pornography in the UK that showed erections or penetration. Mock rape for sexual entertainment was very tightly censored and many top shelf magazines even airbrushed out ladies' bum holes. So, really it's just rewinding the clock to a previous position that conservative (small c) members of society are comfortable with (traditional values etc).

Self harm websites have long been on a list for potential censorship. That was expected if any move was made in this direction.

As for web forums, that's more directed at P2P types that exchange porn files or share advice and tips about self harming. What has completely failed to grab anyone's attention is that it's also a secretive approach on copyright abuse. 

Alcohol and smoking will go the same way as the minimum pricing and plain packaging farces. What a laugh that was but a waste of good taxpayer money, let's remember.

Esoteric material is just to keep things open, also hoover up things that don't match today's criteria but may be necessary in future years. What novel kinky things may arise in the future, eh? My goodness. But sadly it's probably nothing to do with sexual peccadilloes that might seem indulgent today but horrific tomorrow, and more about fissile material discussions hidden in the comments section of some obscure gardening/farming website.

GCHQ don't care that much. We really are more interested in catching criminals, spies, smugglers, terrorists etc and appropriating industrial/commercial and diplomatic secrets in order to maintain and enhance Britain's domestic and foreign interests and security. What you jerk off to is not our remit - that's a job for the police. 

Of course, if the police were to want that info all they have to do is click a few buttons and it's done. We're quite tightly connected these days, you see. But they're a lot more interested in 'giving the suspect a beating' for want of a phrase.

**In summary** - we've been hoovering up web traffic since the web began. The fact that this has recently come to light and the current government has announced these new policies is purely coincidental.

Maybe. It's all speculation, really. That's why we're not analysts.

Any drilling operation would involve risks of water contamination, air pollution, and toxic spills. Most of the time, these risks wouldn't be adequately covered in the planning application required to undertake such an operation, since the ecological value of a healthy environment is under-represented in planning law. Which is why you so often see local protests against planned development, especially in areas of natural beauty or significant ecological importance.

In a wider context, fracking is a symptom of how we are resorting to ever more extreme methods of energy extraction, having exhausted the easier to extract energy sources available to us. New methods of unconventional fossil fuel extraction, of which fracking is just one, carry higher risks than conventional methods, and have lower energy returns. They reinforce the unsustainable energy consumption of our present system, increasing the chances of a future energy crunch, when whats needed are solutions that address the underlying assumptions of growth that our societies are built on.

The protests have two key objectives - to raise awareness of the opposition to these practices in order to influence future decisions concerning energy policy, and to increase the economic costs of fracking so that the companies and investors involved consider switching to less damaging sources of energy.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; why should 'trolls' be allowed to tweet what they like?

Ok, I'm probably going to get shit for this.. but here's my stance. Trolls are like a self-righting mechanism of the internet. People generally don't understand just how *uncontrollable* the internet is, they just use the superficial mainstream front end that has been gussied up over the years to make them feel safe. 

The reality is that it's all a charade. Ticking '*friends only*' when you upload your pictures to Facebook doesn't do shit, computers were built to duplicate data and there is absolutely nothing you can do that will stop someone just downloading the image and sharing it somewhere. **You have no control**. 

What this leads to is a very large group of people who have no idea how open they are online, people who believe it's an extension of public society, people who think that somehow their idea of politeness and proper etiquette can be in anyway enforced upon the lawless digital wild west. It can't.

*Trolls* are a reaction to that group, trolls are people who find it amusing that you take the internet seriously. They deliberately contradict your idea of politeness because you allow them to, and you show them it bothers you. Trolls are people who understand that there are no rules and that you shouldn't give one single iota of a shit about what the anonymous internet says about anything. Just turn the fucking thing off, go to another website, don't pour your life out onto the greatest ever information sharing technology we've ever invented.

They are also opportunists, if you leave a comment box out in the open they *will* shit in it. Because they can, because you clearly don't care about protecting it and most importantly.. because you need to learn that the internet will not be nice to you and it will not do what you ask it to and you have no way of *forcing* it to nor should you try. We've inadvertently created near absolute free speech, don't destroy that because sometimes that free speech is used to insult or offend you.

Are trolls cunts? Yes, absolutely.. they say horrible things to people but I would *much* rather have a bit of  easily ignorable text based abuse be the reason people take a moment to reconsider their outlook on how they use the internet instead of uploading deeply personal images with wild abandon and having them shared with **millions** of people across the world.

If you can't handle a few choice words from a few pricks over the internet you probably need to seriously re-evaluate what you think the internet is. Movie companies with hundreds of millions of dollars can't make a dent in people sharing whatever the fuck they want, you haven't got a snowballs chance in hell of stopping people seeing your nudes *unless you never upload them to the fucking internet to begin with*.",0,1375008628,null,0,1375009106,0,cbbwh6e,t3_1j7g3u,t1_cbbwh6e,t3_1j7g3u,null,1430266532,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Richer investers who could, would only have to get in a sprinkling of top quality players to make us a competitive squad again.

Don't see how that is mercenary in any way.

We have the history,  the trophies etc. Its not like being a bottom of the table team being propelled to europes elite.

Its not that FSG are bad owners.  I just don't think they want to invest the kind of money to get us back to the top.

I know many people who have this concern including people associated with the club.

I may be wrong. In fact I hope I am. I have my doubts though.

Also we weren't used to the conductor hand movements for 6/8 or anything. We got it together pretty quickly and it sounded great, but there was a while when there was a mix of people playing in slightly different rhythms because they didn't play 6/8 very often.

Personally I played saxophone (we didn't have many brass players so I played trumpet pieces for the orchestra and transpose as I went along) and most of the pieces I learned outside of orchestra were swing time so it always took me a while to get used to playing classical pieces or the rock pieces (our conductor liked to give us variation, we did a Mozart piece, the Doctor Who theme and Bohemian Rhapsody in one school recital once).

&gt; Cultural deprivation in London?

Why so incredulous? I seem to remember rioters targeting police not so long ago, but it's not just London. Elsewhere young Tyrone is encouraged to buy his social status, have a fast car, drink heavily at weekend, be a sport fanatic, grow up to be a footballer or pop-idol, perhaps just bang a pop-idol even though they have painted faces a clown could admire.

Of my immediate peer group growing up: 

1. Me: father worked double shifts to afford a semi-suburban home, stress made him violent, was estranged since 10 years old but there remained years of dealing with mental health issues still unresolved. Mother raised two kids on abusively low paid jobs, can't retire, can't live on her meager pension. I was different perhaps because I was sent to not the most local school but a catholic school some way off, then onto grammar school (I earned a scholarship), then university unsuccessfully. I wasn't active in my choices and just went ""with the flow"". At 30 I'm stuck with no assets and trying to build a career/life. If I'm lucky I might be able to start a family and have a home closer to 40 or never. I could sign-on but the thought of it is just depressing—only ever for a few weeks. I occasionally do cleaning work and accept charity, so I'm like five years NEET. I'm isolated and have no friends. It all seems an impossible task and I end up indulging on the internet. Recently found out that I may have suffered undiagnosed malnutrition or some auto-immune disease much of my life which has left me with arthritis. Only ""job experience"" is shelf stacking.
2. Direct neighbour 1: boy same age, smoked from an early age, regularly abused aerosols, drank heavily went onto harder things, fathered young. His parents drank heavily and I wouldn't be surprised if he suffered some sort of pre-natal alcohol poisoning, the clinical condition that makes babies more likely to grow up to be criminals and suffer addictions. He served jail time for using his car as a weapon. He's out but aspires to not very much, drinks, uses drugs. His mother died relatively early through cancer which took his father recently. He blew his inheritance before he'd even got it running up a 4k£ cocaine bill.
3. Direct neighbours 2/3/4: boy, girl, girl, similar ages: mother became an alcoholic, was unfaithful ran up thousands in credit card debt, leading to father being a single parent of three. Oldest girl I think became a teen mother or at least was pretty enough to be preyed on by older men, younger sister again early pregnancy and abusive partner has left her still suffering PTS a decade later and on anti-depressants. Boy became teen father at 17 GF as 16 (another neighbour)—parents disapproved (GF father actually chased me down the street swinging a hammer one night...), were homeless for a bit literally camping or sleeping in unused buildings. Got a house on a near council estate, their naivety was abused by local drug dealers. He took to heavy drinking and now is an alcoholic ten years later estranged from his kids.
4. Near neighbour 5/6: became a capitalist, relative success, early-ish pregnancy, now lives separated. His brother disliked England and tried his hand living in NZ.
5. Near neighbour 7/8: broken home, father alcoholic, single mother had two kids, son left to live with father, daughter to her credit I suppose avoided the teen pregnancy trap, works for the police, binge drinker at weekends, dissatisified with life. Not in contact with brother—at 30 he married a 45+ year old with multiple children.

You get the picture: no role models, no real aspirations, no real success stories, little cultural wealth beyond drinking and hanging out on streets. Little to get involved in accept mischief perhaps, living amongst the sterile suburban extreme beige-ism where no one gets to know or have a stake in their neighbour. It's all empty front gardens should you be lucky to have one, and tarmacked roads as play ground.",0,1375011074,null,0,1375011547,0,cbbwr7l,t3_1j6ft1,t1_cbbwr7l,t1_cbbwd5t,null,1430266402,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,veritanuda,null,null,"Do you mean how long would it take to develop a reactor in the same way that the original nuclear reactors in the UK came online? Well people often forget that he UK was at the forefront of  Nuclear innovation in the early 50's and [Rutherford laboratories]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_Appleton_Laboratory) were set up in response to this.

It is worth remembering that the [worlds first commercial nuclear reactor was build and designed here in the UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Hall_nuclear_power_station#Calder_Hall_nuclear_power_station)

In that sense it would not take long at all for the UK to actually develop a commercial reactor if some criteria are met. Namely political and public momentum and policies which invest the same subsidies in renewable actually go into proper research instead. 

We can't assume that we can replace current nuclear reactors  that currently supply about 19% of the UK's energy needs with LFTR type ones as there are huge differences in the technology that means it is not easy to do a 1 for 1 comparison.

For one thing LFTR's don't need to built close to bodies or water, as water is not used in the cooling process. They are also inherently cheaper to build because they do not need large containment buildings in the case of a coolant leak as they operate at normal atmospheric pressure. So that means they can be smaller and placed just about anywhere. 

You don't NEED a 250MWe reactor up in the wilds of Scotland when you can have 25 10Mwe ones ringing a city for the same cost.  

The momentum needs to overcome the incumbent nuclear industry which has no interest whatsoever in pursuing these new technologies as they completely undermine their current revenue stream. This is based on the costly and complicated fabrication of the solid fuel. This is not to be underestimated as the industry is worth billions and if you think that renewables had a hard time, remember that all renewables are not even on the same scale as nuclear because of their power density. To produce 1GW of power requires 50sq miles of desert to be buldozed for solar power or 100sq miles and 1000 windmills for wind power or 350,000,000
tons of coal or 200 tons of Uranium or 1 ton of Thorium in a LFTR.

I would love to think we could do this before the decade is out but I  could not say how quickly we could do that but my hope is that the more people who know there is alternatives the more momentum will be in favor of safer cheaper and revolutionary nuclear power.

The first step is just educating the public and politicians. I am trying to do my bit but it is slow going as people eyes glaze over when you start talking about 'nuclear'. ",0,1375013439,null,0,false,0,cbbx1ue,t3_1j5qw9,t1_cbbx1ue,t1_cbbwk3n,null,1430266264,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

There are fair and proper ways to do this. You either employ enough staff to cope with peak demand, and accept that sometimes they will be underworked. Or you have a core set of employees, and use agencies to meet peak demand - crucially, the agency are allocating work. These staff cost more per hour. Or you employ enough staff to cope with average demand, and *sometimes* offer a few hours overtime.

This has all been done to death by HMRC wrt contractors. If you have a regular contract with a single employer, and if they direct you as to what hours you work and how you do the job, you are an employee. And if you are regularly working 40 hours a week, you are a full time employee.

They can't just ""pretend"" you aren't really an employee if you get sick, or take a holiday, or the work dries up for a couple of weeks. Employment law is either faulty, or being blatantly ignored, either way it needs fixing.

true,yumineko,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"I think this is largely because of EU free movement. As an EU/EEA citizen, you don't need to say that you are visiting another member state to live or just for holiday. You could say you are visiting for holiday, and nothing stops you from staying longer. Also, there's no real accounting of people returning to the UK with right of abode.

Another factor is there is probably no real attempt to accurately gather the number of citizens and former residents emigrating from the UK. If the government gathered this information accurately (as well as incoming numbers), they would be able to say for more certainty that net migration is down. That is the number of people coming into the country to live (citizens who were previously expatriated, people exercising right of abode for the first time--for instance, children of citizens born abroad, EEA nationals, legal non-EEA immigrants, refugees) vs the numbers who previously lived here who are leaving (this includes illegal immigrants leaving, legal immigrants who are leaving and giving up residency, EEA nationals moving to another EEA country, and British citizens immigrating). 

If they can say that this is a low number, they score points. Problem is, this means they develop policies which make this country less attractive not only to the types of immigrants most people claim they would like to attract, but long term residents and British citizens themselves. An example of such a policy is the recent rule changes to the requirements to bring non-EEA spouses/partners into the country as a British citizen. If the HO is successful in overturning the recent ruling, this gives the current government a victory in this ""net-migration"" numbers game as citizens seek alternatives. This might be good for the Conservatives, but in the long run, it might not be the best for the country.

But the way this is being covered is giving people the idea that the average non-EEA legal immigrant is not being checked and accounted for when they come into the country. They are being checked, and there is a tally kept of them (you can get the numbers every year). What they are talking about is more of the less regulated movement of people. If you want to explain to the UK government what your plans are when you visit Majorca or Australia so that whoever is in power can score political points by tallying you as an expatriate when you leave for an extended period, then this should be of concern to you and you should support something being done about it.

Secondly, she wasn't just trying to get on with her life. She specifically signed up to a public platform to broadcast her opinion and in doing so, I believe, waives the right to only have well balanced and reasonable people respond.

I really like the way Lambert has added to the squad so far this summer, he's given the team a lot more depth, as well as giving some more options to vary tactics/ formations - which we know he likes to do. 

My guess is that he will predominantly stick with the 4-3-3 which worked so well towards the end of last season. Despite the fact the Lowton and Luna will be expected to do a lot of attacking, the beauty of the team last year was the willingness to work hard and track back - especially from the likes of Weimann and Agbonlahor. For my money, it was these guys that really made the formation work.

I am excited to see how some of the new guys (Tonev, Bacuna) and some of the younger guys (Gardner, Carruthers) will fit in to the team this year.

true,lbspredh,null,null,"&gt; intentionally putting yourself at risk of health problems(that the taxpayer will have to pay for) 

it's my body I dont see how it's any of your business. as for the taxpayer excuse healthcare isnt given out on a cost vs contribution basis, I have in occasion enjoyed drugs but at the same time I pay taxes and contribute more than I've taken out. by this logic we should not give healthcare to people on low incomes because they cost the taxpayer.

&gt;losing the mental ability to not commit crimes (that again, the taxpayer has to pay for) isn't selfish and qualifies as perfectly innocent.

again this fallacy that drugs and only drugs make people commit crimes and always make people commit crimes, crime is a choice, and people with socio economic issues are likely to commit crimes. people with socio economic issues are likely to take substances. I would draw the link between the issues and the crime before the drugs and the crime.

&gt;not everyone is not everyone

what? I know that sounded clever in your mind but what? and i think you missed the point drugs dont turn people into mindless crime machines a choice is made.

&gt;I'll rephrase that: If you can show a causal link between any and all classified drugs, and halving your propensity to commit crime, I'll believe you. Otherwise there's no reason to believe around twice as much crime is committed by addicts.

so you will stick to your ignorant assumptions until someone proves it otherwise, but wait you refuse to look at any evidence you are presented with. oh well I guess your baseless assumptions are correct then.

&gt;100% increased risk of being criminal

said no scientific evidence ever.

&gt;Yeah no.there are too many of them, they aren't literally twice as likely to commit crime as the middle class, and they aren't deliberately choosing to be poor.
Now you read into the fact I put the numbers problem first and tell me how evil that makes me

neither are drug addicts, except by anecdotal (or pretend) evidence
i dont dispute that you put the numbers first, only that the evidence the numbers are based on is spurious at best. and not evil, just wrong. theres a difference.

this is a big program that eats nearly 2GB of space and can be much larger if you need the additional voices etc to help a range of user. this just isnt done on an Ipad

you also cant plug in ANY of the adaptive control interface tools that are out there. we have easily 10 different types of adaptive keyboards and a good number of pointer control devices that just don't work with an Ipad.

if a touch interface is seen as some mecca for those with advisability's then i can get 22' touch screen PC for £450

which provide all the benefits of touch plus all the assistive programs, can have all the adaptive control equipment work with it and it can be mounted on an adjustable monitor arm so it complies with visual display regs which is actually more important for a person with bad eye sight or posture control.
this works with Ad too being windows

No, it's given on a cost vs QoL basis. If you overdose and put yourself at risk of death, the NHS *HAVE* to provide care for you. It doesn't matter if the money for it was taken from the budget of palliative care for terminal patients, or funding for A&amp;E staff, or whatever- now it goes to the addict, instead of the person who didn't put themself in that position. Pretending that being addicted isn't selfish is just childish, don't try.

If £100M gets spent on treating addicts that's £100M that can't go to a new CT scanner, or opening more wards, or paying off debt. Money doesn't appear out of thin air, if you think it does then that goes a long way to explain why you don't seem to think addiction is a cause of crime.

&gt;again this fallacy that drugs and only drugs make people commit crimes and always make people commit crimes, 

Yes, only drugs cause crime. 100% of crime is caused by drugs. That is my point here. 

I've already explained this to you once and iirc, you completely ignored the explanation rather than responding to it. Why would I bother again when you're bent on ignoring it?

&gt;and i think you missed the point drugs dont turn people into mindless crime machines a choice is made.

Are you telling me that no drugs have any effect on your mental state? it looks like you're telling me that. 

&gt;said no scientific evidence ever.

If you want to look at the discussion I was having before you interrupted, it's right there for you. Or would that be too much effort?

I guess you know pretty much nothing about it then? You can use it in a reactor, or as a neutron source, or for a host of other purposes. It's less stable than enriched uranium, but that doesn't mean you can't use it for non-violent purposes.

There were players like Sterling, Borini and Wisdom last year being relied upon in the first team, none of which were older than 21.  Now those players have that experience as well as other players around them, veteran players are healthy and returning to the team, and we've signed TWO experienced players (Aspas may not be familiar with the EPL, but he's also 26 and has played in La Liga).  I don't think Arsene Wenger was concerned about Santi Cazorla's first team experience when he was immediately thrust into the starting role.  How about Hazard?  Mata?  Were they given training wheels just because they're foreigners?  Veterans aren't necessarily veterans of the EPL.  Just older players with more first team experience at a professional level.

Last summer during preseason BR said that he was putting together a long term project and for fans not to expect immediate success - this was also the message from Tom Werner.  AVB said last summer in regards to Spurs that they didn't have the quality to compete for the title.  It isn't out of the question for a player or coach to be cavalier and blunt on the issue.  There also isn't a need for him to be so direct.

Check again, I'm arguing against legalization, not against treatment.  Treating existing addicts is fine with me, but making it fully legal to develop a dependency, then cost the NHS thousands for treatment, without at any point being responsible for your actions, isn't. Hard drugs aren't legal because if they were, they would cost us a lot more in terms of healthcare provision (at least in theory) and result in a lot more people getting messed up. 

&gt;But this is absurd, addicts do not choose their circumstance anymore than alcoholics choose to be alcoholics

Precisely why drugs shouldn't be legal. Why would removing the hurdles you need to jump to become addicted reduce the chance people become addicted? How would legalizing meth stop people who would otherwise take it from doing so?

&gt;Addiction should be treated like an disease, and you do not help sick people by forcing them into the shadows or through the courts but rather by removing the stigma around their problem so they'll more readily seek help.

Nor do you fight it by removing all the safeguards in place against them becoming addicted. 

&gt;create a stringent legal grey area that allows the highly restricted sale of various grey area drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine in small quantities.

Good luck finding a profit in that.

no in my experience it's only shady characters on the internet who seem to know a lot about weaponised plutonium, but the way you describe it sounds like it is fine if used *legally* in a stable and regulated environment, or better yet use the safe alternative to get the same effect.

&gt;Even if you did know the definitions, how do you figure that? how does some guy in a dark room somewhere watching a video directly hurt people in it?

demand leads to the creation of supply, and even if it doesnt the fact that it cant be created without hurting people means it's an act of evil to be involved at any stage.

&gt;Yup, all addicts ever want to be addicts. If they had a choice, they would choose addiction over use without addiction.

yup, everyone who ever uses drugs invariably becomes an addict, and not a very small minority of users.

How far Labour are to blame for the global economic crisis is debatable. Many other countries were hit just like we were with varying degrees of severity, but the difference is how they coped; the US is back on the mend, Germany is doing better than ever, France is middling but that's largely due to restrictive socialist economic policies more than anything else. Even China is doing very well, and they own Hong Kong which is next to New York and London in terms of financial services; one would expect that to have hurt them!

If somebody can consistently get a 1% higher return than somebody else on a multi-million pound pot, they're worth far more to the bank. It makes sense to pay someone in the region of what they earn for the business minus risks and expenses. If you offered 100k for your CEO of a billion pound business, your savings overall would be minimal - there's only one of them. However, most people would agree that a good CEO could make well over a couple of million difference in profit as compared to a bad one.

The real issue is one of regulation - at present, banks are effectively subsidised by the state. If they can run completely independently at a size which doesn't threaten our economy, I have no problem with them making lots of money.

For the record, it still makes me smirk when I hear a bank advertising BS mortgages.  They spend millions on advertising and can still let something like that slip through.  They'll be trying to encourage young people to take out mortgages, and young people will be most familiar with the american term ""BS"" meaning bullshit.
I downvoted your first comment because it didn't make sense and you had misunderstood something about Bank of Scotland, so just following the up/downvote etiquette for relevance, politeness etc.
Again, I downvoted the second comment because you hadn't understood my self-deprecating, apparently too subtle remark about the poor quality of the joke and the tedious, soul-sucking process of unravelling and explaining a joke, and also because you were being a bit nasty and rude, which IS a bore. It was graceless, much like this back-and-forth I've been weak enough to get drawn into; an aspect of reddit I've tried hard in the past to avoid.  There are no winners in an exchange like this, to a third party reading this I think we'll both appear a bit pathetic.

I'm sure that's really useful outside or in the sports hall. The introduction of iPads is to increase the number of alternative teaching methods (whether you agree with the effectiveness of these methods or not is a different point).

I'd like to return to one of my earlier points. If the iPads don't work well for the disabled children, but do for the rest of the class, why should this effect the fabled children? Maybe a Windows PC with Dragon would be better.

Didnt really bother reading your hyperbolic sob stories but if your looking for a career pathway and are willing to work try the railway, many places are providing the trainign for free (EU social cohesion funds)

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/191ibc/what_are_the_best_websites_for_not_wasting_your/c8jxg12 

To get out more there is meetup.com and many other volunteering oppurtuinites in your local area


The cultural capital excuse is dead. You have the internet,want some spare cash /r/worthturkingfor, eat cheap and healthy? there is a subreddit for that, the best deals and cost comparison, there is a chrome extension that will check in real time for you, you know where to go, you can find jobs and training all over the uk. 

Your life could change tomorrow if you are willing to put the effort in.

I see young lads making bad choices who join the firm via the probation service and most fuck off because they are scum, but some start ont he shovel, year later they are COSSing and burning or the overheads or maybe they hit the books and go the tech route. From useles nobhead to technician on 35k and company van in 3 years, in the mean time maybe they meet a girl at the local cat rescue and have a kid.

because a 10' screen you have to hold yourself is better than a 22' screen on a fixed arm

&gt;I'm sure that's really useful outside or in the sports hall. The introduction of iPads is to increase the number of alternative teaching methods (whether you agree with the effectiveness of these methods or not is a different point).

why would you need one in a sports hall or out side and without wifi that's also really limited in what it can do to, take picture and notes. a proper camera and a note pad are much better outside

&gt;Which would would make everything small and difficult to use with touch control. Which is something you were against earlier... And it negates the point of running iOS. That is not an effective way to integrate with AD/OD.

it would be as small as the devices resolution that's it. yes win 7 does not go with touch well but windows 8 does. its the only way to do any form of AD on an apple device and will be for a very long time they are opposed to working with each other.

&gt;I'd like to return to one of my earlier points. If the iPads don't work well for the disabled children, but do for the rest of the class, why should this effect the fabled children? Maybe a Windows PC with Dragon would be better. 

ill refer back to my counter point from that last time

&gt;show me what it can do that you cant on a pc or what it can do better?

no really your for there use so whats the benefit? you have spent the last 5 post saying why im wrong but you have yet to put a proper case for them 

&gt;Alternative teaching. It's about finding better ways to teach. That could mean doing a quiz on the iPad, then getting back to work (something Impero does quite well on the iPad). Also, PLENTY of schools us laptops in classrooms despite 20 minute advice. I'm not saying that's how it should be, but if it doesn't swing the way schools use laptops, it won't swing it with iPads either.

there are quiz tools that work with the standard smart boards already and they are a lot cheaper than a few ipads let alown a class full.

yes visual display regs are broken by lots of business and schools and the are doing it with laptops but they are sitting on a desk not being held which makes them a better choice for any user than a tablet.
i would never recommend laptops for most school situations either, particularly for young children there eyes and body's are still developing and we should not give them something that can hinder a normal healthy development.

just because schools use laptops is not a justification to issue them with tablets which comply with even less of the regs making them a bigger health risk, we should look to make the kit safer for the children not worse.",0,1375025285,null,0,false,0,cbbz9lv,t3_1j5p6i,t1_cbbz9lv,t1_cbbyy3z,null,1430264496,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You are objectifying culture incorrectly. Culture is the set of dominant social behaviours forged over time. Culture isn't going to the opera and waving a flag when the next big circus is visiting town. The UK culture can be summed up as vicarious pride: finding glory in sporting events, royal arseholes and arseholes to be, and even consumerism which is essentially taking pride in something someone else made.

&gt; Who tells tyronne to do these things?

Endless propaganda on TV directly in the form of advertising, indirectly in terms of what broadcasters choose to glorify or exclude. The public sphere is dominated by advertising as the only allowed public medium of (one way) communication. Pop ""culture"" is mostly one large gratuity.

&gt; Didnt really bother reading your hyperbolic sob stories but if your looking for a career pathway and are willing to work try the railway, many places are providing the trainign for free (EU social cohesion funds)

Looked at that and it's totally exploitative. Amazon owe me about 3.4 pennies.

&gt; eat cheap and healthy? the best deals and cost comparison, there is a chrome extension that will check in real time for you

Pesticides and gluten are cheap, neither are those healthy. For me to buy food I've actually traveled on bike 30 miles round trip. The nearest supermarket is 2-3 miles away. I've lived on about 15 a week for 3 years, dropped to about 9 stone and didn't have the energy to leave the house for a period. I'm not even that worse off when I look at some of the people around me, but you likely don't see that, it's all smiles and rapture on the TV. What obstacles did you have to over come? Abusive father? Absent mother? Two or three addictions by the time you were 17? A baby at 16? Forced into dreary employment on minimum wage, losing that mostly on rent, amenities, children, and the rest on beer? Much of this is **systemic** and **induced** poverty of money, land, role models, political voice, movement, self determination and time.

&gt; you can find jobs and training all over the uk. 

Training, right that requires capital. Moving, that requires capital too. It's rare to have training schemes that aren't aimed at 16-24 year olds. It's a tough time for those older and with patchy employment histories.

&gt; Your life could change tomorrow if you are willing to put the effort in. No excuses.

Essentially you are telling me to be a better capitalist. I could ""change"" tomorrow, I could except loads of debt on top of the 20+ from university (I was such a fool), work some shit under paid job, slog just long enough to perhaps afford to rent in a better area with better job access, slog even longer for a mortgage. If I'm lucky I could be digging dirt for monied pricks on the HS2. If I'm really lucky I'll ""win"" the game and be in a position to exploit other people, but not everyone can be the lucky knobhead climbing the corporate ladder because we need loads at the bottom to support it all.

Nah you cunt, im telling you to be a better communist. Just will everything you wish for into existance with the power of positive thinking you fucking bellend. 

Do you give up your time for free? SO why expect others to do so, im suggesting that you aquire more means of exchange is you are dissatisfied with what you have.


'The system' coddles you and gently strokes the balls of losers, form pram grants, housing benefit, to rehab houses, mentors, endless cash for charitys, princes trust, tax emeptions, but some poeple- you- are just massive cunts.

You whine about not having enough money, then when someone suggests you get a job making more you start wanking on about capitalism, you sound like an edgy 14 year old just receiving their first copy of marx

&gt; I have today had my attention drawn to a piece on your website which is appearing now in the UK. The piece contains a number of false and scurrilous accusations. No prior notice was provided to me by you of an intention to publish this piece.
&gt; 
&gt; I have this evening referred the matter to the Attorney-General of England and Wales as publication of the piece of this nature in the UK before a trial constitutes the serious criminal offence of Contempt of Court. The matter has also been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service and the Trial Judge. No publication of any material that might prejudice a trial is allowed in the UK and the offence is punishable with a substantial sentence of imprisonment.
&gt;
&gt; Please ensure and confirm that the piece is to removed immediately in order to mitigate any damage already done.
&gt;
&gt; Yours sincerely,
&gt;
&gt; Angus McBride

Some of these differences are level of religiosity (and type of religion), attitudes towards family life, gender roles, sex, alcohol, physical appearance and dress, and the idea of Britain (especially patriotism and the armed forces). You said ""you can only be outnumbered if you view the other group as different""; you forgot ""or if the other group views you as different"". Muslims in Luton and the white working class both see each other as different.

**The marginalised question:** When you have different communities in the same area, different groups tend to monopolise different types of employment. You can see this in any British city. As your numbers decrease, the job opportunities available to you also decrease. This has historically been a big problem for immigrants, and is now also becoming so for the white working class.

There's also the issue of where people live. When a large number of a different group of people move into your area, your sense of community suffers. If they become a majority, you feel truly marginalised because your possibilties for socialising will become very narrow (e.g. experiences at school, local facilities etc).",0,1375030128,null,0,1375030812,0,cbc0ltw,t3_1j7obn,t1_cbc0ltw,t1_cbc08z6,null,1430263871,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The first next week.

&gt; If you have a store 3 miles away why do you have to cycle 15 miles away?

Because tescos are shit but I have no other choice other than 5 mile Sainsburys, or the 4 mile away Tescos in the other direction. 15 miles away is a place I can bulk buy and who allow me to buy the food I can eat at a decent price, so yeah you try coming home with 2.5 stone in a backpack. Alternatively I could use the local convenience store and pay twice as much for even worse food—that's another feature of the poverty trap.

&gt; Tyronne does not have to watch endless shit on tv.

In a culture lacking communal spaces and endeavours kids invariably veg out in front of the TV, like their parents who probably come home burnt out having given the best 10 hours of the day driving, being at work, then driving home. You seem to have a stunted mind that can't recognise systemic violence, in this case it would be cultural and intellectual. Also you are just promoting the key anti-culture of Britain: consume, consume, consume.

Never had housing benefit, I don't drink alcohol, never smoked, never been arrested, never been a regular drug user (not seen any in a decade and nothing harder than a few brews).

&gt; You whine about not having enough money, then when someone suggests you get a job making more you start wanking on about capitalism, you sound like an edgy 14 year old just receiving their first copy of marx 

If you have to label me get it at least more correct you dumb fuck, I think we've been through this: try anarchism. No, I actually complained about the poverty trap which encourages anti-social behaviour and showed you that there exists pockets of social deprivation. I never said I don't have enough money.

I have actually tried to become a ""good little citizen"" but I'm stuck at 30 not being able to do the job I did with little opportunity of other stuff.

Bullshit. My next door neighbours growing up would conform to your ""Muslim stereotype"" yet they were white protestants. Same for my sisters best friend, white Catholics. One of my own friends was one of those crazy Scottish evangelical religions, totally identical.

Feel free to find examples of extremist Muslim opinion as some form of ""but they are different"" proof. For every one you come up with I'll find three white Brits with the same opinion. Deal?

&gt; and the idea of Britain (especially patriotism and the armed forces).

So the ""idea of Britain"" is our army and it's colonial history? Britain was the source of the enlightenment which led to the end of these attitudes, your ideas of ""patriotism"" are dead and buried. The ideas of justice, freedom, education, secularism and democracy are the ""idea of Britain"", not our army. 

Our armed forces have nothing to be proud of aside from tiny minority of recent wars e.g. Falklands and WW2.

&gt; Muslims in Luton and the white working class both see each other as different.

Maybe I'm biased by the situation here in Glasgow but that's just bullshit. The Muslims up here smoke and swear as much as the rest of us. 

&gt; When you have different communities in the same area, different groups tend to monopolise different types of employment. You can see this in any British city. As your numbers decrease, the job opportunities available to you also decrease. This has historically been a big problem for immigrants, and is now also becoming so for the white working class.

You just made that up. The only jobs dominated by immigrants in the UK are local shop staff and food takeaways. The ""traditional British chippy"" was always owned by an Italian, so the idea that something has ""changed"" is faulty to begin with. 

The only change in retail affecting the ""white working class"" has been the switch to centralised retail areas in supermarkets and shopping malls. That has absolutely nothing to do with immigration and neither do any of the problems of low wages and poor conditions.

Immigrants didn't fuck the working class in this country, Thatcher did when she re-valued the currency to force Britain into the banking and service industries by making manufactured exports unviable. Blaming immigrants, the people who kept our economy alive, shows a complete an utter lack of knowledge of how economics work. Population growth is always good for any non-physically crowded country like the UK. They create jobs because they have to be fed, sheltered, transported. Immigrants are economically the best option as another country has already paid for their non-productive childhood years. **You** are more of a drain to this country than any immigrant is. 

All I can say is: **I'm glad UKIP have zero authority over the UK's economy**. They would be one of the greatest disasters we've ever seen.",0,1375031681,null,0,false,0,cbc12e9,t3_1j7obn,t1_cbc12e9,t1_cbc0ltw,null,1430263658,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As the technical implementation of any proposed site blocking system has not been released, it is unknown whether this type of bypass would be effective or not. Furthermore the proposed system is targeting porn (and related subjects) only. Which this service, is not.

If an ISP was going to go via the DNS or IP route, then yes, this would be effective... IF the site you are trying to access is within the PAC file. Quickly going to Immunicity's site reveals that ZERO porn sites are currently on the list.

So at present, how effective is this at reaching porn sites?

**0%** - but this could change if they added porn sites to the list.

If an ISP goes the slightly more invasive route of deploying Deep Packet Inspection tools to prevent access to porn sites, then this Proxy Service would also be ineffective, as it doesn't use HTTPS where the site also doesn't, so the Packet Inspector will be able to see the traffic data just as well as it would through going to the site directly.

Coutinho and Sturridge address large holes in our team, but we still have a couple more holes in the first team and one the bench that need to be filled with players of equal talent before we're honestly ready to start competing with Spurs and Arsenal for the final position in the top 4.

Yes there are many white people with these opinions, but you'd be hard pushed to prove that Muslims in Luton are not more conservative than the white working class on sex, gender roles, hedonism etc. 

&gt;Feel free to find examples of extremist Muslim opinion as some form of ""but they are different"" proof. For every one you come up with I'll find three white Brits with the same opinion. Deal?

An example is the Muslim woman in Luton [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00pbclq) criticising the presenter for her dress: ""Who are you trying to seduce?"".

&gt;So the ""idea of Britain"" is our army and it's colonial history? Britain was the source of the enlightenment which led to the end of these attitudes, your ideas of ""patriotism"" are dead and buried. The ideas of justice, freedom, education, secularism and democracy are the ""idea of Britain"", not our army.

These seem to be your idea of Britain, but the idea of Britain as defined by these other things you don't like is very strong, as you can see by the massive interest in things like the royal baby, and the outrage over Lee Rigby's murder being heightened by the fact he was a soldier.

&gt;You just made that up. The only jobs dominated by immigrants in the UK are local shop staff and food takeaways. The ""traditional British chippy"" was always owned by an Italian, so the idea that something has ""changed"" is faulty to begin with.

I would add public sector jobs in immigrant heavy areas (as you'd expect), together with things like taxi firms. Add together retail, food service and local public sector and you have a big chunk of the work available in working class post-industrial Britain. Re: the Italians, unless you can show me a history of literally millions of Italian immigrants coming to Britain and becoming a majority in numerous urban areas, this is a false equivalence.

&gt;Blaming immigrants, the people who kept our economy alive, shows a complete an utter lack of knowledge of how economics work. 

I didn't. I agree immigration is good for the economy in general (but bad for some groups), but I think it's sometimes worth sacrificing some economic growth for a more cohesive society.

Sterling and Ibe have looked good too. Pacy, tricky and with an eye for goal, it'd be hard to pick between the two as far as who had a better preseason but I would say Sterling looked slightly more dangerous throughout matches. Ibe was not far behind though.


Defense with or without Kolo looks solid, Simon has made some decent saves and still hasn't a conceded a goal, and Allen, Lucas, Hendo, Downing, and Borini all look good, but will continue to improve match to match. Minus the first game (understandably) our captain has looked fantastic, spraying passes of many different sorts all game and has gotten forward to great effect. There's not much more to say really he's hard and he's Steven fucking Gerrard. What a player.


Coutinho has been phenomenal. He truly is a special player and he's already proving the creative spark we need to open up tricky premier league defenses. He's linking incredibly well and on the ball he's even more confident. Finding the net, creating goals and generally being untouchable. I've heard the theories about how he won't be as effective this year because teams will shut him down faster/know how to play against him but I'm not buying it.

There is a much bigger difference between north and south than people on the island acknowledge and the south doesn't feel any less an independent country without it.

Where we are in the football world means we have no choice but to take gambles on the likes of Borini, Coutinho, and Sturridge. We have to make those signings. They aren't flagship signings. They aren't going to send fans to get a new kit, but they're the type of signings with potential that can help position us for the future.

We cannot sign marquee players right now. If we did it would be a huge surprise. 

Personally I am completely content with the manner of business we're conducting. I'd be fine with the squad we have this moment if we started the season tomorrow. Aspas seems to be an astute signing. The type of player who is only going to grow in stature by playing with better teammates. 

Are we guarantees for 4th? Not even close. But to think we can't challenge is silly. Think about the games we threw away last year. Think about how the whole first half of the season we barely had a squad. Think about how the last games of the year we had no Suarez. 

We're going to improve. Thats what happens when you keep a talented young squad together. They grow together and improve together. And the clubs results with it. 

My prediction for the season is that the gap between the first 6 and the other 14 will grow. But the gap between 1st and 6th and 4th and 6th will be much smaller. 

I don't know exactly what the future holds, but we cannot compete with City, Chelsea, and United for money. And right now with Arsenal and even Tottenham for present position (what's also never discussed is how being in a city like London helps them). 

We have to build up. And look at how many young players are bursting to get into the first team. For years we had no youth setup and we're finally about to reap the benefits of it. 

I think we'll surprise people this year. But what surprises me is how many of those people will be Liverpool fans.",0,1375035620,null,0,false,0,cbc2ak8,t3_1j83g5,t1_cbc2ak8,t1_cbc22fq,null,1430263084,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

It's the only reason I can think of for Labour to bring in a flawed system (ESA) to replace a working system (IB) only for the Tories to bring in an even more flawed system (UC).",0,1375036463,null,0,false,0,cbc2k76,t3_1j7pe7,t1_cbc2k76,t1_cbbz96k,null,1430262959,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't believe there is another way.

I'm not looking to pick fights with fellow fans, just expessing an honest opinion.

Edit : 
I think much of what FSG has invested has been based on player sales.

Carroll and shelvey alone have covered most of our outlay so far this window.

Torres for Carroll etc.

There has been some investment but hardly anything considerable.

Not stealing to fund a habit - which the majority of drug users do not.

The majority of users use mdma and other 'party' drugs infrequently (usually at weekends) and may smoke cannabis as often as they drink a beer - the majority of drug users just get on with their lives with no ill effect to society apart from funding criminals (as there is no legal avenue to purchase drugs)

true,lossaysswag,lfc12,,"Once again, you trying to harp on the use of ""franchises"" only shows your desperation, but allow me to explain it for you. I'm very aware of what LFC stands for. However, I chose to use ""franchises"" because it's a term common across all sports and leagues. In other words, I was informing you that I follow various teams in a plethora of leagues and different sports.  Basketball and football teams aren't referred to as ""clubs"" in America.  Could I have said ""teams?"" Sure, but that wouldn't have been clear as to illustrate the array of sports I follow.  Now onto the rest of your tired argument. I mentioned Fulham because of you focusing on ""veteran players"" and it is, and has been for years, a team full of previously established veteran players who are past their prime.  My statement was meant to undercut your argument and it's certainly done its job since you are now backtracking to ""clarify"" what you *meant to say*. Furthermore, your cries for ""proven talent"" are considerably overshadowed by examples of ""proven talent"" not living up to the hype and transfer fees they command as well as the unproven talents that come in and make their presence felt. For the former: Schevchenko, Samba, Forlan, Robinho, Robbie Keane, Torres, Adebayor, the list goes on. The latter: Benteke, Michu, Chicharito, Coutinho, Ba. The answer isn't always the most expensive marquee signing and that is the point I'm making, and typically it's only the fair weather fans that believe that is the only answer. So while you sit here and argue that Liverpool's only chance at reliving former glory is an owner with an unlimited bank roll, I'll sit here comfortably believing that the coach who's inspired a team of young ""inexperienced"" players to perform like they did in the latter half of the season knows how to construct a formidable side that I will faithfully cheer for.

&gt;Straight to the ad hominem.

Actual ad hominem.

&gt;In reality, ad hominem is unrelated to sarcasm or personal abuse. Argumentum ad hominem is the logical fallacy of attempting to undermine a speaker's argument by attacking the speaker instead of addressing the argument. The mere presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy isn't there.

While you are quite correct that the timing is inherently suspicious given the failure of the DCB and Snowden leaks... instructing ISPs to implement their own systems for this goal isn't precisely the most effective way of getting the infrastructure in place for future monitoring.

Some may go DPI, some for DNS-Block, some may go for IP rulesets. All would have to be merged into a bigger, unfriendlier and centralised system at some point which is arguably more work than just implementing it from scratch (as per the DCB).

It's entirely possible Coutinho will move on in a few seasons, regardless of our place in the league.

Bottom line is we have (last I checked) the 5th highest turnover in the PL and the 5th highest wage bill.  Therefore, our logical table placement is probably right around 5th.
