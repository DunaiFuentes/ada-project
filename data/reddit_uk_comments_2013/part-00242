I really want to see Townsend on the left in favor of Sig, and Lamela on the right.  Townsend could do a better job with his left foot on the outside I wager, and could still shoot with his right if the defense sells out on him beating his man and crossing.  Lamela look confident last Thursday, and knowing how talented he is, I think that's enough to warrant at least a small run of matches on the right.

As for the center mid spots, I'm not too worried.  Once we have both Capoue and Sandro fully fit, I doubt we'll see Mousa and Paulinho start together again.

Left back is my main worry, because that's the one problem that involves bringing someone in.  According to the one QPR fan I've seen talking about Benny, he's still a solid enough player.

true,tfree16,null,null,"The two systems with two strikers that I can think of (4-4-2 and 3-5-2) are somewhat antiquated. 4-4-2 pulls a man out of the center of midfield making it harder to control the middle of the field. It also requires more defensive work from the outside midfielders. They need to come in and help cover the third man that most top level teams field in the center. 3-5-2 solves the center midfield problem but leaves a lot of space open on the wing. It has also proven to be a very difficult system to implement at every level I've ever played at and requires extremely talented fullbacks. Liverpool, who have been experimenting with a 3-5-2 looked particularly poor against Arsenal this year. I think this was mostly down to their lack of pace all over the pitch but also because Arsenal was able to exploit the extra space on the outsides, creating 2v1s with Liverpool's fullbacks.


I don't think our problem is tactical, rather personnel.  I think AVB has yet to figure out the best way to organize this particular group of players. I also think that Townsend, while talented is still far too one dimensional. He is pacy and has a wicked shot when he catches it but he takes soooo many touches and ends up slowing down our build up. He's not the only one that has been guilty of this, Kyle Walker and Paulinho in particular have dwelt a little too long on the ball at times this season. The best teams have players that can beat you off the dribble but they mostly play two touch. They beat you with the pace of their passing and intelligence rather than the pace of their players, though having both helps. Our speed of play will improve as the players get used to playing with each other, but I'm not sure Townsend is the future at right wing. On counters he's a great layer to have because that's when you need pace and direct dribbling.


On Soldado, I think he is a rich man's Defoe. He is a very capable goal scorer and provides more for the team than Jermaine. However, he lacks the size and strength to play as a target, and does not have the speed or guile of someone like Aguero or Suarez.

in the town i live there's a factory which could probably employ most of the unskilled unemployed from the town and surrounding area, but almost everyone who works there is from eastern europe.

there are good reasons for that - as everyone knows minimum wage here is a fair bit of money back in poland, gives them more incentive. they were also brought up in relative hardship to most people here and as a country seem less inclined towards coddling their kids and that whole ""everyones a winner as long as you tried"" thing that's been pushed the last few decades (yes yes ""sounds like daily mail shit"" but you know it's true). all that i think makes them less averse to the kind of work they typically get.

but still, what are the locals then going to do? the only other significant area of employment for unskilled workers is retail, which doesnt have nearly enough space for all the unemployed in my area. so what do they do? either move away or stay stuck in a town with no jobs, languishing away, developing no skills or anything but a history of unemployment, more likely to take up drinking, drugs and generally getting up to no good, these are the people who will be making up this community for decades to come, long after the immigrants go off to greener pastures or back home... not a good mix if you're interested in the long term wellbeing of your area, you'll be left with a dysfunctional town and a local labour pool of no use to anyone, including themselves.

i have no doubt there are a lot of figures which could show me that immigration boosted the UK economy but what that doesnt consider is the potential long term effects, seems likely to me that it will prove to be a short term boost with a loss in the long term, and that's if the economy is all you care about.",0,1384364337,null,0,false,0,cddgog7,t3_1qj4wu,t1_cddgog7,t3_1qj4wu,null,1428675114,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

My local area is now a strip of Polish businesses, and all the job agencies around here are Polish too! A friend's son coming out of college locally took his CV up and down these shops and businesses last summer and was turned away because he couldn't speak Polish. 

I can't really complain though, as I'm a homeowner and the Polish influx has directly benefited me by pushing prices up to the point where the local authority is considering selling off much of the council stock around me, which will make my property worth more I'm told.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"I understand- I'm not trying to hate on you either, just explain why I disagree.

In big games, Lucas is asked to do too much if he is paired with Gerrard.  We have excellent midfielders, but with the exception of Henderson they aren't very mobile.  In big games the opponent will have several top class midfielders for Lucas to deal with, making him less effective (for obvious reasons) and Gerrard isn't a great help these days.  Coutinho does track back, but as I mentioned in some comment a week ago or so, he needs to be an option for a pass when we win the ball so he can't mark too tightly.

This isn't a slight on Gerrard.  But I feel against a team like Arsenal, with Ozil, Cazorla, and Ramsey, any DM gets overwhelmed when they don't have solid midfield partners who can cover ground and/or have good positional sense.  Last weekend the fact that we were using a still-new 3-5-2 didn't help.  When we switched to 4-4-2, with Lucas and Gerrard in the middle, it was even worse.  This isn't down to Lucas, and I think any DM in the world would have issues dealing with it- certainly anyone we could look at signing.

The other thing about Lucas is that he's very, very good at winning second balls when the opponent clears, and recycling possession.  He started off as an attacking mid, and he's got the foot skills, vision, and passing that came out of that background.  There are many DM's who are stronger than he is, or better at tackling, but who are not nearly as good at recycling the ball (see, eg, Wanyama).

I would like to see Lucas partnered with Joe Allen, who is a bit more attacking, but also has fucking superb positional sense.  Sacrifice Gerrard's minutes a bit to make this happen- we need to rotate anyway.

I never shouted or celebrated as much as I did watching those last few games, and the Final, I was uncontrollable, I'm shaking typing this up as we speak.

As for your quote, personally I'm fine with that. Many people want to cut down central direction and top-down management, and having too many managers is a constant complaint about the NHS.

Besides, the NHS has always been an evolving system ever since it was first created. Over the last 60 years it has grown and evolved, and that's a good thing. As I said in my original post, as long as the quality of care is good and the system is affordable, I don't really care about the ideology behind it and whether it is provided by the government or private companies.

Why do you also assume that if Poles and other took jobs from locals then locals will go into drinking and drugs? Do you really think so bad of your own nationals?

This means that those who were simply lazy would be forced to take example from those people who work harder and don't complain on everything.

    &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;drs 1-4 it was in his past so he would remember it all. 
    &gt;  
    Couldn't we just assume that the Doctor is observing some point 
    of temporal protocol. In other words the various Doctors can 
    remember the adventure from their previous experiences but must 
    behave exactly as they remember themselves behaving.  To clarify:
    Davison remembers his lines because he's heard them before 
    several times over and now musn't contradict his own history by 
    conflicting with his own memories.  He doesn't share his 
    fore-knowledge with his companions because, as he has stated 
    several times, such fore-knowledge is dangerous. So the poor sod 
    is forced to plod through the same cycle of events at several
    points in his history knowing the outcome but forced to behave as 
    if it's all a big surprise.  The Time Lord equivalent of reruns.
    
    Which means in ""The Five Doctors"" they're all only acting and
    it's just a pantomime.  Doesn't that have the ring of truth?

    &gt; [concerning the possibility of The Doctor remembering in later

    &gt; 
    &gt; I've always had a pet theory that since interacting with 
    future, or 
    &gt; indeed, past regenerations what strictly forbidden except in 
    the gravest 
    &gt; emergencies, that the Time Lords would erase the events from 
    The Doctor's 
    &gt; memory
    
    Not so.  Drs 1 and 2 remember the events of ""The Three Doctors"" 
    in ""The FIve Doctors"" (2 talks about Omega with the Brig and 1 
    enquires ""Where's the little fellow?"" on encountering 3.)  5 also 
    remembers Omega in ""Arc Of Whatever"".  I still think the simplest 
    and least fussy explanation is that he does remember but has to 
    go through the motions exactly as he remembers from the last time 
    round so as no to contradict his own history. This fits with what 
    he's always said about changing history and the dangers of 
    fore-knowledge.

true,Colinfucius,lfc99,,"I actually completely disagree. The Red Sox have been Billy Beane if Billy Beane had more money to spend, not the Chelsea/Yankee buy every expensive player that has a pulse. They've always been 20-40 million behind the Yankees in payroll, which is a lot fewer superstars in your lineup. (Despite all of that money, the Yankees were awful this year, which was sweet, sweet justice.)

This year's championship team was a perfect example of old school moneyball. A lot of the clutch performers down the stretch were total nobodies in the offseason that Ben Cherington handpicked because of their plate discipline, clubhouse chemistry, and non-mainstream stat lines.

If you look at Boston and LFC together, I think you'll see their strategies have actually mirrored each other: 

1) Don't spend the most, but spend enough to have a real, practical chance to win a championship.

2) By young talent, and invest a lot in your own academy/farm system

3) Keep the franchise superstars that you have by offering solid long term contracts (Gerrard's new contract, Ortiz and Pedroia, etc.)

4) Never sell to a direct rival unless you are really pulling one over on them (Torres)

5) Rehabilitate your stadium and the surrounding area

6) Spend a little extra (but not too much extra, i.e. Willian) when the timing is right, but without panicking or making emotional decisions. Set a value for the player at the start, and if it's exceeded you have to stick to your guns. You will get a better deal at that position next window. (For the Sox, refusing to get into a bidding war with the Yankees over Teixeira led to getting an equally good first baseman in Adrian Gonzalez the next year) It's NOT that FSG is stingy. It's just that they are PATIENT and it pays off.

7) Acquire players that are in line with the manager's philosophy and fit a real, thought out approach to winning under his system.

Heck, even in that one year where FSG was overspending on players, the two clubs had very similar signings: Andy Carroll and Carl Crawford.

So I actually do think that FSG's Red Sox strategy mirrors their LFC strategy. I believe it IS a moneyball strategy (just with more money than the Athletics had), and that's it's very Billy Beane and not very Yankee. The Yankees spend their way out of problems, as they will this offseason. FSG spends money, but is more interested in outwitting and out-scouting the rest of the league.

The good news is that it works. 3 championships in 10 years on the baseball side. I honestly believe they can do the same with Liverpool and that it's already begun.",0,1384368387,null,0,false,0,cddik7r,t3_1qjbmj,t1_cddik7r,t1_cddggiq,null,1428674099,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

&gt;in a material sense

You keep using this phrase like it dismisses my point, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what magical, all-powerful meaning you could give it for that to be true. Can you explain?

To address it directly though:

It does. It *literally* **does** make a difference. Did you not read my post? My whole point was that *it doesn't* matter if it's only a tiny part, if you're going to compare two figures in some way, you need to handle the level of precision at a consistent level. *To three significant figures* is just plain *wrong* when the order of magnitude is changing. 

Let's give another example of how shitty representation of numbers can lead to gross misrepresentation of the real world:

1 million people like orange juice, down from 1,560,800 last year.

How many people decided they don't like orange juice anymore? Was it 560,800? Or, since we're rounding down, and presented that ""1 million"" value in a really shoddy, lazy manner, as few as 60,801 people could have changed their minds, which is *negligible*. Since we've been so tremendously inaccurate, as many as 1,060,799 people could have changed their minds.

Do you get my point yet? And yes, in the case of the BBC article, it's minor, but in order for numbers to have meaning they need to be presented with their *absolute* precision, **especially** when you're comparing them to other numbers.

It isn't that the number they're telling us about is insignificant in their greater context. **That is not what I am talking about.** I am ranting that the BBC is not presenting the numbers properly relative to each other, context or no context.",0,1384368985,null,0,false,0,cddiukq,t3_1qizvn,t1_cddiukq,t1_cddhp6s,null,1428673913,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There are plenty of roads in the Netherlands that have no cycle lanes, but the drivers aren't up their arse, beeping / revving or passing close at speed.

There's so much aggression and dangerous moves here, because most drivers do not cycle.  They don't know what it feels like.

If they did, none of them would be pulling some of the aggressive and dangerous acts that a sizeable amount of them currently do.

Resigning is what the employer wants, as it means they have no risk of an employment claim. The employee has given up any bargaining power in return for nothing.

It also makes signing on much harder.

The correct approach, if they are going to dismiss the person (and he has not managed to get another job) is to comply with all the company rules and wait for them to dismiss him.

They may well offer a compromise agreement, where the person agrees to resign in return for a little more money and an agreed reference.

And that's sort of where my question lies. I'm fairly young and keen to become a screenwriter one day, but I'm just not sure how it works in the uk and looking at your imdb profile you have written a few things so...

I guess what I'm asking is how does someone become a screenwriter for television or film in the uk?
spec scripts? pitching tv shows?

Personally, I wear Dailies. I get sent enough to wear them most days in the week (80 pairs every three months delivered to my house). The cost is about Â£20 a month direct debit. If you want, you can also get a decent idea about cost by [calling up and asking](http://www.boots.com/en/Help/Contact-Us/).

Dailies are in my opinion so much better than monthlies, purely because of the limited effort they require. Just pop them in every morning, plop them in the bin at night, repeat.

You'll find that when you're on the Contact Lens Reward Scheme with Boots, they'll send you a little postcard every 6 to 12 months asking you to come in for a free check up. Normally I just ignore, but eventually they will stop sending you contact lenses and hold them hostage until you book an appointment.

Having sat there, I don't agree with this (unless you meant PK rather than PK9 in which case yeah). Being close to the pitch is nice, but if you're unlucky you're practically looking along the goaline, which means it's hard to tell if the ball is on target or not for the goal at the Anfield Road end, and you're a long way from the Kop end goal. Plus being PK8 or 9 you're right in front of the away fans, so tend to only really hear the away support. 

PK9 are decent seats - pretty hard to be when you're that close to the pitch, and there are definitely worse seats in the ground (I've watched a game from the back row of the Kop, and it's a pretty shite view), but they're nowhere near the best seats I'd say that being lot closer to the halfway line or Kop gives you a much better experience in the Main Stand, even if you're much further back.

That it is ideology not science.  That it s fearful of a competition of ideas and excludes those which threaten its ideological basis.

Im a massive MisFits fan, I loved the look of the show when it began. So having the opportunity to shoot the show in the style I admired was great fun and an amazing opportunity. I'd like to think I brought a bit of myself to it too, but to be honest I was just happy to be making MisFits. I didn't like season 4 as much though, so having the chance to make MisFits and to try and take it back to the show that I initially fell in love with was a genuine privilege. And a bit terrifying if I'm honest!

I actually felt like I was given a lot of freedom, there was no one looking over my shoulder on set and I had no notes about changing scenes or anything like that whilst shooting. But I know if the Executives aren't happy then they get involved... I definitely think I was helped by the fact that I knew the style of the show and wanted to do it justice. 

In the edit though they really know what they want so you have to listen to them, its there show after all. But its a two way process, they are definitely very understanding about your ideas as a director. 

The over all process wasn't that different to my shorts, it just took a lot longer and we had a lot more money :) Over all though I prefer making my own thing. Sometimes after a long job I almost forget what my own identity is. Especially after a commercial where its not as fun as MisFits... and then I just have to go back and work on my own projects.

[background - i've worked in a big media org, and been involved in policy about how numbers are presented. I also have spent a lot of time analysing a presenting big &amp; small numbers to management teams and organisations]

&gt; they need to be presented with their absolute precision

This is basically wrong - numbers on the scale of an economy do not need to be presented with absolute precision because they are not absolutely precise, and any precision there is, is lost in the likely +/- accuracy of said number. 

Lets take a look at the number in the article - your calculation shows that the % fall was either 3.0736% or 3.0964% - even at the scale of an economy the difference between these two is **meaningless** because the inaccuracies in measurement will dwarf the difference here, and the ebb and flow of a system will be greater than the diff here - you cannot attribute cause to that difference. You acknowledge this yourself - so the BBC have done nothing wrong - they've presenting information concisely and that rounding has no material impact on the figures. You've just got upset that one (smaller number) is accurate to hundreds and another is accurate to the tens of thousands. But that is exactly how numbers *should* be presented in media. 

&gt; It does. It literally does make a difference. Did you not read my post? My whole point was that it doesn't matter if it's only a tiny part, if you're going to compare two figures in some way, you need to handle the level of precision at a consistent level. To three significant figures is just plain wrong when the order of magnitude is changing.

Your own figures demonstrate that in fact it does not make a material difference - so I'm bemused to as why you think your example makes your point. It makes the exact opposite point - sticking to 3 sig figs on these 2 numbers of different scale made almost no difference to the % fall in unemployment. Did *you* not read your own post?

So what about this:

&gt; Imagine if that 1.31 million was ""fifty thousand""

Well no - if the policy is 3 sig figures (which i think it is) then they would present a number along the lines of 50,400 not '50k' and the levels of accuracy would be largely preserved. The fact that the total number was measured in millions means that the sig fig version didn't need the hundreds - which makes sense as hundreds are a tiny proportion of millions so don't represent a material amount. 

Lets take a look at your made up example that wasn't featured on the BBC (so isn't a real problem either):

&gt; 1 million people like orange juice, down from 1,560,800 last year.

You've not reported the numbers as the BBC 3 sig figs rule would dictate - they would say

""1.13 million people like orange juice, down from 1.56 million last year""

Do *you* see the point yet? They present each number to a finite level of accuracy - 3 significant figures - which is a media decision to keep numbers concise, and not over precise given inaccuracies, yet good enough to mean that the rounding errors are not a big percentage of the actual figure (as your example has shown - the difference was 0.0228% points - nobody cares (or should care) about a difference of that scale... except you!). 

Now onto the business side of things. No senior staff cares much about a one off 3% shift in top line numbers (they certainly don't care whether is it 3.0736% or 3.0964%) - they want to know what the trend is - what was it last month, last year, the total accrued effect, speeding up, slowing down. This is what matters as of course these numbers change every month and the overall direction and rate of change is the significant factor that adds up. **That's what they actually got wrong is not reporting the wider trend in the figures**. 

My conclusion is your whole rant is about the fact that you don't like the way that the numbers look. The only examples you have of where it would be a problem are made up by you. And ask anyone that runs their careers by these kind of scale numbers and they will tell you the same - its the trend that matters, not the single data point results.

true,NEWSBOT3,,,"what worked for me previously was *gradually* making changes like.



1. First week start by ditching drinks that aren't water. This part sucks, but you'll live with it. This is the only change you should make for a week or two. Studies have shown several times that gradual changes work best, not big drastic ones. You also need to do an action 21 times before it becomes a habit, which is another reason to wait a few weeks before the next change.



2. find some common exercise with a friend. It can be anything from the gym, sports, walking, running, cycling, swimming etc. You want at least 45-60 mins of good heart rate 3 times a week. I used to live in York and i would go the swimming pool at 7 am, swim for an hour, and then go to work, plus some gym stuff for cardio like rowing, jogging, cycling etc 2-3 times a week. Having a friend is important because it keeps you going because you don't want to let them down - without it ,when you feel even slightly off you'll start to avoid it. Walking can work but it needs be like an hour plus a day and it doesnt get your heart racing enough.



3. now that you've been exercising for a week or two, start by cutting down the portion sizes and changing to slightly better foods for you. Don't rush this part. One trick i found was  that some stores like tesco label their food in percentages of the RDA - so i refused to buy anything with any nutrional figure more than 30% - then with 3 meals a day i was inside the recommended amounts easily. Drink water before your meals and you'll feel more full and eat less. And if you want to snack, do it with something like ryvitas that are very filling without being much in them!
Read the labels on all food you buy, its shocking how bad a lot of it is, especially some stuff that gets portrayed as healthy!


good luck!

edit : remember to treat yourself once a week or whatever - you dont need to totally eliminate food you love! - and its much easier to cut back or reward yourself with a treat once a week or so for exercising all week or whatever.",0,1384374523,null,0,1384374913,0,cddlgik,t3_1qjywp,t1_cddlgik,t3_1qjywp,null,1428672657,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

true,deadsoldier,England,2012 GSX650F,"I can recommend both the Oxford heated grips and the heated wraps called Hot Hands.

The grips are much better for all year convenience since you fit them and forget. They feel like regular grips and when you have cold hands you turn them on. Simple.

The wraps called Hot Hands work well but do not have an adjustable heat output, only on/off. Unless you have very thick gloves you will probably find you have to toggle the heat often to stop your hands burning. They make the bars thicker (more like a 1"" cruiser bar than the regular 7/8th bars on most bikes) and reduce road feedback and vibration very slightly. This makes them good for sedate rides and tours but not really suited to spirited rides. They are removable, which makes them great if you change bikes often.

If you go for heated grips/wraps you will probably want hand guards if you are doing rides over 20-30 minutes often. Grips only warm your palms and base of the fingers well, so long rides can get cold without the extra protection.

Personally, I can't find guards to fit my bike, so I'm running a very thick winter glove with heated grips. I ride just about every day, year round, without too much discomfort. 

The main suggestions I can make are to wear breathable base layers and carry waterproofs. If you have a backpack or tankbag you regularly use, put a sports drink and something to eat, in there. Make sure you have AA/RAC/etc and carry a puncture repair kit and a charged mobile phone.

A breakdown on a back road in a summer evening can be an annoyance. A breakdown in the rain on a winters evening could prove more serious.

Most importantly, enjoy the ride! That's what it's all about. This is the time of year when you find out who the real bikers are :)

They have similiar values, similiar religion and similiar approaches to plenty of things (with exceptions like mushroom pickings from forest which is popular in Poland but forbidden in UK, because UK does not really have any proper forest).

not disputing that, except mushroom picking, that's legal in scotland where i am.

&gt;Why do you also assume that if Poles and other took jobs from locals then locals will go into drinking and drugs? Do you really think so bad of your own nationals?

somewhat, when it comes to raising people to be able to cope with the world of work i think things really went to shit in education, parenting norms etc in the last 20-30 years. but leave people without jobs or any hope of things getting any better and they simply get bored and turn to such things for something to do, i dont think thats particular to ""my own nationals"" just what happens when people are in that situation.

&gt;This means that those who were simply lazy would be forced to take example from those people who work harder and don't complain on everything.

and if it was Â£5 for 1 zloty and brits could make quite a lot of money back home by working low paying jobs in poland, while poles couldnt go anywhere else in europe to make more money for the same work, i bet they wouldnt be so motivated to work hard and would complain about everything too.",0,1384374913,null,0,false,0,cddlna6,t3_1qj4wu,t1_cddlna6,t1_cddieur,null,1428672569,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"Nah. I mean, I see the appeal, and I expect him to be a tough opponent for our soft midfield and I also agree that we need that strength, but he's not really the one to provide it. He's a bit too much of an aimless dribbler, doesn't command an area as much as he just barrels through it, and his passing is pretty poor. He's also slow off the mark, he takes a couple strides to get going and that leaves us susceptible to quick midfielders.  We'd be sacrificing several strengths to deal with one weakness. Decent player, but our style necessitates a little more selectivity. 

Yann M'vila is a name I've seen thrown around, he's reportedly unhappy in Russia and if he's straightened out some of his behaviour, he could be worth a lot more than the Â£10-Â£12m it would take to sign him. There's a multitide of players in France and Germany who could be available for decent prices - Milan Bedelj from Hamburg would fit our style perfectly, Ivan Rakitic would be fantastic if we can prise him away from Sevilla, I've heard good things about this Rodrigo Caio kid in Brazil, I think Seb Rudy is out-of-contract at the end of the season, he'd be worth signing on a pre-contract agreement and then trying to get early for a cut price in January (Spurs-style)... there's no shortage of players if we're ambitious, stay in the top 4 and are willing to spend some money quickly, and all those players would vastly improve our midfield - more so than someone like Diame, in my opinion. I'm just throwing out these names to show that I think there's a lot of good options out there.


Signing someone like Diame would be *over*-focussing on a problem in our squad, it wouldn't be taking on the harder task of finding someone who can add some muscle and toughness but enhance our passing and creativity as well, someone who'll intercept as much as he tackles. I think the targets we've pursued so far have all been good fits for our style and attitude, so I'd be surprised if anyone at the club was even thinking of Diame. Fernando Reges is an option I've seen atop a lot of wishlists, and (based on the admittedly-few times I've seen him play) he seems to contribute much of what Diame does, while holding the ball superbly and passing it much better. I think he's also in the final year of his contract with Porto. Somewhere along the line, this just turned into me summarising twitter conversations, but I think my point is somewhere in there.

Let's not pretend things have to even out and balance.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation)

Many ""rules of the road"" are not suited to anything other than a motor vehicle.  Those that don't follow even single letter of the law are rarely an issue for anyone. 

&gt; While they won't come off well against a car, bus or lorry, they can do a fair bit of damage to a pedestrian if at speed.

Yet statistically they don't.  More people have been killed by cars, this year, mounting pavements than people on bicycles have killed in a decade.  Very few people are injured, even less are killed by people on bicycles.

Let's not pretend that people on bicycles are a hazard to pedestrians

&gt; In the last ten years, just over 7,600 pedestrian were killed by motor vehicles while 29 were killed by cyclists. Over the same period, 364,000 pedestrians were injured by motor vehicles, almost 76,000 (or 21%) of them seriously while cyclists injured just over 2,600 with roughly the same proportion (22%) being considered serious. - [Source](http://adrianfitch.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/are-cyclists-a-bigger-threat-to-pedestrians-than-motor-vehicles/)

&gt; Cycling on pavements is anti-social, yet the subject receives far more attention in the media than the shocking fact that around 40 people a year are killed by cars that have mounted the pavement. - [Source](http://www.etatrust.org.uk/2012/11/cars-driving-on-pavements-american-vs-british-police-response/)

This is why we have such an issue at the moment, people that want to cycle need facilities to do so.  Because at the moment, we're being killed by poor drivers.

Maybe this is because I use the term *significant figure* in its *mathematical* sense, not its layman, *hey, that number might be important* sense. We seem to be having different arguments here.

In this article the figures are not presented with consistent *mathematically* significant figures, such that some fall well within the realm of the *absolute* errors of others, despite those numbers being used in direct relation to one another. This is a sort of scientific faux-pas, and when you take a course in statistics or statistical science, people tend to nail this point into your head, because it's the sort of thing that can prevent a paper from passing peer-review.

true,nycsurfer,num22,,"I admit that this opinion is not based on too too much, but here are my reasons...  

First, Chadli has the same number of goals (2: Villa and Anzhi for Chadli | Villa and Tibsli for Townsend -- same level of difficulty) and assists than Townsend in much much less playing time (source: table on the right -- ESPN says Townsend has 0 [how do we have a winger with no assists!?  How can Soldado score without service?] and Chadli has 1).  

Second, Chadli seems less selfish.  I applaud Townsend's work rate.  But, IMO, he is hoping to become the next Bale by launching shots toward the goal.  We have a clinical finisher in the box but he goes for goal himself.  I think I watched Kaboul make more crosses than Townsend in the last match (no evidence, just anecdotal).  Townsend is infuriating to watch.  And I know this is a product of having inverted wingers, but man, he makes me want to punch a wall sometimes.  I have a feeling that Chadli will be more willing to distribute and cross.  

Third, I think Chadli has more experience.  He has played in the CL, more international experience, an Eredivisie title run, etc.  This all indicates, to me, that he might be able to handle a little more pressure and still be able to perform.  

Fourth, Chadli brings a little more flair and sexiness (okay, A LOT more sexiness).  ",0,1384376828,null,0,false,0,cddmk2s,t3_1qjo6c,t1_cddmk2s,t1_cddkg7g,null,1428672144,13,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,13

&gt; ""Crashes involving bikes mostly driverâs fault""

&gt; More than two thirds of all crashes between drivers and cyclists in Central London are the fault of the motorist, research indicates. 

&gt; The City of Westminster Council found that drivers were to blame for 68 per cent of collisions between cyclists and motor vehicles in the borough in the past 12 months. It found that cyclists were at fault for only 20 per cent. In the remaining 12 per cent of cases, no cause could be found or both parties were to blame. 

You're lucky you've never had a problem, but that doesn't mean just because you haven't that other people aren't using ""common sense""

&gt; I've commuted by bike in a large city, on busy roads and big roundabouts and ride around that same city every week, but never had an issue just because I use common sense.

I've been hit by a delivery van who knew I was there (he overtook and just moved into me) and recently had a person jump into a cycle path, resulting in a broken collar bone for me.

https://www.dropbox.com/s/366h6bgafhs9at4/pedestriansbrf_2.pdf

&gt; In 2010, the vast majority â 99% â of KSI (killed or seriously injured) pedestrians in urban areas
â i.e. areas where pedestrians are most likely to be â were the result of a collision with a motor
vehicle.

&gt; From 2001 to 2010 (inclusive), out of the total num
bers of pedestrians killed by car or cycle in any location (i.e. in the road or on the footway), cycles were i nvolved in only 0.6% of fatalities and 1% of serious injuries

&gt;In 2010, cycles accounted for about 1.9% of all urban, non-motorway vehicular traffic, but were
involved in 1.1% of pedestrian fatalities and 1.5% of serious pedestrian casualties.

&gt; there are people who flaunt the law regardless of their mode of transport.

Didn't say there aren't.  But the consequences of those actions are very different.  Yet it's also brought up when ever there's a cycling death, that cyclists are the ones always disobeying laws etc.  Every time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In 2010, the vast majority â 99% â of KSI (killed or seriously injured) pedestrians in urban areas â i.e. areas where pedestrians are most likely to be â were the result of a collision with a motor vehicle.

Because cars are obviously much better at killing people when used improperly - no one denies that - several tons of metal and lots of power are going to do a lot more than a cyclist. But that doesn't mean  that cyclists never kill or cause injuries.

&gt; From 2001 to 2010 (inclusive), out of the total num bers of pedestrians killed by car or cycle in any location (i.e. in the road or on the footway), cycles were i nvolved in only 0.6% of fatalities and 1% of serious injuries

That sounds like it's being diluted by car usage. I think it'd be better if it was cyclist accidents compared against cycle usage, not against cars and cyclists (where cars will obviously cause more damage)

&gt; In 2010, cycles accounted for about 1.9% of all urban, non-motorway vehicular traffic, but were involved in 1.1% of pedestrian fatalities and 1.5% of serious pedestrian casualties.

I'm tired but it sounds like cyclists cause a reasonably proportionate amount of fatalities/casualties in line with usage?

&gt; Didn't say there aren't. But the consequences of those actions are very different. Yet it's also brought up when ever there's a cycling death, that cyclists are the ones always disobeying laws etc. Every time.

That isn't what I said, at least. I just said that there are ""plenty of prick cyclists"", just as you can get prick motorists, lorry drivers or pedestrians. Cyclists shouldn't be blamed automatically (as with any road user) but neither should they always be absolved of blame - even your own stats show that cyclists do indeed cause some accidents and fatalities.

&gt; Damn right some of us have a grudge given the treatment we get for cycling to work.

If I wanted them to be seen as a legitamite threat in Season 8/9 ... have them kill Clara. Kill her dead. Dead for good. Not the weird Rory-everyone-lives-Rose-just-this-once type of death that feels a little too common to me. Have them kill Clara, and have the doctor grieve. Have them chase the Doctor. Run him into the ground over several episodes. Towards the end of the season, The Doctor flees to a planet. Solves a mystery. Everything seems good. Doctor makes new friends. As he's flying away, waving and grinning like a dopey mofo, DALEK BATTLESHIP OUT OF NOWHERE BITCHES. Destroys that planet Deathstar style. End of episode, Doctor screaming in rage/agony.

Final two episodes. The Doctor, still grieving Clara and in an attempt to  avenge his new friends attacks the Daleks head on. Destroys some, but eventually captured. Daleks use Tardis to make Doctor relive painful moments over and over again. At the end of the season, Doctor escapes and hides using chameleon arch. Important point here, Daleks are not wiped out. Daleks survive. Shows in this instance, the Doctor is not able to destroy them and is overpowered.

Gives additional depth to the Doctor. gives further justification to his absolute hatred of the Daleks.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Let's imagine a case where there's a manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer involved:

Manufacturer makes a widget. They use Â£100 worth of raw materials - for which they pay Â£120 (Â£100 + Â£20 VAT). They sell the widget for Â£150 (Â£180 inc. VAT).

Their VAT return looks like this (I've slightly simplified this, but you get the idea):

    VAT due on sales and other outputs (Box 1)  : Â£30 
    Total VAT due (Box 3)  : Â£30
    VAT reclaimed on purchases and other inputs (Box 4)  : Â£20 
    Net VAT to be paid to Customs (or reclaimed) (Box 5)  : Â£10 
    Total value of sales excluding VAT (Box 6)  : Â£150
    Total value of purchases excluding VAT (Box 7)  : Â£100

Manufacturer pays Â£10 to HMRC.


Now the wholesaler comes in and buys the widget for Â£150 (+20% VAT). They resell it for Â£200 (+VAT) - so the sale price is Â£240 inc. VAT.


    VAT due on sales and other outputs (Box 1)  : Â£40
    Total VAT due (Box 3)  : Â£40
    VAT reclaimed on purchases and other inputs (Box 4)  : Â£30
    Net VAT to be paid to Customs (or reclaimed) (Box 5)  : Â£10
    Total value of sales excluding VAT (Box 6)  : Â£200
    Total value of purchases excluding VAT (Box 7)  : Â£150 

Wholesaler pays Â£10 to HMRC. So far, HMRC have had Â£20.


Now it's the retailer. They buy widgets from the wholesaler at Â£200 (+VAT) which they sell to the customer for Â£250 (+VAT, Â£300 inc. VAT).

Their VAT return (again, grossly simplified) goes like this:

    VAT due on sales and other outputs (Box 1)  : Â£50
    Total VAT due (Box 3) : Â£50
    VAT reclaimed on purchases and other inputs (Box 4)  : Â£40
    Net VAT to be paid to Customs (or reclaimed) (Box 5)  : Â£10
    Total value of sales excluding VAT (Box 6)  : Â£250
    Total value of purchases excluding VAT (Box 7)  : Â£200

Retailer pays Â£10 to HMRC.

HMRC have had - after everything is added up - Â£30 in VAT. 

Where businesses can come unstuck is if they don't keep enough money back to pay HMRC. VAT's due to be paid... ooh, I think it's about six weeks after the end of the quarter. You can't usefully do a VAT return until you're absolutely certain you've got all your invoices (both sales invoices for things you've sold and purchase invoices for things you've bought) accounted for, which realistically means that at best you can't complete it until a week or so after the end of the quarter.

Meaning that if you didn't keep that Â£10 back to pay HMRC, you've got **at best, assuming you're organised enough to prepare your VAT return at the earliest opportunity** five weeks to find it or have a very interesting conversation with the taxman.",0,1384380916,null,0,1384381397,0,cddohph,t3_1qiv8n,t1_cddohph,t1_cddns9o,null,1428671171,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Use [My Fitness Pal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com)and one of its phone apps for calorie counting and do some exercise.  

Don't cut down masses. Work out height/age/weight to get an idea of how many cals you are meant to eat a day and then maybe cut 200 off that to start. Go for a walk at lunch time if your not very active and build it up over a couple of months.  If your like me and go balls out exercising and dieting, you'll give up in 3 weeks and put all the weight back on again.

For me in the past. the key was cutting out carbs and fat as much as possible with out going mental. I have also found that drinking big glasses of water 3 or 4 times a day help as it makes you feel full.  Finding time to exercise a bit is hard though but there are so many advantages you just have to do it even if it means getting up early or something.

Increasing them over time is a good point, it'd be easy to forget that.

Ah there are a couple of other options, income drawdown being the main one. You can withdraw up to a particular amount per year, and the money stays invested. It's more risk, but you're in more control and have more control over what happens when you die if there's money left over.

Here's the exact same one I have on the back:

If a driver hits me, he's a fucking blind cunt that shouldn't be on the road.  Maybe said driver should open his eyes?  Maybe I should have flairs attached to my helmet and lasers?  A huge flag?

Watching Liverpool Football Club is one of the greatest things to ever happen to my life and I don't know what the past 18 years would be like without it. It's one of the greatest collectives in the history of sports and once you get it, there's no greater high. OP will be in heaven when he gets it. But that will come. Trying to do something, settle in too fast, or be something you're not is never a good thing and you'll get outed for it. The New York City is a very transient city and we get visitors and supporters from all walks of life. With football exploding exponentially every year due to increased coverage, its inevitable that the support base will grow. From a third person point of view, I see quite a few conversations that end with an uncomfortable silence due to some of the things said. You can definitely sense it from the natives when I go over for a match and you step into the likes of The Sandon and The Albert for example. Definitely at The Park on match days since its a stones throw away from the ground. Times like that I just keep relatively quiet and enjoy the mood with my friends and make new ones on the way.

One of the only ribs that the Bitters have about Liverpool Football Club is that they say they're the real Liverpudlian club, The People's Club, since LFC has so many foreign supporters. Most of the foreign Liverpool supporters will say they don't mind it, but they do to a point. Some even blame us for the allocation of tickets to be too much for foreign supporters knocking other Scouse out of the ground which you do have to say is true in a way. (The finances of football. That's another story.) Just seen heard too many people get a ""Fack off"" as a response. 

Foreign supporters, I think, will always be behind in the count at the initial start regardless.

true,lampfiles,null,null,"I started with ""The Unearthly Child"" and and committed to one episode a day. Sometimes I'll skip a day or if I'm particularly invested in a story (The War Games) I'll watch two a day. The pacing is slow especially in the first few seasons. However even when I felt bogged down or bored I reminded myself that it was only twenty minutes and then I could do something else.  

The thing is that slow feeling eventually kind of stopped and I found myself looking forward to my daily dose of classic Doctor Who. I embraced the hokey cliff hangers and rubber suits. I started growing attached to companions. I found myself heartbroken when Ian and Barbara left the Tardis and didn't know if I could go on. I honestly wish I could rediscover the second season of Doctor Who and experience it for the first time all over again. The first Doctor along with Ian, Barbara, and Vicki is one of my favorite character combinations the show has ever done (2nd Doctor with Jamie and Zoe is also up there). I watched The Underwater Menace episode with trepidation thinking there was no way Patrick Troughton could replace William Hartnell. I even felt a little sad when I finished the black and white episodes and started Spearhead From Space. It was the end of an era and the show has a very different feel and look after this. At the time The Enemy of the World and Web of Fear hadn't been recovered. I'm excited to go back and finally watch those. 

With this method I'm currently on Season 11 Death to the Daleks. Sarah Jane has just shown up and I'm finishing up the Third Doctor. 

My suggestion is don't over do it. Skip the reconstructions and audio only episodes. I made the mistake trying to go through Marco Polo and almost quit the whole thing. Read recaps instead. That way you kind of get an idea about what is going on. It also helps when companions leave. The only reconstructions I watched were episodes one and four of The Invasion. They were done fairly well. I also watched the First Doctor's regeneration and listened to Vicki, Katarina, and Steven's departures.

Also, as a committed pedestrian, I don't doubt cyclists have to face bad drivers, but I've nearly been hit by more cyclists jumping lights, riding pavements, and going down the street the wrong way than I have cars. It gets even worse at this time of year, as there are quite a few who don't wear lights. 

I'm not saying these deaths are the fault of cyclists, but people are taking serious risks - it just astounds me how so many cyclists seem oblivious to their surroundings. But I guess cyclists would say the same of many car and lorry drivers.

I post these mostly in addition to many of the other suggestions people are posting here...

**Smith:**

I've actually had really good success with ""A Town Called Mercy"" for the sci-fi spaghetti western laced with comedy.  Has a little bit of everything.

""The Eleventh Hour"" if you know someone WANTS to be hooked.  If someone is unsure about the show though, it's not generally a good idea to have to explain regeneration so soon.

""Vincent and The Doctor""  /feels.

**Tennant:**

I've had a lot of 'stereotypical females' that thought ""Partners in Crime"" was pretty funny.  

""Fear Her"" highlights the Doctor's empathetic and methodical sides.

**Eccleston:**

""Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways"" is a good way to have that conversation about regeneration, and has all the 'Weakest Link'/'Big Brother' references for TV junkies. 

""Dalek"" isn't as much of a fan fav, but is a good way to introduce Daleks and the Doctor/Companion dynamic.

&gt;&gt;JR James was a major figure in the history of planning. He was chief planner at the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and professor of town and regional planning at the University of Sheffield between 1967 and 1977, before his untimely death in 1980.

&gt;&gt;He left the department his vast collection of slides and documents which are believed to have been completely lost for more than 30 years. They give a nostalgic view of how urban spaces across the UK from Sheffield to Milton Keynes to Norwich and Newcastle have developed in the post-war period.

&gt;&gt;Students Philip Brown and Joseph Carr, who put the archive together, hope it will provide a valuable resource for present and future planners and for members of the public with an interest in cities, new towns or urban development in the UK and elsewhere over the past 50 years.

&gt;&gt;The project was funded by the University of Sheffield Alumni Fund and directed by Town and Regional Planningâs Dr Alasdair Rae.

&gt;&gt;He said: âIt is a great pleasure to be able to launch the JR James digital archive.

&gt;&gt;âIâm constantly fascinated by the photographs and documents in this archive - itâs fantastic that the public can now enjoy a rare glimpse of the UKâs planning heritage so easily. The hard work of our students has ensured that this important collection is accessible to more people now and in the future.

&gt;&gt;âPhilip and Joseph have produced an extraordinarily rich and important archive.â

&gt;&gt;Many of the images were in a poor state and not categorised when discovered in their original format. Some did not have captions, or were rather vaguely titled, and a number of images remain classified as âunknownâ. Dr Rae is asking people to view the archive by visiting the website and helping to identify the unknown locations using the online commentary boxes.

&gt;&gt;The archive is now live and can be viewed at www.flickr.com/people/jrjamesarchive",0,1384412371,null,0,false,0,cde0z30,t3_1qlm7c,t1_cde0z30,t3_1qlm7c,null,1428665335,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,hybridjatt,indigo,You already know how this will end.,"What a fantastic episode - Rudy's character development here was paced extremely well. They brought him around in a way that made sense - not too quickly, with reluctance on his part, and very meaningful in the end. Sure, the actual substance of the episode was fairly predictable (the what), but the manner in which they moved through the episode (the how) was poignant and effective.

Interesting how Rudy's tendency to care only about himself played out here - the irony is that he overcame it in this episode literally by caring about himself (albeit a different version). He saw how kind the other version of himself was with everyone, and became aware of that potential within himself as well. When he finally really opened up his heart through his treatment of Rudy 2, he found himself able to be honest with Jess about his feelings. Dat development.

I cracked up throughout the episode as usual. I think everyone's already quoted the good jokes.

I'm really pleased with how Season 5 has been progressing so far. It's to early to tell, but at this point it seems like it's doing the show justice as a final season.

Also, I know someone already asked, but does anyone know the song played near the end of the episode when Rudy and Jess are talking on the bench? Maybe /u/sonofthewear?

For what to start watching: You can go from the beginning with 1 but I would actually recommend watching one great story from each Doctor.  My list would be:

* 1st Doctor - *The Daleks*

* 2nd Doctor - *The War Games*

* 3rd Doctor - *The Green Death*

* 4th Doctor - *City of Death*

* 5th Doctor - *The Caves of Androzani*

When it was seen to be failing he had no Plan B, and declared that it had always been his intention to create a battle of attrition. He lied. 

General Rawlinson refused to hear any officers who said his own plans were failing, even going so far as to try and have all of his order papers recovered from the front lines and destroyed after they been distributed. He tried to lie. 

Air pilots who flew over lines saying they hadn't been breached, barbed wire hadn't been cut, were ignored and dismissed. Their evidence was just too much trouble to deal with and meant plans had to be changed - that meant an embarrassing acceptance that the generals had been wrong and needed to try something else, even, heaven forbid - stop the slaughter. That would have meant accepting they were wrong.

Yes, the generals hadn't come across this type of warfare before, but a complete lack of imagination, adaptability, honesty and interest in what was actually happening at the front is revealed again and again - they were based 20 miles from the front lines - a day away from the battle. A full day. That meant it took a day for information to get to them from the front lines, a day for information to travel back. And they knew that.

I'd go on, but I need to get in the shower and go to work - already late...

The best solution seems to be to separate cyclists from the rest of traffic entirely, but I'd guess that's still quite a way off.

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"I don't cycle, i find the idea scary, (and my commute is a bit far). But I welcome bikers, and do my best to watch for them and give them space.

All I ask for is lights. 1 steady white on the front and a steady red on the back. Roads aren't always well lit. Blinky LEDs are hard to distance.

Where I live (a town centre) it's not your hobbyist cyclists you get ,or your commuters. There's no high vis, no lights, just people riding round a residential estate. And that's fine. But they give absolutely no consideration to the rules of the road. I'm not talking they skip a red light when it's safe. I'm talking they see the pavement and the road as one space, driving on a certain side of the road is for other people, left middle or right is fair game. If they are riding together they might choose different sides each leading to you being passed on both sides.

They basically act like fast unpredictable pedestrians that don't stick to the pavement.

The main through road is busy, it's got a residential shopping strip, (grocers, butchers, tesco, chemists etc.) cars parked both sides, leaving one lane for traffic passing both ways, it's residential and not incredibly well lit in places. It's not a road that was designed to have that much traffic on. You can't drive fast, it's impossible, it has speed bumps but it doesn't need them.

You can, and people do, however cycle at speed, weaving in and out of parked cars on and off the pavement, riding out of blind corners without looking. But the scary one is when you first see the cyclist riding into the range of your dipped headlights as they have no lights, no reflectors, wearing black, on a badly lit street at speed often with no or one hand on the handlebars down the middle of the road.",0,1384421853,null,0,false,0,cde2re3,t3_1qjuam,t1_cde2re3,t1_cddjepr,null,1428664464,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

What happened recently was that a company called Liberty Global (huge cable/TV company) bought VM - so now Branson/Virgin get nothing other than licence payments from VM (a brand that they intend to keep for now, they use the UPC brand in other countries).

1. Even getting even every month is a reason good enough to move. However, plenty of people don't just get even. They save money and not only to move back but to buy a house in UK or pay for a holiday. From my point of view, even NMW in UK is not a bad amount of money (if you live outside of London where houses are cheaper). Obviously you won't be going to a pub every few days but we are used to that - it's only wealther nationanls who think that partying every weekend is something normal;

2. Also fishing and later eating that fish. It's ""so crude"" in opinion of UK people but well, they actually do it fish, don't they? Only difference that fish is from commercial sources. I'm surprised Brits get so annoyed at that. Isn't it really rewarding when you eat the fish that you caught it with your own hands? I know that may be because of regulations and lack of procedures and actual will. If fisherman want to take the fish home, just increase their fees. Personally, I don't do fishing nor eat much of it.

3. Part of people yes. However, even when people have opportunity to work and make normal living they very often choose drugs ""just because"". It may be sad to say but a certain number of people will always struggle. That is why there is no possibility to decrease unemployment (unless it's a communist state!) to absolute minimum or 0. Some will not work just because they are lazy. Also, when certain nation is generally wealthy they can find ways to increase employment. In example of UK it is to switch free benefits to actually doing some work, even simple, sweeping streets and similiar. If there is money for benefits there will be for those jobs.

4. Not really. UK is a nation which predicts prices. Money in UK allows to buy more in UK - not necessarily in Poland. Look at the prices of cars. In UK you can buy one for 10k, in Poland for 50k while at the same time you earn roughly 1:1 (now it is bit more in Poland). How long do you have to save money to buy a car in UK earning 2k, while earning 2k of PLN in Poland. Life is simply easier and affordable in UK and also in other western nations. Plenty of Poles went to UK because of language (English and German were in school, not French or Spanish). Also, similiar climate in UK and Poland, where southern nations can be bit too warm.

The general idea is broadly right - the company who charges you Â£50 VAT will not be paying Â£50 to HMRC - but note the manufacturer bought raw materials and paid VAT on those materials.

Where did they come from and how much VAT did the supplier of raw materials pay? There's every possibility that somewhere in the chain there's one or more items that don't attract VAT at all but some sort of process somewhere turns them into something that does attract VAT.

Take biscuits, for instance. A plain biscuit is considered an essential item and doesn't attract VAT - you could buy a packet of digestives and you wouldn't pay VAT on it.

You can also buy chocolate intended for cooking purposes and that doesn't attract VAT either. (A bar of chocolate sold for eating such as a bar of Cadbury's Dairy Milk does attract VAT, so don't buy one of those!).

Melt that chocolate down, add milk and sugar (cooking chocolate is quite bitter), cover the biscuits in it. Sell those biscuits.

You are now selling chocolate covered biscuits and they **do** attract VAT.

This is the sort of thing where you start to involve an accountant (which I'm not) because it's incredibly easy to misunderstand the law, fail to charge your customers VAT and then the taxman comes knocking on your door and demands 20% of your income - he doesn't care that you haven't charged customers VAT when you should have done, the fact that you can't very well go back to your customers and ask them to pay 20% more is Not His Problem.

So that's almost as large as the all the cuts made to the deficit so far (I make that ~Â£50bn). Do you think it would be fair to stick to these cuts, and continue making further cuts, while business was getting a free ride?

&gt;I'd go with a temporarily bigger deficit, but there'd be long term gain because of businesses flocking here since it would be an English speaking tax haven in the EU.

The problem with becoming a tax haven is that the businesses that flock here wouldn't necessarily employ a lot of people here, or do a lot of business here. The businesses based in the Cayman Islands will actually have 99.99% of their employees and do 99.99%% of their business in other countries.

&gt;It'd also allow small businesses to spend the money they were paying in corporation tax to expand their businesses, hiring more people, etc.

It would help small businesses but not that much. If they have a 5% profit margin and are currently paying 20% corporation tax that takes their profit margin down to 4%, so they could save 1% of their turnover. They would probably benefit more from other cuts to their costs i.e. employers national insurance contributions. I work for a small business and don't think that cutting corporation tax to 0% would transform their business enough for them to start employing more people.

I think that rather than abolish corporation tax, we need to find a way to make bigger companies pay as much as the smaller ones. For companies like G4S and ATOS this would be simple, as the government could just refuse to do business with them while they were avoiding tax.",0,1384428888,null,0,false,0,cde3paj,t3_1qiv8n,t1_cde3paj,t1_cde3f9f,null,1428664025,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

More people on bikes means less motor traffic, which means more space for those using motor vehicles.  The car should be inconvenienced in cities though, they're clogged the streets up, damaging them, killing people and causing a lot of pollution.

It's really not. Enrique's better.

&gt; A ball player with great passing range has been lacking since Alonso was moved.

Have you not watched Gerrard for the past two seasons? This is something we certainly do not need.

But yeah, we do need a new midfielder - just not an Alonso. We need a mobile, goalscoring midfielder.

Other than that, I wouldn't say no to a proper winger, which we've managed to have exactly none of once again. (Sterling's still developing).

I'd much rather get one or both of the above than another striker. The only way to move forward now isn't to buy more bench strength, it's to buy first XI players that push our current starters to the bench. We can't start another striker, and if one of Suarez/Sturridge gets injured, we switch to 4-2-3-1 - so having striker cover for them isn't so essential.

I was rather impressed and shocked that they actually made 8 renounce the name of the Doctor and essentially break the promise. I thought they'd make 9/War Doctor be the everything-that-is-bad-about-the-Doctor-regeneration, and that the ones before and after weren't ""in on it"". This way it essentially makes 8 the bad egg, as he actively chooses to become a warrior and leave the good man behind.

I honestly thought I'd be more upset if they were going to change the entire numbering of the relaunch Doctors, but I can't say it's bothering me at all. Even though I still can't quite fathom that 11 is actually 12 and 13 will come this Christmas. It fit quite nicely, and I honestly think that the numbering won't be a problem for anything other than the regeneration limit. People (and maybe even the Doctor himself) will keep referring to 12 as 11 and 10 as 9 and so forth, and just calling 9 War Doctor. Pushing the regeneration limit hit closer to the present is an interesting move and I can't wait to see how that will play out.

I also really liked that they didn't show present-Hurt in the episode, instead they used an old image of him and used it as a reflection. Making it even more cannon that regenerations *do* age, and that he's been fighting in the war for a really long time (12 is supposed to have been roaming about for 2-300 years, and he doesn't look much older at all).

The fans even named him man of the match against Man Utd in a league cup match a season or so ago and then his performances forced Glen Johnson to left back in a derby game against Everton.

Carragher named him as a player who has the raw potential to have a massive role in the club for years to come; and in true Carragher fashion ""Kelly chases every ball down and goes in hard for every tackle"" Rodgers also said ""His hunger to play and win games and leadership skills are already reminiscent of a young Jamie Carragher""

* The Hurt Doctor is indisputably 9a
* The choice not to become a ""Doctor"" wasn't made by The War Doctor (Hurt), it was made by The Doctor (McGann)
* The War Doctor fought the Time War for a hell of a long time. He's a youthful John Hurt in that reflection
* The whole ""Time Lords are as bad as the Daleks"" isn't a value judgement made by The Doctor - and he knew how evil they'd become when he ""enlisted""

The idea that everyone needs to change their lifestyles, live in ecohomes and seldom use energy is really a misdirection. Industry uses far more energy than individuals anyway.

The energy is available, it's not finite. It just requires investment. Private capital only invests when the marginal cost &lt; marginal price. As time goes on the marginal cost decreases (and due to market forces and scarcity price increases too).

I will post my criticisms, but the fact that we saw 8 in action again, even if it was only for a few minutes is SO DAMN GOOD.

CGI spaceship, looked like it was on a string, don't know if that was intentional or not but it looked ridiculous.
The lady choosing suicide, stupid and completely unrealistic (I know we don't have the context) but really? There is no way I could ever believe that.
Again the goblets full of dry ice? What year is it Steven Moffat. Every time there is some kind of goblet in Doctor Who it just makes me cringe.
8ths regeneration, did not like, he didn't get back in the TARDIS?
Biggest criticism though, not ENOUGH OF 8!!!

Can another branch of the BBC please begin producing a series for the 8th Doctor!
And of course I personally have huge problems with John Hurt being the 9th Doctor, I don't care what he calls himself, he is still the goddamn 9th Doctor. I have an even bigger problem that the current Doctor can't man up and accept his John Hurt self, he has killed a lot of people himself and it's still him.

Politicians, government departments, companies, charities, celebrities â they do not hire PR teams out of vanity. They know that protecting and nurturing their reputations is vital if they are to be able to meet their objectives. That is why PR is becoming a professional service, not miles away from legal or financial advice.

'Spin' is just a by-product of the way we consume media these days. Natural progression of things really. As someone who works in advertising and speaks to PR people every day I assume he never approached an important situation by going: ""how can we best get our message across to the voters"", but rather, ""how can we best communicate this to the press so they will report on it as favourably as possible"".

Charlotte Elspeth Pollard â known to her friends as Charley â was a female human companion of the Eighth Doctor. Later, she came to travel with the Sixth Doctor. Her existence was always legally problematic for the Doctor.

When he met her in his eighth incarnation, he saved her from what should have been her natural death, although it was what the Tenth Doctor would later call a ""fixed point in time"". (AUDIO: Storm Warning; COMIC: Fugitive) This act of compassion was a violation of the Laws of Time. It destabilised the Web of Time and forced the Time Lords to send him into exile in the Divergent Universe. (AUDIO: Zagreus)



Caris? no idea




Lucie was born in Blackpool on 31 July 1988. (AUDIO: Brave New Town) Lucie's mother was Mary Miller (nÃ©e Ryder). (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks, Horror of Glam Rock)

In 1992, an incident at a children's party left her with a lifelong distaste for jelly. (AUDIO: Orbis
Lucie was at first an unwilling passenger in the Doctor's TARDIS, having been placed with the Doctor as part of a ""Time Lord witness protection programme."" She told the Doctor the Time Lords had placed her in his care because she had seen something important; she didn't know what. Her initial attitude towards the Doctor was disdainful, but she recognised he was ""about saving worlds"". (AUDIO: Blood of the Daleks)




Tamsin came from Dulwich and was an actress. Before she met the Doctor, her career was going badly due to her age. She answered an advertisement which read:

**Tory MP weeps over discovery that his Brazilian wife is Â£70-a-time suburban prostitute**

He said he wanted to become famous for his political achievements. But yesterday a Tory MP was thrown into the spotlight for a very different reason â after his wife of seven years was exposed as a Â£70-an-hour prostitute.

Mike Weatherley, 53, was one of the new wave of MPs who came to power with Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this year.

The father-of-three took his blonde wife to functions in the run-up to the General Election, and just two months ago she was photographed visiting the Houses of Parliament.

But it was revealed by a Sunday newspaper that 39-year-old Carla has also been busy plying her trade in three different 'massage parlours', under the names Bea, Adriana and Bianca.

The lorry driver's daughter, who is alleged to have worked as a prostitute in her native Brazil before marrying Mr Weatherley, was caught on camera performing a sexy striptease in pink and black polka dot underwear for an undercover reporter.

She said she worked in three brothels and charged Â£70 an hour for sex. 'I like it here, nice clients, nice people, nice place and good money,' she told the Sunday Mirror.

The shocking revelation is bound to prove an embarrassment to Mr Cameron, who is pictured smiling at Mr Weatherley's side on the MP's personal website.

The couple are understood to have met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, while business executive Mr Weatherley was on a work trip.

They married in Brighton in 2003. It was the MP's second marriage and, at the time, the new Mrs Weatherley's occupation was listed as 'housewife'.

She is reported to have gone home to Brazil in 2007, returning two years later when her husband asked her to assist him ahead of his election campaign.

But that was a decision Mr Weatherley may have been regretting yesterday. The MP, who insists that he has been separated from his wife since February this year, wept when approached at his home in Brighton yesterday. 

He said he had no idea that Mrs Weatherley had been selling her body, but claimed they had remained good friends since their separation.



'I am still very shocked by the news and am trying to come to terms with it,' he said. 'I do have proof that we have been separated since February which I can show if needed.'

When I referred to lifestyle change I didn't really just mean that we'd all live in teletubby houses.  I'm well aware industry uses lots of energy, but industrial production would likely have to be ramped down a bit as well.  It's all tied together, I'm not trying to separate industry from living standards or anything, they're quite bound up.  That's all fairly congruent I think.  Things like people having fewer cars, or goods or whatever would be part of it.  But then again, given how much stuff is just made and then thrown away not long after, this needn't be a bad thing per se.

And honestly, I don't believe that blind market forces alone should drive energy policy or research.  There's much more to think about than profit margins.  And certainly, bar some pretty serious breakthroughs in fusion or something, the time of cheap energy is somewhat limited.  There are physical limits on the amount of oil you can get out of the ground, and frankly there's no other substance like the stuff for energy density and convenience.

Introduces Rose as a character and modern Who. Does a good job for new viewers.

**Dalek**

Introduces the Daleks, mentions of the Time War and The Doctor's hatred of them.

**Bad Wolf**

**The Parting of the Ways**

Brilliant ending, more Daleks and mentioning of the Time War as well as an introduction to regeneration, and ofcourse the Bad Wolf. Also Tennant.

**The Girl in the Fireplace**

Not too much significance, but a good episode. A lot of Doctor mythos.

*Series 3:*
______________________________
**Blink**

No reason. Just great fun, she's never seen it.

**The Sound of Drums**

While it's weird to have it in the middle of a series of episodes, it does well the explain The Master, Gallifrey and the Time Lords before the War.

**The End of Time 1 &amp; 2**

Hints of the Time War again, we see the Time Lords for the first time in newWho. Tennant's farewell.

Ill answer in a more pragmatic way.

&gt;Does this cycle superhighway give cyclists automatic right of way....
If the answer is yes is the problem that drivers haven't been made aware of this?

Cycle lanes do give priority to cyclists, I don't believe there is any doubt about that. I don't believe that the priority of any lane (be that cycle or bus lane, or any car lane) changes at junctions. If the cycle lane leads to or around a junction they should be safe in that lane and other traffic needs to filter or pass taking those in that lane into account.

But the problem is a little more complicated than either drivers or cyclists being at fault.

The reality is large vehicles have blind spots - they wait at lights/junctions to the right of cycle lanes, cyclists assume (and rightly so) that the cycle lane is safe. The large vehicle assumes the cycle lane is empty (because of blind spots) and makes his move to turn left oblivious to the cyclist in their way.

so the problems are....

cyclists assuming large vehicles can see them.

large vehicles assuming the path is clear, because it looks clear.


And the problems are compounded by bad design.

Nether of which really have anything todo with priority

I've noticed a huge increase in dangerous driving within London. The problem is there's never a police officer around to catch the perpetrators. A couple of weeks ago, I was nearly hit by a black cab. There was a police car behind the black cab. The officers inside must have seen everything, but did nothing (probably too much paperwork involved). Ask yourselves this: how many cyclists do you know? How many stories have they told you about near misses or actual collisions? A cyclist from my work recently told me about a driver who, from a stationary position, purposefully rammed into the back of him because he (the cyclist) decided to take the blue area designated for cyclists at the lights.

Drivers are generally very impatient, to the point where they'd rather risk a cyclist's life instead of waiting a few seconds. Is this really what it has come to? Something needs to be done. This government needs to act. Hot air and twisting statistics (i.e. Boris Johnson claiming that as a percentage cycling fatalities have been reduced in London) will not suffice. There needs to be a zero tolerance policy adopted by traffic police - if a driver drives dangerously, he/she should be charged, and should lose his/her license for a few months. Curbs are some other barrier needs to be erected to completely separate the cycling area from cars. Another suggestion: cyclists should wear cameras and upload dangerous incidents to YouTube for the police to investigate.

Would you get on to a spaceship with a Dalek or would you trust yourself to your own fate, rather than whatever tortures and painful death they would have in store for you?

Importantly, this sets up the Doctor's decision to regenerate into the War Doctor. Her death forces him to look at his choices and to take part in the Time War in order to be able to put an end to it.

Anyone driving a car learns pretty fast that being to the left of a HGV/bus when it's turning left is somewhere you should avoid being. Either you out accelerate them (easy on a car, not so easy on a bike) or you hold back until you can judge their turning circle.

A large portion of these deaths so far have involved buses and lorries. It's possible some of them have been down to dangerous lane changes by the larger vehicles, the lack of charges seems to indicate it wasn't that level of careless driving.

I read a lot on cyclist blogs that busses should have better coverage for the drivers so they can check their coverage but that isn't a solution.

Cyclists need to be taught in the same way that car drivers are taught: that you should drive defensively. Yes they should be aware of your position but you should drive as if there's a good chance you're invisible to him. 

You may be 'in the right' but that's scant consolation when you're in the hospital (or worse). Drive defensively and you find that the number of accidents you get in that both are and aren't your fault goes down dramatically.

Yes, one puts unwarranted wear and tear on the pavements and often blocks or narrows the pavement for pedestrians.  They also kill and injure . . . the other is a bunch of twats which ultimately do very little harm, no matter how annoying it is.  The also injure people.

Urgh. This pisses me off so much, the same thing happened to me. Two weeks into a new role and their HR call me and even though it's in a sector I don't care for, convince me that it's such and interesting and dynamic role that I simply must be interviewed.

Later they tell me that they won't be inviting me back for a second interview because 'you're too enthusiastic about your current role.'

So liking your job is an unhireable offence? How about 'we love her enthusiasm for her work, we'd love her to be as enthusiastic about our company.' Nope.

I think I might've dodged a bullet though, one of the ladies couldn't find a good thing to say about the team when questioned. She was diplomatic but I read 'bunch of arseholes.'

Then if worst came to worst and two of those three got injured Alou Diarra can play CB, and Demel could probably cover too. Give it a while longer and Leo Chambers will be ready to act as backup too, in my opinion. 

We've got the same problem we've always had. No striker who will guarantee you 15 goals a season. I don't remember the last time we had that. Andy will be a big help when he's back - we were a different side when he played last season - but we need someone else who can score goals too. 

I think Nolan should probably be eased out of the side as well now. As a captain? Top draw. Organises people, gives them a kick up the arse when they need it and stands up for his team. As a player? He's gone downhill the past year or so. He can't handle longer than 60 minutes anymore. We need to shift Rav into AM and give him freedom to roam. Picking up the loose balls from Carroll (hypothetically speaking until he's back of course) and floating around the oppositions DM and back line. That'll allow Noble to do his thing in CM, with Diame or Collison (who I do still rate, but only when he plays in his natural position, centre mid, not on the fucking wing) next to him. 

Give Winston or Noble the armband. They run the team and keep it ticking over. 

I'm actually happy with our squad, it's just the lack of effective striker that is fucking us up so much right now. There is no position that I think we are particularly weak in, definitely not weak enough to be battling relegation, apart from up top. All our eggs in one basket with Carroll, and it's backfired. 

If we had a decent second striker, I'd be thrilled. But let's be honest, the shit we've got up top at the moment isn't good enough, as proven this season. Carlton isn't match fit and needs some kind of support if he does play, Modibo I won't even comment on and Petric is just a typical West Ham signing - looks to be a decent bit of cheap business, plays one game and gets injured. 

A bit of an essay and I did go pretty off topic, but I needed to vent. Not aimed at you personally haha.

I love the club and truly believe the squad is good enough for a 8-10th place finish, but without goals we can't do fuck all. Defensively I don't think anyone can moan. It's goals.

&gt; (1) A person is guilty of an offence if, with **intent to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress**, he... uses threatening, abusive or **insulting words** or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour,... thereby **causing** that or another person harassment, alarm or distress.

So the s4A offence is broader, not needing the fear of violence, just the intention to cause harassment or distress, and it actually causing that.

Which isn't quite as bad as the s5 offence, whereby you just need to carry out the behaviour etc. within the hearing or sight of someone likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress by it. But that only comes with a fine, not 6 months in prison.

Some of the UK's public order offences are ridiculously out-dated and easily abused.

&gt;An administrator at the Internet Archive HQ in San Francisco said its [guidance](http://archive.org/legal/faq.php) for lawyers explained the mechanism. That was that if a website, like Conservatives.com, put up a robot blocker, those pages it blocked would simply be erased from the record as a matter of etiquette.

It seems fair enough, but CW goes on to say

&gt;The erasure had the effect of hiding Conservative speeches in a secretive corner of the internet like those that shelter the military, secret services, gangsters and paedophiles.

Seriously? They edited their robots.txt, which they are perfectly at liberty to do, they didn't set up a paedophile network you can only access on Tor.

&gt;And it erased the official record of their speeches from the Internet Archive, the public record of the net - with an effect as alarming as sending Men in Black to strip history books from a public library and burn them in the car park.

As far as I can tell the archive erased them itself as a matter of courtesy? The Tory party hasn't done anything like sending MI5 (MI6?) officials over there to destroy their hard drive as if they were the Guardian.

No, I can't take the article your article linked seriously. Sorry. I stand by what I said.

I should point out I'm no supporter of the Tory party, just don't think this is a viable line of attack.

Although the new series started in 2005, it didn't even air in the U.S. until 2006. For a while it aired on the Sci Fi Channel and later BBC America.
 
The ratings for the new Doctor Who show were slow to grow, but by the 2nd Tennant season, it became a hit and Doctor Who fandom began to spread out more into the general population.

However there is another option, [CDS](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8184108.stm), that many doctors prefer and which I myself am far more willing to accept. Basically this practice sedates the patient with drugs so that they are no longer conscious and allows the person to die naturally without the doctor or nurse taking an active role in it. Now there is an example of it being mismanaged in that article so this is why I am still apprehensive about this and would want stricter controls.

With euthanasia the biggest worry for me is that people could have their cases mismanaged and die when, unlike with CDS patients, they could still have several healthy and active weeks/months left.

 I know this sounds a little far fetched but to be honest I'm a little worried about getting to a stage where people can be euthanised for ailments that are not terminal.

true,FalconHunter,jack,Jack Harkness,"A) McGann only had the one onscreen appearance, so there's a novelty to his portrayal. The movie was awful, but McGann's performance was nothing short of spectacular. As such, there was a mystique to him which was amplified by Eccleston's appearance in Series 1 as the 9th Doctor. There was a desire to know how the Doctor got from McGann's 8th to Eccleston's 9th. It's only a big deal because there's so little onscreen time for McGann that every appearance is thoroughly enjoyed. Also, he loves the role as much as Tennant does/did and is eager to participate in any opportunity they have for him as the 8th Doctor. 

B) Nothing. The classic series ties to the current series have already been covered in as much as it matters. If you weren't lost or caught off guard by Sarah Jane Smith in ""School Reunion,"" then you're fine. The canon events that are relevant to the 8th Doctor are that he encountered The Master and beat him in the 1996 movie. Outside of that, it's just tiny details that won't be addressed or don't matter to the current series or the 50th. 

You will want to get caught up on the current series, though, or the 50th may be confusing. In particular, Clara Oswald (the current companion.)

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi CompanyRepresentative, on your twitter feed you posted this http://imgur.com/yiZj2nA no dates for the eligibility of the discount code were given, further more your website accepted the code when I made my payment.



On the the terms and conditions section on your website it is stated that:

 âMost changes are minor. Occasionally, we have to make a âsignificant changeâ. A significant change is a change made before departure which, taking account of the information you give us at the time of booking and which we can reasonably be expected to know as a tour operator, we can reasonably expect to have a major effect on your excursion. Significant changes are likely to include the following changes when made before departure; a change of accommodation to that of a lower official classification or standard for the whole or a major part of the time you are away, a change of accommodation area for the whole or a major part of the time you are away, a change of outward departure time of 12 or more hours, a change of UK departure point to one which is more inconvenient for you and, in the case of tours, a significant change of itinerary missing out one or more major destination substantially or altogether.â

Informing me that I have to pay an extra Â£34 3 weeks after I paid for the holiday is what Iâd consider to be a âsignificant changeâ why has the error only been picked up now? Me and the majority of my fellow travellers in the same party as myself booked on the same date and not one of us has been contacted about this prior to today. A fee that is over a 25% increase on the original price is a significant change.


Further down on the terms and conditions page it is stated that

'If a significant change to your holiday arrangements is made to the holiday you have booked and for which you have received a confirmation invoice, or if we cancel the holiday within 4 weeks of the original departure date, you may choose to:
1) Accept the changed arrangements as notified to you by us (this may involve a change of resort).
2) Purchase a replacement holiday from us, of at least the same standard if available (and paying supplement or receiving a refund in respect of any price difference)
3) Cancel your holiday and receive a full and prompt refund of all monies paid to us.
We will pay compensation as detailed unless the change is for reasons beyond our control as described below. We will always refund the difference in price if the replacement holiday is of a lower standard and price. You must notify us of your choice within 7 days of our offer of alternative holiday arrangements. If you do not, we will assume your acceptance of the new holiday arrangement.'
Paying particular attention to the bold sentences, your website is under your control therefore by definition me and everybody else that has been asked to pay a further Â£34 is entitled to a full refund as an over 25% increase in price is a significant change.


Finally, it is stated that;

'If a significant change is made as a result of unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control , the consequences of which we could not have avoided even with due care which include but are not limited to those circumstances set out under the heading Force Majeure compensation we regret cannot be paidâ

Enabling a discount code on your website with no eligibility dates doesnât fall under the Heading âForce Majeureâ as the website is under your control it cannot be argued from your point that this situation was created by something out of your control.


Let me know how we can work this out.

Sincerely 

2902326

true,twcsata,null,null,"Basically, no, not in a few words :)  But I'll try.  You know from the new series that Christopher Eccleston is considered the Ninth Doctor.  Well, Paul McGann (from the mini-episode) is the eighth, but he only appeared onscreen once, in a tv movie in 1996.  So we never saw him regenerate into Eccleston's ninth Doctor.
Flash-forward to the most recent episode of Series Seven, ""The Name of the Doctor"".  We saw a glimpse into the Doctor's life history, and saw that there was an unfamiliar version of him, played by John Hurt.  The Eleventh Doctor explains that this is a version he tried to forget, because he did terrible things that were not worthy of the name of ""Doctor"".  Though it left us hanging, fans instantly theorized--and hints went out--that he was between Eight and Nine, but not numbered that way because he doesn't consider himself the Doctor.
Now we get the mini-episode, and it confirms it by showing us Eight regenerating into that mystery Doctor, or at least a younger version of him.  He did it deliberately because he was going to fight in the great Time War between the Time Lords and Daleks, and he knew it would require him to do things that the Doctor would never do--but that had to be done.
Now, the only regeneration never seen is from that Doctor into Nine.  But we can hope.
