But I disagree. There's usually plenty of very good discussion on this subreddit. Sure, there's some knee-jerk reactions and sometimes its difficult to go against the hivemind. But that happens to every subreddit once it has a fairly large number of subscribers. There are lots of people who regularly contribute here with lots of good content as well as discussion. And some people have worked really hard from day one to make this subreddit a good place, specially the mods (and it is a good place, compared to any other subreddit I can think of, imo). 

I'd personally want everyone, specially people like you (sometimes controversial maybe, but atleast you speak your mind and bring your own opinion into the discussion) to stay instead of just walking away.

Personally this whole Rafa thing is kind of stupid. Its really surprising and weird how polarized this sub has become over a silly issue like this. I've never seen anything like this before over here. But in the end we all want him gone, and would have preferred RDM to not be sacked. I think once this issue cools down, this sub will be back to normal as well.

So TL;DR : This subreddit very good. Me like a lot of people here. No go. All people stay. Rafa evil. He go. We live happily ever after.",0,1362096012,null,0,false,0,c8njg4c,t3_19eta4,t1_c8njg4c,t1_c8nj3km,null,1431442954,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

There are a few things you can do that might have some impact on their ability to steal public money in the guise of ""helping"" people back to work.

1. You could write a letter to the DWP asking for the money that Igneus are allegedly entitled to for helping you find a job - after all you found it yourself and the money would help keep you in work. For added kudos make sure your local paper, local councillors and MP are also aware of your letter.

2. Find out how many of your new co-workers are there getting ""work experience"" under the threat of benefit sanctions and surreptitiously let them know that they're victims of a forced labour scam.

3. Let everyone know about http://www.servitudecomplaint.org.uk and write some letters. Convince other people to write letters too.

4. Sign some petitions against the attacks on welfare and help force the government to look at helping people find work instead of taking away their support in the vain hope they'll somehow get a job instead of being tortured by JCP/DWP etc. http://wowpetition.com/

Wasn't it his brilliant move to bring in Aquilani? Ya that panned out really well. Any thoughts on his term at Inter and how he ruined an amazing side that Mourinho built, including ruining Snjider, arguably the best player in the world at the time? 

I said 6 years. I'll give him credit for Valencia, but since then he has been so tactically inept and has refused to change his style of play. He has been revealed for what he is, a tactical fraud. I do not consider ""luck"" a factor in football nor did I say such a thing about Rafa, please don't stick words in my mouth to sound more credible. I said Milan cocking up was more of a significant factor than any tactical brilliance on his part. 

I totally agree with you here, a good manger plays with what he has and not what he wants. Square peg is exactly what I would say. The reason why we are rubbish this year is because he refuses to stop playing the way he has been throughout his career. 

I'm sorry but it doesn't take time for a good manager.  Look at what Robbie did, look what Hiddink did and look what even Grant did. Again Grant got sooo much shit hurled at him, but STILL made it to the bloody finals of the Champions League! Robbie won it with *arguably* a weaker, older and slower side.

I totally agree, its not entirely Rafa's fault. Its Roman's impulsiveness and the boards lack of foresight. That being said, Rafa has to take a lot of the blame as well. Any decent manager (re: Hiddink, Robbie and yes even Grant) have proven that they can handle the situation better than Rafa.

true,Ivebeenfurthereven,cnty-uk,"Living by the sea [Southampton via Sussex, Southsea and Swansea]","&gt;Imagine where we might be as a human society if the resources diverted to warfare had went elsewhere. 

To alter the topic slightly, I actually sincerely believe the reverse: we'd not have had the advances of the 20th century technological revolution at all, or had a much-diminished version of what we enjoy today. Warfare makes us invent new things like nothing else. It's ugly, but true: necessity is the mother of invention, after all.

WWII kickstarted, among other things, rocketry and computing. The modern world wouldn't exist without either of those.  
It's possible to make a more nuanced argument about where we'd be without the introduction of the perils of atomic warfare, but in my opinion, every single form of life on planet Earth has actually been incredibly lucky with how that narrative has gone so far - compared to the possible alternatives of all-out destruction that reared their ugly heads repeatedly during the Cold War. Yes, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, but without the consequences of mutually assured destruction that'd lead to entire nations being left in ashes. That nearly happened several times, and we've avoided it by sheer bloody miracles. The heroic calm of Soviet officer [Stanislav Petrov](http://geoffolson.com/page5/page8/page24/page24.html) is a good example - faced with alert systems flashing in his face warning of imminent nuclear attack and recommending an immediate counterstrike against the West, he sat calmly, did nothing, and waited to see if his hunch that the warning satellite had malfunctioned was correct. (It was.) Had he been wrong, the first he'd know about it would've been a blinding flash.

Had the course of history not gone *exactly* this way, and nuclear weapons were developed in peacetime, they could've been used in anger and all-out exchange with the Soviets would result. If nukes didn't exist at all, WWIII would likely have broken out in the same style as WWII - another massive land war in Europe, killing millions.

true,ksturgis,null,null,"For starters, to suggest that Yossi was any kind of pillar of the success at liverpool is absolutely laughable. Does Rafa deserve some blame for Alonso's exit? Absolutely, but at the same time he left for Real Madrid (arguably the biggest club in the world historically) and Masch left for Barcelona (arguably the biggest club in the world at the time). Alonso being spanish understandably wanted to go to Madrid. There really wasn't a lot that could be done to stop him or Masch from leaving the club. As for Aquilani, the lad just couldn't stay healthy (and let's be real, it was again a lack of proper funds that kept Rafa from being able to invest in a more proper replacement to begin with). But if you're going to highlight the exits, don't ignore his brilliant signings (Torres, Reina, Masch, Alonso, and Luis Garcia to name a few). He deserves all the credit in the world for his Champions League success and for the majority of his time at both Liverpool and Valencia. 

My thoughts on his time at Inter? Despite the fact that he was given less than 6 months to establish himself, he still managed to win two trophies (the Italian Super Cup and Club World Cup) despite missing key players such as Milito and Sneijder to injuries and poor form respectively. Nonetheless, Inter's continued struggles even after Rafa's departure show that their problems ran much deeper than an ""inept"" manager. 

As for the rest of your post, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. Chelsea winning the Champions League only mitigated the issues that this club has at a squad level. Everyone knew that a massive squad overhaul was still needed and a few transition years were on the horizon. This was beginning to show when RDM began to struggle in both the league (going from 7 points clear, to 4 points behind Manu) and in CL (where we were well on our way out of the group stages before RDM was sacked). Once Rafa (or anyone for that matter) took over, time was EXACTLY what would be needed. Unfortunately here at chelsea, patience and time are two things no manager will have, and Rafa is quickly learning that lesson just as the previous 9 managers have.

Sacking Di Matteo was a disgrace, and whilst it is to support the legend himself, the singing of his name at Chelsea since his departure is actually the closest thing we have done to sticking the finger up at Roman&gt;
This is probably what I agree with most and I've felt this way since Ray Wilkins was let go unceremoniously.  As to the point of the post.  Having watched a video of what he said, I'm conflicted because I dont support him but the underlying message in his so called rant is that these chants run off his back like water and while Players like Lampard, Mikel, Terry, Ferreira and the core whove seen managers come and go can distinguish between abuse for manager and support for players, some younger/newer team members may not so easily detach themselves.
I'm by no means a Benitez fan, I have always felt that he has very little tactical nous despite his well publicized attention to detail and his man management is terrible when not dealing with someone in good form or he just inherently likes (ie Benayoun and Xabi in his Liverpool days).  Despite this there are players who will feel major responsibility for poor performance and feel that the intensity on the manager increases with performances they are responsible for and that can lead to a lot of **misplaced** pressure.   
I'm no psychologist, sports therapist, or professional in the field, I just feel that too often we fail to notice true and subtle points in statements by allowing inflammatory feelings to stop us form reading between the lines.

Traditionally, 

Labour are the working mans party, funded by the unions, pioneered the welfare state, care about the working man and maintaining his livelihood.

Tories are the old boys club, focus on what I suppose is known as trickle down economics or, if the rich are doing well, we are all doing well.

Lib Dems, well liberal means allowing a man to be the master of his own fate essentially. As long as you don't hurt anyone else crack on with it. For this reason they are generally more popular with youth (scoff) 

Reality

Labour - Power hungry individuals formed together to run a country the way they want to; under the guise of being the working mans party but generally ignoring this whilst in power. In my opinion the lesser of the evils but just because she's wearing pretty make up doesn't mean she's not going to fuck you. 

Tories - Power hungry individuals formed together to run a country the way that their dad is telling them to; under the guise of understanding the way the country works because of all of their heritage. They really don't care about helping out the little guy it's all about pumping money into the pockets of their old school friends. Slick, well polished snake oil salesmen who don't care about you or your opinion. They are the worst of the three

Lib Dems - Never, been in power, never really expecting to be in power often perceived as a wasted vote and have well and truly shot themselves in the foot by pissing off student voters. Having said that this is the place where you will find well meaning politicians who genuinely believe in what they say. Vince Cable really knows his stuff and is an asset to them. They were forced into a hike in tuition fees in exchange for the AV referendum which the Tories then fucked them on by lying about the way it worked to the general populous. 

In truth they are all probably as bad as each other, I vote for whoever I have to in order to keep the Tories out. It's a slimy mess best summed up by [this](http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=e2HQaF_vfes&amp;amp;amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3De2HQaF_vfes)

1. While Donna, Martha, Amy, Rory, and miscellaneous people who enter the Doctor's life usually end up with some sort of sad tradeoff as the price for all of space and time Rose (until the very end of her journey) did not. 

2. She actually gets offended when she finds out her 900 year old friend had ""women friends"" before her. Because ""I'm not the FIRST?!"" What? Has that ever happened in the history of men ever? 

3. When she breaks out of her ""prison"" she immediately gets The Doctor killed with her carelessness. 

4. She sends Donna to her death without so much as shedding a tear. 

5. Even though she is locked in another dimension with the father she lost and the mother she loves and the best friend she snubbed as soon as the Doctor came into the picture she bawls like a baby when she can't travel with the Doctor anymore.

6. When she has to go back to that dimension she is given a perfect copy of the man she loves and promptly makes out with him in front of the True Doctor, only to chase after the Tardis in front of the Human Doctor, because.....whatever...she's flaky.

No. Was he important to Liverpool? absolutely. When those three left, Liverpool were shit. Yes Madrid and Barca were big clubs, but at the time Liverpool was a massive club as well, so aside from Rafa being a prick there was no real reason to move to the other clubs. 

He won the Super cup and Club World Cup, as any Italian will tell you, two completely useless and meaningless trophies. The club world cup required little or no effort to win. If he was a good manager, he would make do without Milito. Again, when you inherent such a strong squad, how do you screw it up so bad? This Inter team beat the invincible Barcelona. The continued struggles of both clubs just show how detrimental he was to both! Compare the legacy of Mourinho at Porto and Chelsea or Guardiola and Barca!

We were playing fine at the beginning of the year. With the exception of a few losses, the United loss was the result of twatenburg NOT a failure on the part of our team, Juve are a good side full stop, and Falcao is a beast not much you can do. I wouldn't say we were well on our way out, we just really underestimated Shakhtar and Juve. Not to mention had to put up with the twattenburg affair, JT racial allegations, and Roman never giving Robbie the full backing he deserved. 

At least we played with passion and purpose. We may have let a few goals slide, but no matter the score you always had the feeling we would catch up and at LEAST fight back.  If we had RDM, we would still have a manager who could inspire the players, something that Rafa is completely incapable of doing. For crying out loud Yossi said it in his interview before coming here that Rafa is a rubbish manager for building confidence. 

It is no coincidence now that our players have no confidence, no cohesion and play like shit since Rafa took over. Every single one of our most promising players have looked like shit since Rafa took over from RDM. Oscar, Hazard, Ba (from newcastle), Cahill, Luiz even Moses isn't as good as he was. He has weakened us offensively, and has done nothing to solidify the back. Yes each of those players show glimpses of their quality, but god damn, under RDM Hazmatar was unstoppable. Even bloody Torres was scoring more. 

We have been in transition for years now. In 2009 everyone said we were too old and wouldn't go anywhere, Hiddink changed that in a shorter time than Rafa had. Last year everyone said we were shit and wouldn't make it passed the group stages of CL, RDM changed that again in a shorter time than Rafa had. This year we have the most promising talent in Europe, the most promising player in Brazil after bloody Neymar, and no injuries. Rafa is completely cocking it up. If he was a decent manager, he would do better. Hated or not.

2. She's not offended. Just surprised. Plus, in School Reunion she and the Doctor have that big ol' deep talk about what happens to the Doctor's companions when he leaves them. Rose says something like, ""But what about Sarah-Jane? Doctor, you barely ever mention her. Is that what's going to happen to me?"" I don't think it was *just* about the romance. You know there's always *that* kind of story. Mickey even said it: the missus and the ex, a man's worst nightmare.

3. Which story are you talking about?

4. She knew that it was an alternate reality version of Donna so it was fine. Donna wasn't actually dying in *Turn Left*. Donna even said it herself.

6. All I can say is: very confusing conflicting emotions. It's kind of awkward right? The man you love can't love you forever and you have to leave him. But then there's this exact copy of him so you're supposed to feel the same feelings toward him but you can't shake the fact that he's not the ""real"" version. But the real version can't be with you and the ""fake"" one can and they both love you.

I think it's more awkward that Rose is supposed to feel the same towards the Human Doctor that she does towards the ""real"" Doctor. It's like finding out who your adopted parents are and there's that weird feeling like you guys should be great friends, but obviously you're not because you've never met each other before.

Otherwise, I don't really blame Rose on that one. Because I don't know what it's like to be in that situation. It just sounds emotionally confusing.

It's like how people blame Amy Pond for not grieving for the loss of her baby. But when you think about it, Amy didn't even know she was pregnant before she had the baby, and it was promptly snatched away from her only to find out that the grown up version of this strange baby was actually a mysterious time traveller and best childhood friend all along who is making out with your childhood idol.

No we just have plenty of people running around rewording the usual communist manifesto (say 'totally inclusive democracy where everybody gets a say and an equal share of all property/wealth') and attempting to push it as some new and revolutionary form of thinking.   It's not.  It's New Communism, tastes like old Communism but with a minty fresh smell.

2. Funny you bring up Mickey. The guy she literally rolled her eyes at and LET exist in an alternate dimension because he felt like a third wheel. 

3. I'm talking about when Rose escapes her parallel world and the Doctor runs toward her and she runs toward him and he get shot by a Dalek. What were her exact words in that scene? ""YOU CAN'T DIE! **I** JUST GOT BACK!"" So many other companions would have been apologizing left and right, but not Rose. She's just upset because he's dying inconveniently. 

4. By all means, let's discuss ""Turn Left."" Donna has just been hit by a car, is lying on the ground in agony, is possibly experiencing what it's like to die and what does Rose say to her? I'm sorry? Let me get you something for the pain? Don't worry, it'll be okay? No, of course not. ""Tell the Doctor Bad Wolf, because I can't be bothered to care about your dying."" 

5. She didn't seem very confused when she flung herself into human doctor's arms. 

I could go on and on pointing out specific acts but, if the argument against these insensitive, irrational, inconsiderate acts are she was conflicted, or confused, or some other thing that we can't really know for a fact she knew, then we aren't really disagreeing.  

I'm basing my judgment on what I can prove. If I wanted to speculate on her emotions I could go to extremes and paint a much more malevolent character. 

For instance, getting the Doctor shot by the Daleks wound up making her a human clone version of the Doctor. Who's to say she didn't do it on purpose because her future self once again breaks free of HER universe and travels back in time to plan out the plot? When she turns and sort of half runs toward the Tardis, who's to say she wasn't lunging toward the machine because truly all she wants is to control space and time the way she did after consuming the vortex? 

That's why I tend to shy away from ""well she was probably thinking"" or ""well this is understandable because she knew.."" when I don't really know that for a fact.

true,LokianEule,mccoy,Time's Champion,"1. Rose gets a happy ending but that doesn't mean she doesn't suffer. Seeing her dad die like that, knowing she can't help him- especially after almost killing a bunch of people. Nearly getting killed by Daleks (a lot). Nearly getting baked by the sun. Nearly getting blown up. Nearly getting killed by robots and Slitheen. Like, wow, I think I'd cry too. A lot. I'm surprised that ALL of the companions don't cry
more often.

2. Rolling eyes. Such a crime. And Rose didn't ""let"" him exist in an alternate dimension. Mickey *chose* it because he didn't have anything else to stay for in his universe. He wanted to be of use. Because clearly Rose was more in love with the Doctor. I think that's one of the only truly bad things Rose did (out of two things): she strung Mickey along when she should've just ended it when she realized she liked the Doctor more.

3. You're kidding me. You're going to blame Rose because a *Dalek* shot the Doctor??? Blame the Dalek! She has nothing to apologize for. And her comment about ""You can't die, I just got back!"" is like commenting on the irony of the situation. Like, ""Great! I finally meet the right guy and he's from another planet!"". That's not selfish, it's irony (and it's what Grace Holloway said when she met 8).

4. Uh, again, Donna wasn't ""really"" dying. Plus, what good would sorry do? Or a pain pill (where would she get one anyways)? Or lying and saying ""it will be okay?"". Rose was being practical. ""Tell the Doctor Bad Wolf because stuff is happening and this is serious."" Maybe if
Donna was actually dying, this would be an issue, but she wasn't.

5. Woah, okay I think that there's always going to be *some* viewer interpretation of events. If there wasn't, it would be hard for there to be such a thing as ""active viewing"" where the audience is engaged with the story. We have to interpret stuff for ourselves.

I dont' think it's a huge stretch to say Rose was emotionally confused. Do we really need the character to outright say, ""I'm emotionally confused""? No, we watch her body language and the context of the situation.

Plus, what's wrong with ""this was understandable because X""? That's the viewer relating to/sympathising with a character. Which is something we should be able to do in order to like, or at least, appreciate a character.

&gt;Basically, you're painting the character into what you want, instead of judging her based on her actions.

And ""Tell the Doctor Bad Wolf, *because I can't be bothered to care about your dying*."" isn't putting words into Rose's mouth? You're doing it just as much as I am. And we're both *supposed* to. It's all interpretation. Though I did not get that at all from Rose's body language and demeanor.

She found a best friend in Mickey, but she could never love him like that again. Think about it, SHE had to save HIM in the first episode, and he was cowering at her feet. When you experience a man like that, you obviously go for someone a little more protective. 

What would you do if you found yourself staring at your true love and his duplicate, knowing you couldn't be with the real one but COULD be with the other? Humans are known to 'take what they can get'. We'll never know if it's a 100% Pure Love from then on, but at least we'll know she's not in a pit of depression.

If you're gonna hate on anyone, hate on Martha. She's the one that throws herself at him and is appalled that he doesn't instantly love her. She's the one that gets extremely jealous if he snogs another woman (like the matron). Whereas Rose continues on with her business of saving the world when he snogs Madame de Pompadour, and the like.

It's the end of the episode, the Angels are defeated, River says her mysterious ""we'll meet again when the Pandorica Opens"" line, we return to the TARDIS safe and sound. The story's over but the episode isn't.... we've still got one very important realization to come.

But this sequence feels really out-of-place. It feels like a better sequence to *start* an episode than end it, and it makes Amy seem *really* forward and the Doctor seem *really* oblivious to her intentions.

The difference being that it's his personality and memories this time instead of his appearance.

When you do, you won't exist anymore. Nothing you remember will even matter anymore because you won't exist."". It's essentially like telling someone to kill themselves. And honestly, if I were told that all my memories were fake and I had to basically turn myself off or kill everything that I was for the better of humanity, I would have a VERY hard time with that decision.

true,[deleted],null,null,"1. The problem with Rose getting her happy ending and STILL suffering is it's a bit like someone winning the lottery and then complaining about how much more difficult it is now that they have all *this* money. Sure their suffering is legitimate, but how is your average person supposed to commiserate with THAT? As for her father, she got him back. So again....not so much with the suffering. In the end she got the super-mega-supreme happy ending with cheese.  Not only does she get people back from the dead (or a reasonable facsimile thereof) she doesn't have to work in a shop anymore, gets the love of her life to grow old at her side, has her best friends and family close by, and has a career as a ""Superhero"" thanks to her experiences with the Doctor. And she's young and pretty to boot. I'm sure some days she wakes up and feels a little down because..... *it's raining on her Porsche or something,* but .....COME ON. You would have to be a serious pessimist to find anything worth complaining about in her life. 

2. Mickey absolutely **chose** to live in an alternate dimension , *but she let him.* I'm not saying she should have kidnapped him and dragged him back to Earth against his will, but considering how upset she was to be inhabiting a separate dimension forever, you'd think she would have shown slightly more concern for her supposedly close friend about to do the same. She could have been a little more insistent or at least show a little guilt. I mean, there probably wasn't enough room in the episode for it (and I think sometimes people confuse my criticism of the character as some sort of vendetta against Billie Piper so I'm going to go ahead and point that I'm critiquing the character here) but even a conversation after the fact with The Doctor indicating she felt guilty would have been monumental in building even the teeniest bit of empathy for Rose Tyler. 

3. I'm not kidding you. Trust me. You would know. My charm and wit would utterly disarm you to such a degree that your responses would take much longer to compose. --Again, you don't have to BE at fault, in order to feel guilty. I think it's normal to feel bad about things even though they aren't your fault. I don't think I've ever met anyone who didn't apologize to the occasional inanimate or regret a decision they made that wound up harming someone in the end. 

4. Actually, in that episode Donna even asks. ""But I'm not dying? Not really, right? RIGHT?"" Rose says, ""I'm sorry."" That's not me putting words in her mouth either. That's her stone cold response. As someone who has experienced the losing side of a pedestrian vs. vehicle accident, the very thought of someone standing over me as I lay immobile and broken to deliver a ""message"" is a bit....unsettling. Come to think of it I think I might of apologized for denting their car when they asked if I was okay, so maybe it's a matter of different personalities/personal philosophies in life? 

5. Interpretation is awesome, but in this thread we were asked to discuss why there IS Rose Hatred not **if** there is, and I'm offering that perspective. You seem to suggest my perspective is wrong. That's all fine and good, but kind of not the purpose here maybe? 

While I appreciate the royal ""we"" I couldn't help but notice how much displeasure you take from my embellishments while simultaneously defend your own. If we are all entitled to our own opinion -- great! If we are all entitled to your own opinion and a glass of wine -- even better! But if we are all...basically entitled to our own opinion as long as it lines up with yours, then I'm going to have to go away for awhile and possibly tear a pillow apart with my teeth. I get bitey when I'm repressed. I'm not really sure why......

I just don't feel the same way about Rose's situation as you.

I'd be happy for him. What happened between him and Rose, well...it seems like Mickey has moved on and it's ""water under the bridge"" so to speak. I don't really find that to be something to condemn Rose Tyler for. Also, no I don't think you have anything against Billie Piper, just in case I was giving that impression.

I think that this whole discussion is a matter of different personalities/philosophies. i.e. things Rose does may piss you off more than they piss me off. Or, i.e. some people find Amy's almost-cheating of Rory unforgivable and I don't. Anywho, we're getting off topic.

5. Well I guess we both got off topic then, but it's not like it's a bad thing. We're discussing the show and that's always nice. Though I'm not suggesting your perspective is wrong. In no way did I say that. How can a perspective be wrong? I'm just disagreeing with you and arguing my side. You're doing the same to me and then it turns into a discussion.

&gt;While I appreciate the royal ""we"" I couldn't help but notice how much displeasure you take from my embellishments while simultaneously defend your own. If we are all entitled to our own opinion -- great! If we are all entitled to your own opinion and a glass of wine -- even better! But if we are all...basically entitled to our own opinion as long as it lines up with yours, then I'm going to have to go away for awhile and possibly tear a pillow apart with my teeth. I get bitey when I'm repressed. I'm not really sure why......

Wow, I don't really understand your hostility. The idea that I'm saying nobody can have an opinion unless it's mine is wholly untrue. I don't mind you ""embellishing"" but you can't criticize me for ""painting the character into what I want"" when we're *both* doing it.

And saying that I'm using the royal ""we"" is just trying to be antagonistic. Like you want to have something against me. Really? It's we, as the audience/viewers of the show.

I'm all up for arguing and/or discussing about characters but if you're going to lob these accusations that I have some kind of tyrannical ""everybody must think my way"" crusade then this isn't going to work.",0,1362121112,null,0,false,0,c8nqrkn,t3_19fne8,t1_c8nqrkn,t1_c8nqd5u,null,1431447309,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Werevark,eccleston,Eccleston,"I actually completely disagree. I found John Smith to be the most endearing David Tennant ever was. He was a principled man whose love for his country was deep and real (as shown by his willingness to stand against the Family, drawing arms with the boys), but not overwhelming (as shown by his reaction to their tears when they're forced to kill). He was a man who understood the potential of people around him (his reaction with the boy who stole the watch; he told him that he noticed how bright he was). He was a man who found love and who looked forward to spending the rest of his life with the woman he loved and doing the things he loved.

And I guess I didn't see his initial refusal to change as whining, or a sign of weakness; I saw it as him fighting for his life when everyone else is telling him to drop it and essentially die. He is going to die if he opens that watch; there will be no more John Smith. John Smith doesn't become a Time Lord, he ceases to exist. As a man, he's found something he loves, a woman he wants to spend his life with, things worth fighting for. He's fighting to hold onto that. And even if he does become this 'Doctor', what do they tell him about this guy? They talk about how he's always alone, always lonely, so far beyond everyone else. Why would this man who has found so many reasons to live between this amazing woman, this fantastic job, and so many other things only to become someone destined to be alone?

Consistency is excellent and puts teams in the right places to go somewhere, but the best record is not indicative of the best team; obviously, this is purely subjective both on the team level as well as the individual level — however I would contend that given the framework I have laid down is that any team that beats any other team in any circumstance is ultimately the victor regardless of the circumstances.

1.) Your views on the playoff system, which you approached critically and ended up generalizing you point - to which end you insulted myself and presumably others - contributed little to the conversation as your focus was not on the system itself but a general distaste towards not only the structure of sports in the US but also the culture in general.

2.) The mobility of teams in europe is not indicative of the teams in the United States, the focus is on individual players (such as farm teams in baseball, collegiate athletes, ect); thus, we have established a playoff system. I'm not saying it is good or bad in anyway, but the links between a teams mobility and a playoff system are there. America: the cream rises to the top, and the best individuals play at the highest levels of competition.
Europe: the collective cream rises to the top, and while individuals with a high level of skill may be picked from a global talent pool, the focus is on the team.
These perspectives are integral into fandom as well as money to be earned by the owners of the club.
Population density plays an important role in this, football clubs are generally located in highly populated areas with smaller football clubs acting as even more local subsets... given the amount of land these dense populations occupy, it is fairly logical that they overlap with one another(just look at all the clubs in all the Burroughs of London). It is quite different in the United States given that teams are located in valuable economic markets which is correlated by the population density of the region; however, it is not determined by the density. Even teams whose names overlap are not located in the same area but instead speak to a relative (non-cartographic) location. It is rare to have two teams fan-bases intersect on central and non peripheral locations (excluding a few outliers.)

Australia also has compulsory voting, and it is more lucky with it's politicians.

But when it comes to music I think the whole ""Oh the industry is ripping us all off"" excuse is exactly that, an excuse. I mean you can buy nearly any tune from iTunes for £0.99 but still some people just won't pay that measly sum or any sum for that matter for the music they listen to. 

£0.99p, it's like, the price of a bar of chocolate. 


And talking of chocolate, you could also argue that someone lifting a bar of chocolate would never have bought that chocolate in the first place so there's no sale lost there either. 

Basically if you download an album, the demand was definitely there because you wanted that product and obtained that product. You just chose not to pay and instead take it for free.  

Am I wrong? 


I mean it's digital, so it's just not seen as taking anything anyway. And anyway, the artist can just make money doing gigs or busking or some other form of work to feed their family. Can't they?  

Why should they get paid for their work?

Why should they get paid for something they've created that's a major part of my life?

I mean download all you want, I care not. People however really need to stop trying to justify what they're doing with bollocks fallacies.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"I'm taking what the judge said about the sites with a degree of scepticism as I'm pretty certain that he's just repeating what the BPI said about them (although I haven't seen the court documents).

I think this new ruling is a bit worse because the judge found that the sites had infringed copyright directly by communicating the works to the public. While this was also found in Newzbin (but was a bit shaky) it wasn't claimed in the TPB case. This potentially means a lot of other website operators (including anyone merely running a proxy) could also be infringing copyright in works even though they wouldn't be under the other limbs (joint tortfeasance and authorisation).

In doing so, the judge applied a couple of recent CJEU cases that might have been of some help for the sites (including one that I think narrowed the definition of communication to the public). This is partly where the lack of a defence bites, as ordinarily a defendant would be able to argue for a different interpretation of the CJEU rulings, or raise similar cases, but without those we now have a fairly solid ruling that merely running a web-service is direct, primary infringement, even if there isn't direct involvement in copying.

The other main reason is that this shows the music companies have pretty much free reign to get websites shut down. Newzbin1 took over a year (a couple of trials and three judgments) to sort out. The TPB case again involved a couple of judgments, some fiddling around with orders and about 6-9 months. However, while I can't tell for sure, it looks like this block was obtained within a couple of months, without any hearings or messing around. Simply application -&gt; judgment -&gt; block, with no opportunities for interventions.

There's also a bit (paragraph 68 of [the judgment](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2013/379.html#para65)) on take-down notices where the judge seems to skip over EU law in finding:

&gt; the Websites' purported policies of removing infringing content only upon the provision of individual takedown notices would, even if rigorously implemented, be wholly inadequate...

This could be a major problem for other websites, whereby a US-style notice-and-takedown system still wouldn't be enough to escape liability - sites may have to take active steps to police themselves (which seems to go against the hosting and mere conduit limitations in the E-Commerce Directive).

But maybe I'm being overly pessimistic.

Tears begin to well in his eyes. He softly whispers, ""...ahora... ahora es el momento!""

Rising from the emerald pitch which was home to so many of his greatest performances, Torres tears off his Chelsea jersey to reveal a red blaze beneath. This has been Fernando Torres' greatest performance of all. Running towards the Kop, Torres proudly tugs at the Liverpool jersey and lifts the crest up to his lips. The Kop goes wild. Torres once again feels the passion surrounding him, lifting him up.

Slowly the song builds, quietly at first, ""His armband proved he was a red! Torres, Torres!""

Torres turns away and walks toward the Chelsea bench.

More and more join in, ""'You'll Never Walk Alone', it said! Torres, Torres!""

Torres approaches Rafa Benitez, they embrace once again within Anfield as a ray of sun breaks through the clouds and falls upon them. Torres' hair shines like El Dorado, the city of gold.

The whole stadium joins in, ""We bought the lad from sunny Spain,
He gets the ball and scores again!""

Arm around Torres, Benitez unbuttons his jacket. A hint of red lies beneath. A scarf. Slowly he unwraps the scarf from his neck. Torres takes one end, Rafa the other. They raise the scarf high and joyously join the song in a divine crescendo,

One reason being that you would assume that people in regular, full-time employment are more trustworthy and reliable, having a job goes hand in hand with being responsible for yourself. If you've demonstrated that you're not, you probably won't have a job. Minimum wage jobs also often have an opportunity to do more hours, so if they have spent more than they should, then they can put in a few more hours and earn the money back.

You can also pursue claims against working people for damages, those on housing benefit have no money so you're chasing a lost cause.

Another reason being that they're going to be out more of the time so will cause less wear and tear to the property. They're also less likely to be throwing parties or whatever all the time because they have work to go to and they need sleep etc.

Hitler was actually unhappy with that word being used in the party's name, preferring instead ""Social Revolutionary,"" but by the time he took control of the party it was too late, so he merely tried to impose his own definition on it. Read [this interview](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2007/sep/17/greatinterviews1) by George Sylvester Viereck from 1929 if you don't believe me. Here's a pertinent excerpt:

&gt;""Why,"" I asked Hitler, ""do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?""

&gt;""Socialism,"" he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, pugnaciously, ""is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.

&gt;""Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.

&gt;""We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national.

I bought the flat I live in from a guy who was renting it to someone on housing benefit at the time of the sale.  The landlord had a good relationship with the tenant, and the tenant knew she would have to move out when a sale went through.  I even met her when I first went to view the flat, she was very friendly and knew exactly what was going on.

So when I put an offer in to buy the flat the landlord let the tenant know that she had 2 months to move.  So she went to the council to ask about what to do next, and they advised her to stop paying rent and not do anything until she was lawfully evicted, a process that I'm told could take many months.

She reported back to the landlord who shat himself when he heard this.  But as I said they had a good relationship, and he helped her find another flat nearby for the same rent and she moved out before the completion of the sale.  I only found out when the landlord told me all this after the sale completed, but it was very close to causing the sale to fall through as I wanted to move into the flat straight away.

After I heard what the council's standard advice was in cases like this (""stop paying rent and wait until you're evicted"") I thought if I was ever a landlord I would never accept a tenant on housing benefit.",0,1362143519,null,0,false,0,c8ntk67,t3_19gebu,t1_c8ntk67,t3_19gebu,null,1431448652,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

But *becoming* an alcoholic in the first place is irresponsible and inexcusable. It would involve drinking ridiculous amounts for a long period of time. There is no excuse for that level of drinking if you don't have a physiological addiction to alcohol.

It's not cool, or a valid life choice, at all.

1) It is inexcusable to allow yourself become an alcoholic in the first place

2) Alcoholics should be given all the necessary treatment to help them get over their addiction.

you said

but that is not entirely true, you are also responsible for choosing who you think is suitable for renting too and that risk is on your back.

Primarily BE provides a fast connection with lower pings, that you can manage within your login area.  The customer service is also far, far better.  The modem/router BE supply is also fairly decent, and they allow you to integrate other routers and switch their one to bridge mode easily.  All this is not supported by Sky.

BE also provide much cheaper landline rental than Sky.

Sky does FTTC, that's the only benefit I can really think of. 

Overall the BE and Sky cultures are so different that I hope the BE side of things are left alone.  If all the BE customers lose the things that made BE so great it will be a real shame.

In this system children in the final year of primary school (age 10-11) take an exam called the 11+ (eleven plus). The results determine what type of secondary school they will attend. Those who pass may attend a ""grammar school"" with all the other clever clogs. Back in the old days (50+ years ago) the kids who failed would go to schools which offered more vocational type subjects to help them get jobs later. Meanwhile the grammar school would prepare the academic types for university. These days there is less difference between passing and failing the 11+, especially as so many people in other parts of the country never actually take it. You can fail it and still end up taking your GCSEs, A-levels and going on to university. But many people are still fans of the grammar school system because it basically means brighter kids get to learn in an environment of other bright kids and not get held back by the slower ones who need more attention etc.

Another little point is that we don't ""graduate"" from school. I mean nobody says that. Graduation is for university. There's no single certificate that says you passed or failed high school, like in America (I think?) As everyone else has said, you take GCSEs and then A Levels, these are all in subjects that you chose and to some extent you can tailor the subjects towards your personal strengths.

                      Lloris

     Lennon           Cazorla          Bale

                      Giroud

Reasoning: Normally I'd rate Sagna over Walker, but Sagna's recent form was absolutely horrendous. Dawson over Vermaelen simply because I don't think he's been all that solid this season, while Dawson has proved people wrong every game. For Monreal, I've been watching him play for Malaga for two years now and rate him above BAE, honestly. He hasn't played much for Arsenal yet so I'll admit I could be wrong in this, but that's my reasoning. Sandro and Dembélé was one of, if not the best midfield partnership in the PL. It has everything. Solid defensively (Sandro and Dembélé were near the top of the PL for interceptions and tackles, individually), fluid, quick, a physical force, and a threat from distance. Wilshere's a better passer than either of them, but this is one of those things where both work well together in a way that a different player might not improve on it despite being better in certain departments. As for Lennon over Walcott, that's a contentious one, and it depends on how the team is set up. I was going for the wingers as providers, and Lennon creates almost twice as many goal scoring opportunities for others as Walcott and is much, much better defensively (ie: he actually bothers tracking back every once in awhile). Bale provides more than enough of a goalscoring threat from out wide and Lennon has shown himself capable of it too, but as a provider, I have to choose Lennon. Cazorla and Bale, I don't think anyone will have an issue with, and for Giroud, I've been more impressed by his movement and link up play, and I think he provides more of an all-around threat than Defoe. On last year's form, Ade is more dangerous, but he hasn't really shown that yet.",0,1362150743,null,0,1362151352,0,c8nv1ul,t3_19gmfq,t1_c8nv1ul,t3_19gmfq,null,1431449330,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

After everything he went through in his younger days as 9 and 10, the weight becomes almost unbearable so he decides that he wants a fresh start.

That's why the TARDIS gave herself a make-over so that he doesn't feel the constant reminder of the pain he endured before (and obviously, because she was in need of repairs).

So it's not that none of it matters to him anymore, it's that he needed to learn to live without those things. Like when you go through a break-up. It's not healthy to linger on the past and the things you would do and the places you would frequently visit. No, instead you try new things and focus on yourself and making new friendships. After all, he still felt much of the guilt (S6E08: *Let's Kill Hitler*) he felt after having no choice but to leave Rose behind on Pete's World, or never being able to reciprocate the feelings that Martha felt, or being forced to drain Donna's memories.

The way the doctor responded to her, the way other characters responded to her, etc. It's a lot of reading between the lines, but hopefully someone knows what I mean.

So for me, here I was watching a story unfold and there was this really odd dynamic that I couldn't wrap my head around. I would see the actress, and see how characters reacted to her, and I just felt like something was... off. In the end, it never led to me saying I 'hated' Rose... she was just very low on my list.

Compare this with someone like Donna (Catherine Tate), who I didn't find attractive either. She was a little matronly, and the character had such an abrasive personality. I didn't get the same feeling from the writing with her, though. It felt like every character responded to her perfectly. I never had to suspend belief... the actress fit the character like a glove.

The BBC is more sinister than that. They employ a load of trots and that means they criticize all governments but they criticize them from the far left. 

http://biasedbbc.org/blog/2013/02/05/reds-on-top-of-the-bed/

&gt; ‘Why nothing about this case on the BBC? It’s not as though the Socialist Workers Party is unknown to them. A regular on the BBC is ‘comedian’ Mark Steel, a long time SWP member, albeit one who resigned from the party in 2007, long after he started to make his hugely amusing appearances on BBC radio. The ‘Right To Work’ campaign that the BBC gave huge prominence to last year was a SWP offshoot.
&gt;
&gt; I think it safe to say that an equivalent sex scandal at the BNP would be headline news on the BBC so why not when it’s the equally vile SWP?
&gt;
&gt; Now why might the BBC have a soft spot for the extreme-left Socialist Workers Party? Who can say.’

I remember Mark Steel telling a 'joke' about bankers like this on the BBC

""It used to be that if you said bankers should be sacked people would think you were mad. Now they'd say they should be killed painfully""

Imagine if a BNP sympathiser had told the equivalent joke about Jews. Or Muslims.

Actually - and for frankly incomprehensible reasons - Mark Steel is a fan of Islamists. Well it's not that incomprensible politically because Respect was a mix or Trots and Islamists. But you have to wonder why the anti war, pro gay marriage left is cosying up to warlike religious conservatives.

http://marksteelinfo.wordpress.com/2013/02/14/enough-arsing-about-lets-sort-out-the-world/

&gt; It might be tempting to consider these thoughts, then conclude you’d done your bit by thinking them, and if you wanted to do any more you could occasionally arrange them into a moan. But it seems enough people are thinking this way at once, that a genuine movement is possible.
&gt;
&gt; For example, Owen Jones, one of the most eloquent opponents of the Coalition’s austerity, is eager to help set up such a network. Salma Yaqoob, who many will know as an inspiring opponent of the war in Iraq, is another. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, feels the same, as does Laurie Penny, the journalist who wrote powerfully as part of the Occupy movement.

Jones and Lucas are fellow left wingers. But what about Salma Yaqoob?

http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100180603/salma-yaqoob-once-described-the-77-murders-as-reprisal-attacks-she-doesnt-belong-in-the-labour-party/

&gt; Then there is Yaqoob’s description of the 7/7 bombings as a “reprisal attack”. Last night her supporters took to Twitter denouncing reports of this statement as a vile smear. “That's not what she said and it's no surprise Dan Hodges trying to spin that to justify his position”, tweeted Sunny Hundal. Except that on 7 July 2010 Yaqoob confirmed: “I once commented that the 7-7 bombings were ‘reprisal’ attacks. Of course, we know that they were exactly this, because the terrorists said so.” It’s also important to stress she condemned the attacks as “murderous and immoral”. She then added: “Pointing to the obvious motivation of these terrorists is, as is now clear, a pretty mainstream opinion. But try saying it as a Muslim.  Immediately, the smears will start, accusing you of being ‘soft’ on terrorism.”
&gt;
&gt; Anders Breivik claimed his massacre was a ""pre-emptive attack against traitors"" and that his motivation was those he saw “committing, or planning to commit, cultural destruction, of which deconstruction of the Norwegian ethnic group and deconstruction of Norwegian culture. This is the same as ethnic cleansing.” If I said, “the Norwegian attacks were a pre-emptive attack against traitors and motivated by the ethnic cleansing of the Norwegian group” what sort of response would I – rightly – receive?

So she's not really anti war. She's anti war when Americans do it. When jihadists do it - even to her fellow British citizens - she's equivocal. 

But then so is Mark Steel.

Not sure how effective this would be on Canal Street. Maybe other facilities for the public? 

I hope the interior of the college, as well as the rest of the exterior sides, look just as good as that side. I really think the architecture of a building reflects on the people, and an interesting and creative college would hopefully make interesting and creative students and staff!

The murder is always caught out though, because it's fiction... 

To be fair, I might ask them why they want to be British Citizens if they aren't stopping being a citizen of a different nation, that seems a bit odd to me (make your mind up people), but if it isn't currently required then I don't care, provided they honour proper British holidays, like the August bank holiday, May day, Boxing Day, Snow-day skiving... it's to make them feel included and assist with a sense of inclusion.

The Tory reforms were introduced after a Cameron promise of no top down reorganisation, following an election they didn't even win. 

It's a frantic idealogical attack on the NHS that  GPs are protesting against - they are the last barricade to these reforms.

If the reforms are needed then campaign on that basis, and have a debate on that basis.


The multitude of concerns can then be addressed in a sensible manner.  As it stands some of the changes will cost serious money to revert back if they prove to be wrong and ill thought out.

I think he would be a huge success in England as well, he is an absolute work horse of a forward with bags of energy, and a very accomplished finisher both with his feet and his head. He could add a lot to the team I think, and I like the idea of recalling Lukaku to give us a more imposing presence up top if needed. Playing both of them in some sort of 4-4-2 variant could be pretty devastating against the right opposition as well.

However, all of the rumours lately have been about him going to Bayern Munich to work with Pep. You'd have to imagine that the lack of managerial stability at Chelsea is going to start playing heavily on incoming players decision making, and as he's already based in Germany it would be an easy adjustment for him to move south to Munich. 

Though *if* we are miraculously able to secure a Mourinho comeback, then a call from Jose and the chance to explore a new country and a new league whilst living in one of the world's greatest and most vibrant cities, London, could possibly turn his head.

That I am afraid, is a massive generalisation. Just because you are in receipt of HB does not make you unable to access credit, or not be concerned about a credit rating. Sure, there might be less of a concern but for plenty the concern still exists. It is perfectly possible to have a not-shit credit rating and be on benefits.

Plus all of our good actors move across the pond as soon as they can which doesn't help.

Maybe because I was part of a generation raised on us shows like E.R NYPD blue etc, that  stuff like The Bill and Casualty always seem a bit quaint unreal and completely awful to me. There will never be a British 'The Wire' or Sopranos it would be appaling if they even tried. Even though we definitely have the stories and characters in RL that could form the basis of programmes like that. 

If there's a British show and it's not comedy there is a 95% chance I will hate it. Aside from Comedy, that is the only format in which I might ever recognise our culture or people I might know.  Even the bad American shows are infinitely more watchable than the equivalent Brit ones.

I'm becoming far more ruthless in my ignoring of idiots, and I am ever growing in contempt for the Irrational.

I always used to have an inner belief that the most idiotic and irrational human being could be brought round to a sensible understanding of the world. That If you took the time to engage with them and tried to assist and understand them, that somehow they would be able to break through their ignorance. This is however not the case.   
   
 I'm not sure how it is in other countries, but here in the UK we have a sub species of human bereft of understanding, lacking any willingness to apply thought to their action and incapable of adjusting their position in the face of facts. I will never get back the time i have spent trying to get a grown man to understand that he, a bus driver, will not necessarily get a pay rise because his wife, a cleaner, has got one. I will never claw back the sanity lost in explaining to a grown man that i know he is lying because i am in receipt of facts that prove the case, even when it makes no difference for him to lie to me apart from to hurt my ability to assist him in said case. My lost hours spent with the individuals, who on receipt of facts that disprove their position, never acknowledge, but merely move on the the next travesty of misjudgement, will never be reclaimed.

true,arquebus_x,k9,K-9,"&gt; Making the Doctor feel like a huge part of himself dies, and he, or at least Ten, views/viewed it as total death, makes it much more momentous.

I 100% agree with you on this. Perhaps the difference is that I treat this as the Doctor's self-perception rather than the objective reality of what's going on. So yes, most of the incarnations have feared regeneration, and Ten even more than the others, but that doesn't translate into an actual reality of interrupted/replaced consciousness.

The First Doctor's regeneration was rather uneventful - he didn't seem to be too concerned about it. The Second Doctor was angry, but I think that was largely because he was being punished. The Third Doctor had the weirdly racist Asian Time Lord to ease his passing, so he was afraid but resigned. The Fourth Doctor half-heartedly tried to avoid regeneration (he wasn't keen on meeting the guy in the white bodysuit, i.e., Fifth), but he didn't really complain. The Fifth Doctor self-sacrificed and didn't really have a strong emotional reaction to his regeneration. The Sixth Doctor regenerated off-screen, more or less, and was presumably unconscious when it happened. (Unless you subscribe to the theory that he was regenerated as punishment after the Trial, in which case it was just off-screen, and probably resembled the Second Doctor's regeneration.) The Seventh Doctor was also unconscious at his regeneration, and wasn't expecting it, so he had no emotional response. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration happened in the gap years, so we don't know how he felt about it. The Ninth Doctor was rather flippant about his regeneration. The Tenth Doctor actively tried to resist it, rejected the idea of it, cried a little bit.

All in all, the Tenth Doctor was really the only one who had a truly visceral negative reaction to the idea of regeneration.

&gt; Instead, there could be some Time Lords who just LOL@death and say, 'i'll be back'. I don't find that fun or engaging.

Perhaps not, but they do exist. Romana certainly. The Fifth Doctor and the Ninth Doctor more or less fit the bill as well.

My suspicion is that Ten's reaction was a bit of (inappropriate) fan service, and it bothered me because it was clearly the hand of the writer imposing an external emotional motivator in order to acknowledge that the audience really loved Ten. Of all the regenerations over the years, Ten's was the only one I actively hated, because it was so ham-fisted.",0,1362161347,null,0,false,0,c8nycht,t3_19gn1y,t1_c8nycht,t1_c8ny0o6,null,1431451043,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"Regression to the mean is somewhat illusory and is only ""valid"" if a particular individual measurement is extreme i.e. an outlier. If you assume a normal distribution, it is probably going to be closer to the mean. 

Winning a manager/player of the month is only quantifiable as a yes or no metric with ""no"" being the mode with a 95% chance of that occurring and a yes occurring 5% of the time assuming it is given out as random (It isn't but it is close enough to make this assumption). So obviously, it is more probable that a team will not win the MoM award. So when a team wins it one month and doesn't win it the next month it gives the impression of a ""regression to the mean"" when in fact there has always been that original underlying probability. There is just as much chance as of winning the next manager of the month.

Tottenham have not performed so far away for the mean for effect to occur. It is not a causal relationship, you cannot assume that a team will perform worse the next month if they perform well this month. If you assume a normal distribution around a particular mean, if a team scores higher than the mean then of course it will be more likely that the next score will be less and vice versa. This is due to the probability distribution, it has nothing to do with ""luck evening out"". Also, performance from week to week of a team is not mutually independent.

For me this idea has always helped give but a thin intellectual and ethical support for needless acts aggression: nuclear strikes, disability cuts, Spanish inquisition, beating obedience into children, etc, etc. It's such a spurious form of logic: evil (the undesirable) is sometimes good (the desirable). It's another one of those areas where once you let it cross the line it allows for floating boundaries, it's one step towards... If you want to talk about unavoidable evil, say spider man only has time to save one damsel and has to let the other die, then I'm open to that idea.

The thing is it is totally not necessary, there will be other ways, better security for one. You use I presume the West Burton example, so it shows that despite the extreme lengths covert operations are willing to go it still fails, but that gets us into sketchy hypotheticals. It also goes back to the idea of open justice and investigation. It should be public knowledge who is being surveilled lest naughty people choose to abuse their secreted position. Why do I say that? Well, because every day whether it is downloading the wrong file, tweeting something offensive, or traveling 80mph on the motorway, almost everyone breaks the law and sometimes unknowingly. It follows then that nearly anyone can be made a criminal. That is such an excellent tool to use against political opponents and the police effective adopts the role of the judiciary.

true,Ragekitty,US,usa,"Here's what I think and it's not a particularly unique opinion. FSW can fuck off and die as far as I'm concerned. I wasn't on the Rafa Out bandwagon when he first got hired, but I wasn't particularly keen on having a former rival manager on-board. I liked RDM well enough and I understood then that Roman can do as he pleases. I was surprised to see him fired after such a short string of mediocre performances, but the show must go on. When Benitez was appointed, two things went through my brain; (1) Why the fuck would he be considered qualified enough to manage us? (2) Who the fuck decided that having a former Liverpool manager would ""save"" our season. Keep in mind, we were only 4 points behind United at that point. I hardly thought we needed to be ""saved"".

As the weeks blended into months, I found myself growing very weary of the same mediocrity that RDM seemingly was fired for. How was it that FSW is able to keep his position week after disappointing week when better managers lost their jobs? Poor substitutions, poor decisions about starting eleven, very poor involvement on the sidelines, etc. Why is this fat fuck still our manager? I want a manager who displays happiness and elation when we score, anger when we lose -- not some aloof douche taking notes on the sideline.

While I didn't hate FSW at first, it didn't take very long for me to understand the hatred pouring in from other CFC fans. Recently, I was thinking that ANYONE ELSE could do a better job of motivating the team and the players than FSW. I still believe that.

I said it in a different thread: I want a manager who seems like an older brother to the squad; someone who is emotionally vested in our results; someone who bonds with the players but has the maturity to handle them as players; a guy who shakes his hands in the air with purpose when we score; a guy who sinks to his knees in despair after a heart-breaking loss. I don't know who that guy is, but that's who we need. Not this emotionless pig we currently have.

So we're stuck with him until May. That's unfortunate, especially considering his recent rants. I desperately wish that I could be a part of the atmosphere at the Bridge because I'd be cheering and shouting as loudly as anyone else. It's definitely on my bucket list. In the interim, I will continue to shout at my TV for every game. I don't think yelling at an incompetent manager creates a negative atmosphere. The players should know that the insults are never directed at them but rather the stupid smug bastard on the sidelines.

It's not her fault, but if she hadn't been so moronically stupid and naive the this would not have happened.

EDIT: So, apparently,she wasn't left alone, she was left with some guy she'd met and was sleeping with, some tour guide who she'd helped out by handing out flyers:

""Scarlett made friends with Julio Lobo, a 25-year-old tour guide, helping him give out flyers...she asked her mother if she could stay in Anjuna, while MacKeown took the rest of the family down the coast for a few weeks.

(A few weeks! FFS)

""She wasn't abandoned,"" says MacKeown. She says there were a lot of discussions before she allowed Scarlett to stay behind; she met Lobo and his aunts, who he lived with and who were happy for Scarlett to stay. ""Julio convinced me he was a responsible adult. I met his aunts and they seemed like lovely, decent people.""...

Maybe so, but the area was a dive, known for its high crime rates. 

""Lobo wasn't Scarlett's boyfriend, she says, although MacKeown later discovered from Scarlett's diary that they had started sleeping with each other. She says she also didn't know that Scarlett had moved out of the house and was staying in a nearby guesthouse.""

Right, so she planned on leaving her for a few weeks in a foreign country, in an area which has a notorious drug trade, perpetuated by gangs, with people she'd met a couple of times. Seriously, it amazes me that there are people that are so stupid in this World.

Plus, literature isn't easy to categorise into age-brackets. J.K. Rowling stated that she didn't have a particular age-demographic in mind when writing it, her publishers targeted children instead. As another example, Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* is constantly thought of as a children's novel, yet the complex satire against the Enlightenment and the political trends of the time go far beyond children's heads.

Saying that, television and music are also applicable to my statement.

* We're on the low end when it comes to shots conceded (as a proportion of the total) in the 6, at 6%.  These, it seems like, consist mostly of close-range headers from crosses and corners.

This is crazy coincidental because I was actually just thinking about this scenario today while I was trying to imagine what a normal response to this situation would look like. 

If my husband showed up at the front door with an exact duplicate of himself and told me I had to live out my days with his duplicate because he had to go off and ....*do a thing* and I could not follow, I think I would probably be very sad, until my husband's dupe made his sad face, then I would apologize to the dupe and put on a brave face. Sticking my tongue down the copy's throat just isn't my first gut instinct. Honestly, I think there'd be an awkward period where I'd be asking the copy questions for a long time because there would always being that feeling of, ""is it really him?"" I would definitely not run after my husband as he left. I'm not really sure what the end game would be there. I mean, if I KNEW I had to stay, I think I'd turn my back and not watch. It's easier that way to pretend the copy is really him and that he never left.

The Doctor is quick to sacrifice himself more often than not.

The small kitchen is closer to the workspace so i use it. when i started, to get into this kitchen, you had to walk all the way around 3 hallways and into the back near the food preparation area rather than through the front door because it was locked from the inside. i dropped my lunch off and left through the front door (shorter route by far) and back to my desk. after being tired of walking the long way to get my lunch and many days spent wondering why the door was always locked from the inside, i finally asked several people why it was so. turns out, its been like that since they started (20+yrs) and they never thought to unlock it.

you mean to tell me for 20+ YEARS you walked around 3 hallways and through a deserted dining hall to get into the kitchen through the back door only to leave through the front without wondering ""why don't i just walk through the front door both times""? the door has since been unlocked (by me) and people continue to walk around the long way as if some old ritual should not be broken. bunch of lemmings..",0,1362169092,null,0,false,0,c8o0yfc,t3_19gtke,t1_c8o0yfc,t1_c8ny5f7,null,1435576833,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

Turkey too I believe have a deal, but man that is so convoluted and backwards that it would leave us so unbelievably dependent we would have less freedom than we do now, and it would be a lot less stable, just as a cherry on the top.

Almost every sport in the US has under-emphasized the importance of the regular season. The NBA season is so unnecessarily long and admits so many teams into the playoffs, the regular season is irrelevant. Likewise in baseball, an MLB team can lose 60 games and that's considered an AMAZING season (the MLB is also expanding their playoff bracket to allow two more wild card teams to compete).

The points system in European league football takes away those ""meaningless"" games we see in American professional sports where one team already has a good enough W/L to make the playoffs and the result doesn't make one bit of difference for them. This happens every season in the NFL. A similar argument could be made that if Utd continue their run of play they could afford to not care about their last few games, but this is not the case every season as it is in the NFL.

There are so many people in this country who NEED assistance but don't even come close to seeing it because as far as the system is concerned they simply don't exist.

I wish there was a solution to this. Unfortunately, as long as people view the homeless as an inconvenience to avoid and not people who genuinely need help, things aren't set to change any time soon. Politicians certainly don't help matters when homelessness is treated as an inconvenient statistic rather than a very real problem.

I knew a couple of women who were homeless in Providence, RI, and would rather stay on the street than go to the shelters, because they'd be robbed, and raped while there. Also, in the cities they have ""night shelters."" You have to show up by a certain time, and queue up for a bed. If the beds all fill up, you have to sleep on the street. Then, in the morning, you have to grab your stuff and be out of there by 6:30 am. Some of the smaller towns have shelters that you can actually live at for a period of time, to get back on your feet, but they're few and far between.

The atmosphere isn't that great afterwards unfortunately, the majority of fans are straight back on the tube home, which involves a fair amount of queuing. I'd say just get into any nearby pub and have a drink, reflect on the game and chat to any other fans.

The objection I think comes to the idea of therapy for those wishing to become 'ex-gay'. Being homosexual is not recognized as a mental disorder or as being something inherently 'wrong' with a person by the medical establishment and so there are ethical issues with people offering 'treatments' or 'therapy' for it. If you go back to the time when homosexuality was seen as a mental illness there were horrific measures used to try to change people's orientation.

First few episodes were OK and fresh...now he just seems like a cock and his show isn't funny unless you're a 12 year old boy who laughs at naughty words and naked animals.

Also...Top Gear.

I still watch Top Gear and I enjoy it....but it is going downhill very fast.

The show used to be about cars, with lots of interesting info and genuine information...with a few jokes thrown in.

Now it is a show about 3 idiots who do stupid shit in nice cars.

Every time James May tries to explain something and the other two fucking idiots ""shush"" him it makes me so angry. YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONVEY SOME INFORMATION OVER THE TV SCREEN TO A LARGE AUDIENCE but nope...lets make a joke about horse meat because *that is new*...

Watch Top Gear from 2003, and then 2013...You'll see what I mean.

The three of them are genuinely intelligent men, but they act like fucking idiots just to get a larger audience. The whole show is now so scripted I can't laugh at any of it.

**Edit** I think this is the last good thing Top Gear made:

My point here being that (if we take everything at face value) the journalists engaged him in conversation and ""trapped"" him saying lewd things to someone claiming to be a minor. He shouldn't have done it. 

But what's the context? Were they prowling chat sites posing as a young girl to try and coax someone into such an encounter (as is implied in the video - the journalist mentions a ""decoy"" actually being 26) - or did this exchange begin because the *teacher* was prowling for children on the internet? 

It sounds very much like the journalists posed as a child in order to try and ""snare"" someone and to achieve what they have done here. Whilst of course it's not a mitigating circumstance for the (teacher) to go and meet with the girl - it *is* journalists purposefully creating the story *and* potentially enticing the man into it.

But seriously, you guys all realise that you can't actually pick and choose which forms of state censorship you are for and against without looking incredibly hypocritical and self-serving? Or perhaps you would actually *prefer* to live in a place with laws regulating or outlawing every damn thing you dislike?

You all label yourselves as extremely tolerant and unwaveringly pro free-expression, but when it's revealed in post after post that this tolerance is--in reality--reserved only for things or people you agree with, you struggle to see any hypocrisy whatsoever.

Maybe you think TfL is a private body (despite eye-watering amounts of state subsidy) so can withdraw adverts at their own caprice. Perhaps. However, free speech is surely a principle--not a law--and it is quite clear that r/UnitedKingdom's principles are really aligned with their own sense of superiority in thinking they have all the answers and are prepared to spread them by fiat.

Everytime we censor someone, we deprive ourselves of the ability to hear what they say. This means we become complacent in our beliefs because there is nobody around to challenge them. Even if the person challenging them is wrong, it still encourages us to justify why we have our opinions instead of blindly accepting what we think we know. In a society that permits censorship, you are just as likely end up in a situation where you are the one being censored instead of the people you don't like.

Besides, who has the authority to make the decisions on what gets censored? Do you know of anyone you can trust to make these decisions for you?

I started watching at 9's season and after that I jumped to a few classic who episodes just to get a feel of what its come from. I continued to season 2 and I was really enjoying it but my busy schedule was keeping me from watching. I really wanted to catch up completely so I would be able to watch the brand new episodes in march. Then at christmas I watched the Christmas Who Marathon and was introduced to Matt Smith. I fell completely in love with him as the Doctor. I decided at this point to watch from season 5 to the latest episodes. After the second half of season 7 I plan on going back to watch Tennant's run. But I was curious if I would be off put by someone else being the doctor. My only experience with the full generation of a doctor was obviously season 1 and you really don't get all that attached to him. I also don't know what to think about Matt Smith regenerating. At the end of this season he will be equal to the amount of seasons Tennant did. Does this mean his regneration will be coming up soon? I finally understand why people are still attached to Tennant being the Doctor. I feel the same way about Smith.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; TfL's decision was in compliance with article 10 and stopping the advert was justified as its advertising policy clearly stated it could rule against displaying something that could cause ""widespread offence"" and the public body also had a positive duty to promote equality, the court heard.

This must be the grand tradition of free speech Theresa May has been telling us so much about. Snark aside, I think Anglican Mainstream have as much right to advertise their worldview as do Stonewall, even though I'm personally on the side of the latter. To my knowledge there is no evidence that these therapies work, but much the same could be said of homoeopathy and I doubt anyone would oppose the right to advertise their goods so long as disclaimers were abound. 

I suspect the real bone of contention here is whether it can be classified as hate speech. Even accepting that hate speech should be illegal (which I'd dispute) ""Not Gay! Ex-Gay, Post-Gay and Proud. Get Over It."" hardly seems to qualify.  Surely ""Ex-Gays"" have as much right to promote themselves as gays, which appears to be all this advert is doing.

It's clear that there speech can be as potent as a weapon, and I disagree with the modern concept of ""free speech"" which aligns itself to more ""do what ever the fuck you like"".

&gt; A homeowner moved out after finding a buyer for his property only for 13 squatters to wreak £20,000 of damage in month.

Sinn Fein - The biggest republican party in Northen Ireland (wish to leave UK and have a united Ireland). Do not participate in Westminster, when elected they do not vote on issues on a matter of principle, refuse to make the oath of fealty to the Queen.

Plaid Cymru - Social democratic Welsh (cultural) nationalists. In favor of Welsh independence... eventually at some unspecified date... maybe. 

Social Democratic &amp; Labour Party - NI republican party. More moderate than Sinn Fein. Participates at Westminster. Often follows the Labour whip. 

Green - Post-USSR explicitly calling yourself a communist became unpopular.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8392580/Landlord-left-with-squatter-nightmare-because-of-legal-loophole.html

&gt; When squatters took over Noel Kingsbury's house as he was preparing to sell it, it marked the start of an four-month battle which exposes how the law fails to protect homeowners.
&gt; 
&gt; The illegal occupants refused to leave until he had battled through the courts to secure an eviction order.
&gt; 
&gt; When they finally went, they left behind a trail of destruction including walls covered in graffiti, abandoned drug needles and excrement-stained mattresses.
Mr Kingsbury thought he had his property back. He was wrong. Just two weeks later, the squatters returned.
&gt; 
&gt; This time the homeowner assumed that having obtained the original eviction order, he would at least be spared the expense of a second legal tussle. He was wrong again.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to an ""outrageous"" loophole in the law, the court proceedings had to start anew. By the time bailiffs finally evict the squatters tomorrow, Mr Kingsbury, a father of one, will face a total estimated bill of £40,000 for repairs and legal fees.
&gt;
&gt; Mr Kingsbury, a freelance gardening writer, bought the Victorian three-bedroom terrace house in Bristol 14 years ago for £60,000 as a 'buy-to-let' investment.
&gt; 
&gt; He put it on the market last August for £150,000, but his hopes of an sale were set back in November when around 12 squatters moved in.
It cost him £1,300 to secure an eviction order. Once it was in place in mid-December, the squatters left, and the downstairs doors and windows were boarded up to prevent further incursions.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet the security measures proved inadequate. Mr Kingsbury, 53, said: ""Just after New Year a neighbour looked out the window and saw a group of people in the garden with a ladder. There was about 11 of them going up, breaking in through an upper floor window.""
&gt; 
&gt; To the homeowner's disbelief, the squatters were back. In February, he went to court seeking a 'warrant of restitution order', which would allow the original eviction order to be used again.
&gt; 
&gt; However, a judge refused the application because the group claimed they were not the same people as the previous squatters. They were able to exploit a loophole which forces property owners to get fresh eviction orders if new squatters say they have never been at the property before.
&gt; 
&gt; Deputy District Judge Gisby believed the claim, despite a neighbour insisting that some of the latest squatters had been part of the first occupation.
&gt; 
&gt; With a second court order now in place, bailiffs are set to move in tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; The house, on Brook Road in the city's Montpelier district, is one of a swathe of squats that have emerged in the area.
&gt; 
&gt; Just a five minute walk from Mr Kingsbury's house is a bohemian neighbourhood of Bristol which is such a magnet for squatters that it has been dubbed ""The People's Republic of Stokes Croft"".
&gt; 
&gt; At least seven empty houses, shops, offices and warehouses have been occupied by a mix of activists, artists and drifters. Squatted buildings have been turned into a bookshops, gallery and ""free shop"" - but another squatted home is known as an illegal rave venue and a place to buy drugs.
&gt; 
&gt; While the squatters say they are breathing new life into inner-city streets that had been neglected by planners and developers, their middle-class neighbours say they have blighted the area.
&gt; 
&gt; John Gibson, assistant manager of a paint shop, said his staff and customers had to contend with drunkenness, drug abuse and littering.
He said: ""It's worst at the weekends when the all night parties take place. We've had office furniture left outside, a graffitied sofa. Then you open up and the music is still blaring until 10am. Sometimes they are just hanging about outside in the morning, drunk and stoned.""
&gt; 
&gt; At the Smiling Chair bookshop, in a property squatted for four months, a volunteer called Bob said: ""We talked about renting but the owner wanted £125 a week. It wasn't a viable offer.""
&gt; 
&gt; A 21-year-old squatter, who gave his name as Joe, said he had chosen the lifestyle ""because I don't like to see buildings lying empty"". He said: ""I've lived in about 16 squats since I was 16. I go in, stay for a few weeks, a few months, then we get moved on.""
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Kingsbury, who lives with his wife, Jo, near Hay-on-Wye, Herefordshire, said the damage done by the squatters had taken about £30,000 off the value of the house. Legal bills, a ""specialist"" clean-up and lost rent has cost him a further £10,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Under current law, it is a crime to break in to an empty property but not to enter one that has been left insecure. Once squatters are in a building, owners can only enforce their rights by securing orders in the civil courts.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I think it's outrageous. They are stealing property, stealing my services - it's just so wrong to have to take months to get justice,"" said Mr Kingsbury.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I tell my friends from overseas and they look at me with wide-eyed horror at the lunacy of English law.""
&gt; 
&gt; The squatter had moved in to Mr Kingsbury's house after they had been thrown out of the house next door. Peter and Lindy Newton, from London, bought that house intending to move in - but they found that the squatters beat them to it.
&gt; 
&gt; **""I just can't understand why squatting is not a criminal act,"" said Mr Newton, 62, a retired civil servant.**
&gt; 
&gt; **""The only thing you can do is get an eviction order. But the squatters usually skulk away the night before the bailiffs arrive. You're left having to pay for the damage and the utility bills.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Kingsbury's lawyer, Katie Evens, from solicitors' firm Henriques Griffiths, said squatting was becoming an increasingly difficult problem for landlords.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I have dealt with quite a few cases recently in Bristol. They seem to be highly organised groups of squatters. They know exactly what they are doing. They know how to get in and how the law works.""",0,1362187073,null,0,1362187446,0,c8o6fyg,t3_19gt8d,t1_c8o6fyg,t1_c8o6ajd,null,1431455159,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

No. And I don't think you'll find many people who would argue that. 

The criticism for the current proposed implementation is that it does not take into additional factors. There needs to be consideration for locality - whether there are smaller properties available in that area (try to find a one bedroom flat on the islands). And also provisions made for special requirements - disabled individuals may need a spare room for equipment, carers to stay the night - divorced parents may have children visiting intermittently.

Advertising is very much different from two people speaking, it's a shotgun broadcast. It's even funnier because adverts are monopolised by those with the biggest budgets, so on various levels it never was free speech. If you want to talk about property, an advert would be an example of absentee property, there is no ownership to be found, not recognised in the bus driver, not recognised in the travellers, not in the sign maker, not really in the bus company either, and not really in Anglican Mainstream. AM would be an absentee owner of the message and the bus company would own the physical form.

I don't believe that the idea behind the #backingbelfast campaign was in any way thought of to deal with sectarianism though. It's a difficult economy for some and cash flow has been greatly affected by the protests/riots. The campaign is to get people back in Belfast and to demonstrate that it's not all horrible as depicted in the news worldwide.

Sectarianism is something much different. If the protesters were refusing to shop in 'Catholic' shops, or something as ridiculous then yes, the campaign could be targeted at sectarianism. Belfast as a city and possibly Northern Ireland as a country in the near future will see lingering negative effects of the past 3 months, regardless of religion. Tourism, where we've been making bank the past while, is going to take a big hit from this.

Reducing sectarianism is about educating and creating cross community bonds, building on good experiences. Catholics aren't all GAA playing alcoholics and Protestants aren't all cricket playing tossers 

I don't even like using the term sectarian because I feel the idea of protestants and catholics 'fighting' to be long outdated. There is a difference in political beliefs and desires that can be deemed to coincide with religious beliefs but the idea that whether or not you believe Mary was the dog's balls and needs prayed to doesn't define whether or not you think there should be a line on a map to split this island.

Example; I'm not religious, do I want a united ireland?

Backin' Belfast isn't what I would go for personally, I think it's a cheap and cheesy campaign, but I avoided Belfast over Christmas because I didn't want to risk getting caught up in trouble. I won't have been the only one.

Yes, there are even 'chuck wagons' wandering around handing over free food to the homeless.  The problem is a complete lack of capacity in all aspects.

Which considering just how much food and other material over production this country is capable of if it puts its mind to it is... well retarded.

It'd be trivial to build modern hirise flats, with a counsellors office, communal areas (think a miniature Megablock from the Dredd movie) and instantly stop anyone in the UK being homeless... which was in some respects the original point of a council house.

The best you can do is use ECT as part of revulsion therapy and make someone asexual; they'll still be sexually attracted to whichever gender they originally were but won't want to be electrocuted any more so don't act on it.   With further zapping you can probably make a gay man impregnate a woman , but that doesn't mean the guy isn't gay... just he doesn't want to be tortured any more.

Sexual preference is a non malleable part of the a persons psyche.  Same as gender self image.

Often they put in advertising for other BBC programmes. That's not news.

I would be willing to bet it's been swimming in news about Pistorious the last week. Not interesting.

Loads of house price ramping. ""In good news for the economy house prices have gone up"". Really? Is petrol going up good too?

News about the royals that is embarrassing propaganda. (Grovelling shit Witchall and use of weird language like ""there can be no doubt that the queen is ..."").

News about the media as though they are not the media ""look at the media harassing celebrity X"" even though they have a camera there too.

News about celebs. Do not put this on.

Terrible business coverage. ""The pound dropped like a stone today but we won't mention that an instead will say the FTSE rose as that sounds nice and our job on state tv is to give you good news even though the two are related but we don't get that"".

Overall anything they do cover is paper thin. I don't want to think about it any more! It's dire. It's not even partisan as the issues are so shit and so thin. Radio 4 pisses me off sometimes for being partisan leftie but at least I'm aware something occurred even if I disagree with the interpretation.

true,brain4breakfast,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"You're completely right, and people are downvoting you after searching for fifty seconds on Wikipedia without knowing the facts. The crucial difference being between the Monarch and the institution of the Crown.

1) The Crown owns land. The monarch is a large part of the crown, but is not it all. The monarch does not own the land itself.

2) The Crown surrenders all profits from royal land in return for a stable salary. This started after the seven years war when Britain lost the USA and the Crown  was in massive debt. 

3) This deal is beneficial to parliament. They managed to recuperate their costs in less than 30 years and have been making profit ever since. 

4) the monarch's largely ceremonial role is protected due to this deal. To remove the monarch, it would cost four hundred million pounds a year from lost profit on royal land. Admittedly, parliament wouldn't need to pay the Royal family their salary any more. But that's a quarter of what you would lose, not including Royal tourism.

5) Reforming the UK into a republic could cost as much as one billion pounds (estimate, 2005)

I know it's supposedly against peoples' morals, but we're taking their money while they're doing their job , as an employee of the state, REALLY WELL.

We have far the better deal at the moment than we would if we let them be a rich, land owning, tax dodging billionaire dynasty..

And for those asking, As much as you'd just like to see them kicked out on the street, that's illegal.

This is how economy works - it will settle itself eventually.



Well the EU has complete open door already, they didn't collapse. Most immigrants are from outside the EU. The mobility inside the EU generates more wealth than if it wouldn't happen. If labour moves inside the EU, it will create a short supply back home and raise wages, taxes. It also opens the market for capital movement - which I assure you is far more important that the free right to work.



Eastern European states lack capital  - the communist regime wasn't built on the principle of capital ownership. But here we are in Capitalism and everybody needs it. Who has it? The West. You are free to buy properties, factories, business everywhere without any obstacles. It would take 2 more generations for an average European to gather that capital. 



I'm sorry, you cannot have one without the other. 



But I do agree with you - immigration must be a controlled process with laws, regulations and institutions to watch over it.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"&gt; I can't stay in this country because the weather is shit primarily.

The weather in the UK is actually pretty decent compared to most places in the world.  It rarely drops far below freezing point so snow and ice are little more than occasional inconveniences.  Similarly, our summers are generally quite tolerable.  There's perhaps a few weeks of the year when it might be unpleasantly hot, but I prefer that to living in a country where air conditioning in your home and car is a necessity rather than a luxury.

Also consider the vegetation.  You don't have to get much hotter (e.g. Spain, Portugal, the south of France) for the landscape to turn from rich green to sandy brown.  I like my country lanes with green trees, fields and hedgerows.

To be honest, if you're living in Liverpool then you should go and spend a bit of time on the south coast to see how much better the weather is.  The distance from Liverpool to Plymouth is third of the distance from Liverpool to the north coast of Spain: [proof](http://i.imgur.com/JgRBWxA.jpg).  Not that I'm suggesting that Plymouth is necessarily a great place to live, but rather that you shouldn't judge the weather in the UK as a whole based on what you get in Liverpool.

The big push is for ""file sharing"" infringements.


People will eventually catch on and move to other services that do not involve sharing the download.
However the law will most certainly change to take this into consideration.


The secret world of the Bbs is making a limited return, as are sneaker nets.


Groups of friends are collaborating and downloading parts of torrents instead of full downloads.
Then recompiling the smaller parts, then sharing the download.


VPN's are suitable for almost everyone, but I don't think it will be too much longer until someone creates a commercial, faster version of tor.


Oh the horror!

I'm not certain how much Green or Norris would have improved the midfield, though. The problem we had back in 10/11 was that we **had** to play 4-2-3-1 with a central midfield trio of Johnson, Kilkenny and Howson, or else our results and performances dropped alarmingly. The problem was, as we all knew then, that our midfield would still get turned over by better teams (some things never change) and it needed a 'general' to take it by the scruff of the neck. We either needed someone with immense experience and ability with the ball at his feet to replace Kilkenny, or someone outstanding off the ball to replace Johnson and play the part of the midfield bruiser.

Green and Norris don't fit either role, in my opinion. At best, they would have served as an understudy for Howson in his role behind Becchio (although Norris has seemed lackluster when played there a couple of times this season). The closest we have is Austin, and before his injury I would have strongly agreed, but now he looks nothing like the player we thought he was.

**Head-to-head**


•	This is the 30th competitive match between these clubs and a home victory would level the head-to-head standings at 13 wins apiece.

•	Chris Wood scored the only goal when the teams met at the New Den earlier in the season, but Leeds were reduced to 10 men early in the second half when Luke Varney received his marching orders.

•	Millwall have only registered three league wins at Elland Road, and on the most recent in March 2010 they completed their second league double over the Yorkshire side.

**Leeds United**

•	Leeds have failed to win five of their last six league and cup games, but are within six points of the play-offs.

•	However, United are vying for an eighth league win in nine outings at Elland Road, and have conceded only two goals in the last seven games on their own pitch.

•	At 64 years of age, Leeds boss Neil Warnock is the oldest manager in the Championship.

**Millwall**

•	Millwall ended a four-match losing league run with last Saturday's 2-1 away victory over Middlesbrough.

•	The three points at the Riverside Stadium was also the Lions' first victory in seven away league games, in which five points out of 21 have been claimed.

•	The first goal Millwall score will be their 400th in all competitions under Kenny Jackett, who has been in his post for five years and four months, and is the longest serving manager in the Championship.",0,1362228945,null,0,false,0,c8odyzf,t3_19iqka,t1_c8odyzf,t3_19iqka,null,1431458891,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

These are becoming very uncommon, and there aren't too many of these left, for obvious reasons.  A dry shelter doesn't allow drugs or drink, and they usually not only force the people who go there into going to AA whether or not they actually need it, but they also incorporate some of the AA ideals into their day-to-day operations and rules. If you stay at a dry shelter, and you return from your day drunk or high, they throw you out on the street on the spot.

With regard to AA, it is usually an understanding that when a person joins AA, they aren't supposed to be involved in any relationships for 1-2 years, allegedly so they can focus on themselves and their sobriety.

Also, around here, the shelters are more geared to help addicts and psych problems rather than those of us who are simply just poor, lost their job, etc. They will try to force AA on the people as a condition of residing there, no matter what. Also, the shelters find it simpler, at least in the case of a co-ed shelter that is not designated as being a family shelter, to disallow relationships among residents. By doing that, they eliminate a lot of the drama some people have in their relationships, as well as break-up drama, and residents sneaking around to have sex.

The idea is that if you're married, or have children, you should try to get into a family shelter, so the family is kept together. The co-ed type shelters, with separate sleeping areas for men &amp; women, are meant for single people with no children. The thing is, there's more of those type shelters, and the ones that deal exclusively with either men or women, than there are family type shelters. So, if you need a bed that bad, you either have to abide their rules, or go camp in the woods, or sleep in the street.
