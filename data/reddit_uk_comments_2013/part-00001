Being British is purely cultural and geographical. 

We don't like to be openly nationalist because it is a very British thing to do. Humbleness and reservation are British cultural traits, which you would know if you were British.

They can't go down because they would have to fight Daleks, and Daleks are unstoppable. The cognitive dissonance must have been mind-blowing for them.

Yet if you show up on the day and purchase 2 day returns (grab any train you feel like) on 2 specific dates it will cost you £40. 

This is great because when I go on holiday I spend a day in London at a mueseum, then go to heathrow and on my return spend another day in london seeing friends. Only £40 and I can take any train. No rushing at all.

I'm guessing peterborough's ticketing is better than most other places since its so central to most lines resulting in huge number of people switching there.

That first route is pretty much the way I go, going along the river out of Oxford is good to avoid the traffic but can be muddy at this time of year. Probably worth doing it a few times to get your confidence up but consider carrying on over donning ton bridge and along the road through Kennington if you have any problems / want to be quicker.

The alternative ending that you posted should be fine, but I have found that the road through Milton can be a little fast and there is no cycle lane. Again maybe get your confidence up first if you are in any doubt.

My company provides showers, I'm not sure if there are any on the park itself. There is actually a Milton park cycling forum that may be able to answer that one for you, http://www.mepc.com/parklife/miltonpark/BUG.aspx

As for kit, get the best lights that you can afford, the cycle path from Sutton Courtney to Abingdon is not lit, neither is the river or a few key points along the way. Waterproof gear and a hump (http://www.respro.com/products/urban-commuting/hi-visibility/hiviz_hump/) is also good.

I was completely new to it when I started out as well, I did a practice ride at the weekend and got the train home from Didcot, realised it wasn't as bad as I feared (at least Oxfordshire is flat) and haven't looked back :)

edit: Let me rephrase that, because, well you're right!

1. I knew we would underestimate QPR and play a B squad, this is what I would consider a must win game and I think not starting our full strength squad was a mistake that I saw coming.

2. QPR was the heavy underdog here, we were expected to win. The Blues do much, much better when they are the underdog. (For example Napoli 2nd leg champs league last year, CWC this year...)

Why underestimate QPR? We're not in a position to *maybe* lose or tie a game, we needed a win.

**Henderson**: I was hoping I could type out my first sentence, and because of this player and Downing I can. Had a great game, held the ball well and was hungry, nice to see him get an applause from Sunderland too. whyayeman/10

**Lucas**: Had a job, done it brilliantly. I have nothing to say, he was great, this performance was just like last season. brazilian/10

**Stewart ‘The master of the first touch’ Downing**: Great! This is the man we paid for. His first touches where incredible, should have been rewarded with a goal or an assist at least, but really happy to see him step up and work for his spot in the squad. firsttouch/10

**Sterling**: GOLAZO. Awesome, I like his haircut, it makes him even better. Nothing less than we expected tbh, he’s so hyped up but he’s continuing to deliver (even moreso now). chippy/10

**Suarez**: C’mon. I don’t need to say anything. He’s been great. Deserved goals, always active, he’s like a kid on Christmas morning. booifyou’rescaredofSuarez/10


**Subs**

**Carragher**: Held the ball, the reason he was brought on. scouse/10

**Allen**: Aw c’mon, please score! I am a fan of him and he had a good game high up the pitch. welshxavi/10

**Suso**: Had a good few attacks, that was his aim and he done it well. Good game. ilikehishair/10


**MAN OF THE MATCH** 

Forgot about this.

Everyone. No but seriously it has to be Suarez.

I have ALWAYS avoided the Torres conversations because up until now I have been undecided about him, but enough is enough.

Put him in the fucking reserves for christ-sake, he's an awful piece of shit with no future in football.

Stupid starting 11 from Rafa. NO Mata? ok, he needs a rest. No Hazard? Sure he's been relatively quiet recently, but I'd feel more comfortable with him playing when Mata is on the bench No Cole? Berty is coming back from injury and Cole is an important part of our attack down the sides. Not to mention we need all the defence we can get with Ross in goal.

Ross Turnbull, not bad, keep it up.

Iva, never shoot again please.

Marin, Yup ya ballsed that one up have fun on the bench.

My point being, if you want to score it is much better to have a player who's used to scoring and naturally plays a higher more attacking position than to have a defender. 

If Rafa had brought in Hazard and Mata earlier Lampard would do much more since Eden and Mata already connect really well and you add Lampard's perfectly timed runs to that combo and you've got some deadly plays.

Henderson and Downing looked as good as their original price tags suggested, Gerrard's passing was brilliant and his assist to Suarez sublime. Lucas offered great support for the full backs defending which gave them so much freedom to push higher, he was always an option. 

Sterling's goal was excellently taken. Top players provide finishes like that. Suarez's assist was just as exceptional and he deserved his two goals today if not a hatrick with his performance.

Suso and Allen both impressed me as well when they came on. Allen was unfortunate not to get his first goal, Johnson was just offside. Carragher is close approaching 500 Prem appearances as well.

That would force train companies to actually provide enough carriages. 

Its fair enough that on some occasions trains are full but when it happens **every single day** that is surely the fault of the train companies..

The really annoying thing about the train I get is that put extra carriages on on even hours, not odd. This means the train at 5.30 pm is completely full every single day. The one at 6.30 nearly empty.

true,TheScarletPimpernel,null,null,"I do player ratings on another forum. I've put them up here before, but I usually forget.

Average 6.

&gt;GK

**Reina** - 7. Calm and confident, beating away everything Sunderland managed to cobble together.

&gt;Defence

**Wisdom** - 7. Rock solid springs to mind. Johnson caused him a little difficulty in the second half but on the whole shut up shop and kept it shut.

**Skrtel** - 7. His usual hard-tackling self. Showed some excellent attitude at the other end when hunting the ball down after a set piece.

**Agger** - 7.5. Kept the backline locked down and played some nice football, too.

 **Johnson** - 7. Almost scored what would have been one of the flukiest goal I've ever seen, but still. Very well done again tonight.

&gt;Midfield

**Gerrard** - 7.5. Embarrassed once in the first half by a lack of awareness, but still emerged from the game with two assists (can we call Suarez's first goal an assist?) and a reasonable performance. I can feel a piledriver coming, I can.

**Lucas** - 6.5. Somewhat poor in the tackle tonight, caught off guard a few times - but his passing and general presence ensured an above average performance.

**Hendo** - 7.5. He's been quality recently, no? The energy he adds in that midfield is phenomenal. His passing is effective, his one touch play betrays a very clever footballing brain, and he has excellent technique. All in all, he will be staying here until the summer. And am I mistaken, or did he get a standing ovation? Serious question.

&gt;Attack

**Sterling** - 8. What a finish. He played with penetration, verve, and kept Sunderland under constant pressure.

**Suarez** - 9 MotM. I'm not even going to bother dissecting this one, he was just...Suarez. Assist was fantastic, first goal was better, second goal was just incredible. Such deftness of touch...

**Downing** - 7. Not quite as effective as in recent games but still offered a high level of energy, pulled some new tricks out of the bag and was unlucky to neither score or assist.

&gt;Subs


**Allen** - 7.5. This is why we bought him. He broke up Sunderland's attacks, played the ball away, and bust a gut to get to the other end of the pitch. His finishing needs some work, and the gods really did have it in for him tonight, but he looked at home for possibly the first time in a Red shirt.

**Suso** - 6.5. Technically superb, as always. Not as high a level of involvement as we would all like, but he played some neat football when he got the ball and looked involved throughout.

**Carragher** - 6.5. Helped keep the clean sheet. Not really much more to be said.

true,szlafarski,lfc99,,"I think that's how BR and crew already feel. He's vocalized his feelings about the January transfer window and said any new changes will be made in July when a proper assessment of the year is made.

Quite frankly I thought that Cole+Downing out and Sturridge+Ince in would solve our problems. Downing however is looking really good, but the prospect of Ince coming back is just SO inviting.

Right now this is our senior team (more or less)

Strikers/Forwards: Suarez, Borini, Sturridge
Wingers: Sterling, Assaidi, **Downing
Attacking midfielders: Suso, *Shelvey, *Gerrard, **Cole
Box to Box midfielders: Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Gerrard, Shelvey, **Sahin
Fullbacks: Johnson, Enrique, Kelly, Wisdom
Centre backs: Agger, Skrtel, Coates, Carragher, *Kelly, *Wisdom

(*filling other positions, **potentially on the way out)

It's pretty clear that we need a real attacking midfielder (Mata/Cazorla/Eriksen/Sneijder/Hazard style) because putting that pressure on Suso is a little much. Shelvey has shown potential to fill that spot but it's too early to tell what type of player he will become. Gerrard was once that player but he isn't 25 anymore.

Between our Strikers/Forwards (3) and Wingers (2) by the summer time we should be fine, totaling 5 options out of a demand of 3 on the pitch. Having one striker and winger on the bench is ideal.

Box to box/defensive, we're good. Lucas is world class and Allen and Henderson are proving to be good options there as well. Even with Sahin going home, we have loads of options. 

Come Summer 2013, should Downing and Cole be gone, I think we will be one more GREAT attacking midfielder/creator and maybe one Ince away from a squad that will be a top 4 contending squad.

but

Should a hotel be able to charge more for rooms in the summer? Their costs (catering, staff, upkeep) is largely static over the year, yet holidays are a lot more expensive in the summer.... it's just because of supply and demand. They could charge less in the summer but then they'd be oversubscribed and wouldn't be making as much of a profit. Now there's the (very valid) argument that the rail service is a public service first, not a profit making company, but then people complain about the govt holding up barely profitable services, so which is it.

The fact is, the demand dictates the price. If price goes up so people consider car (my boss has stopped paying £3600 for a yearly season ticket and is buying a car this year for example), then that's reaching the upper threshold that people are willing to pay for trains. From a business viewpoint, to charge lower than that would be silly (since people will buy anyway). 

The reason it's so cheap on the weekend is it's on an off peak (read: significantly quieter) service, and since it's unlikely to be a commute (since buying advance off peak tickets every day is unlikely) it's probably not an essential trip, so they want to be sure that you go by train. 

Their costs are (virtually) the same whether or not you travel by train so it's in their best interest for you to get on.


Yes, I do think it's bullshit, but don't think ""this ticket should cost £12.50 but instead it costs £108!"", because that's not really true. Rather, if their business analysts sat down and did complex maths or something they might come up with a figure given the average (across all times of day/week) passenger numbers, and the cost/count of trains on the line etc, an optimal price per person. Pulling it out of my arse they might come up with a figure like, say, £80.

So what they do is raise it up to £108 for the people who have to go, because these people need it anyway, and they lower it to £12 for the people who don't have to go, to entice them in.

true,doody,null,null,"Thanks for posting this. I heard it before, but those stations are an abiding fascination for me, since I encountered a number station, or at least that’s what I think it was, at an early age.

I was about 11, on a family holiday in Scotland. Sitting in the dark in the back of the car, late at night and driving up the highlands, I heard a short and very peculiar tune on the radio, then a long pause, and then the tune repeated. The forth or fifth time it came up, my uncle tuned the radio away, but I had caught sight of roughly where it was on the radio dial.

We got the late ferry to the Isle of Skye, and when we arrived I had my own little room in the roof of the guest house – with a radio. So, very late and out of curiosity, I hunted on the little transistor dial until I found that weird, haunting refrain. Short, just two bars long, it was the scratchy sound of two or three horns, in a mechanical and unsatisfying descending cadence. Then about 15 or 20 seconds of dead air, and then the same twisty little half-tune. I knew that more than 2 hours ago, the station had been broadcasting the very same thing, and surely, no-one would be broadcasting that as listening material. If you heard it once, you wouldn’t need to hear it again for pleasure or for entertainment. I figured that there must be another purpose to the station. It must broadcast something else, and this tune must simply be a way for its listeners to find the station. Radios in those days commonly did have shortwave, but they rarely had presets.

Every time I was in the room by myself, I left the radio on, and I heard nothing but those mournful horns.

After the holiday when I got home, I listened to it some more, but it really couldn’t compete with the other delights that radio had to offer. But I listened when I could, and always at different times. And each time I tuned in and there wasn’t a programme, just that flat herald, I reckoned that whatever it was that they did broadcast, it must be pretty short, and very infrequent. And it must have a very tiny audience. I’d love to say that I guessed it broadcast for an audience of one, but I never made that jump. I did figure that it was something quite secret, but, of course, young boys see secrets everywhere.

I still remember the tune, though.",0,1357165425,null,0,false,0,c7pxskp,t3_15tvep,t1_c7pxskp,t3_15tvep,null,1430836746,6,false,BritishRadio,t5_2sbl7,6

true,Axius,uk,United Kingdom,"I would have to say that recruitment values could do with being re-evaluated. You obviously need workers more conscientious than you are getting, and I do find there is certainly an absence of that throughout everyone these days, not just the youth.

There doesn't seem to be much desire to 'do a good job' with things because there is not much recognition for doing more than just needs to be done, and that is behaviour I feel reinforced by the working culture of 'achieving targets'. Everywhere I have worked, I have worked alongside people whose only concern in the job was to reach their daily target then slow down.

Yes, the work gets done, but there is a marked decrease in quality after they reach their targets. Then there's management who oversee things like overhauls of IT systems who then come to you to ask why you aren't outputting the same levels of work 2 weeks after a new and much slower system has been implemented; that kind of shit is demoralising and makes you feel your efforts are not appreciated. If you don't make efforts feel valued, you'll see a lot less of them.

Of course, that doesn't mean the people you are describing simply don't feel valued. There is every possibility they just feel they are young and should have a life and consequences be damned.

I know that when I apply for a job, it is something I will be able to perform well in and I believe I will want to produce results I am satisfied with. Generally everywhere I have worked has been pleased with the work I do because I enjoy being as efficient and accurate as possible. I know not everyone is like me, and that's okay, but I have seen people who genuinely do not care and expected me to pick up their slack. It's always going to be anecdotal evidence, but I do know there's a real mixed bag of employees out there.

My biggest concern is that there are a lot of unemployed youths out there who would be EXACTLY what your company is looking for who would be infinitely better than the people you hired but because of overvaluing of supposed 'transferable skills' and previous experience and some kind of doggedness on the part of employers to want to avoid training anyone where possible, these people are being left out. Hell, I feel even charismatic overconfidence in interviews seems to be a selling point now.

I'd like businesses to genuinely give the lesser skilled people a chance. I do seriously believe that they could surprise. Giving someone who feels they might not be skilled enough for a position a chance to prove they are is probably a lot better for productivity than someone who doesn't want to take responsibility or ownership of their own mistakes/work.",0,1357165868,null,0,false,0,c7pxxhh,t3_15tmg3,t1_c7pxxhh,t1_c7pvzs3,null,1430836819,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't mind a slightly convoluted plot every now and then as long as it keeps me entertained during the episode, which that one did. And it had some really great parts too, for my money. The evironment of the Asylum was one of the creepiest we've seen in a while, Oswin was hilarious all the way through, and the part where the Doctor admitted he knew he was somewhat responsible for the Daleks becoming stronger, and that he had tried to stop it (retroactively making the Season 4 finale much better, IMO) all helped me really enjoy it. 
 
 Amy and Rory's thing did bother me- much more, considering how nasty they were to each other when they didn't really have a problem.

The Doctor even brought the matter up about not destroying the insane Daleks. The Prime Minister said that it was offensive to extinguish their ""divine hatred"". It even posited that they couldn't bring themselves to actually kill the Doctor because of the intensity of their hatred for him. The fact that the Daleks were unwilling to go themselves just illustrates quite how insane the Asylum was to even scare a Dalek.

Bringing the Doctor in to solve their problem would've been ideal, though. He can't refuse because he's surrounded. If he succeeds, they'll blow up the planet with him still on it, and if he fails, he's as good as dead down there. What they didn't count on was losing all record of him.

The impure Daleks they executed were different though; they were not pure Kaled but were made up of scraps of other species, therefore not true Dalek, therefore a different form of life which Daleks swore to destroy.

The divorce proceedings did seem sudden, but we hadn't seen how long it had been until then; we didn't see a problem until the argument they had before the Doctor left the last voicemail. It was Amy's misguided attempt to save Rory from a childless marriage, and Amy can be very determined.

You certainly have been able to on some routes since privatisation.

It's been a few years since I made the journey, but you used to have a choice between Virgin and Chiltern (??) train companies between Milton Keynes and London.

Virgin trains were faster and more expensive, Chiltern about 40% cheaper (a little over half the price) and stopped at every station on the way.

I don't really have a firm opinion about privatisation vs nationalisation, but if you were around before privatisation you will remember that British Rail was frequently awful, with dated and under-maintained rolling stock. 

You talk of the goal of getting cars off the road, but do you drive yourself? I didn't until I was 30 or 32 and, after riding motorcycles and using public transport for over a decade of adulthood, found owning a car to be a revelation in convenience and luxury.

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"I can see where you're coming from, but I'd have to disagree. His movement wasn't that noticeable because he was on the ball so much, completely controlling the game with his passing. Even so, I thought his movement was efficient, he made the runs when needed and was always available for the lay off, where he was ready to switch the field of play.

The one thing that I would criticize him for was his defensive work in the first 20-30 minutes of the 1st half. Sunderland's 1st chance with McClean was partially because Gerrard was watching McClean, Johnson and Fletcher pass the ball around Lucas. They all played in the bit of space around Lucas and in front of Skagger, where Gerrard should have been. He definitely improved his work rate and closing down after that though, I don't know if it was because we had the ball more or not. 

That would be my only critcisism of his game today though, other than that I thought he was absolutely fantastic in his deep lying playermaker role.

Edit: Gerrard started all 3 goal scoring moves today, with Suarez being the other person involved in all 3 goals as well. Further proof that they were our best players today by far.

Also their first chance was missed by McClean, not Fletcher, like I incorrectly said. Fletcher probably would have buried that too, so thankfully it wasn't him.",0,1357168127,null,0,1357170629,0,c7pym4n,t3_15ujoa,t1_c7pym4n,t1_c7py6f7,null,1430837127,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,pikeybastard,null,null,"I was having a really interesting conversation on this topic over Christmas with a friend's dad who worked for British rail and then moved to Tfl before retiring . I put to him this argument essentially, because to me it seemed so self-evident that a return to nationalisation would answer many of these issues. I'll relay what he said to me as I remember it, because I guess he has an interesting perspective, whether you agree with it or not I hope it adds to the discussion.

He argued that railways do not represent a monopoly, because the competition, rather than being with a different train operator on the same routes, is with other forms of transport. In other words, people make decisions as to whether to ride the trains as opposed to coaches, buses, cars, planes, whatever. I argued that they are a different series of decisions- for example, taxis long distance explode in cost, planes are inconvenient, and that cars require significant upfront investment (lessons, insurance, buying/renting a car), and you can't drink and drive. You can't drive a car into London to drink for NYE for instance and still party, or at least you need to plan it and have a place to stay.

He countered that my arguments were focused upon decisions that are immediate and located only in the needs of today, and that when you deliberate upon decisions regarding infrastructure the answers that people find need to be not only long term, but functionalist- in other words, not merely needing to understand what problems will need to be answered, but how those answers in term will shape the society and decisions that will be made in the future. The issues we face now are the result of decisions made a long time ago, obviously, too.

He also said that operators not only compete with other forms of transport, but on record; a bad operator loses its franchise, like connex did in the south east, and that this needs to be more immediate a threat in the current climate.

The reasons he gave for the current clusterfuck are decades of under-investment in the rail system (the track, the network, the stations, proper route planning, triage and prioritisation of resources and rolling stock etc) due to the country's infatuation with cars and road-building- soemthing that also destroyed many town centres. The railways suffered, and built up a kind of 'operational debt' (not financial, just in what it could deliver) that British Rail couldn't cope with, meaning that by the 90's the system was creaking. It needed huge investment, and that was what led government (both Tory and then New Labour) to come round to an idea that even Margaret Thatcher baulked at, which was privatisation (of the railways, not full-stop obviously!). His argument was that if you privatise the system, the rail operator needs 'ownership' responsibility for the infrastructure, and that the efficient maintenance of it and investment in it is a key part of how tenders and contracts are won. Instead, because Railtrack was privatised in a hurry before the Conservatives inevitable electoral oblivion, it became a rush job with no core accountability. When Railtrack inevitably failed in the early 00's, rather than the state organ of National Rail (which costs ridiculous amounts), he argued that as privatisation had begun, and that the nationalised British Rail hadn't been particularly good in its own right, and furthermore that no government could afford renationalisation overnight, that the operators should have been forced to take responsibility for the infrastructure as part of their service offer.

So basically his argument was we have the worst of both worlds, and have done for decades- a nationalised operator that under-invested for 50 years, and cut provision drastically, or unaccountable profiteering with the state still picking up the tab (and lacking the wherewithal to invest to bring costs down and improve facilities) for much of what actually makes the system work. So fares go up, but nothing improves. His solution was either totally nationalisation coupled with a will to put railways ahead of roads and air in transport policy (which we can't afford) or going the whole hog with privatisation and making operators both more responsible but with perhaps bigger incentives for success- a bigger stick, and a bigger carrot.

I hope this isn't long and rambling, and I may have got things wrong somewhere, as this is relayed rather than my own ideas. It foxed me, as I'd been very certain regarding nationalisation, and I guess this is why the Tories were nervous about privatisation in the first place, and Labour are nervous about re-nationalisation. I thought it was interesting anyway.

Does it matter that the you on Mars is a 'copy' if the original disappears?

Now consider the Doctor. The regeneration process is sort of like the old Doctor's body being disintegrated, because every cell of his body changes during regeneration. I suppose you could cling to the fact that the same molecules are involved, even if they've been completely rearranged. 

So, it's a philosophical question. If it were me, and I lost my personality, then I would consider regeneration to be death, and the birth of a new person who benefits from my memories. And in light of the Mars example, even if I retained my personality, I might still consider the process to mean my death.

If we don't take the option of nationalisation we can't allow the current situation to remain and must, as you say, force the companies involved to be responsible for upkeep of infrastructure and place more accountability within the contracts.

I disagree on your father's reasons for keeping faith with that option rather than the nationalisation option though. They seem to be 1) privatisation has already begun 2) British Rail was a bit crap and 3) no government can afford to privatise the industry overnight. Well 1) isn't a reason at all in my opinion, 2) was partly caused by massive underfunding and needn't always be the case. The amount we're putting into subsidies now is certainly more than British Rail got! and 3) doesn't apply because it would happen through buying back the contracts one by one as they expire. The money saved in subsidy should definitely go a long way towards running the next contract. Look at the profit margins of the current operators if you don't think that's the case!

I also think competition is basically non-existent. You yourself pointed out why competition with other forms of transport doesn't make sense, and if we want to reduce carbon emissions as a country we don't want our railways to be losing the competitiveness war with driving. Competition based on record is like I pointed out in my original post predicated on ministers being able to choose a franchise that will actually do better amidst a small pool of options after a long term contract has expired.

As for the mention of craft beers... after being converted I've moved away from mainstream lagers and on to craft beers, mostly stouts and IPAs.

I've attended a few craft beer meetups and they regularly use Fosters as a control group for tasting. Hell, they even doctored the beer by deliberately tainting it with bad ingredients and brewing issues and it tasted better than the regular stuff out of the tap.

In a few larger cities around the UK there's Brew Dog which is pretty good for getting in to craft ale, not least for the educational side of things.

Really?! This sub cracks me up sometimes. Did you ever see the documentary where they took a newspaper with a picture of the twin towers being hit to Afghanistan? Think anyone knew what it was? Nope. You'd think that would shed a little light on the level of education and media penetration in Afghanistan. When your knowledge of politics puts you on a par with an Afghan warlord who's probably can't even read, you're in trouble. We didn't do into Afghanistan to bring democracy, it was to deprive international terrorists (Who do, by the way, exist. Just thought I'd get an inb4 in there quickly) of a training ground and sanctuary, after three thousand people were killed in the US. It creeped into establishing stability as the years went by to maintain some semblance of order (initially insurgent activity was almost non existent). I would take a serious look at how you view the world if you can agree with this guy, who only a few sentences ago, claimed the Prince was in Afghanistan to drunkenly slaughter as many Afghans as possible.

In the UK, the DfT hands out franchises by bidding (though that process is pending review!) for specific routes, so for one whole ""route"" there is no competition. Of course, routes often converge at a certain point (especially around major cities), but more often than not this is part of a local, stopping, train and long distance, non-stopping, train divide.

The model used in Germany, which has certainly been a successful model and quite probably a good one to imitate, is that all long distance routes by the former national operator were spun off into a single company, and regional ones to another. These two companies have very different charters and very different goals. Further to this, provided you convince the governing body you are capable of running a TOC (i.e., have the funding, have the ability to get rolling stock to use, have a maintenance plan, etc.), you will get a license granted.

I promise you Australians and Canadians and South Africans feel the exact same way we do. You just don't understand what I'm saying. They would understand a lot better than you.

I love being American. I wouldn't change it for the world. I would rather be from America than Britain. I love our culture, our cities, our sports, our entertainment. In a lot of ways, we're superior to you. Okay? Can that put to rest this narcissistic, deluded fantasy you have that I secretly want to be from modern-day Britain? Y'all are goofy and quaint. I don't care about modern-day Britain. It bores me, to be honest.

&gt; There are Indian people in Britain, who are British. There are Pakistani people, who are British. There are Africans, Caribbeans, Europeans and Asians who are all British. Being British does not imply any racial or ethnic features. Being British is purely cultural and geographical. 

This is the only fucking thing I've been saying this entire goddamn time. Guess what! There are British people in America! Many of the Asian, African, and Middle Eastern people in Britain were born in Britain. But they're still Asian, African, and Middle Eastern. Likewise, I'm still European, ethnically. You get what ethnicity is, right? It's similar to race. It's about genetics. Haplotypes and haplogroups and shit.

&gt; Being British is purely cultural and geographical. 

Not in all cases. You're conflating nationality (aka citizenship) with ethnicity (which is more about a historical gene pool).

You need to read [this article on progressive nationalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_nationalism). It's not about superiority. It's simply about identity and autonomy (often in the face of oppression). Obviously, Britain has a long history of oppression, but it also has a long history of being invaded and oppressed so maybe you can find a quiet, humble sense of national self. Our ancestors did when they fought back against the many invading forces. It would be pretty insulting to them (and many oppressed peoples around the world) to call them xenophobic, prejudiced, and having delusions of superiority. 

The fact is, Europe has a very skewed, radical view of nationalism due to your fascist history. It's not like that in other places. And we're not wrong.

Well it's sort of like Schrodinger's Cat. Until someone is convicted at their guilt or innocence is unknown. But we're supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt, i.e. to not say they are guilty. 

Before anyone says that in the Shrodinger's Cat case the cat is in a superposition of &lt;dead|alive&gt;, it [has been argued](http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/43411) that the wave function collapse is something that happens in your head. I.e. it is a state of knowledge changing, not something that happens to the cat. 

Now our legal system effectively monopolises wave function collapse to guilty. So it forces us to to say that someone in the &lt;innocent|guilty&gt; state must not be described as guilty until a court collapses the wave function to guilty.

We're talking about guilty of some specific crime here. Describing someone as a complete and utter cunt and painfully unfunny (to pick two random examples) is a matter of opinion and is not covered. What you can't do is say ""X is guilty of Y"" unless X has been convicted of crime Y by a court.

true,widgetas,null,null,"All state funded schools (save for some special cases, I think) are required by law to make children take part in collective worship, of a primarily Christian nature, every day. This goes for all schools (not Muslim schools, of course) whether or not they are faith schools. It so happens that at the end of last year the government recognized that most schools don't observe this law, though I think that they're still uneasy about scrapping it.

Why that is, is beyond me and many others. The schools aren't doing it anyway, and that's before considering forcing a religion on children (removing kids can be tricky, even ignoring the social aspect of being taken out of assembly) and whether or not that's fair.

I'm not sure what schools you're talking about, or how many, when you say ""owned &amp; run by the CofE"". ~1/3 of state funded schools in England &amp; Wales are faith schools with the majority of those being CoE iirc. The fraction of non-funded faith schools is probably rather small, and I can't imagine that there are more than a handful, if any, privately funded CoE schools.

Unless you meant schools owned &amp; run by them back in the day? Must be a very long time ago. Given that ~25% of the population on the census said ""No religion"" and given that other surveys that don't have a leading question find ~50% non-religious, I think it might be time to retire laws that take a general approach and assume everyone is Christian by default.",0,1357174882,null,0,false,0,c7q0l9h,t3_15sxuk,t1_c7q0l9h,t1_c7pojs7,null,1430838251,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Think 'Come Dine With Me' meets 'Get Your Own Back' meets 'My New Best Friend' meets 'Wife Swap'.

Dave Benson Phillips moves into a lucky University or Shared Flat with at least 4 occupants and gets up his 'Challenge Room' in a communal area. In it there are games, gunge and whatever tools DBP deems necessary to test which of the housemates is the **""Dave Benson's Buddy For Life""** (the shows working title).

He moves into the house and attempts to put housemates against eachother, on the first day there he might want lunch made, then a bed to sleep in, then a pack of Airwaves from the shop, then his feet massaged... 

Housemates can refuse, but that surely would not go down well with DBP. At the end of each day Dave plays a popular game with the housemates, such as spin the bottle. This is essentially an excuse to the the attractive people naked and covered in gunge. It is not essential to the format, but gunge and nudity are. 

At the end of the week DBP has to choose his new Buddy For Life, who wins some shitty prize and the love of DBP for life.

Apart from being an amazing concept, it has other benefits for DBP. If he was to go bankrupt and lose his house (not saying it will happen, but these are tough economic times) he would always have a house to sleep in, we just film 52 per year and he will always have a place to stay...

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"I remember reading an argument that the difference between the UK legal system and the legal system in, say, Mao's China is that the UK legal system does not expect criminals to apologise or even admit their guilt. 

This seems to be hinting at the same sort of distinction. In the UK if you kill someone you will be punished and let out. You're free to dispute your guilt. 

Of course it's not quite true because denying your guilt may stop you being paroled. Still a cynical Tory view of this is that you only have to say you admit guilt. The legal system does not care about your subjective views on the matter. 

I've got a friend who's a JP and he objected to the quintessentially Swedish view that there are 'no bad people only sick people' on much the same grounds. It implies that people who don't conform need to be treated until they truly believe or a cured. It is a simultaneously too liberal and creepily totalitarian view.

Conservative legal systems punish people from the crimes they are convicted of. They do not seek to redeem them or change what they subjectively believe, merely deter them or others from doing the same thing again. Subjective beliefs are regarded as being irrelevant.

Incidentally I'd love to know why someone downvoted this comment.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"best performances: Suarez, Reina, Gerrard

below-par: Sterling, Lucas, Skrtel, Hendo

Reina for stopping 2 goals, we could have easily went into half time at 2-2 and the game would have been different. We didn't defend well from 25-40'

Skrtel for being dragged into the middle so often and leaving Wisdom isolated so often, his needless fouls and being out of position so often. There were numerous set pieces were the right-hand third was completely open with 2-4 sunderland forward moves and only Wisdom left to defend. the best chance Sunderland had came with Lucas being turned, Agger being drawn in and Skrtel being turned and drawn in for the ball to be popped out wide behind Wisdom. Happen 3-4 times in the game

Sterling didn't make a single complete forward pass or get passed his man in the first half, and he was against Rose, and anticipated challenge. Did well to finish the goal, but the rest of his match was a story of missed chances and a nervousness to receive the ball, lift his head up and then use his body and pace to make space.  He seems to always want to just either move or get it away from him

Lucas still doesn't look himself, turning sideways and being out of position on fast counters leaves him lost. Tracked him during the second half and thought he would come off because of his dawdling and getting tangled between the lines, improved greatly in 70-90' but Sunderland were not pressing his space at that point and he had room to move. HE was very often cut out of passing lanes, other teams would have noticed that tonight. Our back 4 with Gerrard and Lucas infront of them is ver vulnerable to high, flat pressing across the line in the first few seconds of a change of posession. Gerrard and Lucas are both usually tangled out of position. Saw that against Stoke, saw it again tonight

Hendo disposessed and turned over the ball more than anybody else. too critical a role to be that sloppy. doesn't have the attacking edge and vision yet and also seems eager to move the ball anywhere. worst performer on a stats basis, terrible pass completion rate for somebody in his role (75%). we need a #10 for the second half of the season, Hendo isn't it.",0,1357176934,null,0,1357177487,0,c7q16f0,t3_15ujoa,t1_c7q16f0,t3_15ujoa,null,1430838503,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If you get convicted of some crime you should be punished but it is neither possible nor desirable to re-educate you that the crime was wrong. The most we can/should do is to say ""if you do it again, we'll punish you again"".

A concrete example would be Tony Martin

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Martin_(farmer)#Parole_applications_and_release

&gt; Martin was imprisoned in Highpoint Prison, Suffolk. When he became eligible for parole and early release in January 2003, the Parole Board rejected his application without stating a reason.[17] The chairman of the parole board, Sir David Hatch, in an interview with The Times described Martin as ""a very dangerous man"" who may still believe his action had been right

This is wrong - Tony Martin was denied parole because of his subjective mental state. Or, even worse, because he had the integrity to state it. If I were in his position, I'd talk to my lawyers and they would say ""Admit your guilt and say you won't do it again"" and they'll let you out and I'd do it. Or course, and even worse, the scum who persecuted him were not held to the same standard.

But it's like innocent until proven guilty. The law controls objective actions not subjective beliefs. So saying someone who has not been proven guilty is guilty is problematic. Saying you're innocent if you've been convicted is too if you're up for parole. Your beliefs are not regulated, only what you say. It seems like a subtle distinction but it is important. Only totalitarian regimes try to control people's subjective thought. And only ochlocracies allow people to say ""He's a pedo! Kill him"".",0,1357177189,null,0,1357179073,0,c7q1922,t3_15uczt,t1_c7q1922,t1_c7q16wg,null,1430838546,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,jonnyjm,eng-merseyside,Merseyside,"I find most of my unhappiness as a young person stems from education, and more specifically the educational choices we are forced to make a relatively young age. 

16 year old me and what he wanted, is vastly different to 21 year old me and what I want now. How many people truly know what they want from their life at the age of 16? I know all I wanted to do at the time was play the drums and as I was forced (by both college and myself) to compromise on my education I found myself in a degree I didn't particularly like, in a town I didn't particularly like (Stafford is no place for a student!) with no true idea what I wanted post graduation.

As it happens I did decide on a specific career in my final year of university, and I dove straight in at the deep end and based my entire dissertation on it. 

Now a graduate, I'm making up for the 3 or 4 years of time I essentially wasted not having any true direction or overall aim in my life. Now here I am on JSA for the last 5 months, struggling to find work as the Job Centre slowly try to convince me to drop the only ambition I've had since I was 16

This turned into more of a ramble than a post with a point, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think too much pressure is put on adolescents to decide what job they want, what course they want to study and what university they want to move away to in the formative years of their life.",0,1357178684,null,0,false,0,c7q1p05,t3_15tmg3,t1_c7q1p05,t3_15tmg3,null,1430838833,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

As for the divorce I have to disagree. Alot of marriage ends in divorce so having that happen makes it more real in my eyes. The doctor just see's what the problem is and gets them to communicate, so he helps solve the problem, but it is up to them to fix things. He could never do it for them. Relationships don't work that way.

Given what the problem was I have a hard time believing they would have staid apart. It's possible sure, but i can't help but feel even if the doctor hadn't shown up, they would have ended up getting back together after being separated for some time.

Daniel Levy will not go into talks and base his value of Bale as so much above the going rate. He will extract as much as possible out of Madrid.

We should be looking to get maximum return on the money we have. I am not convinced that Sturridge will give us this. Who else would buy him? Honestly? In the prem not many top half teams, so why is he 12million? Is he gonna go abroad? Who wanted him there?

true,Conot,cnty-wales,Swansea,"The entire idea of a court of public opinion is idiotic.

The public has no idea what they're talking about half of the time, they lack most of the information, and half of the information they do have is based off of word-of-mouth, ""Old so-and-so down at the pub said"" and rumor mongering by the newspapers.

Personally, I think that its disgusting how utterly easy it is to sway the justice system via public opinion, see for example, the case of the young man who made a off-colour joke about a kidnapped child on his Facebook wall, and got done for ""sending a message or other matter that is grossly offensive by means of a public electronic communications network."" which carries a jail sentence and permanent criminal record.

He made this joke on his facebook wall, which is only visible to those who specifically look at his page or who are his friends on Facebook. His stuff got cross-posted to April Jones groups on Facebook and he effectively got ""court of public opinion""'d into being arrested for his own safety.^[1](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-teenager-jailed-facebook)

That young man, who made a off-colour joke in what most would consider a private forum, now carries a criminal record for life for the crime of making poorly thought out jokes, all because members of the public took offense to that.

To me, this is utterly disgusting, that a person could be in effect lynch mobbed in such a way, and that the court systems would just bend to public opinion like that.

So when you ask me ""should it really hold in the court of public opinion"", I say that the court of public opinion should be taken out behind a shed and shot, but lacking that, they should not go off on a bloody wild tangent based off of a preliminary arrest during which no charge has been made.",0,1357181040,null,0,false,0,c7q2e22,t3_15uczt,t1_c7q2e22,t1_c7pzcmc,null,1430839159,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

A few quick thoughts:  

* Your Yorkshires actually look pretty good to me. I've never had them with butter, but in the absence of gravy I imagine that's better than having nothing to moisten them...  
* ...however, I would seriously consider making some gravy next time. It doesn't have to be fatty: you can pour away any fat from the tray that the meat has roasted in, and cook the bits that are stuck to the bottom of the tray with some flour, seasoning, and an appropriate stock, and that's it. Nothing terribly unhealthy about that.  
* I personally prefer roast potatoes to mash, for the variation in texture if nothing else.
* Good roast parsnips are easy to do and go well with beef, pork, or poultry.  
* Something green would make the whole thing look a lot fresher and more appetising. It doesn't have to be anything madly exciting: steamed Savoy cabbage is cheap and easy, and you can toss it with butter and nutmeg if it seems a little dull. But really, any green vegetable would make your meal look less like an incursion from the 1970s.  
* An additional sauce for the meat wouldn't go amiss. With beef, either mustard or horseradish is traditional and gives it a bit of a kick.

It is true to say that it would have been much safer to play Mata and Hazard, proven playmakers, but it's not asking too much of Marin, Oscar, and Moses to go out and score a few goals at home to put away team with only **1** win in the EPL this season.

To understand the divorce you really have to take Amy's perspective (I know some of you are cringing at this idea). 

Her life has revolved around the Doctor since she was 7 years old. She's been traveling the universe seeing and doing amazing things with the Doctor since she was 19 years old. They've been going on adventures for two seasons at this point (for some perspective think about where Rose was at the end of her second season) and in that time she's fallen in love with Rory, gotten married, found out she was pregnant, had a child, had the child stolen, met the grown up version of her child (missing her child's whole life), and has now been in essence abandoned by the most important person in her life (the Doctor) so she can settle down and live a normal life with her husband. 

That being said I ask you how is Amy supposed to settle into a normal life with just Rory and be happy? What is she living for? What is she looking forward to?

Rory loves Amy and she's all he needs in his life, whereas Amy loves Rory, the Doctor, and adventure. Amy isn't satisfied or happy just living a normal life with Rory, but taking into account her life thus far I can't really blame her.

When it comes to work, you need to find an occupation that you can live with to pay your bills. If you pick a job that is based around a subject you enjoy then it will destroy your enjoyment, when essentially doing that task constantly day in day out under the threat of failing to pay your bills and mortgage, loosing your home, loss of relationships etc it drains the enjoyment from it, it becomes the thing that you have to do even when you dont feel 100%, its the thing that forces you to get up in the morning when all you want to do is get another hours sleep, it will become the endless treadmill that you just loathe

So unless you find a job that wont eventually make you hate existence like being in charge of looking after newborn puppies then dont feel its essential that you have to like the job, imo the best jobs would be the ones that require the least thought, are the least taxing on you, so you can go there and switch off and then get home and still have the energy to do things you enjoy, one example for me was working in a sorting office for the post office over xmas, posting letters into the various different holes for different postcodes. It sounds dull but in reality the time flew by because the work was repetative, menial and almost medatative. My current job is alot more challenging on a daily basis, there are fewer cookie cutter solutions as its different issues each time and its more taxing as a result, i am a lot more stressed because of it

Part of the benefit of being the first companion of the reboot is the show has a certain innocence and purity. Newcomers were getting used to this new show. And the first companion can be just as pure.

To continue, let me summarize the show:

A brilliant, eccentric madman has this fantastic magic carpet... and offers to take an ordinary, average person for the trip of a lifetime.

In any other story, that trip of a lifetime might be traveling the world in cars, boats, and planes. Or riding off on a horse into the sunset. Or riding a more H. G. Wells time machine that just travels time in that one spot and there are no weird aliens wherever they go. And it might be some short-lived flight of fancy.

The favorite question the show poses--just by being there--is this: if The Doctor showed up right where you were and just said, ""Hey, wanna travel with me, see some stuff?"", what would you do?

You know damn well you'd do what Rose did. And you'd be just as enamored and careless.

Short term or long term savings? Last I read obese people cost the health service less over their lifetime than ""healthy"" people but cost more when measured year upon year.

So ironically by extending life they will wind up costing the NHS money (and pension pot, and benefits pot) rather than saving any. But it will save money in the short term.

Compensation which then *doesn't* go into improving the infrastructure.

For example if someone is hugely fit does that mean their earnings increase?     ",0,1357211745,null,0,false,0,c7q91rt,t3_15vse3,t1_c7q91rt,t1_c7q8rtz,null,1430842361,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Careful, dear, you'll put someone's eye out. I'm scanning you. You're on another of the escape pods from the Alaska, right? Same ship I was on.

*OSWIN*:
**Hello, the Chin**! I have visual on you!

So much bigger on the inside? I'm... Oh, what is that word? It's so big, so complicated. It's so sad.

*IDRIS*:
But House just can't delete a TARDIS' consciousness, that would blow a hole in the universe. He pulls out the matrix, sticks it in a living receptacle and feeds off the remaining Artron energy. You were about to say all that. I don't suppose you have to now.

*IDRIS*:
Yes, of course I'm dying. (takes the sonic) I don't belong in a flesh body. I could blow the casing in no time. No, stop it, don't get emotional. That's what the orangey girl says. You're the Doctor. Focus. (holds the sonic out for him)

DOCTOR:
It's a TARDIS junkyard! (heads for exit) Come on. (stops) Ooh, sorry, do you have a name?

*IDRIS*:
700 years, finally he asks.

*IDRIS*:
I think you call me... Sexy.

*OSWIN*:
Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius that sounds modest and a tiny bit sexy?

DOCTOR: 
Doctor. You call me the Doctor.
...

DOCTOR:
(stops) You did! (whirls around, happy) Look at us. Talking. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could always talk? Even when you're inside the box?

*IDRIS*:
You know I'm not constructed that way. I exist across all space and time, and you talk and run around and bring home strays.

Alive. I'm alive!

DOCTOR:
Alive isn't sad.

AMY and RORY watch, RORY holding her close.

*IDRIS*:
It's sad when it's over. I'll always be here. But this is when we talked and now even that has come to an end. There's something I didn't get to say to you.

DOCTOR:
Goodbye?

*IDRIS*:
No, I just wanted to say... hello. Hello, Doctor. It's so very, very nice to meet you.

Hello?

Of course I was. **I wanted to see the universe, so I stole a Time Lord and I ran away**. And you were the only one mad enough.

No, we don't! Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see the universe, ended up stuck in a shipwreck, first time out. (runs over and leans on the back of her chair) **Rescue me, chin boy, and show me the stars**.

Be able to discuss the issues of the day? Absolutely, I would never have it any other way, but what the public does at the moment is not discuss, it is to rally together around one issue until someone who wants the favour of the public bends or until the government makes a minor concession to appease them.

The fact is is that a arrest can be done for literally any reason, and while yes, there is a relatively high probability that this is because they suspect him of sexual offences, the fact is it might not be. It might be because they want him to bear witness, or give information on somebody else, or maybe they have some evidence and want to keep him under scrutiny for 72 hours while they consider the evidence.

It could be any of the above, but IMO, the public opinion always sways to the worst possibility. Look at Michael Jackson, he was found not guilty on all counts, yet the public (and by association the popular media such as cartoons, comics, comedians) thought of him as a pedophile till the day he died.

My point, in short, is not that the public should not be able to discuss the issues of the day, it is more a irritation that the public rarely does ""discuss"" and more frequently jumps to conclusions and then rallies behind those conclusions, regardless of what the legal system or any other official system finds to the contrary.",0,1357212026,null,0,false,0,c7q92xq,t3_15uczt,t1_c7q92xq,t1_c7q8ufl,null,1430842376,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,KarmaAndLies,null,null,"You're absolutely right, however there are a large number of ""professionals"" who continue to parrot the exercise for weight loss narrative, or just parrot it because they know that exercise is good for you (outside of weight loss).    

The problem is that the stereotypical: ""eat less, exercise more"" line that you so often hear repeated is primarily aimed at the mildly overweight. Which is to say thin people who put on an extra ten pounds.     

These people need to lose the ten pounds (i.e. eat less) but also could do with being more fit (i.e. exercise more) so the message works. The problem is that when obese people read the same exact message, they put too much emphasis on the ""exercise bit"" and not enough on the eating bit.    

Even using a calculator and some common figures (calories in a pound of weight, calories burnt with an hour of exercise) you can see that exercise is basically useless for weight loss. But conversely if you look at how many calories a human body burns even while unconscious it should be evident and obvious that you can literally eat your way thin (by having a calorie deficit).    

Now exercise is very good for people. No doubt about that. It improves your heart health, decreases your type 2 diabetes risk, and has even been linked with a happier mental attitude. So exercise is very good, just not very good for weight loss.    

PS - There is a lot of evidence that *what* you eat is as important as having a calorie deficit. See things like /r/keto/ for more information.  ",0,1357212699,null,0,1357212892,0,c7q95ok,t3_15vse3,t1_c7q95ok,t1_c7q8yim,null,1430842421,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He was fouled constantly last night but kept going until his 90th minute substitution.

Secondly, there was a revealing display of team spirit and professionalism from an unused substitute. Ali Faurlin warmed up almost constantly last night, and was the only player who did so without tracksuit bottoms on, ready to be called into action at any point. He never got the call, but at the final whistle ran onto the pitch and bowed down to Sean Derry, giving him the 'worshipping' gesture for his outstanding performance.

I agree with your original assessment that this is unlikely to just be those that were being pushed into courses as a box-ticking exercise, which is a shame. If this is putting off students because they fall into the awkward middle-ground of income (i.e. no government assistance, but also not rich enough that mummy and daddy can pay for it after they've sent them off on a gap yah) then ideally we should do away with that and re-invest the money into more appropriate paths for those who were being pushed onto them (apprenticeship schemes etc) and also in assisting those who are otherwise being put off (through some way, maybe a flat reduction in fees - maybe an increase in threshold for assistance)

Then there's the cost of a desk &amp; equipment, which for many of my clients is comparable to the salary costs of a graduate recruit.  Once you've sorted all that out there's often a need to consider which tasks can legally be assigned to them without breaking contracts, H&amp;S law and more.

As a result of the above, it simply would not be worth it, assuming that it's even possible, for many companies.  Once you get to A-level students the arrangements get much simpler, but there's still a great deal of cost.  If you can train up a full time graduate, that's likely to offer a much better payback than a part time student, simply due to being able to assign more continuous training and thus having a shorter time before they are able to do useful and profitable work.

It's easy to think of examples where little training is needed, but those jobs tend to be less interesting.

true,borez,cnty-england,Geordie in London,"In the town I grew up in ( Just outside of Durham in the 80's ) there were four main factories that had major apprenticeship schools in the area; Black and Decker, Electrolux, Rothmans and Smart and Browns. 

These apprenticeship schools all shut down within the space of a few years at exactly the same time as Thatcher decided to declare war on the living standards and rights of the working class and instead concentrate on the short term profits of the financial industries. You could say around the time of the birth of the yuppie.

Now I'm not sure how this was done, maybe she stripped away tax or other incentives that made these schemes possible, maybe it was done another way, but it happened and that's when they ended. 

Now many people ( in the area where I grew up ) believe Thatcher had a personal agenda she needed to satisfy, maybe because she too came from a similar background growing up above a grocers shop in Lincolnshire before she became one of the lucky ones who got out with a scholarship to Oxford after another candidate withdrew, who knows?  

That system of working class apprenticeship has never recovered though and it won't recover until a government takes a seriously hard look at why this happened in the first place.

Wisdom was left one v FIVE for their chance at 2-0. Everybody else was ball-watching or sprinting up the pitch while sunderland still had possession. Really odd one.

The passing move for Sterling's chance 2nd half was gorgeous. Raheem botched the finish but his movement was key. Lucas - Sterling (coming in off the right into the middle and passing round the corner to...)  - Suarez (moving left then cutting back to the right) - Gerrard - Wisdom - Gerrard - Suarez (flicked to...) - Sterling (who had circled around from the left into the right channel to receive the final pass).

That move and the goal that Sterling did score show exactly how Sturridge might prosper as a wide forward. It's not like playing wide when the centre forward is a traditional striker (Torres for example). In our system the wide forwards will often be making runs ahead of the centre forward, getting into the space created by Suarez's genius. Would be very surprised if Brendan changed our system by moving Suarez wide and Sturridge central.

The whole ""...but you don't have to start paying it back until you're earning X amount..."" line is a smokescreen.  Of course it's true, strictly speaking, but no more so than any kind of progressive taxation.  Those who go on to earn more money can afford to pay higher rates of taxes which, until recently, went towards supporting the costs of free education to all.

Upping the tuition fees is about allowing the Universities to become financially independent.  Put simply, it's the thin end of the wedge that leads to complete privatisation of higher education.  One no longer has the ""right"" to attend University (give the right academic qualifications), but instead is being offered the chance to borrow the money (admittedly with favourable terms) to pay for it yourself.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Disclaimer: I'm not HR - but a graduate who is 2 years ahead of you. 

Sounds like there are two issues here.

The first, is that after a year and a half - you've not had a pay rise. This is generally not that uncommon. Then again, for a graduate job, you would expect a  pay rise once a year, at least for the first couple of years. My guess is you are on somewhere around 18-19k a year. 

First thing you need to do is look in your contract for pay stipulations. Mine says for example. I'm entitled to a review every year in March. There I put forward my achievements for the year, what the industry average is - and how much I think I deserve. My boss will then say XYZ yes or no, essentially.

This is pretty common and learning about pay rises is very important. How to negotiate them, and making sure you don't sell yourself short. You need to do some serious research on this by googling. I literally shot myself In the foot in my first job doing this -I left after a year because 18k just isn't enough in London. I was offered 25 and couldn't say no. I probably should have stayed with my first employer for a little longer. 

If you work with a household name, (i.e. a large company) then there will be procedures in place for you to open up discussions about pay rises. (Pay review?) this isn't 'causing trouble'. So don't feel bad about informally asking your boss to meet and discuss it at a convenient time. 

Secondly, your new position as a manager.

This again, is very common. After a while in a job, you will take on more responsibility - and you should be rewarded in kind.

If I were in your boots?


I would:


Schedule an appointment with my manager. Armed with all the facts (including a list of all my achievements over the past year and a half) - how I've grown into the role, couldn't imagine working anywhere else, blablabla. Now, with the new responsibilities XYZ - managing two people -  I feel a payrise in line with my role expectations is in line.  

You could take it further and ask for a new contract and a significant pay rise to take into account your 'new' role.


Your alternatives?

Start looking for a new job. Don't feel bad about this. I update my CV monthly *just in case*.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt;  Short term or long term savings? Last I read obese people cost the health service less over their lifetime than ""healthy"" people but cost more when measured year upon year. This is exclusively due to earlier mortality (obese people die younger, so get treated for less years, thus saving money). 

This is.... really, really bad logic.  A healthy person is likely to work until they're 65 and have relatively low health costs until they reach that age.  Due to living longer they'll pay much more tax, and due to being healthier they won't be using as much sick leave on average.

The obese person will have a lower total cost to the NHS over their lifetime, but the cost per year is much higher - meaning that their ratio of tax paid to cost of service used will be much worse (this is what we mean if we say somebody is a drain on the NSH).  They will also likely be quite sickly for the final year(s) of their working life, since obesity is a gradual killer, so will probably be contributing less even within that time period.

1) Chop potatoes into quarters and boil for in water that just about covers them.  Boil for 10 minutes. Take off heat drain out water, and (optional) sprinkle a teaspoon of Tumeric over them.  It brings out the earthy flavour and gives a lovely golden colour to them.  Put the lid back on the pan, and shake them well so they crumble slightly. Put on a tray with oil then in hot oven (about 200) for 40 minutes. Turn the tray around, and shake, after 20 mins.

2) Leave Yorkshire pudding mix for at least 15 minutes once you've mixed it.  This means they rise evenly when cooked. (A note, you probably know already - put oiled tray in oven for 5 minutes to get piping hot, and *then* put the batter in.)

3) Boil carrots for 6 minutes, then on a tray and drizzle with a little Orange juice. Sounds weird, I know - but it really brings out the flavour. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Oven for 15 mins.

4) Try green beans on there, too. Chop the ends off, and cut in half.  Put them in a steamer pot and cook for 20 mins.  Covering them in water before hand gives them a nice shine when they come out.

5) Gravy makes it infinitely better. It moistens the Yorkies and softens the crunchy potatoes.  Use juices from the meat to make it even better, and less wasteful!

I see the Falklands as an interesting topic to get people interested in historical research and how governments will ignore it if it doesn't suit their ends, because there's so much juicy info out there to be found about the whole saga, and the only possible conclusion that one can come to after doing it is that Argentina has a shakier claim than any of the other powers involved. However, Argentina choose to ignore almost all of that, instead citing tiny, conveniently worded parts of the Nootka Sound treaty (which doesn't actually apply to the Falklands anyway) and bleating on about colonialism. 

To begin with, the ludicrousness of Argentina's position is a spur to the student of the Falklands' history -- more evidence needs to be trotted out to dispute their bullshit! ...but after awhile you realise that it's pointless because their claims have never been about anything other than a minor desire to possess the islands because they're relatively close to them (not very close, but relative to anywhere else on Earth, yeah), and much more pertinently, a major desire to gain political capital with a sadly miseducated population. We could probably find that Ancient Britons rowed a log-raft and settled there twenty thousand years ago and it wouldn't make any difference, president after president will carry on rolling out the corpse of Las Malvinas every time things look bleak in Argentina, and as long as the public remains ignorant enough, it will always be a cause celebre, and therefore worthwhile for them to do so.",0,1357218742,null,0,false,0,c7q9wvm,t3_15voh5,t1_c7q9wvm,t1_c7q8oxx,null,1430842772,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

You kind of jumped to that. I've read that obesity can shorten a person's life by twelve years (all other things being equal). In the UK the life expectancy of a man is 78.1 and a women 82.1 years.

&gt; That means that for obese individuals they will die at 66.1 and 70.1 for men and women respectively. Right at retirement age. 

These are average ages.  If the average person of normal weight dies at 80 (ignoring sexes), then a certain percentage - let's say 20% - will die before they're 70.  Another percentage - let's say 5% - will die before they're 60.  Saying that the mean individual dies after retirement isn't particularly relevant - what matters is what proportion of people die before that.

Additionally, pensions aren't necessarily *bad* spending, in the sense that pensioners tend to spend almost all their money, which is beneficial to the economy.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"No European power established a settlement until 1764, when the French built a garrison at Port Louis on East Falkland, disregarding Spanish claims under the papal Treaty of Tordesillas that divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. Unbeknownst to either France or Spain, Britain set up a West Falkland outpost at Port Egmont, on Saunders Island, in 1765. Spain, meanwhile, discovered and then supplanted the French colony after an amicable settlement. Spanish forces next detected and expelled the British in 1767. Under threat of war, Spain restored Port Egmont to the British, who only a few years later abandoned the area – without, however, renouncing their territorial claims.

So while the Brits saw it first, they never claimed the islands nor tried to settle until after the French. The French gave it to Spain, Argentina did sort of inherit it (or rather the Spanish inherited Argentina if I read correctly). It wasn't until 1833 the British came back and said ""Oh remember when we saw this first but never really did anything with it, now you're here, we want it again!

Britain let land ownership go out of control, absentee landlords caring only about the bottom line kept poorly paid labourers working on the 35 farms. New islanders couldn't obtain any land of their own as it had all been parcelled out by the British government. And it was only in the late 70's when the population was steadily declining The British decided to do anything worth while with it. (see dantheman999's graph in this thread)

So who really owns the islands?

The British claim is ""We saw it first!""

Plenty of larger countries are near smaller islands that share the same continental shelf.

Should Cuba be part of the United States?  Cuba was formerly a Spanish colony.  The southeast part of the USA, e.g. Florida and so on was also a former Spanish colony.  Should Cuban land become American?

Regardless of all of this....  We have to deal with the status quo.

Should Argentinians give up their land to the remnants of the native inhabitants - who were their first?  E.g. the Tierra del fuegan indians?  Argentina is a very young country; should the wrongs of the 19th century be made right by their evacuation to Spain, or maybe have the majority of the current inhabitants lose their rights as citizens and have the native inhabitants become the rulers?

Should Australians go home to the UK, Ireland, Italy, Greece and return the land to the Aborigines?

The United States used to be a British colony.  So did Bermuda.  Given Bermuda's proximity to the USA; should the Bermudans lose their land and have it taken over by the USA?

The Argentine position selectively ignores parts of history. Either way I think both sides should bore to what the local population wants.

As I've been telling you over and over again - perceived British genes do not make one British. If somebody is telling you they're British, they're either from Britain or lying. Britishness is a way of life, not a genetic makeup - we see anybody who has grown up or immersed themselves in British culture as British. We don't see anybody as having British ancestry because there are no traits of a British born person. Now, if you're specific you may see yourself as English, Scottish, Irish or Welsh descended. That would make a lot more sense because all of those countries have a specific genetic makeup. Britishness is a coverall for a bunch of different people from different countries. It is not a race, or an ethnicity.

&gt;In a lot of ways, we're superior to you.

Lovely. How many times have you been here? I've been to Florida, and I must say it is a very nice place. I wouldn't like to live there though, I prefer my tap water drinkable and my healthcare accessible.

&gt;There are British people in America!

Ex-pats, sure. Genetically British? No. I am Genetically Irish. Am I Irish? No. Would I consider myself Irish? Would the Irish consider me Irish? Absolutely not, on both counts. Bear in mind that Ireland is part of Great Britain, and you may come to the conclusion that I am genetically British. Except the English and the Irish share very little in common, genetically speaking. Why is that? Could it be that there is no glorious British race? Is the BNP wrong?

&gt;long history of being invaded and oppressed

The last time Britain was invaded was in 1066. Before that, we were invaded twice. We have a long history, but invasion is unusual. We have a sense of National Self, we don't see a Britain as a non-existent anomaly. We just feel no need to pretend our country is any better than any other country. Most of us, at least. There is the BNP and the EDL, but they are the minority. Some people here are internationalist, and some people are isolationist and some people are nationalist. It is a diverse country, but overt displays of nationalism are frowned upon.

&gt;Our ancestors did when they fought back against the many invading forces. It would be pretty insulting to them (and many oppressed peoples around the world) to call them xenophobic, prejudiced, and having delusions of superiority. 

Nationalism to further a cause is different to peace-time nationalism. The USSR in 1941 declared a 'great patriotic war'. This is fairly odd coming from a Socialist country 

&gt;The fact is, Europe has a very skewed, radical view of nationalism due to your fascist history. It's not like that in other places. And we're not wrong.

Look at the EU. We prefer internationalism, on the whole. Join, or die, as Benjamin Franklin said. Only time will tell if internationalism trumps nationalism.

true,JayCartwright,lfcflame,,"In 08/09 Stevie had 24 goals in 44 appearances, his best ""goals to games"" ratio of his career. 16 of those goals were league goals. While I don't think we are ever going to see those numbers again, I think we are seeing a sort of Renaissance of him into a different and more complete midfielder overall. I don't like to use this analogy, but it looks like he is doing a similar thing to what Pirlo did when he moved to Juventus.

Over the past few weeks I think we have seen a marked improvement in our captain. It seems like he is really coming to grips with his role in Brendan's philosophy as of late and is starting to realize again that he is still ""the guy"" for Liverpool, albeit in a different version than he once was. Brendan has asked him to drop a bit deeper and to me, act as almost a safety net for all of the young talent we have in the starting 11. As the team is maturing (and the return of Lucas), he is recognizing it and trusting them more and you have seen him get a bit more further to impose his attacking side a bit more because he can rely on the others around him.

His fitness has really impressed me too over this campaign. I think he has played every minute of every league match and that is really helping his confidence after a couple years of in and out of the team struggling with the groin, infection and knee. 

Here is to hoping that Captain Fantastic keeps up this nice run of form and has a healthy and incredible 2013 and the rest of team continue in our recent upward trend.

This is why the news about Cole possibly moving on was never going to be good news - you can't undo a mistake that big. The money saved doesn't even buy a young first team squad member.

There are a few more poison pills to swallow. IMO it is also going to be impossibly to move on Carroll - there is no way his wages are going to be matched by anybody. The transfer fee will almost certainly be a writeoff, and he will have 3 years left at the end of this season which is about another £17-20M in obligations. 

On a total £65-68M obligation for Carroll we are going to be lucky to get back £15M. I don't even want to think about what that works out to cost on a per minute or per goal basis that he played for the club, probably the most expensive player in the history of football. 

edit: just had a thought that I should do a post with a comparison of our wage table from 18 months ago and what it would look like today post-Cole. light and day. the only bigger stink deals in the current cap are Henderson and Downing.

There's a key difference though, a homosexual relationship is consensual and does not cause any harm. A peadophilic relationship is not consensual and does cause harm.

true,imbeingsirius,null,null,"Barely - Of course she took his departure hard: It was unexpected and seemingly forever. It wasn't romantic love that causes her to cry (Mickey doesn't think so anyway). Leading up to that, she had basically broken it off in the first episode, Rose (End dialogue: R-""Thanks"" M-""For what?""R-""Exactly."") when she leaves him for the Doctor. Then, we see how casual their relationship is in the episode where Rose gets jealous because Mickey is seeing someone else. She doesn't want him back per se, but there is lingering jealousy - he, meanwhile, has moved on to a new girlfriend. Then, in the Empty Child, Captain Jack reveals that Rose considers herself unattached. This leads up to the finally, where we essentially learn she loves the Doctor (or is at least willing to undergo staring into the Tardis). 

This leaves us at the beginning of Season 2, where she feels somewhat abandoned by the Doctor (as he's morphed into Tennant), comforted by Mickey's presence (but still not romantically comforted), but then resentful when he  tags along (and who wouldn't be?). Ultimately, she gets over it and stands up for Mickey to the Doctor (who alternately teases and ignores him) and cries when Mickey leaves.

I love Rose for how human she is! That's why I think she was best with Eccleston - He was a more human, realistic Doctor, more of a genius mechanic compared to Tennant's puckish/trickster, larger-than-life personality. Once paired with Tennant the relationship got a little too let's-giggle-and-hug-all-the-time.

I used to vote labour, switched to UKip though. To be honest mate, while the government has been in power they seem to be doing a hell of a lot more than labour ever did. They used the veto on the EU for the financial tax, which in London makes up 40% of worldwide transactions. New York processes 20%. For the EU to go after this just damages our economy further than the already broken immigration laws are. Over 1million East Europeans came here last year, due to us opening our borders to them at the EUs demands. Thats over 1% of our current population. We do not need more unskilled people here, we have enough out of work already.

UKip will address these points, and if you watch some videos online by typing UKip into youtube, you'll see they're extremely pro commonwealth.

Wouldnt you rather have the option to move to Canada, an English speaking more similar culturally and economically country? Or Australia? 

Putting all our eggs into the mainland Europe basket just seems daft. We're a highly reguarded international nation, yet people succumb to scaremongering such as 'WE'LL BE LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD' or 'WITHOUT EUROPE WE'LL BE A THIRD WORLD', I shit you not people have said that to me here lol.

Not to mention we spend 53million a day in the EU, as well as the overwhelming numbers of unskilled English with poor communication abilities (English not being their first language). I believe passive governments of labour dont really get anything done at all, except from let foreign nations pull us into wars that arent ours, or play too passive a role in the EU and UN.

We need a party like UKip in power to help sway our international influence away from just a European one... As well as to address the issues labour ignores and the tories only talk about.

People keep reading these stories about excess tuition fees and how there are no jobs to go into after graduation and therefore naturally think it is a *bad* idea to attend University. Now none of that stuff is untrue. Tuition fees are high and jobs are rare.     

However we still have a great student finance system in this country. You can get an entire degree without having to pay £1 of your own money up-front. After you graduate, if you struggle to find a vocation then the state won't harass you with debt repayment notices or late fees.    

In fact you won't have to even start paying it off until you're making over £22,000 a year, and even then the repayment schedule is progressive (i.e. the more you earn the faster you repay). At 22K you literally only pay £90/year (£7.50/month). If the University experience or a degree isn't worth less than you pay for a landline telephone then I don't know what is.    

As far as the ""joblessness"" issue goes: What is the alternative? It isn't like you can any more easily go out and get a job today than you would be after you graduate. In fact quite the opposite. So while there are no jobs assured for graduates, there are even less jobs available for those without higher education.   

Now people keep saying ""but I don't want loans of XYZ thousand pound hanging over me!"" Which while I can respect and understand, the way the repayment scheme is structured it is more similar to a tax than it is an actual loan. The reason loans suck is not the repayments, it is the stress related to what happens when you lose your job or cannot afford to pay it (neither of which are a threat with student loans).   

Just attend University, forget about the loans, and when your pay-cheque arrives just give the extra couple of hundred pound as a tax you are paying for something.   ",0,1357230299,null,0,1357230590,0,c7qcgae,t3_15vxh5,t1_c7qcgae,t3_15vxh5,null,1430843965,43,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,43

I can't explain why since it isn't quite as big an occasion as winning the UCL (not to downplay it though, it's still freaking massive) but Gerrard's incredible equalizer against West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup final was my favorite.  Maybe because Stevie is my footballing idol and the way he took that game over as if to say ""no, I've decided that Liverpool wins this and NOTHING will stop that"" just really sticks with me.  Even as the game was coming to an end I just knew Gerrard had one more bit of magic in him.  My mates (mostly United and Chelsea fans...) were all giving me shit for losing to West Ham and when he hit that volley they all shut up as I went ape shit and made them eat their words.  I'm a very quiet and reserved person normally so when I erupted into this jumping, yelling, and cheering crazy person I think it freaked him out.  

Mauling United 4-1 at Old Trafford and Real Madrid 4-0 at Andfield were also incredible moments in our more recent history.",0,1357234081,null,0,1357234323,0,c7qdmh7,t3_15w2fj,t1_c7qdmh7,t3_15w2fj,null,1430844542,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

I believe in fundamental human decency, and, as Bill and Ted put it, being excellent to each other. Ultimately I want it to be possible for everyone to have anything they want, but that's not possible while we are not post-scarcity. I therefore support transhumanism and space exploration, as well as cheap/free/renewable energy as very important (perhaps the most important) goals. 

So long as we must have a state, however, the state I want to see is fundamentally socialist and protective of human rights. Experience tells me that the EU does a better job of human rights protection better than the British government, thus leaving the EU is not something I would endorse (until such time as we need no states at all of course - but I am a realist *sometimes*...). 

I do not believe immigration is a significant issue, but that isn't really based on anything because the figures are constantly massaged by all sides and I just don't care enough to go digging and find out for myself. And if people are coming here for an improvement in living conditions that is a *compliment!*

Clinging on to the last remnants of empire is no better than clinging on to Europe, but the EU exists *now* and is doing a reasonable job, or at least no worse than trying to reignite the commonwealth would do. Most of our import and exports come from the EU simply because that is the closest place to ship things from and to! Making that more difficult would likely do more harm than good to the economy. 

Something needs to be done about the banking sector, but I'm not sure what - I like the idea of a very very small stamp duty (say 0.005%) on all international transactions in sterling, but I don't really know the implications of that any better than anyone else. 

As I said, I did get involved in politics - I've campaigned for No2ID, and a couple of other similar groups, I even once stood in the primaries for a minor party but wasn't selected, and made serious enquiries about standing for council election in the past. 

I've become disillusioned by the entire process and become an anarchist in response to my experiences - I think the system is fundamentally flawed as it currently stands, and I don't think any of the current options offer viable answers to the fundamental underlying problems with capitalism and democracy in it's current party-and-media driven form! However a revolution would end up with too many people getting hurt along the way. 

I don't know what the answers are other than to complain loudly and and make sarcastic jokes about politicians and the political classes. 

Which is coincidentally where we started.

It needs to be taken into consideration that the entire English school system for 13 years was set up with the aim to send 50% of leavers to University. I'm not wanting to be dragged into a debate on wisdom of this policy itself (you can argue with G_Morgan on that), however it cannot be denied that a very large percentage of those finishing school now have been prepared for going on to University. The massive hike in tuition fees is an unfair punishment on that age group and the 13 year focus on universities has reduced the number of other options for school leavers. Regardless of whether you believe that reducing the number of graduates is a good thing, this was still introduced in a very cruel way.

true,thatbloke83,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Yea that loan still gains interest though.

I have a 13k student loan from my University days, and it was only after a very significant payrise 2 and a half years ago that I started paying off more each month than the monthly interest that was being added to my loan (about £35/month interest was being added, I was paying about that per month, give or take).

Let's do some (very approximate) maths.

Let's assume that based on the above, a 27k loan will be adding about £70/month in interest.

Assuming you're paying 9% of everything you earn over 22k (I pay 9% of everything over 15k currently) then you need to be earning enough to mean that 9% of everything over £1833 is £70.

22k a year means you earn £1833/month. £70 is about 9% of £777.
£1833+£777 = £2610/month, or **£31320 per year**.

i.e. you need to be earning more than 31k/year *just to be paying off more than the interest every month.*

I finished University in 2006 with a computer science degree and it wasn't until about 6 months ago that I was earning more than 31k. I'm going to be 30 years old this year.

How many people with that level of debt are seriously going to be making a decent dent in that loan within the first 10 years of their working life?

I've worked out that if I continiue on my current salary then what's left of my own student loan will be paid off in 8 years - when that happens I'll consider it a payrise. If I had a loan twice that size, I would expect that to be closer to 28 years.

To be quite honest I do not believe that we have a ""great"" student finance system in this country anymore I would rather pay higher taxes and ensure that we could keep tuition fees low/eradicate them than be walking out of University with a 27k loan that's not going to be paid off for 30 years.",0,1357239944,null,0,false,0,c7qfj4o,t3_15vxh5,t1_c7qfj4o,t1_c7qcgae,null,1430845512,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,[deleted],null,null,"Don't really agree with ChainsawEpidemic. Leaving the EU is a risk that we do not need to take. The EU will become more politically responsible as integration deepens and is at its core a democratic institution. There are calls for it to have a single president and the parliament to hold all control in the near future as integration deepens, meaning it would be directly democratically responsible.

If we leave the EU we have to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU. Norway has a free trade deal with the EU (It's outside the EU) and basically it has to implement all EU laws without getting a say in what happens. Edit: forgot to add that norway pays a significant amount into the EU budget as part of its free trade agreement. In fact because we have a rebate now it might even be the case that we are paying a similar amount of money into the EU budget if we left. On top of that Switzerland also has a free trade agreement with a clause saying that should switzerland ever decided to deny an agreement or treaty with the EU all relations can be cut.

50% of our trade is with the EU (some will argue its lower but its still at least 40%), so its a pretty hefty sum to be throwing around. Eurosceptics argument is that we are having our sovereignty taken, the EU is unaccountable, etc. The fact is its unaccountable because of the refusal by some governments (mainly the UK) to have a more accountable EU government. The parliament has the final say on legislation but since we are not a 'federation', countries in the EU are the ones that write the legislation. Effectively the legislation is written by people nominated by elected EU country governments, and then it is decided upon in parliament. This is democratic, even if not directly so.

The EU provides us with so many benefits and the main right wing reason for leaving the EU is largely fueled by things like the working time directive (giving workers a maximum work time), which probably a lot of right wing politicians would like to remove. The whole sovereignty thing is nonsense, its just scaremongering piled on by newspapers. Fact is, being in the euro or whatever after the banking and further regulations are put in place will probably be beneficial to the UK in the long run. 

I assume in the coming years we will see movement towards a single EU government, and by leaving now we are isolating ourselves greatly. Our influence in the world will be greatly decreased and its likely many businesses will move to the EU rather than the UK (larger market, etc). The largest business lobby in the UK has already said it will fight to keep us in. People say that once we get rid of the EU we will be able to make all these free trade agreements and it's total bullshit. The EU has free trade agreements with the biggest economies in the world, the EU does not hold us back in this respect. 

The EU works to preserve culture, and if anything the EU is the main driving force behind spread of anglo saxon culture across the continent. English is growing to become the main language of political discourse on an EU level, and all these people saying it will destroy our culture should note that not only does the EU strive to preserve culture but it is actually helping to spread our cultural values further afield.

Here are some fucking gems. Emphasis **always mine**:

18 up, 10 down.

&gt;Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds; and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions.


&gt;[The Qadiyaniyya or Ahamadiyya group *is perverse group that has nothing to do with Islam*. It was founded by a man named Mirza Ghulam Ahmad who is considered by Muslims as an apostate. **He was an agent of English colonialists, a traitor of his people**. He did all he could to turn Muslims away from the true Islam. **He aimed at making Muslims give up the obligation of Jihad.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/v6mu2/ahmadiyya/c51soba)


11 up, 6 down

&gt;[No one can just show up and claim to be a Muslim, holding any old beliefs. There are certain core principles that every Muslim must hold and bear witness to, to be considered within the fold of Islam. One of these principles is the authority of the Qur'an and the Life-Example of the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad (pbuh).
The Ahmadi/Qadiani movement contradicts the Qur'an, claiming there is another Prophet after Muhammad. They have changed many of the rituals of Islam, abhorrent to the teachings of Islam. And worst, the writings of their founder show many, many inappropriate statements concerning Allah. The core message of Islam is Tawheed, the absolute unity of God, and Qadianism violates our core in so many respects- how can it dare to call itself a reform movement?
The modern day followers are sincere, no doubt, but originally, **the founder was a British client, from one of the ""House Negro"" families that cooperated as traitors when the British were subduing India**. Islam has the potential to be a powerful force for unity and resistance to occupation- **so it was very convenient for the British, I'm sure, when one of their Uncle Tom Muslims declares himself a Prophet and outlaws jihad**, the very mechanism of defense and resistance that could've expelled the British.](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/136tou/what_is_rislams_opinion_on_the_ahmadiyya/c71c86b)


16 up, 6 down.

&gt;[**there's a huge difference between tolerating a religious or ethnic minority and tolerating the qadiani movement.**
the qadiani-movement is a movement against islam, mirza ghulam (their leader) was a fraudster, payed by the british empire, around the year 1900, **he thanked them by abolishing jihad against the british empire** and making claims of prophethood and publically stating that the fate of the ahmadiyya sect is bound to the british empire, at a time, when they were aggressors and invaders, if the empire rises they would rise, and if it falls, they would fall.
Allah  exposed him many times, mirza ghulam took an oath, together with a muhaddith (a scholar of hadith) of the time, that Allah should let the one who is a liar die first, mirza ghulam died in the same year, after some reports, while being on the toilet, while the muhaddith lived on for many years. in addition it was and is the ijma' (consensus) of the scholars of islam, that the qadiani are not muslims. **if I were the leader in an islamic country, let's say malaysia, I would give the christians and jews their rights, would allow sects of islam (like sufi, salafi and even twelver shi'a) to live in peace under one banner, but would ban the qadiani movement alltogether**, this group, counting about a million people, is still supported by the british government today, they give out flyers in the trainstations and airports, that say some true things (i.e. from islam) **but is then calling to their twisted group and false prophet, they are invited to speak in the british parliament, and why? because they are enemies of islam, they seek to split and ultimately destroy islam.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/t4ssd/some_questions_about_the_ahmadiyya/c4jlxzq)

It goes on an on. To be clear a lot of commenters aren't quite so insanely paranoid about the west.

It does to me make it very clear that even relatively moderate muslims in that subreddit will never, violent or not, de-attach the cultural and political antagonism they perceive as necessary in their faith against 'The West'. 

Except Ahadiyya Muslims, who seem to want a secular society and to practice their own faith in peace. Of course, they're not Muslims for thinking that. Leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

2.) Personal Statement. Basically, why you want to study the course, what differentiates you etc. Include things like books, sports, volunteering, work experience. 

3.) Teacher reference. Your form tutor will write how you're hard working, passionate etc. and say you're suitable for the uni choices made. This is where you can enter any extenuating circumstances.

No one has the emotional maturity or understanding of their actions to consent to sexual activity until they've already bred and raised a child to adulthood.  And even then they can't perceive or appreciate the consequences of their actions which stretch into the indefinite future.

Why not say that blacks and hispanics lack the emotional maturity and understanding of the consequences of their actions since they have so many out-of-wedlock births?

Almost five hundred years ago, in 1516, in a blatant exersise of sixteenth century colonialism, the area of South America now known as Argentina was forcibly stripped from the indiginous people by a Spanish government situated 10,000 kilometres away.

The indiginous people were executed and forcibly removed by the Spanish colonialist forces and Spain subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule.

Since then the country has been dominated by an ethnically Spanish ruling class who have systematically imposed their language and culture on the country, eradicating the existing civilisation and resisting all attempts to restore the country to it's native people. Such colonialism is abhorred by people the world over who reject the destruction of civilisations by foreign powers and the long-standing colonial occupation of land. 

In order to respect the 1960 UN Proclamation to' bring to an end colonialism in all its forms and manifestations', it is necessary for any Spanish-descended citizens to give up all land and power and seek immediate repatriation to Spain. The civil war and revolution which lead to independence from Spain, and the creation of Argentina as a nation, must be considered a strictly internal matter which had nothing to do with the actual natives of the area. It must therefore be seen as only one more component of the legacy of colonialism which continues to uphold the oppression of the native people and the withholding of their right to the land occupied by the nation known as 'Argentina'.

Surgical Treatments

The use of surgical techniques in the treatment of sex offenders has been reported over the years although such procedures are now very rare. A major problem with surgical techniques is the ethics of ablating healthy tissue and the resulting side effects such as nausea, thrombosis and gynecomastia. Coupled with this is the fact that the procedures are irreversible.

Sturup (1968, 1971) reported a 1% reconviction rate for 900 sex offenders followed up for 30 years after surgical castration, and similarly low reconviction rates have been reported by Heim and Hursh (1979) and ortmann (1980).

In this case the bar owner has no right to confiscate a passport because:

(a) They have no right to do this anyway whether it is false or valid (see above), and
(b) This is not a false ID related issue anyway. It is a simple civil damages issue.

You should claim back your passport, pointing out that they were wrong to confiscate it - they could be found liable to a £5,000 fine for doing so as it is a valid passport. You should also of course pay for the damage as soon as possible.

**Edit**: maybe it was all in my head that it was not over the PA system as I was a kid. Found this on a random forum after some searching: 

&gt; Initially this started out with the crowds singing along to current chart songs that were played over the PA systems before the match and at half time. 'You'll Never Walk Alone' was one of several songs from the charts of around 1963/4 that were popular with Liverpool supporters, and it just outlasted the others.

true,RabidRaccoon,cnty-expat,Expat,"&gt; A liberal professor of psychology who studied in the late 1970s will see things very differently from someone working in child protection, or with convicted sex offenders. There is, astonishingly, not even a full academic consensus on whether consensual paedophilic relations necessarily cause harm.
&gt;
&gt; So what, then, do we know? A paedophile is someone who has a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children. Savile appears to have been primarily an ephebophile, defined as someone who has a similar preferential attraction to adolescents, though there have been claims one of his victims was aged eight.
&gt;
&gt; But not all paedophiles are child molesters, and vice versa: by no means every paedophile acts on his impulses, and many people who sexually abuse children are not exclusively or primarily sexually attracted to them. In fact, ""true"" paedophiles are estimated by some experts to account for only 20% of sexual abusers. 

Typical Guardian reader moral relativist nonsense. He doesn't really believe too - I bet he'd go apeshit if someone who he knew looked at child pornography was hanging around his kids. I.e. he just thinks he'll get brownie points for saying he loves a hated minority without having the moral or intellectual framework to work out whether or not that hatred is justified.

Here's what the best treatment of the subject I've seen

http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2007/09/the_mindbooty_problem.single.html

He proposes three boundary ages 

12 - when you can physically have sex - when women reach puberty

16 - when you're intellectually mature - people under 16 score quite badly on intelligence tests

25 - when you have some kind of emotional maturity - people under that age don't have proper self regulatory systems 

Which is a bit like a boot sequence when you think of it - I particularly like the way there's ten years between 16 and 25 where you're smart but clueless.

As he puts it -

&gt; I'd draw the object line at 12, the cognitive line at 16, and the self-regulatory line at 25. I'd lock up anyone who went after a 5-year-old. I'd come down hard on a 38-year-old who married a 15-year-old. And if I ran a college, I'd discipline professors for sleeping with freshmen. When you're 35, ""she's legal"" isn't good enough. 
&gt;
&gt; What I wouldn't do is slap a mandatory sentence on a 17-year-old, even if his nominal girlfriend were 12.

16 is the age of consent in the UK. And I wouldn't date anyone under 25. Given that I'm ... quite a bit older. And if I had kids I'd not want them to be around someone over 25 who I knew or even suspected had 'a primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children' or was an ephebophile. 

In fact I'd have no qualms about arranging for something very nasty to happen to that someone if they didn't stay away after a friendly chat. 

&gt; Debate still rages, too, about the clinical definition of paedophilia. Down the years, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – ""the psychiatrist's bible"" – has variously classified it as a sexual deviation, a sociopathic condition and a non-psychotic medical disorder. And few agree about what causes it. Is paedophilia innate or acquired? Research at the sexual behaviours clinic of Canada's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health suggests paedophiles' IQs are, on average, 10% lower than those of sex offenders who had abused adults, and that paedophiles are significantly less likely to be right-handed than the rest of the population, suggesting a link to brain development. MRI scans reveal a possible issue with paedophiles' ""white matter"": the signals connecting different areas of the brain. Paedophiles may be wired differently.

This misses the point completely. There is a moral reason why you're not supposed to have sex with people who are underage - because it deprives them of a childhood. As the Slate writer puts it

&gt; The next standard is whether your target is intellectually developed as a subject. We're not talking about her body anymore; we're talking about her mind. When you were younger, we cut you slack for thinking only about boobs. But now we expect you to think about whether she's old enough to judge the physical and emotional risks of messing around. The same standards apply, in reverse, if you're a woman.
&gt;
&gt; It's possible that you'll think about these things but fail to restrain yourself. If you're emotionally immature, we'll take that into consideration. But once you cross the third line, the age of self-regulatory competence, we'll throw the book at you.

I.e. if you're under 25 and you have sex with someone under 16 the penalties are reduced. But if you're over 25 and you have sex with someone under 16 you're going to prosecuted for statutory rape. Possibly after getting beaten to a pulp by concerned parents.

That doesn't mean losing self-determination, it means delegating some powers in a constitutionally protected arrangement to a federal legislature, which we would elect a big chunk of the members to, and keeping broad control over many policies, a la literally every federal state in existence today, at home. I don't see what's wrong with that at all. Saying that it would be like Canada being in charge of the USA is, simply, a tragic lie on your part. A better analogy to the emerging state of the EU would be Canada and the USA merging together and selecting Chicago as the new capital of a union of 60 or so relatively independent states.

So you might have a standardised rate of VAT, but different levels of income tax across the EU; you might have a constitutional right to healthcare, but the implementation of that healthcare might differ from state to state within the EU. The EU has always been pretty good at recognising regional differences, hell it actually celebrates them with stuff like PDOs for food, minority language protection, the capital of culture program, etc., whereas the UK and France amongst other EU states have always been very centralised and bad at promoting the fringe regions for fear of inciting secession (that's gone well . . .). We don't suddenly stop being England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, in fact being separate states within a federal Europe could give those identities a new lease of life whilst not losing any power on the world stage. That history doesn't disappear just because we are a state of the EU rather than the UK.

We live in a globalised world, that unfortunately is governed by corporations to a greater extent than people. The solution to that problem is not to split apart, but to join together and create powerful federal governments on a large scale.

true,hughk,eu,European Union/Yorks,"&gt;There is an entire spectrum of possibilities, which includes reducing the EU to basically a free trade space.

It depends upon what the EU wants to offer. Effectively if the UK trades with the EU, it has to follow whatever EU regulations they want to apply. Same as happens in Switzerland or Norway.

&gt;In fact, it seems that no country has influence on the direction the EU is taking 

The commission is essentially run by country appointees (the commissioners) and the parliament is democratically elected. No one country can dominate but countries are free to form their own interest groups.

&gt;Look at the EURO currency, look at the support for solar energy (after pouring billions in it, achieving price-energy parity is still as far as ever), look at stupid things like the cookie law or quotas for women in boards of directors,

The non participation in the Euro is a mixture of hand waiving by the government and a transaction tax by the banks. Has it particularly helped the government, well not really and every transaction with Euro land involves paying the City.

Solar power is more of a recommendation than a policy. There is a direction from the EU for renewables but it is down to the countries how to assist or regulate.

the same goes for your other points.

As for sovereinty, why the heck can't say Birmingham make its own decisions,  why can't Southampton declare independence? Actually states in the EU have rather more power than local governments usually do in individual countries.

There is the scene where Sally is taking the TARDIS key from  the angel's hand and you can see them looking at her when she turns her back. Then she moves slightly and the viewers' line of sight of the angels is obstructed . . . and THEY HAVE MOVED AGAIN. In the same shot, the angels go from alert to weeping, no close up, no dramatic music. Only the subtle movement. That is what resold the episode after a rewatch. Other than that, I was never too scared by Doctor Who episodes, but the bootstrap paradox about the DVD's was cool and imagining the total fear and bewilderment that must have been present in Sally and what's-his-name is fun.

I also say no to the mash - sorry, can't abide mashed potato - it's invalid food. Also, probably no healthier by the time you've mixed it with butter, salt &amp; cream!

I second (third, fourth, however many it has been) the call for more veg. Not necessarily quantity (that is a LOT of carrots) but variety. Some people have mentioned parsnips, peas, sprouts &amp; cabbage - all good choices. You can also mash some carrots with turnips (or swede) too.

All of this smells like Clara is definitely a pawn of a very malevolent presence--considering how taken the Doctor is with her, it's going to make her betrayal quite heartbreaking.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Firstly, there's no such thing as budgetary 'sovereignty'. 

Sovereignty is a legal concept. It fundamentally comes down to whether a n EU state can unilaterally leave the EU (and don't be tempted to get back into the 'f-word' vis a vis US 19th century state compact theory, it won't work). 

Beyond that there are obligations on each EU state. Chiefly they are to implement EU laws and not pass any laws that contravene EU laws. 

But EU laws themselves are only valid if the EU has 'competency' (again, **not** federal style authority) to create legislation in that area.

Competency also comes in different flavours. Some types of competency are shared, and some are specially fenced off such that the EU member states acting **together**, rather than the central EU machinery, creates policy.

The EU's budget is a hybrid. The central EU determines how much it needs (and remember, it can only spend on things it has competency over) and the individual states agree on their budgetary contributions. 

There's more to it than that, but it essentially means that each state pays towards the EU's budget. 

If this looks like it should be impossible, because a similar system in the US (Articles of confederation) utterly collapsed, it should give you a strong handle of just how different the EU is an an institution. 

There are democratic elements that do what people want but are useless at getting anything done, there are 'eurocrats' who are drawn from the same type of civil servants that get spending deals done between the US and Pakistan, and there are heads of government and senior ministers who know they can act a bit more maturely because they're not running for re-election solely on their EU decision making performance.

Even if you aren't a fan of classic TV, ""An Unearthly Child"" and ""The Daleks"" are interesting to see where the show came from.

2. If you want something closer to what you've already seen, start at series 1 from 2005.  Being a reboot, it requires no knowledge of the past show to follow along and enjoy.

There are two relationships that currently exist that we could be a part of. There's also one that keeps getting thrown around that's never really been tried. 

**A Norway style arrangement** 

Wherein we comply with EU regulations and directives in just about every field except ones that we genuinely need (FDI and FPI negotiations with developing countries, something that until the Lisbon treaty allowed the EU to negotiate on behalf of all member states we were desperately falling behind the Americans and Chinese in). 

What's worse, if Norway is any example, we'd be even more 'under Brussels thumb'. Norway complies with EU regulations faster than almost every EU state, except **it has no formal input on what those regulations are**.


**A Swiss style agreement**

Which would theoretically allow us to opt out of things, but on a tit-for-tat basis. This would mean the EU would then reciprocate by allowing member states to impose trade barriers on us in areas we don't co-operate in. Given that our export market is considerably more diverse (and therefore competitive with other EU-states), this is not something we want. Especially if you look at all the case-law of the ECJ, where attempts to restrict British, French and German trade is a huge part of what the ECJ has to throw out. 

Also, the European Commission has made it pretty clear that it considers the Swiss model to be a 'grandfathered' exception to EFTA / EEA membership requirements that it imposes on all new states wanting closer trade with the EU. 

Given that even Switzerland is slowly, on new issues, coming into line with the EU, the idea that it would let the UK have privileges it affords to no-one is ridiculous. 

**UKIP style free trade** 

This would see us arrange free trade agreements as though we were any other country that wasn't geographically close to the EU. 

This **is completely possible** but would be terrible. Whilst having the same trade relationship we do today with the US doesn't sound horrific, it would be an absolutely catastrophic downgrade from what we have today, where no European port can stop our goods outside of highly specific exceptions (health issues, national security, and certain cultural matters like Nazi paraphernalia). 

Well over half our trade is with the EU. Not individual states, but the EU as a whole. I can't even begin to think of how ruinous it would be if that relationship were to fracture into individual member states, or if it was downgraded to a non-integrated free trade arrangement. 


Tl;dr: Having evil evil bureaucrats in Brussels regulate Great British tyre pressures is a pretty enviably good deal for unfettered access to one of the world's largest and most sophisticated markets.

If that means we need to at least give an image that we are considering leaving to be able to negotiate a stronger position then so be it.

How many points would we be realistically happy with from our next 4 league games? (United (A), Norwich (H), Arsenal (A), City (A)) I'd say 6? (3 draws and a win) Although we could beat city since they've lost Yaya to the ACON and they haven't been up to last seasons standards and we pushed them all the way at Home.",0,1357255233,null,0,false,0,c7qko1r,t3_15wqex,t1_c7qko1r,t3_15wqex,null,1430847928,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,SpottieOttieDopalis,lfc68,,"It really wasn't that hard to come to that conclusion, not too long ago. He's been on a steady decline since his 08/09 season and last season was possibly his worst since then, with him being riddled by injuries. His days as a #10 are over, whether it's because of managerial preferences or his decline I'll never know, but it's clear that Hodgson and Rodgers view him as more of a traditional CM now. That transition was always going to take time and when you add in the injuries he's had over the past 2 years, it's pretty easy to see why people thought he was past his best. 

And those people that said ""he can't play possession football"" were right, to an extent. He had to change positions to fit into Rogers system, because the Gerrard of old was an instinctual, powerful, and quick AM that was perfect for a counter-attacking system, and that clearly wasn't going to fit in Rodgers' possession based system. It seems that Rodgers wants Gerrard to pick and choose his chances from deep, where he's able to use his excellent passing when teams give he space.

 I'm interested to see if more teams press us more in the future because we've struggled to deal with that this season. Gerrard has been great when we're in control of the game, but has struggled when teams press us(he's a bit like Carrick in that regard), granted that the whole team has struggled as well. I'm interested to see how deal with it in the future, specifically how Gerrard handles it, because when Suarez and Gerrard are at their best is when the team is at their best.",0,1357255285,null,0,false,0,c7qkomw,t3_15wl7s,t1_c7qkomw,t1_c7qijeu,null,1430847936,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

You can read into it yourself. 

Even if you argue that they've formed a contract and the passport is collateral, what's stopping OP from simply saying he's up and decided to breach the contract and would like his passport back? If, hypothetically, it ever got to trial, OP can offer up money in place of the passport and thus the landlord isn't really going to be able to say there is any loss for which he can claim. I don't see how the landlord can even claim to have collateral over someone else's passport. If OP decides not to pay for the damage, the landlord cannot legally take ownership over someone else's passport.  

The landlord could go to the police and allege that OP is guilty of criminal damage to property. Unless he has CCTV up in the bar, I wonder what evidence he has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that OP was in fact the one who caused the damage (other than his say so). 

But in the meantime, he's still unlawfully holding on to OP's passport without consent and that's theft. The evidence there is pretty straightforward. 

Like I said though, it's legal fairy tale land. Worst case scenario is that by the time the police even look into this, the landlord will have valued the damage and OP can pay for it. If OP needs his passport any sooner than that  then his best bet is to go to the police. Or threaten to go to the police while offering up some other collateral to the landlord in place of the passport. Otherwise OP is shit out of luck.

I doubt you'll get a place next to the stadium unless you get to Mansfield at least a few hours prior to K.O. This really is the biggest thing to happen to Mansfield in its entirety as a club and it sold out of tickets within a couple of hours after people were queueing  up over night just for this match. I would suggest trying to park at the ""John Cockle"" its a pub and has free parking if you drink there and it is only a 10 minute walk from the stadium.

If you are looking for general pubs there are a number of them within 10-15 minutes of the ground which are located in the town centre, most notably The Swan and 3 different Wetherspoons (the best of which being located at the top end of town). I would definitely avoid 'The Talbot' and 'Il Roso' because that is generally where most Stags fans will be drinking prior to kick off and they will be absolutely rammed and sometimes there is trouble if some people are looking for it (home and away).

As for must sees Mansfield really doesn't offer much, there are a number of fast food/restaurants if you fancy a bite located close to the ground (McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut) A supermarket (Sainsburys) and a B&amp;Q/Homebase if you need a bit of DIY/Biking equipment..


Hope that covers it, I will update this if I think of anything else.

http://i.imgur.com/jmWZn.jpg?1 Just a little overview of where the stadium is and where the town centre is located.

Instead, the producers probably create a shortlist of actors they'd consider for the role, and the BBC vets that list, eliminating actors they wouldn't want and possibly adding suggestions of their own.

From that point, the agents or managers for those actors are approached with the question, ""Would so-and-so be interested in being the Xth Doctor?"" Some actors say no, some would love to but aren't available, and some say ""Yeah, sure."" Meetings follow. Some of the actors might read for the part at this point, some of them might not, although I'm guessing that all three of the modern-era Doctors probably did read for the role.

Anyway... at this level -- lead role in a long-running hit series -- you won't see any ads saying, ""Open call for next Doctor,"" but, by the same token, the producers just didn't say, ""It's Matt Smith!"" without going through a process to get there.",0,1357257621,null,0,false,0,c7qles7,t3_15x1sf,t1_c7qles7,t3_15x1sf,null,1430848355,10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,10

true,nnth,lfc68,,"OK - we all know that Suarez can be a touch wasteful in front of goal at times. We also know that he likes to come deep (sometimes very deep), and we also know that he is one of the best creators of chances around. Part of the problem that Liverpool have with a player like Suarez is that he picks the ball up outside the box, often in wide positions, beats two defenders, looks up, sees Jonjo Shelvey (and just him, all too often) and thinks 'aaahhhh fuck it' and smacks the ball against the keeper (he does score sometimes too from these positions, but not enough to make it the correct thing to do, although he is right not to pass to Shelvey).  

Does he do this for Uruguay? Admittedly, he does beat two players, but instead of creating an angle for a shot he has the perfect number 9 to lay up for nice tap ins. [This](http://youtu.be/bAj-zCllvJ0) for me is the perfect example of Suarez playing as a false 9 or free 10 or whateverthefuck you want to call it. He starts off really wide on the left and as soon as the move is on his movement is just... incredible. He creates two good options for a through ball on the way to collecting the ball on the other side of the pitch, dragging (and literally pushing) defenders all over the place, then comes up with a lovely piece of skill before laying up Cavani with a bread and butter finish.  

As far as Sturrigde is concerned, he's no Cavani but all he needs to do is look for Suarez, make himself available for a short pass if Suarez is going in behind, or go for the ball in behind if Suarez is deep. Any forward with half a brain really could thrive off Luis after half a season in the same team. To an extent, this season is already (and was always going to be) something of a *rebuilding for next season kind of season* and so hopefully it won't be a problem to stick them up there together and they can have some time to learn what each other likes to do, which is hopefully combine to score 50 a season.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811251/quotes

&gt; Daleks: We are entombed, but we live on. This is only the beginning. We will prepare. We will grow stronger. When the time is right, we will emerge and take our rightful place as the supreme power of the UNIVERSE!

Fuck yeah!

And you have to admire the way the Daleks had come from 1918 level technology to going toe to toe with the Doctor in time machines.

Also there was a funny bit in Planet of the Daleks where the Doctor and his entourage are climbing a shaft. The Daleks look up and confer. A bit later an antigravitational disk is provided. The Doctor looks down and says, rather wistfully, ""You have to admire their technology"".

Now as everyone knows the Daleks are pretty much Nazis [expys](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy). The Nazis had some cool technology too - V1 and V2 rockets, jets and Panzer tanks. So much so that they failed to invest resources in uncool technology like fighter jets and bombers.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2#Assessment

&gt; ""… those of us who were seriously engaged in the war were very grateful to Wernher von Braun. We knew that each V-2 cost as much to produce as a high-performance fighter airplane. We knew that German forces on the fighting fronts were in desperate need of airplanes, and that the V-2 rockets were doing us no military damage. From our point of view, the V-2 program was almost as good as if Hitler had adopted a policy of unilateral disarmament."" (Freeman Dyson)

I think the point is that - like the Nazis - they are clearly on Team Evil. But they are single minded and technically adept. You can regard them as being a worthy opponent in a chess game for very high stakes, like the [Man in the Black Pajamas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/quotes?qt=qt0464807). If we were fighting evil idiots like the 7/7 bombers all the time, where would be the challenge in that? These people are the enemy but we need the Nazis, Commies and IRA (essentially just as evil as the 7/7 bombers but far more technically competent) to keep us on our toes and stop us turning into decadent swine.

As Doctor Who put

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811251/quotes?qt=qt1644139

&gt; Sarah Jane Smith: Well, what are you waiting for? 
&gt;
&gt; Doctor Who: Just touch these two strands together and the Daleks are finished. Have I that right? 
&gt;
&gt; Sarah Jane Smith: To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it. 
&gt;
&gt; Doctor Who: Well, I do. You see, some things could be better with the Daleks. Many future worlds will become allies just because of their fear of the Daleks. 
&gt;
&gt; Sarah Jane Smith: But it isn't like that. 
&gt;
&gt; Doctor Who: But the final responsibility is mine, and mine alone. Listen, if someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you and told you that that child would grow up totally evil, to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could you then kill that child? 
&gt;
&gt; Sarah Jane Smith: We're talking about the Daleks, the most evil creatures ever invented, you must destroy them! You must complete your mission for the Time Lords! 
&gt;
&gt; Doctor Who: Do I have the right? Simply touch one wire against the other and that's it. The Daleks cease to exist. Hundreds of millions of people, thousands of generations can live without fear, in peace, and never even know the word Dalek. 
&gt;
&gt; Sarah Jane Smith: Then why wait? If it was a disease or some sort of bacteria you were destroying, you wouldn't hesitate. 
&gt;
&gt; Doctor Who: But if I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent lifeform, then I become like them. I'd be no better than the Daleks.

No wait, that's a load of liberal horseshit. I'd kill 'em off with no moral qualms at all. But perhaps in a deeper sense admirable civilisations do need a steady supply of loathsome ones to keep them on their toes. But I'd definitely recommend dealing with those loathsome civilisations in the way Churchill did in real life (carpet bombing with a follow up of WMD if the carpet bombing didn't do the trick), rather than the way the Doctor did in Doctor Who.

true,mrh112,null,null,"Britain hate the EU for a few fundamental reasons which need to be reformed for the British to accept the EU.

Firstly the free movement of people needs to be significantly brought back into context, the free movement of capital and finance is brilliant for the EU, however the movement of Labor has been a dismal failure in the eyes of the British especially after the influx of cheap foreign labor for the wealthy to abuse, the movement of people should be abolished at an EU level and instead the right to impose immigration policies given back to national governments.

Secondly the EU needs to become significantly more democratic, given the diversity in Europe unlike some may believe the answer isn't to increase the power of the European parliament but actually go back to the time before it existed (when support for the ECC/EU was at its peak. This is why I feel the best thing to do would be to simply have the council of the EU as the sole legislative organ of the EU, all laws of which are discussed should be required to be passed to national parliaments for debate and then the result relayed to the national representative in the council (unlike the current system I suggest that the head of government is not the national Representative rather the population elects or parliament appoints a separate Minister of Europe to represent their nation in the council), if their is a super majority agreement the law is passed. This would remove the 750 MEPs we currently have and make the EU a less federal and more Confederal level of governance where national parliaments have greater control.

Lastly the Executive arm of the EU should be under complete democratic control of the council of Europe, this means the members of the Council also form the executive arm of government as well as legislative, they all come to an unanimous agreement on who to appoint to key positions in Eu wide organisations, this is basically the parliamentary system however without a head of government as this is jointly exercised by all members of the Council.
Lastly the ""Head of State"" or ""figurehead"" of the EU will also be given to the council of europe jointly.

The EU is an incredibly diverse union, as a result the more power we transfer over federal matters to the trusted organ of government the people relate to (national parliaments) the more trust people will have in the EU.",0,1357265196,null,0,1357265730,0,c7qno7k,t3_15wamt,t1_c7qno7k,t3_15wamt,null,1430849468,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6
