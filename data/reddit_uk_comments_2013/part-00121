&gt;1) male death rates from cancer are higher

&gt;2) expenditure on male cancer is lower

Most men killed by cancer die from lung cancer, then bowel, then prostate. Most women killed by cancer die from lung, then breast, then 'other.'

The only cancers which could be called 'male' are prostate, testicular and penile. Similarly only uterine, ovarian, cervical and really (by a large margin) breat cancer could be called 'female.'

In 2010 17, 788 women were killed by uterine, ovarian and breast cancers. 10, 751 men were killed by prostate cancers. The other are classified 'other'.

&gt;3) male suicide rates are higher

True, but this is not due to some demonisation of men, but rather a long-term and ingrained view that men should be stoic; not concerned by emotion, that they should support their families or they have failed. 


These are not new ideas recently come to the fore, this are old ideas which need to be changed for the benefit of both men and women. It's one of the reasons why equality of access to employment and education is important. Absolutely more men need support, but it's not new, and it's nothing like the fault of feminism. 

&gt;4) male specific medical interventions such as men's mental health clinics just don't exist (it's apparently sexist) but female only clinics do exists apparently due to there being an identified gender need.

You've editorialised heavily here. Again, this is not feminists ganging up on men, but rather a recognition *by healthcare professionals* that there are mental health concerns which men simply do not endure, and that the difference in the root causes and circumstances of those illnesses is better handled and streamlined by centres staffed by appropriately trained specialists in those fields.

The problems you list aren't really problems at all, certainly not taken from the position of the article. They're all readily explainable from a position of pragmatism. There are of course problems which both men and women face which are dealt with in less than ideal circumstances, but blame and accusation wont get us far. The article provides a skewed perception of reality, one which harms all of us. Unless we tear down the barriers which says women are only mothers and men are onky providers there will be attendant problems for all of us; but it is not in the tearing down of the barriers where most of the social and psychological concerns lie.

P.S. 'Mansplaining' is usually meant as a descriptor for when men attempt to discuss womens' perceptions through the lens of a male experience and get it wrong. Take for example if I was to try and talk about a bad experience you'd had yourself - I'd probably get it wrong, because while I can empathise I didn't experience what you did so I can't really *know.* Collectively there are things women tend to worry about which men don't. The fear of rapists is something I know is present in many of my female friends, but which I don't experience from my perspective.

I really hate the argument of ""coursework is terrible"", and let me tell you why:

In most subjects, it doesn't really make much sense. I'll agree with that.

However, the fact of the matter is, coursework is practically required to test students in some subjects so that their qualification actually tests them rather than, as you say, remembering the right things. Computing is one such example, where you have to make a program that actually does something useful (mine was an adventure game that taught students German, uploaded their progress (and correctness) to a LAMP server and allowed teachers to dynamically add their own challenges, written in Java). Difficult problems cannot be solved in the space of an exam, and in subjects like Product Design/Engineering, I'd assume the same thing.

The Guardian states that, despite this dictatorial act, [""He was a democrat, whatever that means.""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/02/boris-yeltsin-statue).

Of course, that exercise of personal dictatorship for the benefit of market ""reforms"" is quite different from [what the WSWS aims at](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/04/corr-a04.html):

&gt;The dictatorship of the proletariat, in the writings of Marx and Engels, means nothing other than the political rule of the working class. This political rule must include the control by the associated producers—the working class which constitutes the overwhelming majority of society—of the productive forces they themselves have created. In other words, the dictatorship of the proletariat means nothing other than the establishment of genuine democracy.

&gt;The term “dictatorship of the proletariat” as used by Marx and Engels does not mean tyranny or absolutism or rule by a single individual, a minority or even a single party but political rule exercised by the majority of the population.

&gt;This was also the sense in which the term “dictatorship” was used by defenders of the ruling classes in their opposition to universal suffrage and the development of democratic forms of rule.

&gt;As the author Hal Draper noted in his study of this question: “The London Times thundered against giving the vote to the majority of the people on the ground that this would in effect disenfranchise ‘the present electors’ by making the lower classes ‘supreme’. Manchester capitalists denounced a strike as ‘the tyranny of Democracy’. The liberal Tocqueville, writing in 1856 about the Great French Revolution, regretted that it had been carried through by ‘the masses on behalf of the sovereignty of the people’ instead of by an ‘enlightened autocrat’; the revolution was a period of ‘popular’ dictatorship, he wrote. It was perfectly clear that the ‘dictatorship’ he lamented was the establishment of ‘popular sovereignty’” (Hal Draper, The ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’ from Marx to Lenin, p. 17).

&gt;Marx and Engels did not counterpose the dictatorship of the proletariat, the political rule of the working class, to democracy. Rather, they insisted, it was the form through which genuine democracy was established. This is clear from their analysis of the Paris Commune of 1871, which, for a period of 72 days, established a “dictatorship of the proletariat.”",0,1371409154,null,0,false,0,cak2qew,t3_1geczt,t1_cak2qew,t1_cak02vv,null,1430789631,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Tolosan,null,null,"I'm going to engage with you, because a lot of what you say are issues, but I think the diagnosis you provide are in quite a few instances mistaken, and I think I need to explain why I think they are mistaken. There will be no insults here - I have no doubt that you are genuinely concerned for the welfare of men, and that's an admirable attitude.

1) is a well known problem, and the idea it's because men are viewed negatively would be a total mistake. The main problem actually is with a traditional idea of masculinity as admitting weakness or pain as undesirable and ""unmanly"". For cancer, many of the early signs (i.e. when its early enough to do something about it) are exactly the sort of things this attitude strikes off as being ""nothing to worry about"" and so when the problem can no longer be stoically ignored, it's often too late to do anything about. Furthermore, there are other confounding factors, such as that [men smoke more than women (pdf warning)](http://www.york.ac.uk/media/economics/documents/herc/wp/06_07.pdf). That study is for Germany, but since smoking remains a major risk factor for cancer, any gender disparity is going to come out in the death rates.

2) Again, is this antipathy for men? Where is the evidence? Or is it that male-only cancers like prostate cancer are different? Prostate cancer, the number 1 cancer for men in the UK, is very slow, and often men who have it die of other causes before the cancer becomes a problem. Screening is problematic for a number of reasons (see my answer to your fourth point below). Considering how notoriously dangerous and damaging cancer treatments are, there's a serious issue with cost vs benefit in the case of that cancer. 

In explaining any disparity there are two ways the disparity could have come about. One is that the thing doing better (female cancers, *especially* breast cancer) gained more funding. The other is the factors *pushing down* the other side, in this case mostly prostate cancer. In the case of the former, whatever you think of the campaign, breast cancer has had a huge amount of success in raising awareness of the issue in a way that prostate cancer hasn't. It's dramatic in a way that prostate cancer isn't - prostate cancer is slow and very hard to detect, while everyone heard about Angelina Jolie having a double mastectomy because of family's history of breast cancer. **Note that this is not to say that none of this is a problem, just that 'negative views about men' is not necessarily the best explanation.'**

3) Suicide is (like all sociological matters) rather complicated. Twice as many men successfully commit suicide, but that is not the only gender difference. Women *attempt* suicide twice as often as men. This is chiefly because men tend to choose methods that are more likely to 'succeed' - hanging or shooting - while women tend to choose methods like cutting or overdoses. The reasons for these are complex, but the point is the same: that twice as many men dying requires further analysis and more is required to go from ""twice as many men die from suicide"" to ""men are viewed negatively and that's why more die of suicide."" I think it's important to make the point now that every single suicide is an utter tragedy. I also think that the best way to deal with that is to do the hard work of working out the reasons and not jumping to conclusions.

4) How so? There was a campaign about checking your testicles for lumps a couple of years ago. You can find NHS website advice for both mens' and womens' health online, and if you see your doctor, they'll know about both. In the case of some things, the apparent lack of support for men is a practical matter. For instance, [the reasons there is no nationwide prostate cancer screening are practical, not because of an antipathy towards men.](http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/prostate/faq07.html)

Let's be honest here - mental health provision in the UK is pretty crap. We're set up to deal with depression and anxiety, and even that is extremely scattershot. There's little awareness of anybody's differences when it comes to this topic, never mind gender differences. You get CBT thrown at you because it's limited in scope, and you usually wait a while for that. 

It's also worth keeping in mind that most doctors are men, so as a man you're more likely to see someone who can relate to your experience (and you're less likely to be embarrassed about talking to; can you imagine how challenging it must be for some men to tell a female doctor that they can't get it up?). 

Note that the solution to many of these problems are not rejection of masculinity or a negative perception thereof, but actually as men we need to look at what bits are important and which bits are harmful. In the same way women looked at themselves in past eras (and now) and realised that submissiveness was doing serious damage, we men need to look at our own masculinity to see if we're ultimately harming ourselves too.

Also I have alot of questions about them, can they fly? can they brainwash? They can let Amy count down, but can they do more than that?

2. The Whispermen, I really hope to see these guys back sometime in future episodes, they were awesome, they had awesome appearances, I loved their top hats! And they didn't seem to get killed or destroyed. They can teleport and kill by stopping your heart, or by a whisper. They also have a sense of mystery, are they living things, do they have some sort of consciousness? They can brain wash you, much like the Silence, but these guys seem to have some sort of opposite appearance, were as the Silence have eyes, these guys have mouths.

3. The Silence, the idea of them are brilliant, they can brainwash and you forget that they were there if you look away. I liked their clothing style, but I didn't like their face. And they were mostly killed in 1969 anyway.

4. Vashta Nerada, but then again, where are you gonna encounter groups like that anywhere else than the Library.

5. probably the Empty child, since it was spooky to see a half dead kid that looks for his mummy, with a scary skin gas mask. But it was just one time, one slip up from Captain Jack.

BUT... looking at the videos on liveleak the rebels already have decent-looking Kalashnikov's, one even had a modern scoped M4 carbine. They also had petrol bombs, mortars, grenades, fire-support weapons, RPGs, several M79 Wasp anti-tank weapons and a 20mm orelikon cannon mounted on a 4x4. Besides that they had modern military radios, vehicles, patrol vests and ammunition.

So if those are anything to go by, I'm not really sure how the US providing material support (in the form of stuff they already have) will really tip the balance in the field, as most recent reports seem to suggest the rebels are losing momentum - which I suspect is what has prompted this.

Judging by the videos, most of the rebels only seem to be operating in small extended family-units of 10-20 men, loosely commanded by one or more elders. They lack any co-ordinated command structure or military training... so any operation requiring larger numbers only occurs where several of these extended-family units converge to support each other. Whilst they seem fairly well equipt at the small-unit level, their lack of heavy armour or air support will make holding the ground they gain virtually impossible (which indeed seems to be where they are struggling)... so if the west really does want the rebels to win then the only way I can see that happening is with direct military assistance.

true,meejle,eng-norfolk,Norfolk County,"&gt;[...] [S]tyle books make different recommendations, some suggesting you should leave off the extra *s*, and others recommending that you add the apostrophe *s* to almost all singular words that end with *s*. The exceptions are words such as *Moses* and *Bridges* that end with an *s* that makes an ""iz"" sound, and classical names such as *Zeus* and *Venus*, and *Jesus*. Some style guides suggest that all these words should end with just an apostrophe (e.g., *Moses' tablets*). So our first tough issue--how to make words that end with *s* possessive--doesn't actually have an answer; it's a style issue and you can do it either way. Many people have written in telling me the rule they use is that if they pronounce the second *s*, they write it out; and if not, they leave it off. Nevertheless, I prefer to pick one style and stick with it--I leave off the final *s* because doing so looks cleaner and saves space.

Sorry, your seeing things in on 'overly simplistic' way.

With opensource systems you can alter the code and make it do exactly as you wish - yes that may cost initially but you will have a better and more reliable product if you do and in 'the long run' would save taxpayers money.

ie

http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linux-brings-over-EUR10-million-savings-for-Munich-1755802.html

You would also stop using taxpayers cash to fund a company that uses its monopolist position (which it got in the 90's when there was no competition) to prevent fair competition and innovation, and one that allows the NSA access to it's servers.

The quick and easy option is rarely the best long term.

I am going to have a huge problem when schools, police, etc want to spend taxpayers cash on their Windows 8 upgrade (not using opensource that is what will eventually happen) ... Oh, and they will probably also have to upgrade their hardware to run on it - instead of using something like Xubuntu which would run fine with their present hardware.

true,Girlwithnousername,uk,"United Kingdom, London","I'm really sorry that I'm going to have to call you out on this one because I like you from other subs, but you genuinely haven't got a bloody clue what you're talking about here.

This is not acting like a five year old, it's called being responsible and protecting the wellbeing of your employees, and also protecting your employer from potential lawsuits (thus losing money and reputation, which no firm obviously wants). 

Here's an illustrative example. So there is a guy at work who has said some completely inappropriate things to me on a few occasions, in fact some astonishingly inappropriate things (not to mention that he talks to my chest rather than to my face, and that's not even when stuff is on display, he's just a massive perve). If I were an employer and he happened to throw in 'that dress looks good on you, the colour suits you' whilst I was interviewing him, he'd go straight to the bottom of my shit pile. 

Why? Because I'd think his comments were inappropriate and because I'd find them (as a feminist, which I am not especially) insulting? No. It's because I know that if someone displays such a level of ignorance at interview stage, god only knows how much they are likely to upset my co-workers once he becomes an employee, and no employer wants to employ someone who is so behind the times that they have permanent foot-in-mouth syndrome, which could open them up for a shedload of complaints, lawsuits, HR grievance processes and the like (all of which take up an extreme amount of management time, which costs HUGE amounts of money - trust me - I've seen employee litigation firsthand and it ain't pretty).

So, that's about the sum of it really. Additionally, the newspapers will have put their own spin on it to sell papers, which is just what they do. A bit of curiosity and reading between the lines is all that's needed here.

**TL;DR: employee is a dinosaur with no sense of political correctness, firm don't want to employ him and potentially get sued in the future**

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;I'm really sorry that I'm going to have to call you out on this one because I like you from other subs, but you genuinely haven't got a bloody clue what you're talking about here.

Oh gods don't be. People are multi-faceted. You can hate my political beliefs but still think I'm a decent guy - in fact chances are if you're anywhere near average for UK beliefs you'd find at *least* a few things you'd hate about me. No big deal, as I say, people aren't one dimensional. It'd be boring if we were.

&gt;This is not acting like a five year old, it's called being responsible and protecting the wellbeing of your employees, and also protecting your employer from potential lawsuits (thus losing money and reputation, which no firm obviously wants).

To what end though? Are we going to bubble wrap the entire world for people so they don't have to ever be able to take something on the chin? It's not like this statement did her any harm - and if she really did go home and feel *just awful* about him making such a comment then she needs mental help.

Re: the lawsuits thing, the only reason people face lawsuits over stuff like this is because we as a society pretend that trivial things like this are wrong.

&gt;Here's an illustrative example. So there is a guy at work who has said some completely inappropriate things to me on a few occasions, in fact some astonishingly inappropriate things (not to mention that he talks to my chest rather than to my face, and that's not even when stuff is on display, he's just a massive perve). If I were an employer and he happened to throw in 'that dress looks good on you, the colour suits you' whilst I was interviewing him, he'd go straight to the bottom of my shit pile.

Right, sure. But this guy commented about a *bacon sandwich* ffs. The girl is brown, that's it. People shouldn't need to fear saying a sentence like the one he said around brown people in case they happen to be muslim and happen to be offended by that. There's just no mature reason for such a thing.

&gt;No. It's because I know that if someone displays such a level of ignorance at interview stage, god only knows how much they are likely to upset my co-workers once he becomes an employee, and no employer wants to employ someone who is so behind the times that they have permanent foot-in-mouth syndrome

Right, sure. But he didn't display necessarily display ignorance. I can't imagine myself saying what he said but it's nothing I intentionally *wouldn't* say for fear of offending someone. I know full well about a good deal of the taboos of many a religion, I just assume that once someone is old enough to work in the adult world they probably aren't going to have to take a couple of personal days because someone offered to buy them some pig meat for breakfast.

The person in this case who would be well gotten rid of is the lass in question. She clearly raised this as an issue, which itself would kind of indicate that she's nuts.

In B3 i'm not sure about structuring. I guess comparisons is important but it's more about why you choose your option.

I will probably choose farm advisors or hospitals. 

FAS because it will allow the people to increase there crop yield by up to 200% which means they release themselves from the cycle of poverty and be able to earn enough to have a disposable income.

Hospitals because not only does it allow for closer health services but it allows people to learn about the health risks the rural people are exposed to and so on..

true,Quis_Custodiet,null,null,"The courts are concerned with the welfare of children with respect of their primary caregiver. This is right and proper - we need only question with whom they feel most safe. My own experience with family courts is that they are both balanced and scrupulously fair, even in extremely unusual cases. I'd like to share my story, unusual though it is.

My family history is very complex. I have an older half-brother, with whom I lived until he was 12 and I was 8, the product of my mother's first marriage. I have two sisters from my mother's second marriage (of which I am also a product) who I lived with their whole lives until just before I went to university. I also have a step-brother and sister I lived with from 8 until just before university from my father's partner and 2 step sisters from my mother's ex-partner. In reality, they're all brothers and sisters to me.

The youngest two are my mother's ex's children by two mothers. They came to live with us aged 2 and 3, along with their father. At first he was nice enough, friendly and charming. Before long it became clear that he wasn't really particularly pleasant. My mother and I both share the view that we should try and do the best by people who can't help themselves. Over a period of about 5 years his general demeanor became less acceptable to us as people who shared a home with him. 

He'd become enraged at the sound of the girls playing. He'd find minutiae about which to object, and make constant accusations of laziness with regards everyone else. Mum was studying part time, and would  almost uniformly be called by him at university to him raging about some tiny incident or other. This from a man for whom 2pm was 'early'. He'd refuse to find or seek work, instead occasionally acting as a mechanic for his friends. The older of the two has learning difficulties, and not once did he express interest in her support by the paediatrician, SEN services or school. Everyone was 'out to get him.' He had, on occasion whilst drunk or high, attempted to take the girls after some unjustified slight and leave. He was twice arrested for driving erratically with them in the back seat. In total the latest CAFCASS report lists 78  unspent convictions in fraud, driving offences, theft and a rape accusation. We knew he had a criminal past, but had no idea it was anything to that extent. In the third year of the girls living with us, they applied for joint residence, so that mum would have recognised parental rights in case of an emergency or another situation.

For the last three or so years, the girls have unconditionally referred to mum as 'mum.' There was little to no contact until recently from either biological mother.

Last year out of the blue, he decided that the washing up had been left for far too long. It had been left for about 30 minutes after Sunday dinner. I was reading a school book with the older, and mum doing maths with the younger girl. This was apparently unacceptable. He became angry and tried to take the girls, which mum obviously objected to. There was an extended argument, which I stayed out of. He was the sort of man who'd take any resistance from another man as an act of aggression whereas women are different.

Eventually things came to a head and he assaulted mum. By that act I was done with passivity and responded in the manner of restraining him. Both dogs were in the room and one (to my guilty satisfaction) bit him. My sister who was home from university called the police, and he was arrested for assault.

He was later released without charge on police bail to stay away. He did  not. Over the next few weeks, starting from the first day he made a series of threats over the phone to blow up the car, to kill mum, me, and all of our family who lived nearby. Mum, concerned had phoned the police after the second call, and they happened to be present for the third call. He attempted to come to the house, and was arrested again for threats to kill. Again he was released without charge. The third arrest came when he was trying to break down the door of the house. He was this time charged with harassment inciting a fear of violence. He was remanded for two weeks by the magistrates.

He was found not guilty at trial - the district judge felt he couldn't justify a finding of credible fear, but he did place a criminal restraining order (the typical result of simple harassment charge.) He's no longer permitted in our road, the girls' school or 100m of mum. 

Since then, through a number of hearings, mum has been granted sole residence of the youngest girl, and provisional sole residence of the older. CAFCASS declared him a danger to children, and unfit parent, and a source of fear for both girls.

It took 8 months after his assault for them to play outside unaccompanied. If they hear fighting or loud bangs, they still ask if I'm nearby so they feel safe. 

My mother, the non-biological parent of two girls, won custody of both because that is what is in their best interest. The courts deal well with their role. ",0,1371415149,null,0,false,0,cak4jqv,t3_1ggcxe,t1_cak4jqv,t3_1ggcxe,null,1430788776,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Frankly, I think Mkhitaryan has exactly the complimentary tools we need and have been missing. I hate the idea of us signing him only if we lose Suarez. I think we should sign him and slot him in right away. If he can contribute 10 plus PL goals it would be a magnificent signing, considering he'll create or contribute to so many more. 

If we sign him I think we can say our attacking mid positions are more than full (for pushing just for 4th). If we lose Suarez we certainly will need another striker, but if not I don't see the rush to get one. We've got Suarez, Sturridge, Borini, Aspas - all of who can play through the middle.

That is literally thousands of years in-between where nobody they knew could've safely guarded it to keep it in tact. That was way too convenient for nobody in-between they could trust to hold onto it.

o The Exploding TARDIS. The easiest plothole for people to reference. And its clear why. I doubt we will ever genuinely find out what caused it. The only way I see it being cleared up is in a desperate attempt by Moffat during the Christmas Special where The Silence just conveniently return.

o The Multi-Colored Daleks. We were told ""you won't see the Daleks for some time"" yet we've seen all the original Daleks multiple times over since then but not these ones.

o The Silence, themselves. The Academy Of The Question. We have yet to see any of this and Moffat had made it clear there was some higher force out there trying to stop The Doctor from going to Trenzalore but literally had zero resistance getting there. Makes no sense.

o ""Woman in the shop"" who gave Clara the ""best technical support phone number ever"". I get the feeling it'll be revealed at the end of the 50th Anniversary Eleven tells Rose to go to the shop and hand Clara the number to jumpstart the events with her.

I can refuse to hire children in adults bodies. That's about the sum of it, so that's what I'll do. If I was employing this lady, if the story is indeed as the article in the OP describes it, I'd be working on ways to let her go as soon as legally possible after this.

&gt;I have no words to reply to this. I just... well, whatever dude.

Not entirely sure you took my point. She's brown. I'm white, people shouldn't have to fear that if they offer me shellfish I'll be super offended because I might be Christian.

&gt;Disagree. Being well-read is not a bad thing.

This is not an issue of ignorance - this is an issue of acceptability. As I said, while I can't imagine myself saying what the dude said it, wouldn't be on my mental list of things not to say to someone. It's just utterly unreasonable to construe this as intentionally offensive.

&gt;Excuse me, but in 2013 it is acceptable to talk to an entirely appropriately and extremely well hidden set of breasts?

Course not, it's rude as hell. Never said otherwise.

Uh, wut?

&gt;I don't really know what else to say, other than that you fill me with despair, and I sincerely hope that you are nowhere near my own age, because that would send me to rock bottom.

Heh, I have no idea how old you are. I'd guess we have maybe a decade between us based on the odd thing I *think* I've seen you saying about the place.

Regardless, this is not something that I'm going to change my opinion on. This ladies skin must be as thick as Tesco Value Printer Paper if she has a problem with someone saying something like this - to construe it as intentionally offensive based on the occurrence of it having being said in isolation is absurd and childish and if any serious offence was actually taken then she probably should be seeing a therapist.

true,destria,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"As a student living in London, this guy just doesn't know how to shop or cook for £31 a week. My boyfriend and I spend £30 on groceries for the two of us. I know it's a bit easier to budget with two people as you can buy bigger boxes of stuff, but if I were living by myself, I'd just cut what I buy in half and have less variety in meals.

We buy reduced meat (enough to last a week) and keep it in the freezer: a week's worth of assorted meat supplemented with basics sausages and mince is usually about £10 (by a week's worth, I mean we have meat for at least 6 out of 7 days generally). The other £20 goes on things like a bag of potatoes (£1.50), some carrots (£0.50), two bags of frozen veg (£1.50), cartons of chopped tomatoes (2x £0.50), bag of pasta (£1), bag of rice (£1), some cheese (£3), eggs (£1), milk (£1), sliced ham (£1), cereal (£2) and bread (£1). Bearing in mind I don't buy pasta or rice every single week, and cereal should last two weeks. That still leaves me with ~£5 just to play around with, like maybe getting four cans of tuna (£4) or buying some tortillas and peppers to make a fajita one night or buying some cans of beans to have with toast. You just can't be fussy and we plan our meals around what reduced food we can get. If we can't get any good reduced stuff, we'll buy basics sausages, 2x beef mince, a box of chicken wings and some basics salmon or something and that will cost ~£10. 

The key is cooking everything yourself, none of this premade pizza crap. If my boyfriend and I want pizza, we make it from scratch and it tastes better anyway! I guess we made an initial investment into various spices, herbs, salt and sugar, so our meals don't taste bland, but really that would have only totaled maybe £10 worth of stuff and we could easily make that up by cutting back on meat or something.

true,Girlwithnousername,uk,"United Kingdom, London","Schemas. For the unaware, Wiki says: *In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas), describes an organized pattern of thought or behavior. It can also be described as a mental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information. Schemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory information. Schemas can help in understanding the world. Most situations do not require effortful thought when using schema, since automatic thought is all that is required. People can organize new perceptions into schemas quickly.*

And the thing about schemas is that they are intrinsically connected to your upbringing; I would not for a moment suggest that someone who is usually rational and open-minded would go out of their way to be ignorant to the ways of other cultures, but the thing about schemas is that you only know what you believe to be the truth until life experience dictates that you change your thought direction. As a very general rule, building schemas occurs from the age of around three until probably around the age of 25, however, I would add that if you are particularly stubborn (as, admittedly, I am) or exist within an extremely close-knitted community who only know what they know and anything different seems bad (basically because it is a threat against the norm, and people generally dislike change), then it can and will take many more decades to develop in some people. This is not a bad thing: let me be clear on this. This is a case of people only knowing what they know. 

**However**, I find ignorance and the inability to review your own points of view about *whatever* throughout your adult life to be frankly intolerable and unacceptable, and I put this contractor who did not get the job straight on this pile. Being young and naïve and easily influenced is one thing; becoming an adult and getting to the age of 60 and still living with the same views and schemas is frankly bloody stupid and retrogressive. I don’t want such people in society and in my everyday life, do you? Yes, perhaps it’s a generation thing, but then previous generations get away with an awful lot of pretty nasty shit purely by blaming it on their era. No. I’m sorry, but just no. Our psychology has progressed enough to allow us to diagnose that you’re just a bunch of shits who prefer to be stuck in a former decade purely because *it suits you, and that’s the way it has always been and always was in the good times.*

I hope the above helps to explain my position on *because she was 'Asian looking' that she was a muslim?
I'll get the bacon sarnies in is a perfectly innocuous remark, and one that was in context.*

Part of the schema-building process (which, incidentally, does have its uses) is the ability to (or disability, depending on your point of view) to judge a book by its cover.

Hey I wouldn't go that far!!! :-)

&gt;Beneficial to the human gut? I assume they would get there from us ingesting food produced from cows but I've also heard that dairy isn't so good for us to consume. :S

Generally we pick up our gut microbia from our mother at birth, and from people close to us as we grow up. But in terms of which animal is useful, cows aside from meat etc do contain useful gut bacteria. 
In the most basic way, cows play host to a similar set of microbes that we need for digestion, production of vitamin k and general overall health. Bacteria compete against each other for resources within our body, and on our skin and as such keep each other in check so no one single species/strain multiplies so much that it endangers our health. Our bodies are balanced like that, the only time it changes is when there is introduction of a new strain of bacteria that out competes the others, and our immune system and we become ill. And also sometimes when we take a course of antibiotics, we can get thrush or diarrhoea because the medicine has depleted one type of bacteria allowing another, or a fungus to take hold. 

We eat cows, we drink their milk, we use their poo to fertilize crops etc there is ample opportunity to pick up bacteria and spread it person to person. This is generally a useful trait in human developement, but it can have consequences when the bacteria is pathogenic, as in outbreaks of [*E.coli*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli_O157:H7) 0157 so emphasis is always on handwashing etc *E.coli* love cow guts, not sure why but there is always a significant proportion of *E.coli* in cows. Its not all bad though, *E.coli* are workhorses, depending on the strain you can get them to do lots of useful things, like make insulin for diabetics.

Driving over the border would be better than a light (on foot) patrol.

Secondly, you can hide the weaponry more easily as there are a lot of players watching the borders in conflict zones - intelligence services are not stupid they take a vested interest in this type of thing.

The advantage of parachuting in is that there is much less chance of being spotted because you land in an area where people are not expecting you to reach without them knowing beforehand that you were in country. You have already covered a huge distance without lugging huge weights and you have left no trail of entering, no footprints in the soil, no bags of s**t buried or ration packs - nothing.

Gareth Bale, Alan Hutton, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Giovani dos Santos, Adel Taarabt, Younès Kaboul, Luka Modrić, Benoît Assou-Ekotto, Heurelho Gomes, David Bentley, Vedran Ćorluka and Roman Pavlyuchenko, as well as Dimitar Berbatov.

Since then, our main signings have been:

Both Kyles (4m&amp;6m), Sandro (6m), Gallas (0m), VdV (8m), Pienaar (2.5m), Coulibaly (2m), Parker (5.5m), Falque (880k), Gylfi (6.8m), Jan (9m), Manu (5m), Clintus (6m), Zeki (3m) and Lewis (1.5m).

With Hugo (11.8m) and Moussa (15m) being our most expensive.

See, they aren't all Levy's doing, of course Redknapp will have had a say in transfers, being the wheeler dealer he is. So we can't credit Levy for everything. But at the end of the day, he's the man with the chequebook.

Now from where I see it, all of Levy's transfers have been very shrewd. He hasn't been spot on with some, but the fairly low fees we've paid for all reduce the risk.

What's interesting is that any actual money &gt;5m, let's say, he's spent have been absolutely brilliant signings. Jan, Hugo, Moussa, Scotty, Sandro, Walker, Manu, maybe less so Dempsey and Gylfi, but I think both players have already justified their fees.

Prism and domestic wiretapping/surveillance is one thing, intelligence operations overseas another. Strangely enough, sometimes what the government is doing IS in your best interest. That's something that's been lost on people like you ever since wikileaks came out. Some things take place in the shadows because that's where they belong. You have your own secrets, I have my secrets, yet the government can't have its own?

Again, separate the issues. Domestic surveillance programs are, in my opinion (and i don't think it's a stretch to say), flagrant violations of the 4th amendment. But they've also been passed and renewed by Congress out in the open. The Patriot act wasn't a secret. The laws that allowed things like PRISM to happen aren't secret. Everyone always has to be vigilant in defense of their rights and liberties. Vigilance wanes, and you get PRISM. 

Oh, no, the US and UK intercepted communications between Russian government officials and Medvedev. Say it ain't so! It's called intelligence. That's what they do. Chances are the Russians were trying to do the exact same thing. 

And I stand by my previous comment. Edward Snowden made the mistake of revealing his identity, and made it all about him. If he was doing this for altruistic reasons, he would have stayed in the U.S. Now he's in Hong Kong revealing American intelligence operations to foreign sources. I absolutely support his extradition and prosecution. There is a difference between a whistleblower and a leaker. He is the latter and deserves none of the protection afforded whistleblowers (though, for my money, those protections are too few and should be expanded). The Guardian is just trying to get itself a pulitzer. That's why it ran a story in its own paper on whether the Guardian deserves a pulitzer. Greenwald, who I really respected as a journalist, has allowed the story to go from domestic spying programs to Edward Snowden.

I could see the biggest whovians watching it once at best. For six, they're probably using the same logic. It's easy through a bit of quick googling to find out that the sixth Doctor is the least popular by a *huge* margin. They've arrived at the conclusion that nobody would watch him enough to justify buying his stuff, and right now I have to agree.

The converse is sometimes also the case, eg. People from Southwell pronounce their town phonetically where as the rest of Nottinghamshire pronounces it 'Suthel'.

true,Jaskorus,null,null,"If i'm not mistaken, English was at first just a dialect of the various languages brought forth to British isles by Germanic tribes.

You're saying the United States only brings death and bombs, but if my memory from school serves me right, England did just that through it's 1000 year history of being somewhat relevant.

Britain rose to power because of exploitation of undeveloped countries, would you consider slavery and complete economic exploitation your idea of bringing ""civilization""? Because I sure don't, the US does the same today, but under the ruse of democracy and on a smaller scale, do I agree with that? No, I don't. 
Am I proud of that? I'm not and neither should you be.

On the third argument, the United States aren't an old nation compared to others, but does that mean we're forbidden to discuss history with you?
While the stereotype might be that Americans are ignorant hillbilly landwhales, some of us are actually very interested in subjects like history and you have no right to deny us from discussing them.
Our country isn't old, but we draw our historic roots from the natives who first settled these parts, the Europeans who colonized the Americas and all the way to the fucking dinosaurs. 

Our nation is young, but our history isn't, some of us are proud of our heritage, even if it's not ""american"".


Like I said, The British empire rose to power because of exploitation of undeveloped nations and your empire started shrinking rapidly after they caught up with you technologically and culturally.

I see you're trashing the USA, but do you really think you would have held up on your own during the Second world war?
If it wasn't for the Soviet union handling 85% of the Wehrmachts' might and without our lend-lease convoys, there would be no British Empire today, the US didn't contribute much the the war in Europe, but I think it's safe to say they did the most effort in the Pacific theatre.
(I have a feeling you're going to say that the British contributed more troops in the Normandy landing, it's true but consider what is said above)

What makes you think you would have held up on your own in the Cold war without the US acting as a deterrent?
You should at least thank them for that. 

If you read this carefully, you will notice how I use them instead of us.
My grandfathers' generation did all of that, not me.
Same goes for you, your ancestors did what made Britain a world power, not you.
You're a greasy slob sitting behind a computer and being a hardcore nationalist.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Dogbotherer is a communist who is claiming communism was responsible for saving Britian from fascism.

Dogbotherer is most definitely _not_ a communist.  As he's stated many times he's an individualist anarchist/mutualist who actually has real problems with State socialists, both historically and today.  The original schism on the left at the first international was [when my lot broke with Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workingmen%27s_Association#St._Martin.27s_Hall_Meeting.2C_London.2C_1864).  You might like to gloss over this, as it suits your rhetorical purposes, but it's the most fundamental divide on the left, which has never been healed, and indeed has been written large in blood on the pages of history (with the vast majority of the bleeding on my side), so it's frankly insulting you would simply dismiss me as a communist.

Edit: Incidentally, if you reread my post carefully, you'll see I also didn't say communism saved us from fascism, indeed I specifically criticised the leadership of the organised left:

&gt;(even) the leaders of the Trades Union movement, Labour and Communist Parties wanted to let him do so, it was only a grass-roots uprising of the rank and file, and ordinary Londoners which turned out 250,000 angry anti-fascists who prevented that march

Dailymotion has nearly every surviving serial, plus many reconstructions. The quality of the surviving shows is probably equal to the broadcast quality at the time of production, while the reconstructions are mostly done by someone putting a tape recorder next to the TV speaker and matching with photographs of the show.

In the event Dailymotion doesn't have it, the great majority of serials can also be torrented. YouTube has the occasional serial as well.

Restaurants, tip 10%, 15% if they really were amazing any more and you'll blow the server's mind. Remember...they receive at least minimum wage and employers are not allowed to make up wages with tips. If they were really shitty, don't tip. They still get paid. 

Be aware that chip and pin machines will not generally include an option for tipping and if you include a tip on a card it'll probably be split between all the staff. Tip in cash by leaving coins on the table when you leave.

Don't ever tip in a pub or a bar. Food in pubs is typically ordered at the bar as are drinks no one will meet you at the door or come to your table to take an order. If really really want to you could offer to buy the person behind the bar a drink which they won't take but they will keep the money but this is not usual at all and I wouldn't do it but if the barman is really helpful and chatty etc you might want to consider it. Rule of thumb for all eating and drinking establishments if they don't bring your receipt to your table at the end of the meal, don't tip.

No idea about valets or bell boys I don't use them, they're no where near as common here. I guess you could tip but I probably wouldn't. 

Basically aside from restaurants a tip is never expected so use at your discretion.

Have a good trip!

true,UniversalFarrago,null,null,"My goodness, it's terrifying that a twister touched down in that corner of the globe. To my knowledge, this is basically unheard of. I hope no one's gotten too hurt from this. In case this ever happens again, you may want to keep in mind this potentially life saving fact: if you're home and so much as see a funnel nearing complete touchdown, take immediate action. Go to the lowest floor of the home, ideally a basement. If none is present, go to the innermost room of the house and stay huddled there. If you have the time, grab a mattress or something similar and use it as a debris shield. Ideally, you should be completely covered and in a well protected central room, such as a bathroom (the piping ensures additional debris protection and is indicative of a firmer attachment to the foundation, because pipes, obviously, go underground). If you're in an apartment and live on a floor above ground, get out immediately and hide in the lobby or with tennants on the ground floor.  Again, basements are ideal, so take full advantage of that. Finally, if you're in a ca and you have the misfortune to see a tornado within alarming distance, do NOT try to outrun it on your car unless you have absolutely no other option. Tornadoes are very erratic and their moving ""pattern"" nearly impossible to predict, so you'll never know when it can turn on you. Instead, pull over and take shelter in a secure building, or, if there are none, in a ditch/hole/lower level area. If all else fails and you're out in the middle of the countryside, drive parallel of it's apparent path. That's your best shot at survival. By the looks of it, this tornado wasn't too terribly strong, but the problem with these things is you never fucking know. Unfortunately, every year there are cases where nothing short of a miracle will save you if you aren't underground, and even then your chances are slim.

Sorry for the wall of text, and let's hope this doesn't happen again.

That glorious tradition of yours originates from a time when young lads were forcefully sent to die in hellfire because of some dispute between European monarchs.
They didn't know why or for what purpose they were fighting, in their minds three simple words were embedded; For the king.

They didn't stand in a line watching their friends die and get ripped apart by cannons and cavalry because they thought about the war and knew they were fighting for the right thing.

Not for their home or family, but for their king.
Take for example the Napoleonic wars, Napoleon was a military dictator but the ideas he had and wanted to be implemented were great and unthinkable for the time.
For example, he wanted to allow Slovenes and Croats, who were then under Austrian rule, to have the freedom to speak in their own language and be educated in it.
So why did the British send young men to fight him? Because it was for the king and the king don't take shit from some french guy (pardon me)
He wanted to keep the old order in Europe, which in my opinion is wrong.


It took World war one and to a greater extent, the Second world war for the British people to join the military because they wanted to fight for their country and home, not their king.
They knew what they would probably die for and they gladly did their job.
Again, they did this because they believed Britain should be free, not because the king said so.

So why is there a military tradition from a time of forced conscription and pointless wars when you should be honoring the fallen soldiers, not the queen with those parades.

Kings never won wars, soldiers did.

They certainly didn't want us to oppose it nor stand in its way.  This is what the policy of appeasement was about.  It has been reinvented and rehabilitated in recent years, but at the time, most people knew what it meant.  It wasn't anywhere near as much about war exhaustion nor playing for time to build up reserves as many historians will try to have you believe today.  It was mostly a hope and an expectation that the fascists would be able to deal with the communist threat in a manner in which the old capitalist countries had proved unable to.  Hitler and the other fascists were their attack dogs.

&gt;They let Germany take back Austria and other German speaking nations who generally welcomed German rule. Which would be akin to us bringing Hong Kong into negotiations as they on the whole want to be a part of our overseas territories.

&gt;When Hitler invaded Poland, we declared war as that genuinely was a nation that wanted to remain sovereign and was conquered. It makes rational sense how our leaders handled the build up to WW2 (apart from not arming to capacity giving Hitlers war machine a five year headstart on us)

Lots of the sparkfun items can be salvaged from old electronics. Like the LEDs, buttons, batteries, wires, ect... 

Can you solder?

It's a long time since I've read the statistics on the timelines of military build up, but we certainly would have had a much easier time taking them out before we let Hitler build up his land forces.  And as Parenti says, there were significant and powerful forces in the Wehrmacht and Abwehr who were quite prepared to do it for us, if we would provide them the excuse - we barely needed to lift a military finger in the early stages.

&gt;Plus, from our point of view, Germany was only taking back what was theirs. We thought that the Treaty of Verseilles was a bit harsh, and had had good relations with Germany until the 1900s, so many people believed that Germany should be able to reclaim their territories. Even though people weren't keane on the communists, I can't see them wanting Germany to take swathes of non-German territory, even if they had facist sympathies. 

There were undoubtedly some who held this view, though the unfairness of the Versailles Treaty is generally a much more modern view really.  After the Great War most people wanted Germany to be properly punished for the resulting devastation.",0,1371452888,null,0,false,0,cakf3xy,t3_1gg9w1,t1_cakf3xy,t1_cakevvf,null,1430783729,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Depending on the satnav software it may also require a 3/4g data connection.  Standalone apps like Copilot do not require a data connection since they keep their maps in the phone's memory, apps like Google maps/nav use a data connection to download the maps as required.

However Google maps can also use the cell tower information to perform crude location awareness (within about 1/4 mile) but doing something clever with the signal strengths of the cell towers you are connected to and by knowing the approximate location of each cell tower.  

GPS *tracking* requires a data connection for real-time updates but not for actual locations.  For example my Android handset (with Google location awareness turned on) uploads my position every few minutes to google's servers.

Would be kind of nice if the only trained nurse on a ward didn't get interrupted 3 times to deal with emergencies in the middle of the drug round, don't you think?  As in, less chance of a drug error for which that nurse will take the sole blame.

Piling more blame on people who are already struggling to give their utmost in increasingly difficult situations will only serve to reduce morale further.  Conscientious nurses are leaving the profession because they can't do the job they love to their own satisfaction any more.

It works like this because everyone has the right to work in an environment without abuse, and much like the managers who judge these cases, we weren’t there and are unable to judge the situation in the context of the environment at the time.

It’s conceivable that a Muslim or Jew being offered bacon could have taken offence, but if the offender offers his apologies and protests that no offence was intended, the matter can be dropped. Here the guy refused to apologise, which also has the consequence of making him unfit to be working for an organisation like the NHS which has these policies.

Also some bars don't allow bar staff to take drinks and they will take a pound instead, and a lot of bars will have a tip jar that is usually split between all the staff, if you're not sure just bung a tip in the jar (you'll have plenty of coins)!

Indeed this is such a non-story as people can already sue the NHS, although that is rarely necessary as most hospitals have compensation policies in place to settle out-of-court. Indeed between 2011/12 the NHS paid out £1.2bn in compensation which actually amounts to about 1% of their budget for that period - a fairly significant amount. What people do need to realise though is that they **will not** get compensation for poor service alone. Compensation will only be granted where they can demonstrate they have actually suffered financial hardship as a consequence of negligence (not criminal negligence, but medical negligence which is a rather seperate thing). In precisely the same way as poor service in a resteraunt won't take money off the bill... but a fly in your drink will.

This is perfectly acceptable even in RP - strengthening it can make you sound German. Other exceptions, especially in RP, are T-N or D-N words eg mitten, garden, written, rotten, burden. Here, true RP inserts what's called a Nasal Plosion. Instead of pronouncing the T or D, we send the air up into our nose and back down as an N. The T/D shape is made but the tongue doesn't pull back to verbalise it, merely stays in place until the N is sounded. Mi'n. Ro'n.

This is *not* a glottal stop and it can be hard to tell the difference between the two. The glottal happens further back in the mouth and causes a schwa before the final N. Ro'uhn. Mi'uhn.

When you do a glottal, you'll feel a small pocket of air exploding softly and quickly in the back of your throat. A nasal plosion is exactly the same but in the nose.

We also have lateral plosions for T/D-L words - petal, metal, medal, mottle etc. Here the tongue moves up to the T/D position after that first vowel and then quickly widens to touch the molars and make the T/D sound off the back of them whilst almost instantaneously making a L with the centre of the tongue.

I'd offer the following advice:

 - Anywhere that regularly advertises ""Up to 70% off!""-type sales has probably based their business on the assumption that they'll never sell a single damn item at full price. You are not getting a £700 bed if it's regularly cut to £300. You are getting a £300 bed and anyone who buys it at full price should consider tattooing ""MUG"" on their forehead.
 - If you're at a stage in your life where you're moving into your first unfurnished place, I'd hazard a guess that you're relatively young (maybe in your mid-20s) and you have an awful lot of things you need to buy. In this case, it can sometimes be worth going for the cheap option but understand the immense likelihood is you'll be throwing it out pretty early on. Particularly if your options are that or to buy a nice bed to sleep in but have nowhere to sit for two years.
 - While the rule of thumb with beds is expect them to last ten years, you probably won't find such a bed for £300. I've been very happy with a slightly dearer bed (I think it was about £500; the mattress was most of that, the frame only about £100 and frankly it shows).

So my point is - they have obviously been in supply of modern US and Soviet made weapons by other arab nations like Jordan or S.Arabia for some time now, and that hasn't helped break the deadlock.

The reason the rebels are losing is not becasue they lack small-arms or ammunition. Without heavy armour or air support they have not be able to consolidate and hold the ground they gain through these small platoon-sized actions. This is exacerbated by their lack of a co-ordinated command structure or any kind of higher-level tactical thinking. Instead a couple of extended-family groups, each of 10-20 men jump on some jeeps and head to a checkpoint where they rough-up and execute 2-3 poor conscript lads, then chant the Takbir for the cameras. It makes for powerful internet viewing, but it won't bring down a government... Apache gunships and precision air strikes bring down governments.

I have no issue with supplying weapons, but it isn't really what they need. So instead we need to have a discussion about who we actually want running Syria... then make that happen (and it is likely to involve a lot more than just supplying weapons... probably at the very least a no-fly zone or providing air support Libya style).",0,1371464993,null,0,false,0,cakgql3,t3_1gi5xf,t1_cakgql3,t3_1gi5xf,null,1430782887,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Background: I rent a flat in a block based in central Selly Oak and for most of the year we've had issues with rubbish as the large bins become full and people put their rubbish on the pavement. It's never been this bad - but as many students are moving out at the natural end of their semester, there has been more than usual. 

This morning the bin men visited and collected what was in the bins - but they **moved** this rubbish from around the bins to directly outside of the flat door. I had to climb over the pile to leave the flat and (as you can see) it covers most of the pavement. If I was in a wheelchair or on crutches - I'd have to find another way.

I've taken the matter up with the council who promised it would be looked into but frankly that doesn't feel like enough. Does anyone have any suggestions for further action?

Honestly teaching is not poorly paid for what you need to achieve to become a teacher and the perks you get when you are a teacher.

But as for the job, I know seven people who are teachers. Six of them love it. One of them hates it (hates the poorly behaved children) and regrets training to become a teacher.

I can barely imagine the stoicism it must take to get through that with *""ever-dwindling resources""*.... It is this inherant sense of victimisation and entitlement, that to even utter a word against such a group is justification for:  

&gt; *""I'm going to slap you silly""*

For the record I'm not *""going after""* anybody. I made an off-the-cuff remark about the posters early popularity in the NHS which we have found other references to, so I am not alone in that observation. I have also always been clear that the mentality exists amongst a specific subset of nurses (note specific, i.e. BY NO MEANS ALL). 

Being a nurse doesn't prevent someone from having a bad attitude. Similarly, I couldn't care less if someone works on the *cough* ""front line"" *cough* or the back-office at Tesco, working conditions doesn't ameliorate an attitude problem.  

It's effectively a ""I'm a nurse so my shit smells sweeter"" argument. If indeed you are a nurse you'll also appreciate there is a gulf of difference between the GP practice nurse who spends the afternoon with her finger up her nostril to the busy newly qualified nurse working alone on the elderly care ward. What about the scrub nurse or the nurse in the cardiac cath lab? Are they still holier than holy even though they probably work 8-5pm hours with regular scheduled breaks and better pay?

This happened in 2009 but it seems that the process has not been straightforward as Britannia still has a lot of bad loans on its books while the intergration of the two organisations proved problematic. As a result, they reported a £600 million loss in March, dropped plans to resurrect TSB and Moody's downgraded them. Regulators then started getting twitchy, took a peek about the place and decided that the bank was short to the tune of £1.5 billion. This has lead to a 'bail-in' (sort of like a bail out but with bondholders taking the hit instead of the state) although this is still a work in progress at the moment.

So far as depositors are concerned there's no need for a major panic yet and the line seems to be that small depositors won't be put at risk by the bail-in (plus they'll be covered by the existing government compensation scheme).

I see so many people completely ignore their housing benefit as part of the money given to them just because they 'never see it'. I don't see my rent money either, it goes straight to the landlord. That doesn't change the fact that I had the money to hand over in the first place.

* conversion from cash to bitcoin (for consumers)
* retailers that accept bitcoin
* conversion from bitcoin to cash (for retailers)

Bitcoin has significant differences to conventional payment systems, and in some situations those differences give it a big advantage.  Specifically, for internet purchases, when the customer is prepared to trust the retailer, a bitcoin transaction is cheaper because there is no possibility of fraudulant charge-backs, and also no oligopolistic credit card supplier to demand a cut.  Eventually bitcoins should be the cheapest way to purchase goods from trustworthy businesses, and when these three services become efficient enough, there will be a virtuous cycle of bitcoin adoption by consumers and retailers.

The conversion facilities aren't perfect yet, but for example bitbargain is safe and easy, and these will improve as the market gets bigger.  What's really missing in this country at the moment are retailers that accept bitcoin.  I believe that as retailers discover the advantages of bitcoin, more and more will adopt it.

It's entirely possible that your ""1% of children"" is actually ""no child is stopped, just delayed until the school geek figures out the bypass"".

Another issue is understanding exactly what we expect the filter to do; I've spoken to other parents who expect that such a filter will (for example) permit their children to chat via Skype video calls, but will not permit their child to expose their breasts or genitals to their contacts (because that would be porn, and it's a porn filter). It's difficult to even discuss the issue rationally when we all have different ideas about what the filter can and cannot do.

Finally, unless we ban VPN connections altogether, it will always be possible for a child to pay someone a small amount of money per month to bypass the filter (by running all their traffic through a VPN to another jurisdiction such as the USA, where we can't simply block all VPN traffic to that jurisdiction). Not all of those VPN providers will be law-abiding - some will be criminal gangs; have we really obtained a net social gain if those children who want to see porn are paying people-smuggling gangs to help them bypass filters?",0,1371471845,null,0,false,0,cakhq1c,t3_1ggjzh,t1_cakhq1c,t1_cakh88l,null,1430782423,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think that for graduates of medicine, if they decide not to become doctors or not become NHS doctors or work abroad they should be billed for the full cost of their course.

If they're going to make concessions for engineers etc then there should be a similar arragement. If people are receiving subsidised degrees, the expectation should be that they put their education to use in the UK. It's no good training a generation of engineers if they all sod off to the US or Middle East.

Secondly, Romana at times solves the plot and does the Doctor type things while Tom Baker is just being silly Tom Baker. ""Horns of Nimon"" is a good example.

So some ex-quango lady on £150k a year wants to ""modernise"" the pay scheme (which is fairly necessary due to it's complexity), but some binmen are losing out by up to £4k a year. They are open to talks of modernisation/simplificiation, however it's a union's *duty* to protect *all* of it's members, not throw a few to the wolves so the rest can prosper. Note, that the quango lady is not reducing her own wages.

Whether you're ok with cuts or not, you should always remember that the people on the top rarely cut their own wages, instead cutting those of people below them.

Here is a letter from B&amp;H Greens:

&gt; A meeting of the Brighton &amp; Hove Green Party earlier this week overwhelmingly agreed that it could not support any Brighton &amp; Hove City Council pay offer now being made that would leave staff worse off.

&gt; The council's pay offer, which it suggests will affect about 10% of staff, varies from employee to employee, so each offer is now being individually communicated to staff members by their managers during a 90 day 'staff consultation'.

&gt; Hundreds of staff face a drop in take home pay, offset by one-off, lump-sum compensation packages; the council has stated that, as a result of allowance changes and the compensation, some affected staff will be better off while others have to decide whether they feel the compensation is enough to offset their overall loss. This is an individual decision.

&gt; Much play has been made on social media that individuals may lose up to £95/week, or more than £4,000 a year. However, unofficial sources have recently revealed that a reduction of that level applies to just three employees and does not take into account their compensation package, which is worth about three years' losses.

&gt; Most staff face lower reductions and lower compensation, generally worth between two and three years of loss, sometimes a little more.

&gt; The complete picture is not this simple but it seems clear that once the compensation is gone, low paid staff will be living on even lower weekly take home pay. This has angered staff and it's unacceptable to the Brighton &amp; Hove Green Party, which has resolved to campaign against it.

&gt; BHGP chair Rob Shepherd said:

&gt; “The party's made it clear it cannot support a final offer that appears to leave council staff with a cut in their consolidated take home pay. These include some of the city's lowest paid workers and we understand how they must be feeling.

&gt; ""We recognise that the offer particularly benefits women who, it seems, have not been treated fairly under the existing payment structure. It goes without saying that women should be paid the same as men in comparable situations and we support creating a fair and gender-balanced pay structure. But it is not right if low paid people of either sex end up with a loss of income to achieve that balance.

&gt; ""We're also disappointed with the council administration's decision to delegate pay negotiations entirely to council officers, meaning the administration now has no say in what's being proposed. This is a council offer, not a BH Greens offer. If there are pay cuts on the table, they are not in our name.

&gt; “We hope that, as a result of the party's intervention, the Green administration will find a way to take back control of the process and ensure the council will look again at any offers that result in consolidated pay losses.""

&gt; Green MP Caroline Lucas said:

&gt; ""Since the negotiations began, I have made my opposition to any cuts in take home pay very clear.

&gt; ""I am therefore disappointed that, whilst some will gain from this process, a number will face a reduction in the money they have to live off each week.

&gt; ""This is unacceptable. I know from the many constituents who have written to me about this issue that they agree.

&gt; ""So too does the Brighton and Hove Green Party, whose members have voted to condemn the offer and also express dismay that responsibility for the pay negotiations was handed to council officers.

&gt; ""With the support of the local Green Party, I have pledged to campaign against proposals made to workers that will lead to a loss of pay, in accordance with the local and national party's democratically agreed anti-cuts and anti-austerity policies.""

&gt; Rob Shepherd added:

&gt; ""We also condemn the city's Labour and Conservative parties for creating the mess that the council is seeking to manage. They are quick to criticise the Green administration yet they created the problem.

&gt; ""Going back decades, both parties have presided over agreements which look blatantly unfair to some parts of the workforce and especially women. Both parties permitted what look like unethical, unequal deals. And both parties were warned time and again by council officers that they needed to sort it out but they bottled it in fear of industrial disputes.

&gt; ""Whatever the current state of the pay offer, it is utterly hypocritical of Labour and Conservatives to say anything other than 'sorry'.""

&gt; ""However, it’s more important that all politicians now pull together in the interests of some of the city's lowest paid workers. These people must be at the heart of whatever we do.""
Responding to the party’s decision, council leader Jason Kitcat said:

&gt; ""I very much understand and sympathise with the concerns expressed in the local party motion.
""Members of council staff have just received the council's offer to create a fair and clear system of allowances which completes the final step of the ‘single status’ process. There is now a 90 day consultation period for staff to consider the offer, how it will affect them and respond to their managers with their views.
&gt; ""I believe it is important to not prejudge that consultation, how staff may consider the proposals, nor any negotiations which I hope will follow.
&gt; ""During this consultation period I am confident that the council continues to be open to any suggestions from staff and unions that could further improve the offer whilst ensuring it remains legally and financially viable.""",0,1371473017,null,0,false,0,cakhxym,t3_1gicph,t1_cakhxym,t3_1gicph,null,1430782319,17,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,17

I would not buy from Ikea, purely on the basis that they use different sizes to the standard sold in the UK. This means you are then tied into using Ikea bed sheets almost exclusively.
Also, their cheap foam mattresses are godawful. I moved into a place with one and had to replace it as I could ALWAYS feel the bed-slats. And I'm by no means a big guy.

I actually replaced it with another Ikea sprung mattress which was about £160. Its a decent mattress, to be fair to it - I've got no complaints. But thats £160 just for a mattress, plus at least another £100 for a bed frame.

Memoryfoamwarehouse were very nice on the phone, however have delivered my bed almost a month earlier than I specifically requested.

I can't vouch for the quality of their goods yet, but they have a lot of good reviews. Its certainly very affordable compared to a lot of places.

Also, if you are looking for a sofa, I would recommend [Nabru](http://www.nabru.co.uk/). They do flat-pack sofas, meaning stairs/hallways etc are MUCH more manageable. And all their sofas are fully customizable, so you can choose the exact size, number of cushions etc. I have also ordered a sofa from them (not arrived yet) and having been to their showroom, I can vouch for the comfort of their sofas. The customizable element is fantastic, plus you can order more bits later to make the sofa bigger/turn it into a corner/change the covers and colour scheme. Its also very affordable compared to standard furniture places like DFS (I paid about £400 for a massive sofa with a bunch of extra trimmings. Keeping it under £350 would definitely be doable.)

EDIT: When new, the Nabru sofa cushions are very hard. They require some breaking in, but the ones I sat on at their show room which were broken in, were extremely comfortable.

true,ErroneousBee,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"To expand on that:

Share holders are people who own a part of a company. They get paid in dividends or they can sell their shares for a profit/loss. 

Bond holders have lent money to the bank, and expect their money back with interest at the end on the loan period. Bonds are essentially contracts to lend money.

Depositors have also lent money to the bank, and are guaranteed by law to get their money back (up to a limit), and the government will step in to make sure this happens.

If a company fails, bondholders have a prior claim on assets over shareholders (with depositors and the taxman getting in before them).

""The Co-operative Group"" is a mutual. The 'shareholders' are customers who collectively vote on wheat the group does. That mutual has assets, and wholly owns several subsidiaries ( A farm group, the food shops, a funeral services chain, etc). 

""The Co-operative Banking Group"" is the subsidiary of ""The Co-operative Group"" that has run into trouble. They found that after a load of bad debts in the Britannia Building Society, they did not have enough capital to safely run its business. There was a risk that they would not be able to pay money to depositors if they all decided to withdraw their money, as well as pay back the bondholders when the loans need repaying.

There were several options available:

1. ""The Co-operative Group"" dumps £1.5billion into the banking group. Not going to happen as the Group could just cut its losses and do:
2. ""The Co-operative Group""  declares the banking group insolvent, and the government steps in to repay depositors, and the bondholders lose everything.
3. The Government buys a big stake in the Banking Group for £1.5 billion or more. The Govt. didn't want to do that as it already has RBS and Lloyds shares to get rid of, and this time the shares are not stock market shares, but wooly mutual ones they cant sell on cheap to their chums in the city (or give away to voters).
4. The banking group finds £1.5billion down the back of the sofa, maybe by issuing extremely juicy bonds with 20% interest. But with Moody's saying the banking groups ability to repay bonds was ""junk"", only idiots would believe they'd ever get money back.


So, option 2 its is then, unless the bondholders want to do a deal?

Bondholders: ""OK, Don't repay all the loans, but give us something. How about making us shareholders so we can recoup our losses as dividends over the next few years?""

true,I_AM_NOT_THERE,null,null,"I think the main point about Syria is that this is more about wider middle eastern politics than removing Assad himself. It's about the West trying to show resolve to Russia/ Iran.

Cameron/Sarkozy/ Obama are well aware of who the rebels are. If the press can report about them freely then intelligence agencies will be well aware of who they are. They will know there are Jihadist elements across the Free Syrian Army, but they still want to arm them because they can't back down. They have bound themselves through their own rhetoric over Assad, they all called on him to step down and he hasn't. Well now what? If they back down now, they lose politically in a very important region to the Russians. If they back down on Syria, it shows they can't back up their words, politically that looks terrible (especially for the Americans given they are the pre-eminent power in the region) so they do the opposite and raise the stakes, hoping for the Russians to back 

The problem now is that the Russians/ Iranians are not stepping back. So the choice is to escalate to arming the rebels, which currently doesn't look like it will be enough to make them win. What next? The only thing sure to remove Assad would be direct western military intervention, something which would no doubt show resolve to Russia and Iran, but would be politically unacceptable domestically. Syria is a massive cluster fuck and unless a ceasefire can be established and UN monitoring mission put in place or until one side backs away, then it will continue to escalate to the point of possible direct western intervention, perhaps a no fly zone over parts of Syria.

It's easy to make inferences when you don't have all the facts so I think we should avoid jumping to extreme conclusions.

The manager says he was refused the job offer because of the comments he made to the recruiter and to the manager over the phone.

Going back to your incident. If your employers had demanded that you sign a statement acknolwedging you made racist comments and had been disciplined for it, would you have done so? I doubt it. So why would this guy admit to saying something racist when he quite clearly thought otherwise?

where do you get this rubbish? It sounds like you're playing Daily Mail bingo? This seems to be an attitude you are attributing to nurses rather than one that anyone would actually encounter from them. I daresay I've spent a lot more time in the company of nurses then you (I work on the periphery of the NHS) and I don't recognise these criticisms *at all*. Sure, they'll happily engage you in conversations about ""The state of the NHS"" if the opportunity arises (and time allows) but the suggestion that they stroll around with a sense of entitlement couldn't be further from the truth. Anyone who entered the profession thinking that they were going to be 'heroes all' probably had that illusion comprehensively dashed on their first shift during training.

You seem to be back-tracking and narrowing your original accusation to a ""subset"" of nurses. That's fine, I'm sure I could find you a subset of any large professional community who had similar (or worse) attitudes.

true,pandanomic,num23,,"&gt;Has he been worth the fee?

Absolutely worth the fee, if for no other reason than being possibly the most level headed guy on the pitch. It makes a MASSIVE difference having a mental anchor like that, especially when we're losing games.

&gt;Has he been used in a productive way?

He hasn't been used in the most productive way, but AVB spent most of the season converting him into a LW/CAM hybrid, so he and Bale can overlap each other easily. I think he, like Holtby, will benefit immensely from having a summer of training with the guys.

&gt;How do we rate his future

...I'm not sure I understand the question. I think his future is bright.

&gt;How should he be played?

Continue training him to be a dual-threat LW/CAM. He and Bale have great chemistry on the field.

&gt;Strengths

I don't think I've ever seen him lose his cool. Seriously, guy is like fucking Liam Neeson out there. Has a great right foot (I'd honestly give any free kick/corner on the left side of the pitch to him) with a killer hook. He's deceptively good on the ball as well, I don't see him get dispossessed too often (possibly the flailing arms scare opponents off).

&gt;Weaknesses

Needs to work on his passing and vision. Not particularly physically aggressive, can be kind of a pushover once people start touching him. He's not that fast from what I've seen, but then again our team has Bale/Lennon/Walker, so my perception might be skewed. He needs to drop back more and help defend, hardly ever see him on our half (though if we switch to 4-3-3 then I can let him off a little).

&gt;Added input

Some added discussion: I think he's underrated so far, somewhat due to underperforming (though I don't think anyone assumed he was going to be a goal scoring machine) but also I think due largely to not getting playing time. Every time he did come on the field, he impressed me. When he was announced as a starter against Arsenal, I was elated, and he performed well for the team ever since. He had to take a back seat again when Dembele was injured due to Holtby's good play with Thudd, but I think given a starting role, we'll really start to see the Siggy we believe him to be.",0,1371476414,null,0,false,0,cakipcu,t3_1gidk6,t1_cakipcu,t3_1gidk6,null,1430781960,24,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,24

true,toodrunktoocare,null,null,"&gt;The war would have already ended if we'd assisted the Rebels early on, and especially when they'd beaten Assad's troops into a corner.

But it didn't because external forces (Iran/Russia) intervened first and enabled a counter by the Assad forces.

&gt;Not intervening has lengthened this conflict, and it seems now that chemical weapons have been used by both sides, and Iran is sending troops, so it's arguably escalated.

Not intervening has not lengthened the war. A non-action cannot provide a reaction. I will concede that it didn't shorten it but it was the support for Assad troops from other external groups that enabled them to fight back. Intervention lengthened the war.

&gt;I don't understand why people assume that intervention equals perpetuating violence, and a laissez faire attitude will result in wars ending ""naturally"" in a timely manner with the fewest casualties.

Because in situations like this it becomes tit-for-tat. As you pointed out Iran is already helping (Russia too for sure), this is therefore an escalation of an escalation. What will the response be to our sending more weapons? Them sending even more. They won't stop just because we have waded in. To allow this to become more of a proxy war is a bad move, neither side has much to loose since we have none of our own troops on the ground so there's little reason to back down. We'll just keep throwing weapons at the problem until there's nothing left to fight over.

&gt;Desert wars are often wars of attrition with the balance of power alternating depending on who has the shorter supply runs. They can go on for a very long time until one side has a strong enough hand to actually force the other to surrender. All the mean time soldiers are killing and dying and civilians are trapped in a warzone and suffering and dying.

I think that very fact is a very good reason not to add weapons to the region and drag this out any longer.

&gt;End the war by applying enough force of your own so that one side has the decisive upper hand and you're in a much better position to alleviate the humanitarian crisis.

Isn't this what Iran/Russia is doing? We're talking about adding force to the other side of the scale, we're talking about resetting the balance.",0,1371476657,null,0,false,0,cakirjb,t3_1gi3jg,t1_cakirjb,t1_caki0nu,null,1430781932,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,hotcod,null,null,"I always bring up something like 'bang bus' in this context. It's not enough that they pick up women and offer to pay them for sex they also have to cheat and humiliate the women by leaving them in the middle of nowhere without paying. This of course isn't what is really happening, it's a fiction, but that fiction is part of the fantasy and that means, in this case, treating the women as things to be used and thrown away who are not worthy of even the basic respect of paying them what you say you owe. They are to be tricked into fucking you and then never seen again. 

You can contrast this with a lot of BDSM porn produce by people who understand BDSM in which the actual porn is bookended by interviews that firstly state that the women is aware and happy with what is going to take place and that she enjoyed it after. The enjoying it afterwards maybe a fiction, a job is a job, but again it's about the fantacy. Because of the nature of the acts involved it would be incredibly easy to mistake (and often is in mainstream porn) degradation as consensual enjoyment for degradation as a morganistic act of power. The submissive in the consensual act ultimately has a veto over those acts because it's intended to be a shared act of enjoyment, hence why they feel the need to show that the submissive in the videos is happy before and after. 

It makes for a stark contrast that such other wise mainstream porn ends with a fantacy act of degradation while porn that is about degradation ends with an attempt to show mutual happiness and enjoyment. 

I'm worried this post might make me sound like I watch a lot more porn that I do, it's more that this is something that's interested me since an ex partner who was interested in this stuff pointed out the strange dissonance that lot of 'normal' porn is by far more degrading because of a non sexual act than porn that involves (often) sexaul acts of degradation.

true,jsdeerwood,null,null,"Abuse happens gradually, you can't spot it at first - usually a relationship seems fine at the beginning and then it starts to build up - mental abuse, guilt tripping, blaming etc. usually the abuser does it in a way that pushes the blame onto the victim and makes the victim believe it *is* their fault - 'oh if I had done this right they wouldn't have got angry', 'I made a mistake - they had every right to shout the loud and call me all of that' etc. And then the abuser usually starts cutting them off from friends/family keep tabs on them, where they're going, forbid them going (a lot of guilt tripping etc.), gain more control over them and finally it can get physical.

Ever. To a lot of people (me too sometimes) it can be hard to understand why its hard to leave, but in most abusive relationships it gets to the point that they feel they *can't* because they are so dependent on the abuser having been cut off by them and told day after day that they are nothing, no one cares about them, no one would want to help them, no one would believe them, its there fault etc. and when it gets physical, the idea of them being *caught* when trying to leave or sent back because no one believes them can strike enough fear too - the fact that he could push the harm onto the children if you run or if you don't just take the abuse.

Further, I'm not sure that the availability of online porn has actually changed the situation much; I remember kids pushing porn at you back when I was at school, and the only limiter then was the difficulty in making copies (so the ""best"" stuff, which was hardest to replace compared to things like a copy of Playboy, was only traded with trusted members of the network, whereas things like Page 3 would be shoved in your face whether you liked it or not).

Online porn might even be reducing the impact of easy copying of porn, by getting the trading networks out of school completely. If this is the case, it's possible that by blocking online porn, you make things worse by re-establishing the trading networks that used to push porn at kids, but this time with easy copying available to permit them to widely spread their ""best"" material, not just the stuff they could easily replace via an older sibling.",0,1371477661,null,0,false,0,cakj0z1,t3_1ggjzh,t1_cakj0z1,t1_cakhyv8,null,1430781809,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Student fees of £9000 a year?  That'll never fly, how absolutely and completely ridiculo- oh.  It's past.  Did anyone care?  Few scuffles in the streets, couple broken windows, media mainly packed with people condemning any illegal action committed on behalf of the fucked-over.  How dare they break some windows over £40000 fees for a degree that was brought into force by a gaggle of cunts who got their education for free?  Those vandals are terrible.  They're not even the effected and good-natured students who are 'taking it on the chin' because we're 'all in it together', don't you know.  The people that are acting all pissed off are really anarchists or terrorists or whatever buzzword will make you view them as unimportant de-humanized enemies.  blah blah blah etc etc.  Back to business as usual.

One year after that massive degree price hike, was it a coincidence that I witnessed a complete revamp of every cafe and shop on campus, complete with walls lined with multiple flatscreen widescreen TVs.  It's almost as if a massive amount of money that came from nowhere was spent on pointless and ineffective bullshit that did nothing except make much of the university look more like somewhere funky on TV - an excellent selling point to prospective customers.

Privatise student loans, create a 'business' out of it, let them go about it as they will - within the law (of course) - as much as you can guarantee considering the massive and completely 'unprotectable' number of student debters that exist.  You ever had a debt collector from a private debt collection agency banging on your door?  You can bet your kids will if they don't buck the trend and actually find a job, after sinking that shit-ton of cash that never before was a requisite to getting educated.

&gt; There is a mentality that exists **within a certain echelon** of nurses...

As in any line of work, nurses ranges in quality from superb all the way to feckless or even counter-productive. I've been clear, I'm talking about a mentality that exists with a group of nurses - not a mentality intrinsic to nursing itself. A few of you now have tried to twist what I've said into an attack on all nurses - let me be clear it is an observation of an undesirable attitude that exists amongst **some** nurses (i.e. not all, but enough to be noticably unpleasent).

&gt;  I daresay I've spent a lot more time in the company of nurses then you

That seems like a bold statement given that you don't know what I do, or what experiences I am drawing on.

&gt; Cath lab and scrub nurses work the same shifts as everyone else

No. While there may be a small provision for out of hours service and the capacity to take up anti-social shifts, by far the bulk of the workload is daytime working hours - and that is what most shifts will comprise of. Obviously major centres might have better provision than smaller hospitals and there will be more scope to work nights etc, but the point stands. By contrast an elderly medical ward will need decent staff provision even at night. I would also argue it is easier to habitually under-staff a medical ward than something like the cath lab, where inadequate staff numbers simply means procedures don't go ahead. Similarly, you won't find the GP practice nurse doing a 7pm late shift. My point stands, not all nurses are created equal, yet all are able to bask under the heroic label of 'NHS nurse', and for some people this becomes an identity they flout - the long hours, the low pay, the selfless commitment to patients -- gosh it brings a tear to my eye just thinking of all our little heroes at work.

&gt; Anyone who entered the profession thinking that they were going to be 'heroes all' probably had that illusion comprehensively dashed on their first shift during training.

That is probably true, but I'm **not** talking about people who **entered** nursing under the pretence it was something else... I'm talking about current staff who would portray it as being something a bit more *heroic/stoic/virtuous* than the reality, playing up to public perceptions and stereotypes - *Keep Calm and Carry On, because... you know... 14 hour days, diminishing resources!* etc.",0,1371478258,null,0,1371479424,0,cakj6u6,t3_1ge8f9,t1_cakj6u6,t1_cakihmb,null,1430781732,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"&gt;So you made racist remarks to a colleague, your employer sided with you and eventually fired him as he was 'a trouble maker'?

I was accused of being ""insulting to Islam"" by refusing to remove a picture of my boyfriend from my desk. I wasn't asked by the individual in question, he went behind my back, behind my managers back, and instigated a complaint alleging ""insensitivity"" to a much more senior member of staff. So no - no racist remarks, nor comments on my part.

He was fired, incidentally, for demanding I be moved to another department. Then, when that was plainly never going to happen, demanding he be moved to a different department. And then being incredibly unprofessional, and sexist, towards female members of staff. His contract was terminated for professional misconduct. It went to a tribunal.

&gt;It's easy to make inferences when you don't have all the facts...

You mean like how you inferred from my comment that my issue came about as a consequence of a racist comment?

&gt;... so I think we should avoid jumping to extreme conclusions. He has said that he was refused the job offer after the recruiter's manager called him to tell him he made racist comments to the recruiter. The manager says he was refused the job offer because of the comments he made to the recruiter and to the manager over the phone. The guy says he was being badgered by the manager to admit what he said was racist so he told him to 'sod off' or words to that effect. I don't think there's really any contradiction going on here.

Reed have alleged that, during the subsequent phonecall, the Gentleman in question made further ""inappropriate"" comments. The Gentleman himself - nor Reed for that matter, have elaborated on precisely what those comments were. The article [the original DM one, and the version of this one published yesterday] doesn't contain comments from Mr. Hunt stating that he ""was being badgered to admit what he said was racist"". There's an intersting exchange within this thread from a poster about the lengths recruiters go to with regards these kind of issues - look for the posts dowvoted so far into oblivion by idiots who use the down arrow for posts they disagree with, for an insight.

Thus, there's a contradiction. Reed state he made further ""inappropriate"" comments during the phonecall. He doesn't actually deny this. At the very least, as stated in my initial comment in this thread, his reaction to the accusation is demonstrably unprofessional.

&gt;Going back to your incident. If your employers had demanded that you sign a statement acknolwedging you made racist comments and had been disciplined for it, would you have done so? I doubt it. So why would this guy admit to saying something racist when he quite clearly thought otherwise?

Again, interestingly, you've made an assumption / jumped to a conclusion. Obviously this isn't relevant in my part, as that wasn't the central allegation. To bring it back to an actual plausible scenario, however?

Had I been asked to sign a statement by the company I worked for, to the effect that I admit guilt to ""insulting Islam"" by having a photo of my boyfriend on my desk? No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't have been asked it either, but there we go.

What actually happened, was I was asked if I'd spoken to the individual in question, to discuss his concerns. I hadn't - as he'd gone straight to a very senior member of staff. Had he asked me directly to remove the photo? I'd have told him I didn't consider it to be an appropriate request, in light of the fact multiple people have pictures of their partners on their desk - but - I wouldn't have told him to ""Sod off"".

I'd likely have suggested a quick, off the record, discussion with our line manager, to construct a possible alternative. From there, it's varying degrees of conjecture, based on the decision that was made.

Ultimately, however, I'd have respected the decision made by my line manager.

&gt;That daft thing about all this is that if he had corrected himself quickly and switched the suggested sandwich filling to something non-pork-based because she was asian then that would have been actually racist because he said, he wasn't aware she was muslim.

What's daft, is that if he'd been a bit more professional upon receiving the phonecall - well, it might not have changed the outcome, but he'd most definitely be morally more superior. All he had to do - as I've stated elsewhere, was inform the member of staff from Reed that he was in the phone [hopefully using a hands-free kit, as others have pointed out!], that the accusation of racism / xenophobia was greatly distressing to him, and that as a consequence, it would be inappropriate to further continue the discussion over the phone.

Arrange to meet the company face2face, to discuss the issue. If they refuse, inform them that whilst you can't discuss the issue over the phone, due to the nature of the allegation - and their inability to discuss it in person, you do not wish to say anything further, until speaking to a relevant legal authority.

Instead, he tells a senior member of staff, responsible for his recruitment to a position within the National Health Authority, to ""sod off"".

Then one weekend I spent a couple of hours on liveleak watching the videos from the FSA (one of the rebel groups) and was pretty blown away by how serious things seem to be - it was like going back in time to the Al Queda in Iraq videos of ~2003/4. Soldiers getting sniped, tank convoys destroyed in multiple IED blasts, tanks being destroyed with US-made anti-tank weapons - in one video they even shoot down what looks to be a small jet with an SA-7 shoulder launcher surface to air missile. In one particularly unpleasent video literally hundreds of bodies were washed up along a concrete canal embankment, hands tied with single bullet wounds to the head... amazing that this can happen and so many people can push for us to stay out of it.

A no fly zone seems like a great idea. Obviously though UN opposition from Russia is going to make doing it 100% legally very difficult - but we might have to get used to that. With the security council expanding and including more non-US aligned nations we will probably have to find ways to achieve our strategic objectives without complete UN assent in the future. It is no longer a rubber stamping organisation for the west, and diminishing US influence coupled with rising Chinese/Russian and Indian influence will make obstructive behaviour at the UN even more common. 

No fly zones previously worked in Bosnia in 93, Iraq in 92-98, and most recently in Libya. They have the advantage of being able to provide significant military support to ground forces without the cost/political drawbacks of a full on Iraq/Afghanistan style land invasion. In the case of Syria I expect the Assadist conscripts would simply desert by the thousands the second a western military response was instigated - and either the rebels would win or Assad would have to enter into peace talks.

Of course what we have to ask ourselves is do we really want the rebels to win... it seems to me we want someone pro-western rather than pro-radical Islam like the rebels, so perhaps someone from his Socialist Arab Ba'ath party but not him - he can fuck off into exile or something.

In America they made it so student loans were inescapable - not even bankruptcy can get you out of them.  And since there was then no risk for the lenders, loans were happily given out.

So they now have a situation where attending university requires tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) in loans that people are struggling to pay back because they're then released into a shitty job market with declining real wages - and now they want to increase the interest rates further to squeeze their captive audience a bit more.

TV has become more entertaining, opening up documentaries and factual programmes to a much larger audience. modern factual programmes are much more enjoyable to watch then those of the past, with a few exceptions, like alan whicker or david attenborough, who pioneered modern programme presentation and production styles by capturing the imagination and interest of the viewer. what this old fool wants is TV to appeal only to his tastes, and to his level of education, which for the overwhelming majority would be boring, uninspiring and ultimately unwatchable. perhaps he wants us to go back to black and white too and the old bbc accent. personally i prefer more people in this country young and old learning to enjoy history, anthropology, science, geography etc, and how approachable and exciting these subjects can be.

edit: right now the 3 featured shows on the very front of iplayer are a factual programme about the cuisine of india presented by rick stein, a factual programme about the daily running of heathrow airport, and a factual wildlife show about finding a breeding pair of siberian tigers. would you all rather a single presenter sat in a studio simply read the information to you directly down the screen whilst showing slides like a lecture? or would you rather see the siberian tigers in the wild, the food and culture of india as it is in india, and how heathrow works from heathrow? this just seems like a ridiculous argument. the BBC produces some of the best factual programmes in the world and lots of them. go look at the factual section on Iplayer. on the first page alone there are programmes about aristotle, politics, business, the history of british cinema, the british army, gardening, Booktalk, chinese cuisine, american soul music and an attenborough programme about a giant egg. no other media organisation can come close to the BBC for factual content. bashing the BBC has become just become trendy band wagon.

true,duckman273,1953,Juan Mata,"1. In most of the games I saw at the start of the season he played well and started most of the moves that led to chances for Middlesbrough. Then in the latter half of the season as Middlesbrough stumbled in their push for a playoff place, Josh also lost form. Overall, I think he's had a pretty good season though he's still quite a long way away from the Chelsea first team in my eyes.

2. Perhaps a bit. Last season his development was stunted by playing so few games, but he's still young and still has loads of potential.

3. I have very high hopes for McEachran. I think his season at Middlesbrough has put his development back on track and I can easily see him becoming a key player for us in a few years; he's still a young player and very scrawny, with more experience he'll become more consistent and get a better reading of the game, which is essential for his position. 

4. I think he should definitely go on loan next year, he needs more time on the pitch and I really don't see him getting that at Chelsea. There are a few premiership sides he could go to and challenge for a place in the first XI, e.g. Sunderland, Stoke, Villa etc. I also think going abroad is an option, a loan to a team in La Liga where he gets regular first team action could be really beneficial for him given his style of play and lack of physicality.",0,1371480879,null,0,false,0,cakjzs2,t3_1gil3z,t1_cakjzs2,t3_1gil3z,null,1430781352,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

He has the right attitude, is brilliantly technically and is capable of grafting. I think he suffers at Spurs from not being able to play as our central attacking midfielder (like he could at Swansea) because we have Bale dominating that position, but he has impressed from the left of midfield nonetheless.

Next season I hope he manages to find his place in the team because he does have so much to offer us; goalscoring and intelligent passing amongst his talents. However, if he can't find a place in the starting XI and doesn't move on from last season I worry that a lower club might eventually tempt him- say an Everton or a Fulham- where he'd be the main man and would undoubtedly flourish.

But if I'm interpreting that correctly this would mean that those who studied economically viable subjects would effectively subsidise those who did not. Surely a fairer policy would be to do the inverse and increase the interest rates for those likely to do worse, as they represent a larger risk to the lender, as is the case for all other financial products.

true,mikebravo23,1905,,"1. Don't watch much championship, so cannot comment.  Young player awards are relative on who else is in contention.  For example this season Ake won the award for Chelsea, and he hardly played.

From the amount of games played it seems he did well.

2. His potential has obviously dropped, he did not play that many games for Chelsea under Ancelotti.  

I remember watching him against (qpr?) in the carling cup and he was awesome, for whatever reason, he has not pushed on.  IMO he is a bit slender and too slow for EPL.

He only managed 4 games for a newly promoted side (Swansea) so I am not that sure on his potential.

3.  IMO he will not play Chelsea in the long run.  I do not think he's good enough right now and I would doubt we will make it.

4. He should definitely go out on loan, his game time would be extremely limited at Chelsea.  I would prefer him to go on loan to an EPL club, it is too soon to say who as squads have not settled yet.  Aston Villa would be a good option.

He will have a similar career to Jack Cork.  It's good to see him willing to out on loan thought and learn.

So what? ""Trying"" to be good isn't a good criteria at all to select players for a team. Actually *being* good is what matters. Torres has had a very long leash here, and many fans have supported him through his very mediocre PL tenure for chelsea. He's been given repeated chances for a long time, and at present day remains mediocre in the PL. Fans have every right to demand better from their team, given this many chances.

&gt; The easy option at this point would be to LEAVE

Absolutely wrong. The easy option is to sit on the bench and watch the paychecks roll in. If he really wanted to ""committ himself to a hard path of redemption"" he would leave and take a starting spot on a lower level team, get regular playing time, and work his way back up. 

And what's going to happen next season? Coming off the chelsea bench and scoring 10 goals in a season is not ""righting whatever wrongs he's done"".

http://guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/syrian-opposition-doing-the-talking

This is easily the best article I've come across regarding how Syrian opposition was funded and who's involved. You've got the Neo-Con/Israeli lobbyists in there that were central to the Iraq war lobbying, The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights which is used by all media but isn't credible, think tanks pushing for intervention run by ex CIA, Goldman Sachs, Shell Oil chairman etc and people head hunted and passed around think tanks and organisations calling for intervention. 

The US State Department have been funding opposition groups as far back as 2006 and its shown in Wikileaks cables. What do you think the intentions were of those that were funding opposition in Syria? It was to foster the uprisings against Assad that would lead to him being ousted. Israel and the US want him gone no matter what bullshit excuse they come up with, that's been the goal all along.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clean_Break:_A_New_Strategy_for_Securing_the_Realm


""A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm (commonly known as the ""Clean Break"" report) is a policy document that was prepared in 1996 by a study group led by Richard Perle for Benjamin Netanyahu, the then Prime Minister of Israel.[1] The report explained a new approach to solving Israel's security problems in the Middle East with an emphasis on ""Western values"". **It has since been criticized for advocating an aggressive new policy including the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, and the containment of Syria by engaging in proxy warfare and highlighting their possession of ""weapons of mass destruction"".**

Once Syria is taken out, they will move onto Iran and it also will weaken, if not completely disable Hezbollah.

Here's two more things to consider...

Retired General Wesley Clark says he has seen a memo at the State Department stating the US would take out seven counties in five years including Libya, Syria and Iran.

Former French Foreign Minister says he heard Britain was preparing for the war in Syria in 2009, two years before it started in 2011.

We started the industrial revolution. We are responsible for most of modern science and technology, almost all western culture, modern warfare, mathematics, almost all modern sports, we have been a major player in globalisation and aiding the development of the third world. 

Without the UK none of this would be possible, global communication and a common language, most importantly we united a massive portion of the world through our empire and caused all that has come today, altered history in the most significant way ever done, our global impact over the past 1,000 years dwarfs any thing your nation has done. 

Our national accomplishments? Being the role model for a welfare state, uniting the modern world, globalisation, modern science and technology, modern sport, a large amount of the modern schools of thought, being a force in an open europe and uniting the commonwealth, being the leader in soft power and taking the first stand against Nazi Germany. Having conquered all but 7 nations, having an empire that the sun still never sets upon, being loves by almost all nations and having trading relations with them, having a cultural heritage desired by billions and generally being second to none in making history. The USA has none of this, it is hated by many nations, it hasn't unified anyone or helped other nations significantly other than in WW2.

Plus phone contracts and cable subscriptions are pretty expensive. The average phone contract there [is around £45-60 a month](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444083304578018731890309450.html) compared to [£35 here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12996175). 

Also cable is on average [$128 which is around £81 a month](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203479104577124494272500550.html?mod=e2tw) for a complete package which provides pretty average Internet speeds. Here's some [Time Warner packages](http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/packages/cable-internet-packages.html) and compare them to [these packages from virgin](http://store.virginmedia.com/bundles/vip.html). Virgin media only offers one package more expensive as the most basic package at Time Warner. In the US you get ~200 channels (without HBO who make 'Game of Thrones' and 'Curb your Enthusiasm'), calls and 3mb/s without a wifi router for about £65 a month. For about the same (48 + line rental) in the UK you get ~200 channels, 60mb/s fibre optic broadband, unlimited anytime calls, free installation, 500gb of space to record tv with the TiVo box and 6 months at half that price. 

In fact the VIP package where you 100mb broadband, 1tb of space to record and 225 channels is the same price, for the 1st 6 months and minus line rental, as the basic package in the US. After that it goes to the same price as the premium package in the US for which you only get 200 channels, 20mb/s (they call it Turbo) and call but it doesn't say they are unlimited. 

Oh and also, the icing in the shit cake, you can't change providers. The companies have monopolies in populated areas where only one company can provide you with service.

This problem has been brewing the the last 16 years since Brighton and Hove merged back in 1997. Labour had plans to resolve the problem back in 2007 but were voted out of office and the Conservatives attempted to resolve this back in 2009, but GMB striked then too (remember the rubbish piling back up then?) and Mary Mears backed down and left it for someone else to fix. Now the Green party are attempting to resolve it and Labour are using it for political capital. The Tories are mostly supportive of the efforts to fix the problem.

It does feel like the Doctor's been in denial a bit ever since his last regeneration.   He latched onto the Ponds quite quickly, and would have never let go if he hadn't been forced to.   It seemed like, after all that had happened during Ten's tenure, he was searching for a security blanket.   A stable group of people who he could travel with forever. 

 And after he had to leave them, the only thing that's kept him going at all has been the question about Clara.  Otherwise, he'd still be floating around above Victorian London.   And now, with the mystery solved, and with all this business about Hurt's Doctor, and meeting Ten(who was, at least from what we've seen, WAY more traumatized than Nine)...things are going to get dark for him again very quickly.

I could easily see the Twelfth Doctor being a version that is facing his guilts again over the Time War.  It would make a lot of given the last season and the 50th that a Doctor reborn so close to so many(presumably) traumatic events would be darker.

The question is, though, how to differentiate this from Nine and Ten.   We've already seen the ""I'm so scarred I sometimes forget mercy"" angles from both Nine and Ten.

I'm not claiming neither of those have any effect but simply assuming some kids will always do or learn something regardless of what precise motivation they end up having or else that some kids will never get such motivation regardless of situation seems overly simplistic.

As if you're invoking fate, nothing will make any difference because the same kids will do the same things anyway it'll just happen a different way. Every kid that grows up to do achieve something doesn't come from parent's who did anything particularly special, and plenty of kids of great minds and inventors go on to lead very normal lives. How many people who worked hard to succeed were inspired by some limitation placed on them that drove them to overcome? They had tendencies and abilities that made them more likely to succeed perhaps but nothing is set in stone for anybody.

Again getting very starry eyed and idealistic over teenagers being teenagers and tossing off in their rooms so assume a fair amount of tongue in cheek when discussing the benefits of this idea overall.

what nonsense. i recall a single interview with griffin, and recently a single interview with robinson, so those are completely moot points. the bbc produces loads of information programmes about science, history and art. the fact that youre saying they dont proves you dont know what your talking about.

your simply a thick person with grand illusions of intellectuality. i dont monopolise any television channels, fucking obviously. do you think i pick the bbcs schedules? they do produced debate programmes in studios regarding history, art and science etc, just not as many as they used to because they can make better programmes with more visual demonstrations, like the christmas lectures and the sky at night. but the fact of the matter is studio based debate programmes without an entertainment element score lower viewing figures, fewer people watch them, fewer people enjoy them and as a format they are outdated. 

&gt;And ""EastEnders"" and ""The Voice"" is a good use of my licence fee? Don't make me laugh about the Beeb wasting time and money.

you dont pay for these programmes to be made. your licence fee isnt even a drop in the ocean in regards to the bbc's budget. if there is one programme you enjoyed you havent even provided 1% of the budget for it. east enders has some of the highest viewing figures in british television history, so its a pretty fucking stupid example.  

&gt;Certainly not capitialisation or use of apostrophes it appears... Guess all those Open Uni programmes, or old Horizon programmes never taught anyone anything!

why would i bother with capitalisation and apostrophes when talking to you? the bbc still makes open university programmes, and no, you learn from books, research, lessons and lectures. not from watching the TV.

With guns and rockets (less so bombs) you generally point them at what you want to kill, and it will mostly limit the effects to that target (or an area very near it if you miss). With chemical weapons you release them over a wide area in which your target is and hope it hits them, if the wind changes you'll have gassed a different target, and not just that, but with some chemical weapons the agent can linger in the area, affecting people that come in to provide first aid to the survivors.

For want of a better analogy a gun or a rocket is like fishing with a rod, you generally catch one fish at a time, chemical weapons are like dredger vessels that catch anything in their nets, wiping out areas of seabed with each time they go out.

Not to mention that chemical weapons are a horrible thing to die from, and even worse to survive (in my opinion) look at the sarin attacks in the Tokyo subway for the effects.

So then if you have these 'related factors' and plug them into your spreadsheet and you can get a predicted range of what you would *expect* house prices to be. If they are above they are overvalued if they are below they are undervalued.

One of the biggest culprits in over and undervaluation is the lovely 'rational economic man' model. Or rather it's failings. Behavioural factors. If we feel good about something, we pay more, even over the odds, because we are worried we might miss the opportunity. If we feel bad about something, we will pay less, because we feel like we're getting a bum deal.

As a civil servant, however, after 33 years, I my pension was equal to 100% of my top salary, so (with occasional COLAs) I'm still getting that same paycheck, and will continue to do so.

My wife, a high-level techie manager in communications, recently retired at around $70,000 -- but with no pension, only her considerable investment portfolio, built up over the decades. She always thought she was making excellent money, and put her two kids through college with no debts.

And our pretty new house cost us about three times the Southern average I quoted. We have no debts at all. (Bought the house cash after selling the old one, plus some savings.) We travel when we want to and expect to live the rest of our lives quite comfortably. Much of which is the benefit of having been born in an earlier generation, I personally think.

All of which is to say that, from my POV, you seem yourself to be at a *much* higher than average salary level, relative to the rest of the U.S. Most of us get along just fine -- better than most, actually -- at the level you say you will be forced to cut back to.

On working patterns - my point is that not all nurses are spoon feeding pensioners on care of the elderly wards alone at 5am, while hospital managers quaff champagne, doctors play golf and patients die left, right and centre in their own excremenent... as the daily mail image of the heroic beleaguered nurse would have us believe.

Infact far from it. Elderly care/rehab wards tend to have high nursing staff turn-over rates because the workload is about as bad as it gets in nursing. Indeed most newly qualified nurses take positions on those wards as thats all they can get after graduating, and only do them for ~18 months before moving to something more sedate. Many (including those in theatres/cath lab/community posts/research positions/nurse-specialist roles etc.) have regular daytime shift patterns, few overnights, better pay and often substaintially better working conditions.

I remember reading interviews where she talked about her childhood with a volatile, violent mother who would flip her shit at the sound of a plastic carrier bag being crinkled and would beat her (""I never would cry. I still don’t.""); back then, did she get the idea, subconsciously, that personal relationships have to include some amount of abuse? She describes herself as a people pleaser - and Saatchi as prone to outbursts (and her reaction: ""I'll go quiet when he explodes, and then I am a nest of horrible festeringness.""). 

It raises the question how dysfunctional this supposedly happy, glamorous marriage is and how entangled she has become (it is very difficult to explain the corrosive effect of domestic violence to people who haven't experienced it). And the aforementioned public eye will not exactly make easier for her whatever her next move is, on the contrary. 
 
Saatchi used to spin shit for a living but has issued a surprisingly weak statement - he is basically admitting the transgression while at the same time trying to pass it off as a ueber-smooth version of ""she walked into the door lol"". Quite bizarre. 

(If he had said, truthfully of course, that he was checking her glands, re-enacting some scene or joke-strangling her a la Bart Simpson, his reaction would sound fairly different. And if my husband was loving and peaceful and found himself accused of domestic violence, I would come to his defense very vocally; but her non-reaction speaks volumes. Her behaviour is evasive, and while I'm aware that nobody wants to come home to a gaggle of paparazzi at the front door, I think her escape is down to *what* exactly has been papped. I worry that the publicity of it all might diminish rather than add to any resolve she might have of leaving him.

Unclear or inexact because a choice between alternatives has not been made.

The joke is that Nigella Lawson is famously voluptuous, so Nick Griffin wants to squeeze her tits/arse instead of her neck. As far as I'm aware, that's the intended interpretation, and the only interpretation. Your comment along the lines of ""you can't fault the guy for liking boobs"" confirms that.

Unless you're trying to argue that the comment is ambiguous because it doesn't specify whether Nick wants to squeeze her arse or tits, in which case you're so far removed from the point that this conversation is just you trying to save some pride because you know you're wrong. You're still wrong, because the lack of choice between the alternatives doesn't make the joke unclear or inexact.

------------Sturridge-----------

Coutinho---Mkhitaryan---Suarez


The three attacking players behind Sturridge would be fluid, free to interchange and move about (Micky likes to drift wide sometimes, Suarez and Coutinho both like to drift inside).  Moving Suarez wide will be just fine too, he's a monster for Uruguay playing to the side of Cavani and he did really well at ajax in the same position.

If Suarez goes:

------------Sturridge-----------

Coutinho---Mkhitaryan---Borini/Aspas/Downing/Alberto

Coutinho and Micky are free to roam.  They're both more than able to keep track of one another and not be in each other's way.  If it's Borini or Aspas then they get to interchange since they're both inclinded to move.  At this point Jonno and Enrique will be doing a lot of attacking and be important parts of providing width on the attack.  If it's Alberto or Downing then they provide a bit of natural width and a reliable outlet on that flank.

No matter which way the attacking 4 work out, they have a very solid base of players behind them:

--------Lucas--Gerrard-------

Enrique--Agger--XXX--Johnson

--------Reina/Mignolet--------

The 4-2-3-1 seems to be all the rage right now anyway and the way we seem to be building our side makes it look like we want to play that sort of shape with a set of fluid and interchangeable attacking players.

If you want to get some good views of the city, and you don't mind a walk, try climbing Arthur's Seat or Calton Hill. You could also pay to climb the Scott Monument.

If you like museums, there's the Writer's Museum, the Museum of Scotland, the Childhood Museum etc. Museum of Scotland has something for everyone.

Castle is overrated in my opinion, but if you like Castles then go to it. Stirling Castle is a better castle, but obviously not in Edinburgh.
If you like architecture or politics, try the Parliament. Amazing building, free entry I believe. Of course, you could just wander around the old Town and see some architecture (John Knox's house is a particular highlight, as is Victoria Street)

Well, after taking all of Russia (which he would have done), he would have had all their resources, which amounts to a tidy amount of oil, coal, iron and other goods. It would also have stopped Russia helping Communist China after the Second World War, so they would have likely come under Japanese control, who were allied with Germany. I'd say that would make Germany, in comparison to other countries, pretty damn strong.

&gt;Hitler wanted a world where Germany dominated Europe and the British dominated the rest.

There is no hard evidence for that, and you could argue all day about what Hitler actually wanted.

Please do not blame the bin men personally, I am sure that they are following strictly enforced guidelines and will not go the extra mile as doing so will put their jobs on the line.

It depends what you want. 
RAC and AA have their own patrols, CRB checked, regulated, and a large number of them so hopefully you won't have to wait to long and you'll have the assurance that you will be taken care of. Most others will use local garages and so aren't always as regulated. I have heard bad things about britannia rescue on waiting times and awful service.

The offical line from AA and RAC are that green flag aren't as good but in truth the reasons are becoming fewer and fewer as they use local garages but regulate them well and are beginning to sort out their own patrols. 

All offer fairly similar levels of cover so pick from the three and you'll be fine.

So you can get hit in the testicles, which will release adrenaline, and you may release *more* of it since it is such a sensitive area, but it's not the only way you're releasing adrenaline, as it's being released just by being in a ""dangerous"" area.

It's likely that if you're in a fight and your body is already hyped up on adrenaline, a hit to the groin will be numbed a bit anyway, as you're already in ""fight or flight"" mode.

No I don't. I presume that petty criminals get early release and don't get rehabilitated.

For instance I'd say that a lot of our formalised education systems work to emphasise memorising other people's ideas and parroting back facts learnt from rote with only the most simplistic understanding of the theories behind them simply to pass exams. So the most valuable lessons I got from IT were when I was screwing around not paying attention. I was already curious which meant I wanted to work out how to get around filters, and bright enough to work out how but without the motivation I wouldn't have had any reason to learn.

Saying that if you remove one motivation another will simply come along and achieve the same thing is an action to do nothing because it says you don't have to do anything, something else will come along. Whereas I tend to prescribe to the school of thought that says nothing is guaranteed, so seize every opportunity and try to provide as many opportunities for others as you can because if you don't there's no guarantee others will.

Personally I'd just buy the north peak district (dark peak) explorer OS map and work out your own routes all the footpaths are good and the only place you can really run into trouble is if you decide to go up kinder scout in fog or low cloud, in which case you'll probably get lost as its basically just a large expanse of featureless peat cut by deceptively deep streams which change course frequently and are not accurately positioned on a map. We did an experiment once where we went up there in fog with a GPS on us but we didn't use it, we tried to navigate with just a map (no compass) then after 2 hours completely drenched after wading through the bog in the freezing rain we looked at the GPS, we had basically been walking in circles for 2 hours and we didn't even realise it. 

I've walked most of the footpaths in that area as I lived in Sheffield for years and spent virtually every weekend out there. Its worth taking in Derwent edge, Stanage edge, Win Hill, Kinder Scout, Kinder Downfall, Jacobs ladder... A circular walk out of hathersage along stanage to fox house and down again is good, but that won't take all day. You could get the train out to Edale and walk back to Hathersage, that's a good walk, but also you might want to walk from Hathersage to Edale, overnight in Edale then go up kinder scout from there. You can do some good circular walks from Edale or you can walk to Castleton.... talking of which. The hope valley is good too (although somewhat spoilt by the hope cement works!) which is the one south of the valley Edale is in. You can get the bus to Castleton from Hathersage and go up Mam Tor. There's lots of opportunity for pub lunches...

Its worth seeing if you can get a bus to monsal head, on a good day that valley is stunning.

The issue is these aren't players who'll track back so Gerrard will have to be even more disciplined than last year otherwise we'll conceed on the counter multiple times. It's exciting though considering our back up team will be

---------Borini---------

Sterling -------Aspas

-------Suso/Alberto---

Allen--------Henderson

???-Coates/Ilori- Wisdom-Kelly

????

Which is good enough for cups and replacing any injured players. We do need a back up left back and goalkeeper though and I'm assuming Ilori is coming in. That's quite a fast defence in all honesty.

I'm just glad the option exists for people to make the call, I spoke to a very polite young lady who wasn't flustered or condescending in the slightest that I was asking for the filter to be removed, after all there are plenty of adult themed sites outside of porn that may be blocked by their filters as anything that hits the keyword list is automatically blocked.

That said, I can **totally** agree with it on mobile networks. The sheer amount of parents that give their kids a Blackberry or iPhone at a ridiculously young age and then have ABSOLUTELY ZERO FUCKS to give about what they're doing with it or who they're contacting when they're glued to the screen 24 hours a day is unreal. On the ISP side, it's absolutely not their job to parent your children. The government seems to believe that the day we ""protect"" the youngest children from  ""corruption and filth"", i.e. wrapping them so tightly in bubble wrap that they have no idea what the real world is like, is the day their job is done, but on that same day the entire populace will pretty much be told what to eat, drink, think, say and do. We'll all be reduced to the level of that youngest child.

For people who are happy and want to stay put and lay down some serious roots, buying is probably best if you're the type who can adapt to changes and still pay the mortgage.  

I guess my personal (and therefore by default completely subjective) view is that buying a house for reasons of value investment, great value for money or for making a profit in any way is so dogged with potential future variables (interest rates, PESTLE factors etc) that it makes just as much sense to rent. The only thing I think I really lose with renting is possibly a little more money in the short term and less long term security due to the nature of leases.  

I also have a huge mistrust of financial lending institutions and their various modus operandi, which means it would have to be a very cold day in hell before I sign a contract with any of the banks that keep getting away with murder (some literally).  

We just decided that we'd rather put our money into re-educating ourselves, not having children and making sure we enjoy our 40-50 years that we have left by being as free as possible - we just see families and home ownership as two massive ball-and-chain scenarios - that may change and it's not by any means what anyone else should do, but we have some unique circumstances which prevent some of those things from happening anyway, so it makes sense for us. (If anyone is interested I am training to be a pilot and my SO is training to be a counsellor/psychotherapist).

Di Matteo is great and credit to him but we won it with the ground Jose set within the club. Turning players into not just better players bu also that final mental winning attitude.
I think he said something like: ""From now on you all will dedicate your football and social life as winners. I want you to always think like winner act like a winner...""

Many people can´t see this mostly non chelsea fans. But when I saw some on this subreddit claiming Mourinho would hurt our club because of the Real Drama I got very frustrated that people don´t know what he meant to Chelsea and will mean. We would be nothing without Mourinho period.

true,bcash,null,null,"It's worth pointing out there are significant statistical flaws in all these house price indexes (some are worse than others, of course, I can't think of anything wrong with the Land Registry figures - but these are usually given less prominence in the press).

Some significant problems with this: the use of ""average"" - they mean mean price, this means the average is overly influenced by the top of the market, e.g. a £20,000,000 mansion going on the market for £25,000,000 will be a significant rise to the ""average"" regardless of the rest of the market.  (A better statistic would be to use the geometric mean, it accounts for such things.)

Also the use of ""asking"" price.  Spring/summer months are traditional estate agent fishing seasons, it's easy to add 10% to an asking price to see what happens... can always take it down later if you need to (and such later reductions aren't in Rightmove's figures, they only could new listings...)

So, to get to the point:  Yes, be angry with the powers-that-be for creating a housing bubble.  It's a massive scandal really, a whole generation being impoverished and being denied the most basic of human rights (the right to a family life) just to keep the whole charade going.  But the numbers being reported in the press are still useless for any serious analytical purposes.  Even the graph on their own website looks flatter than the text of the article would make you believe: [http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/house-price-index/national-trends-4](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/house-price-index/national-trends-4)

Back to Rightmove:  It's worth noting that in 2006 their index passed £200,000 for the first time; at the time the Land Registry average was £160,000.  In June 2013 their index passed £250,000; the Land Registry average?  £161,458!  [Source](http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/market-trend-data/public-data/hpi-background)

So, according to the mainstream media:  ""House Prices up 10% in SIX MONTHS!!!""  According to the largest set of data, prices are up £1,458 in seven years... tells a different story doesn't it? [*]

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; 1) They don't work, but lure parents into a false sense of security so they don't spend time with their children to supervise and contextualise their online experiences.

I think I've sat down with my children and explained the ins and outs of both sex and the benefits and risks of online activity. The computers are in shared living spaces, but my 9 year old daughter assiduously saved up for a year and half to buy an iPod Touch - good for her, but I don't want her having unlimited access to the net on the thing, and I certainly don't want to be breathing down her neck all the time. The combination of having conversations with some limited filtering is a pragmatic belt-and-braces approach. 

&gt; 2) The account holder still gets to apply them, allowing for example an abusive adult to block sites that might help out a child or spouse in trouble.

Someone that abusive simply won't give people unsupervised access to the computer. 


&gt; 3) They always overblock, damaging legitimate businesses and sites. And given most censorlists are bought in, they often censor sites on religions or atheism, homosexuality, sex education, basic gaming boards etc etc.


Something like OpenDNS https://www.opendns.com/home-solutions/parental-controls/ does a pretty good job at providing very granular controls with high, medium and low default settings. 

&gt; 4) They send a message that sites discussing sexuality need to be kept away from the public sphere, which isn't actually very healthy in the long run.

Again, decent filters manage to distinguish between site discussing sexuality and showing goatse - I know because when my daughter was interested in finding out a bit more about transexuals (a male cousin is  about to become a she) she could find the stuff she was interested in.

&gt; 5) They push anyone after this material into piracy.

What material? Porn? doubt it. If anyone was that keen they'd find a way to get to it. The filters are really only suitable for avoiding accidental access, rather than stopping concerted attempts.

People need to stop thinking the world owes them something and accept that they have a part to play in helping the country with getting back on its feet economically, if this means pay cuts and freezes then so be it, if we don't do it now there will have to be even more drastic measures later when the interest payable has climbed even higher.",0,1371510877,null,0,false,0,cakv3bg,t3_1gicph,t1_cakv3bg,t1_cakuq33,null,1430776109,-2,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,-2

To address the China poke; they didn't just suddenly decide to block half the internet one morning. This is exactly how it started. You are right of course. Yes, we are perhaps years away from that happening here. Yes, the Chinese systems are far more widespread and sophisticated than our own currently are, so directly comparing the two is silly. 

However, does this precedent not present a serious concern for you though? The fact that our government and courts willingly hand over control of unlimited nationwide censorship to a group of third-party, foreign businesses without oversight troubles me greatly.

The slippery slope is already evident. First it was only by court order that things could be blocked, now it is any site that the US media conglomerates want on the list, no approval needed. Then we get this Claire Perry shooting her mouth off about blocking all the porn.

This latest revelation from her strikes me as a classic positional negotiation tactic. Taking the extreme position initially, knowing it will be rejected in order to make your actual demand seem more reasonable and make the subsequent offer look like a compromise.

true,Girlwithnousername,,Proud 2nd member of STFC Official Fan Club. Go the oranges!,"I've only done two gym stints in my life so I'm hardly an expert, but I hope this may help. 

1. Find a friend who really is deeply into going to the gym, is committed and strong-willed. My previous allies were a former brother-in-law and a former best mate who has seen me in some of the worst states known to mankind. 

2. Try to sign up to the same gym as them and agree nights to go together. 

3. Spur one another on; measure progress. Make it someone who's not going to care about unpleasant sweaty states too. 

4. Try to choose a gym that isn't full of Barbies and Kens if you can. It's not going to help your ego (initially) if it is. If that's all you have available then try different times, weekdays etc until you find a good fit. My gym is empty at 7am, and whilst I loathe mornings with a passion, there's probably only three of us there (*was*), and the other two are just fitness fanatics (which in itself can be motivating to watch). 

5. Look at the classes the gym run in addition to normal workouts. E.g., never actually got round to doing it, but I was potentially well up for kickboxing lessons (I really need to go back there for this purpose actually). 

6. Get a high-beat gym playlist; try to make it tunes that you are very familiar with. If you're having to figure out what's coming next in a set of beats, your concentration will sway, your focus will sway and it will become a chore instead of something you just *do* without thinking about it.

7. For the love of god, listen and ask ALL the questions during your gym induction. 

8. If you forget what the instructor tells you or they only cover a third of it (hi to the idiot who assumed that because I have breasts, I wouldn't be using any weights), ask the guys/gals who do seem to be using it properly for advice when they finish on the piece of equipment. Failing that, ask for another induction, point out what they didn't cover before; after all, you are paying them. 

9. Get solid advice on how to avoid injuring yourself during your induction. If you don't keep up the momentum of going on a regular basis, you may as well just burn £1,000 whilst sinking a Maccy D's and a few pints of lard. 

10. Be prepared to be bored. But offset it with the good. Get to know your own breathing patterns and suchlike. Out of breath walking up that hill usually? Within two weeks it'll barely occur to your body that it's the slightest bit of a struggle. Make sure you keep a mental check on those accomplishments, you're going to need them if the process bores you and you start to resent it (it's probably 75% of people who chuck away their gym membership after the initial month or two burst).

11. Talk to all of your friends about it. Some will creep out of the woodwork who know extraordinary amounts and who can help tailor your personal fitness goals. 

Sincerely, a girl who really needs to force herself to start going back again but struggles with the utter boredom of it all (plus is a bit broke). ",0,1371513147,null,0,1371513552,0,cakvv6b,t3_1gj6t0,t1_cakvv6b,t3_1gj6t0,null,1430775674,6,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,6
