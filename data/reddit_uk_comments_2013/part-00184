I've got Lamela and Chadli playing as inverted wingers. The drawback is this will really narrow our team's play. However, having Eriksen play in the CAM will allow them to pass out of any failed forays into the box. This unpredictability will let us properly feed Bobby Soldier up top.

2-0 up? Bring on Dembele and Holtby. If we need to swap out our CB's give Chiriches a shot. Maybe play 5 back?

1-0 down? Bring out Lennon, Siggy, and Holtby for Townsend, Chadli, and Eriksen.

true,Mr-Ed209,yorkshire,Teeside,"The DPS is massively fucking flawed nightmare to deal with anyway and puts the landlords/agents in the driving seat.

Last year there was a dispute between myself and the landlord/agency as to charges made on my deposit. They were attempting to charge me for cleaning costs (stained carpets etc) even though the flat was in a dire state when i moved in. I told them if they can prove that the damage didn't exist before i moved in i would be happy to pay the charges. They knew they couldn't but still refused to release my deposit. Now in this case, the DPS is supposed to act as a 3rd party and review all the evidence and make a final decision on who gets what from the deposit. However they're only allowed to do so if both parties agree to use this 'alternative resolution'. So the agency just kept denying my requests to use it as they knew they had no evidence to win their claim. I ended up having to get a solicitor involved to make some threatening moves which finally resulted in us agreeing to get most of the money back. 
The whole ordeal was definitely the most frustrating thing i've ever had to deal with.   ",0,1378234422,null,0,false,0,cc10vdu,t3_1lmydq,t1_cc10vdu,t3_1lmydq,null,1429602581,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,sn7x,null,null,"&gt;* **Shelvey**: He's looked good in every game except for the three in the league. Hopefully with a good run of games, he will get better. His eye for attack is superb, and his diagonal balls are often fantastic. The downsides are that those diagonal balls are by nature a higher risk of losing possession, and his defensive play looks quite shaky right now. He could end up being a match-winner or a match-loser, and I'll be watching his development keenly.

He also hasn't impressed me in the league, he wasn't impressive for Liverpool in the league either, only impressive against sub-par teams in Europa, I don't know if it's his attitude or he's one of those players who struggles to step up against teams in the prem, he's good technically and has a good pass but he's been very shaky tbh.

&gt;* **Vásquez**: While I'm usually quite good with my La Liga knowledge, for some reason I don't know much about this guy. He didn't have the best of times at Getafe, but looked very promising at Espanyol. That being said, he only spent a year at Getafe before coming here, so it hasn't necessarily stalled his development. We've got a good record of getting the best out of players that need a boost (Routledge anyone?), so I'm not too worried.

I do believe they played him out on the wing, which is why he didn't net frequently, so that's also a boost for us to know that we have someone who can also cover on the wing if need be!

That being said, that may have been an agreement with the company or some kind of write-off we were happy with based with the amount of work that company sent our way, rather than some law, I don't know.  

So, contact the CAB and see what to do. If you end up paying one of them British Gas would *probably* be favourable. Also note that unless this has been to court (quite possibly in your absence) they're not bailiffs and have no right to seize assets. If it has been to court they can not take anything unless they've levied on those assets in a previous visit (although earlier the same day was sometimes possible). Do not sign a levy, it gives you more time but costs you money and may affect your rights. Do not let them into the house under any circumstances, as once they've been allowed in the property they can perform an unsigned blanket levy and come back later with a locksmith (this isn't an option if they never entered). They can enter through unlocked doors or windows due to stupid old bylaws.   

Also note they may try to trick you to letting them in the house. Asking to discuss it over coffee, or use your phone to see if there has been a mistake, or even just stepping inside out of the rain.

They made some good signings, and have more depth than last year, but I think they have have good leadership, and and a real belief around what they are doing and that will carry them far I think.
3. Man United- I think the goals from RVP and Rooney alone will get them far and they aren't bad defensively. I feel like they have many questionable midfield players but they have enough players to rotate if need be. Someone will find form. This also isn't Moyes' first rodeo even if it  is his first at United.

The prosecution:

&gt;Re-examining, Ms Laws asked the girl if Mr Le Vell had ""done anything to cause you to make up these wicked lies"" and if she had a ""vendetta"" against the actor.

Portugal *have* done better admittedly, although the two times you knocked England out it was via penalties which doesn't really suggest a vastly better side. The Euro 2008 absence is a big blot in England's copybook (fucking McLaren). My point was though that both sides are perennial underachievers; Portugal may manage to get a round beyond England but still inevitably go out despite fielding very talented teams (Euro 2004 was an unbelievably shocking missed chance). Both have ridiculous struggles in qualifying. On the whole though I agree that Portugal do have a better record, but they're probably only a slightly better team than England, certainly not ""substantially"" so.

Have you any proof at all it was based on how the public would react?

I thought it had more to do with protecting societies most vulnerable from going thought this sort of experience before finally being denied even living (a two year old, James Bulger in this case, pretty much still a baby who was with him mum a few hours previous)....

&gt; At the trial it was established that at this location, one of the boys threw blue Humbrol modelling paint, which they had shoplifted earlier, into Bulger's left eye. They kicked and stomped on him, and threw bricks and stones at him. Batteries were placed in Bulger's mouth. Police believed some batteries may have been inserted into his anus, although none were found there. Finally, a 22-pound (10.0 kg) iron bar, described in court as a railway fishplate, was dropped on him. Bulger suffered ten skull fractures as a result of the iron bar striking his head. Dr. Alan Williams, the case's pathologist, stated that Bulger suffered so many injuries—42 in total—that none could be isolated as the fatal blow.

&gt; Police suspected that there was a sexual element to the crime, since Bulger's shoes, socks, trousers and underpants had been removed. The pathologist's report read out in court stated that Bulger's foreskin had been forcibly retracted.[23][27] When questioned about this aspect of the attack by detectives and the child psychiatrist, Dr. Eileen Vizard, Thompson and Venables were reluctant to give details; they also vehemently denied inserting some of the batteries into Bulger's anus.[3][18][28] At his eventual parole, Venables's psychiatrist until he was aged 21, Dr. Susan Bailey, reported that ""visiting and revisiting the issue with Jon as a child, and now as an adolescent, he gives no account of any sexual element to the offence.""[3]

&gt; Before they left him, the boys laid Bulger across the railway tracks and weighted his head down with rubble, in the hope that a train would hit him and make his death appear to be an accident. After Bulger's killers left the scene, his body was cut in half by a train. Bulger's severed body was discovered two days later, on 14 February. A forensic pathologist testified that he had died before he was struck by the train.

**With the transfer window reaching its conclusion we take a collective look at our summer signings.**

Fresh from his success with Brazil at the Confederations Cup, Paulinho was our first arrival in early July with Belgium international Nacer Chadli, Valencia captain Roberto Soldado and France international Etienne Capoue also arriving before the season got underway.

Friday saw a further three additions to our ranks in the form of young internationals Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and Vlad Chiriches.

“We have been extremely active, conducted our business early and have made some excellent acquisitions in the market to make us stronger this season as well as giving ourselves greater options across the squad,” reflected our Head Coach.

“We have added tremendous individual quality and this can only help us to come together as a team even quicker. There is huge belief in what we are looking to create here for the future.

""Paulinho is a player we had been chasing for quite some time. He is extremely gifted and versatile, having originally played as a defensive midfielder and now plays a more offensive role.  He has an eye for goal and works hard throughout the 90 minutes, which is decisive in the Premier League.

""We are looking for Nacer Chadli to play mainly on the wings to give us width but he has also played the creative role behind the striker in the past as well as up front for Belgium so to have someone of his versatility is important to the squad. He had a good season in Holland last year and contributed a lot of goals.

""Roberto Soldado's career speaks for itself. He is an outstanding striker with so much Champions League and international experience. He is a goal scorer and has certainly lived up to that reputation in the early stages of this season already. He can only get better as he continues to adapt to his new teammates and the league.
""Etienne Capoue has grown rapidly during his time with Toulouse, he is a wonderful footballer that can play in a variety of positions and will strengthen our midfield following on from Tom Huddlestone's departure. He is a player of international quality and has great all-round ability.

“Erik Lamela is a young player of great dimensions. He is incredibly highly regarded in his homeland and has been on the radar of Europe's biggest clubs in the past so we are delighted to have him here. He has pace, is a huge threat with the ball at his feet and has a good goalscoring record from his time in Serie A as well as providing a regular supply for his teammates. I am sure he will be able to improve even further in the Premier League.

""It was always our intention to strengthen in defence following Steven Caulker's departure. I feel it is important to have four central defenders and Vlad is a great addition in this area. He is solid defensively, a leader and has the quality to bring the ball out from the back, to drive forward and has great build-up play - something that we insist upon with all our centre-backs.

""Christian Eriksen is a wonderfully creative player, who is accustomed to playing at a high level in Europe. He showed at Ajax all of his qualities and ability, particularly in terms of flair and creativity with the number of chances and assists he provided to his teammates. He has great ability to pick a pass and is an excellent link-up player.

""We can look ahead to the season with a real sense of excitement. These new additions will join with our already strong group of talented players and further enhance the quality and spirit that exists within this squad.”

&gt;Abduction of American Sailors, I thought it was believed that they were British sailors who couldn't cope with life on a British ship and didn't serve their agreed time so they were taken back to do so. (Yes I did see where you wrote about the ambiguity of the statement but I couldn't be sure as to what else you were alluding to.)

You're right that there probably were British sailors that deserted to America to avoid service.  From what I understand however, the bigger issue (and the ambiguity I was referring to) was British citizens leaving to the US and serving on American naval vessels and merchant ships, particularly Irish emigrants.  The British didn't acknowledge the right to renounce citizenship while the Americans did (consider the hypocrisy here if one were to attempt to give up American citizenship - Benedict Arnold?).  From what I understand the point of contention is really a conflict about the British not recognizing US citizenship of former British citizens.  Which if you think about it makes sense from the American perspective, who 30 years prior had chosen to renounce British rule.  The history was probably still fresh in their minds.

&gt;Just a little hypothetical for you. Understanding that Britain sent less troops in any battle of the war of 1812 than were present at your average battle in the N. Wars. Then you would know that had we not been fighting anywhere else America would have likely lost.

I completely agree here.  It would be interesting to consider what the outcome of history might have been if the war had elevated to those levels.  I figure that the British never really cared too much about losing the American colonies in the first place because economically it wasn't worth it to hold on or recapture them. That probably didn't change much in the interim between wars. 

&gt;It probably took this war to show the British that their rules were not &gt;infallible and that they had to adapt to their surroundings. Which probably &gt;lead to the tactics used in the Battle of Waterloo.

You know you have a very good point here.  It would be interesting to explore whether the combination of unorthodox wars the British fought on the American continent somehow prepared them for Napoleonic Wars.  Might be an interesting topic to throw at r/AskHistorians

What I find most fascinating about this war, and what I've learned by discussing it with you, is how it is viewed so differently by both the British and the Americans regarding both the cause and outcome and really illustrates the differences in worldview of the two cultures.  Although if you ask me, I don't consider it much of a difference.  I think the Americans just took the independent spirit of the British to its logical end.

Thanks for the enlightening discussion! -Your friend from across the Pond

What you may not realise is that tram is brand new—billions have been spent on re-engineering miles of commuter roads in Manchester and that's the sort of dangerous infrastructure provided for cyclists. They literally knocked down housing to make way for the lines.

That's Ashton New Road, running parallel to Ashton Old Road 100-200 metres apart. I'm sure they could find some space somewhere.

If you lend someone some money, and they pay back what the owe on time, you have not made a loss. You have absolutely no claim against them.

In the situation described, it *might* be fraud, however. They could be prosecuted and fined/jailed. But in any event, you wouldn't get a penny more than the amount you are owed.

I can't think of any situation where you would be punished for breaking a regulation by being forced to pay money to someone who you haven't actually harmed in any way.

true,Magneto88,uk,United Kingdom,"I have to disagree with you. I already stated that politically we're closer to the Europeans, although a better description would be Britain as an island between America and the EU. We're too ring wing for most of Europe and our left wing party (Labour) is hardly when left when you compare them to something like France's Socialists. A big chunk of the EU hates us for constantly disrupting it (another sign that Britain lacks of a European identity - along with the existence of UKIP) and even those that want us in the EU like France love nothing better than to snipe at us - look at Chirac and Sarkozy's antics. We have some similarities to Northern Europeans it is true but we still have our differences...if you look at Southern Europe there is a gaping chasm between those nations and Britain. What do we have in common with Greece, Spain, Croatia or Southern Italy?

Culturally I don't think there is a debate about us being closer to America than Europe. Humour is but one aspect of culture and if you watch things like the Colbert Report or Daily Show, you'll see bitter and dry humour has it's place in America. However focusing upon humour over the immense amount of shared media we have is missing the point. Just look at the colony of British actors in Hollywood and compare that to the amount of British actors that pop up in French cinema, likewise the shortage of French actors in Hollywood. Likewise the sharing of ideas in our books, tv, newspapers etc etc. My French Politics professor made a great point in a class I took with him during the Sarko/Hollande election, think about how much the American Presidential election is covered in the British press, the French one usually passes by with only a few odd news reports by the BBC and short columns in the newspapers. That should tell you all.

There's two gotchas to be aware of.

1. Unless you qualify for legal aid, you won't be able to afford a solicitor, as their fees will swamp any small claim you expect to get back. Solicitor expenses are not passed on to the losing party. So you can expect to spend hours queuing to talk to students in free law clinics to get some sort of advice.

2. Just because you win this doesn't mean you get your money back. You may need to get court bailiffs involved, or to ask the court to take money from their bank account. This can be really difficult if you rented through an agent, and don't have the contact or bank details of the owner. If the person you have dispute with really doesn't have any money, the court might order repayments at a really slow rate, and it can take years to get all the money back.

I went through this with a housing deposit about 3-4 years ago - and then the landlord fled the country. I finally got all money back last year.

Intrestingly what does stop getting crushed is not mixing traffic (and asking drivers to use their eyes ofcourse, and asking cyclists to be more carefull ofcourse).

The safety a helmet offers is greatly exaggerated, it's one reason so many are against compulsion as it seems like a fix to the casual observer, but it avoids the real issues which do genuinely cost lives.

I can see why landlords might resent the high cost of paying an agent but a good agent will do all this and more (including minimising voids) and are good value in my opinion. The facts speak for themselves - in ten years of letting multiple properties I have only ever had one tenant default - and that was only on their last months rent. 

For the tenant I can see that they may think they will get a cheaper deal without an agent - but that is not always true. I can also see that the tenant may feel they can get away with more without an agent to ensure they stick to the contract.

When a decision like this is taken you need to have the absolute majority agree on it. Reading the comments here that is not a case, it is more of a 50/50 or even a 60/40 vote against the idea.

Even if such an idea is good (which is this one), implementing it would divide the community. I can already see someone posting a picture in a hypothetical situation after this rule is implemented who then gets annoyed to find out this rule, you would then get comments on that post both agreeing with him and disagreeing with him as both the sides fight. Then the calling out of mods and the same thing over and over again as the post is deleted.

So even though I agree with it I would strongly advice against it until it becomes such a big problem that close the 85% or 90% of the sub agrees to it.

Second, I think people need to realize what these agreements may or may not entail.  Just because we have some agreement does not mean that we make decisions or go out of our way to make San Jose happy.  That is the same with Real Madrid, and although I believe a lot of people are overreacting, I do think there could be more transparency about the agreement.

Third, I don't think you can blame Spurs for not selling Keane or Dempsey to the quakes.  San Jose has taken a very conservative approach when it comes to the Designated player policy.  Until revenues are increased in the new stadium, finances have been kept at a minimum.  Currently, club legend Chris WondoWlowski (spelling intentional) is the only DP on the squad.  I don't think the quakes were interested or could afford Robbie Keane or Dempsey.  That's just uneducated sour grapes.

Next, about Simon Dawkins, I think we still had/have hopes for him developing into a Premier League player.  At some point, a loan to a Premier League side was necessary to see if his development could continue.

Show me where Spurs have used the media to target/unsettle a San Jose star, have repeatedly talked about the player joining their team, leaked contract information, and publicly held a high-valued number for him.

They are part of phones 4 u, so are legit.

When you get your phone from them:

* They will probably sign you up to some stupid tech support service which will cost you extra. Immediately cancel this, I didn't have any problem doing so.
* Don't forget to log into their site to update your phone number with them once you have it ported from your old phone.
* Initially I had a problem with my credit card company declining shipment of my phone to my work address and they needed confirmation before sending it, this caused a problem because you can't contact a human being through their phone system. However they will send you via email a contact number that gets through to a real person, and their online support does work (eventually).
* Put all the rebate dates into your new phone's calendar so that you get a reminder to send off from them.
* You can send your bills off in normal mail to claim your discount, no need to bother with registered post.

Not gonna bother explaining them really, you will have to take my word for it.

And for the dig to ""step up"" I do what i can, where i can, when i have the time and interest. But yes on r/chelseafc i am a consumer more than a contributer of OC, you mostly seem butt-hurt that easy to access images get more upvotes than articles and other content that people, like yourself, have been working really hard with.

I can understand that, but i think that pics get more upvotes because A) takes far less time and concentration to consume and thus more peaople have time and energy to look at them and B) Any in depth written article will always face dissent, on reddit dissenters downvote. Its sucks balls, but it happens. Few people will disagree with an emotional picture, more will if it is a tactical piece. 

Up/Downvotes is not a measurement of how good a post is, removing the pics for this sub will not change that. Next will be twitter posts. Instagram posts. 

Unless we have a majority of Pic-submissions thats is obviously blocking other content (and i do not feel this is the case) i do not see the problem.

IIRC:

To me, it seemed like the show had a totally different feel in 1-4, which was hard for me to get used to.  I really appreciated the complexity of the season 6 story arc, along with the Trenzalore story arc that started all the way back in Ep 1 of S 5.  When I went back to watch 1-4, some of the plots seemed way too straight-forward, with no mystery or excitement.  There was the occasional plot twist, [but nothing the size of ](#s ""River is Amy's daughter"").  I can see where some people are going with ""Moffet was better as just a writer,"" but it all depends on your point of view.  To me, RTD replaced Moffet, and I honestly don't think his 4 seasons were as good.  Everyone else seems to despise Moffet just because he replaced RTD, just like everybody used to give 11 the cold shoulder because 10 was gone.

* Release seventeen, yes seventeen players
    * Four on loan - that's fine, still 13 down.

* Sign 3 players - Drenthe, Bridge &amp; Williams

* Sell two of our best players - one after only a year of his contract served.

*All through out the last four months, we're told that there'll be lots of activity, ""in and maybe out"" towards the end of the window. Last week became ""Three are being finalised for deadline day.*

* Deadline day looms. Two days before we sell a star player.

* Deadline day; we sell a brilliant CB who can do wonders with a little faith in him.

A tweet from Tim Dellor tells us on DL-Day to expect a striker by 11. This doesn't materialise. It emerges two negotiations have also collapsed.

*Now,* I am aware that this sort of business is far more complex than many might realise, and small things can lead to big differences; but I would have thought that our early shopping might have shown some intent to build an excellent squad.

I dunno, I'm happy with the three we've signed - they've been great (although Drenthe didn't do great at Yeovil, I'm lead to believe?), but really, we should have been chasing more big players.

true,energyi,null,null,"I would argue that Barcelona play possession football yet still have a midfield anchor in Busquets. A good holding midfielder can either be a tackler, an interceptor or as you said just provide an option when the team needs a pass to retain the ball (or can do all of these things). 

If I were the Arsenal manager I would have seriously looked into Capoue. He is tidy in possession with quick feet, can pass, reads the game well to position himself to receive the ball and intercept, and is strong and quick to recycle possession. The fact that he is French (Wenger probably follows his home league) and you can offer Champions League football this season makes me even more surprised that you didn't go for him. I would place him ahead of one of your midfield 3 simply because of the type of player he is. Having 3 creative central players is good but a holding player allows the others to do their thing creatively with less discipline and fear of a counter attack. This is exactly what Scott Parker was so good at for us when Modric and Van Der Vaart were able to play how they wanted whist Parker did the less glamorous yet vitally important defensive work. With him in your team the more attack minded midfielders could be rotated more which would help fitness levels during the long season of multiple competitions.

So often when Arsenal concede goals it looks to me that it was because of the lack cover given to the back 4 by the midfield rather than the defenders messing it up. It makes your back 4 look like they are to blame but if you watch replays it is because the midfield 3 all prefer to attack and not do their defensive work. Arteta is clearly not a defensive player, if anything he is surely some sort of deep lying playmaker or a jack of all trades. Jack Wilshere likes to get stuck in but is not defensively minded at all and is more suited to pressing high up the pitch than tracking back to defend his own half. 

Having a proper defensive midfielder would also give Wenger another tactical option to suit his plan to the opposition or change it during a game by making a substitution. Having many of the same type of player doesn't give you that flexibility. When playing against teams like City and Chelsea (especially away from home) with all their attacking talent it's usually a good idea to try and counter attack more or they can tear you apart at the back even if your back 4 is world class. Look how Mourinho set up the team against United, Chelsea completely shut United out and the only way it could have gone better for him was if one of Chelseas counter attacks had produced a goal for 3 points. If Chelsea had been set up to attack it's likely United would have tore them to shreds at the back (as they often do to teams at Old Trafford), instead RVP was almost silent all game and they rarely looked dangerous.

I'm not saying all this just to slag off Arsenal. I really do think this (along with another striker) would be the best way to improve the team.

Their issue is and has been the same for a few years now, heart of the defence and covering midfielders. How Koscienny got away with his horror show against spurs beggers belief while Mertezaker is too slow and cumbersome(although I do have him in my FFteam). Their best defensive players are Vermaelen and Diaby whose injury records aren't great.

Spurs as you said will come good but we have to see how all these imports acclimatise to the English game. It's quicker, more physical and will get a hell of a lot colder as the months go on. Chelsea and Man City may have similar issues, but the main core of their sides will be made up of players that have been in the UK for a few years.

I rate Moyes but think he'll struggle with the pressure he's under this season. If he holds onto the job, he'll, unfortunately, do well but I reckon this season will be a struggle. 

Now is the time for Rodgers to lay down a marker. He's kept the majority of last season's first team squad, losing only 5 players. 2 sold, 2 loaned out, 1 retired. He's brought in 8 players where only 2 or 3 will be definitely taking a first team spot (RW, GK, and possibly CB even after Skrtel's great game last weekend). But now there is real quality in depth, so that an injury or long term suspension wouldn't be as potentially harmful.

Right now we're sitting pretty at the top only team that still has 100% record and one of only 3 not to taste defeat along with chelsea and everton. We more than likely won't finish in 1st but as long as we progress from last season finish as high as possible and qualify for Europe through the league, while making a damn good challenge for the Champions League, most of us will be happy.

However, I think you're a bit wrong about our need for a DM. I'd typed out a detailed response to you, but I mistakenly closed the page so this hasty reconstruction will have to do. I can respond to any questions you have.

Here goes:

Unlike in 2010/2011 when we had wingers and strikers(Nasri, Arshavin, Van Persie and Fabregas) who could retain posssession, our current crop(walcott, Podolski, Giroud) are very terrible at that. They don't help keep the ball as much as they're constantly running into channels waiting for release.

This means that the burden of ball possession *must* be borne by all the midfield. We used to play like Barca and have Song as our quality DM, but an evidence of our diminished ability to keep possession is that he was pushed into the CM role and went from an average of 2 assists per season to 14 in one season.

We went from a 4-3-3 with a DM to a 4-2-3-1. Ball possession typically involves a lot of interchanging mobility and so when an attack breaks down our midfield two can often be out of position. Its not that they can't/don't want to defend, it that their starting position makes it hard for them to do so, allowing other teams what looks like a free run at our midfield.

**Summary: A DM only works for Arsenal if we can afford the luxury to devote one spot on the team to a player that only defends. This can only happen if our Main striker and wingers can *all* help keep the ball, like Arshavin, Nasri, Fabregas, and Van Persie used to do. Once we have that even Arteta could play DM and there wouldn't be much of a problem. Our current forward line can't do that so we need that midfield position for ball retention**

*Future Speculation: To be fair, some of our best play as a team in the Wenger era did come when we used a system with a DM in from of the defense and it seems he always tries to return to that. My thinking is that this is why he got Ozil and was also looking for a techincally proficient striker. If he can get that striker, then he'll start looking for a DM in earnest and shift our system back to a DM oriented one. As of now we don't need one.*",0,1378257244,null,0,false,0,cc190lf,t3_1llhfa,t1_cc190lf,t1_cc17a9x,null,1429598709,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Because the Typhoon was designed as a dogfighter, with the massive stresses on the airframe that involves, it's almost strong enough anyway. It would need thrust vectoring to handle the landings and the difficult bit there is actually the control software, not the modification itself, but the Typhoon was designed with that as a possible upgrade in mind anyway, so it can already handle thrust vectoring if it's added. 

Arrested landings don't need *too* much strengthening, just a way to anchor the arrestor hook. Without the need for it to be flung forwards with a catapult, there isn't a massive amount of redesigning to do.

Google 'navalised Typhoon' and there's a load of info about it for you to find out more.

The F18 and Rafale are cheaper per unit, but they'd both still need catapults. Which is why, if fitting the new carriers with catapults is cost prohibitive, you've got to stick with the F35B *or the navalised Typhoon*.

Actually - there is one other alternative to the F35B or a navalised Typhoon, the Saab Grippen. 

The RAF has a couple already to train test pilots and for red flag air to air combat training. That's not quite as capable a plane as any of the others, but do fit the requirements better than the Hornet or Rafale for a similar cost.

At the moment I'd put money on the F35B actually sticking it out, with the Typhoon second choice, Grippen third possibility, and the Hornet and Rafale unlikely unless they're offered very cheaply as part of some kind of wider deal. 

It's pretty much going to be the F35B. But if that *does* get cancelled, it'll be the Typhoon and no cats.

Defoe Soldado Holtby

Subs: Lennon (50-60') Kaboul, Sandro, Lamela, Capoue

I like a 4-3-3 that can drop into 4-1-3-2. With some attacking firepower, it gets off to an aggressive start, forces an opponent to chase.  It plays more possession- driven, and with the fluidity that AVB seems to instill, it can go 4-4-2 or 4-1-3-2 (Holtby drops in behind strikers), 4-2-3-1 (sub Sandro for striker), or a few other combos.  Holtby is left footed, quick, aggressive and can be left to roam a bit, and pester a defense into opening lanes.  I think he may make for a better forward than midfielder.  Also, we can counter quickly...which has been lacking thus far.  Interchange with Lamela, same effect.  I like having 2 strikers on the pitch to split defenders, overlap diagonals, and crowd the keeper back to his line.  To me, one striker is too easy to mark.

We're at the point where a Moffat-esque long-game plot arc would be a **luxury**.  That's saying something.

I don't remember who wrote it, but there was a comment in this subreddit a long time ago that really pointed out the difference between the RTD and the Moffat eras, and it centered on how RTD's stories were grounded in reality, citing how in *Turn Left*, the Doctor's absence actually leads to internment camps being set up in the UK.  In the Moffat era, the Doctor erases himself from history with, apparently, little to no consequence (or at least those consequences are never elaborated upon).  RTD's Who-niverse is far more tangible, and I think it will go down as being better for it.

There's also a lack of a psychological element in the one-offs.  My favorite episode of all time, even above *The Family of Blood* and *The Doctor Dances*, is *Midnight*.  It's a completely isolated tale starring just the Doctor against an unnamed villain, but it's one of the most compelling episodes there is, for the sheer ingenuity of it.

If I were against Spurs or Man United (especially of last season) I'd get the team to absorb pressure and hit them on the break when they press high, pacey players would be necessary here. Against Arsenal or Swansea I'd disrupt their passing rythm by pressing as soon as they entered my teams half and counter their pace by not pushing the back 4 up too high (we all know what pacey players like Dyer and Walcott can do when running in behind defenders). I'd go for high energy and quick passing/counter players here like Dembele, Wilshere, Ramieres (of Chelsea) or Gerrard. Against weakers teams I'd allow the team to express themselves a bit more with higher fluidity and more creative players to break down park-the-bus tactics (not that weaker teams always do that against tough teams).

Obviously these different systems require different players and I'd pick based on suitability for the roles required assuming I had every player fit and on form. Wenger seems to prefer his own way of playing if he has a fully fit squad no matter the opposition. I suppose it comes down to personal preference of management style.

I also disagree on your statement that Paulinho would be an upgrade on Wilshere/Ramsey/Arteta. He's a class player who can score goals but Ramsey and Wilshere have the potential to be Britain's Xavi and Iniesta and Arteta plays a very different game where his tactical nuance is more important to us than what Paulinho has to offer. I believe Capoue was on Arsene's radar for a while, but he seemed to lose interest after January (I don't really understand why). 

Signing Ozil does more for our club than the others, and I think over the seasons he'll prove his worth and more.

Also Assad will still have Sarin so post intervention if he uses it again (which he would, out of defiance and out of desperation as his conventional army would have been damaged) the US would be honour bound to double down.

Dembele on this form arguably shouldn't have started.  Paulinho looked overmatched in terms of the pace of the game, which isn't surprising given the languid pace of the game in Brazil.  AVB took off Dembele for Defoe, even though it was obvious to all that we needed more creativity in the middle of the park.  And he put on Lamela (much needed) for Townsend, who was perhaps the only player up until that point looking like unlocking the game for us.

I appreciate that at the Emirates, AVB actively chased the game whilst Wenger sat back and defended.  That is a win in itself, and given the margin of victory, a not at all shameful result.

If some new acquaintance is recounting an anecdote and some of the details don't add up, giving me reason to doubt them, I can carefully ask further questions which explore the story - giving the person the opportunity to explain the parts which don't make sense, or trip themselves up with their lies. 

I can do this because I don't have any investment in proving them right or wrong - they're someone I've only just met and I only want to get to know them honestly. If the story is worth them telling me then I want to understand it properly, but if it's a fabrication then I want to establish that to my own satisfaction, so I know not to trust this bullshitter in the future.

In our court system, none of those charged with impartiality are allowed to ask questions.

It is the job of both prosecutor and defence to prove the other side wrong and, as much as the prosecutor will deplore these tactics when used on a rape victim, they won't hesitate to do the same if they're trying to disprove the alibi of an accused armed robber.

There are [numerous documented British miscarriages of justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_miscarriage_of_justice_cases#United_Kingdom) - when we discover that a copper lied and fitted up the accused, we don't denounce the prosecuting barrister, ""it's disgusting that you held up this police officer as an honest witness, and allowed an innocent man to be convicted - how could you have done such a thing?""

I *think* that there's an inquisitorial kind of justice system -

Especially Clara who had so much potential to be so interesting. He kind of develops the Doctor, but he keeps teasing me with really vague information about the Time War that never goes anywhere.  
A lot of his companions weren't much on their own and were really only interesting because the Doctor made them that way. And I definitely agree that the plots are getting stupidly complicated. He takes one plot and twists it and twists until it's almost impossible to follow.  I feel like the River Song thing has gotten way out of hand, when there are other things that could have been equally as interesting that got pushed to the side.

On the other hand, though, I really love him in Sherlock.

I thought the situation was that PSG signed Silva who immediately told the press that he didn't want to play with Sakho and that Ancelotti should pick Alex instead. I thought that was pretty outrageous from a slightly tubby primadonna who struggles keeping himself fit (albeit the best centre half in the world) to say that just after arriving at a club. PSG showed Sakho no loyalty too, the best talent to come out of their youth academy since God knows when, a PSG fan and their captain before all the money came in, shunted out in favour of a 31 year old on the whim of someone else. I don't really blame him about complaining to be honest, PSG's such a madhouse it basically encourages that sort of behaviour.

You're right about his concentration being an issue, and he doesn't accelerate well although he's not slow when he gets into his stride. I'm sure our fitness staff can sort that out, and if you compar eour team spirit to PSG's, they're absolutely miles apart, that'll make a real difference to his behaviour I feel. I don't think we'd have signed him if our scouts didn't believe he had the drive to continually improve his game.

true,yabyum,,"I'm a drinker, a thinker, a smoker and a toker","**Spartacus: A rebel without a cause, staring Johnny Depp**

A surprisingly average tale of a white boy who leaves school with fuck all, goes round the country ~~drinking and fucking~~ working as an electrical contractor before falling in love and settling down and starting a family.

For fifteen years, he tries the best he can to what's right for these three women in his life but in the end is overwhelmed by it all and leaves.

Fed up of working for a living, he drags himself through university and gets a management job that involves pointing at stuff, colouring-in drawings and sitting in meetings.

Meanwhile, after a kissing a few frogs of various shapes, ages and colours, he finds one that turns into a princess, a beautiful kind princess, who laughs at his poor attempts of humouring her and doesn't turn into a fuckwit when she's drunk.

- Mark Kermode: This film starts off pretty average but gets interesting towards the end, can't wait for the sequel!
- Mark Lawson: Lacks depth of character and has a rambling plot, its disappointing because it could have so much better. 
- Daily Mail: Its a tale of our times; nice white middle class man goes off the rails and falls a victim of wind farms and immigrants. 

- NME: Good car chase scenes and a great soundtrack not heard since pulp fiction

Your designs seem to only cover a sort of pop-art type style.  You need to appeal to as wide a market as possible.  That means less movie references, and more examples of corporate as well as SME specific design.

Your opening statement doesn't read well. Aside from the grammatical errors another commenter has pointed out, it just doesn't come across as professional.  It sounds like something a student would put together.  Your chosen industry is saturated with competition.  Competition with vastly more experience, and it seems expertise.  You need to differentiate yourself somehow.  Probably price.

We use our graphic design team for anything from putting together trade show posters, web design to the design of our business cards.  I don't see anything on your site that mentions anything like this sort of service.  

Your use of Japanese looks pretentious.  You're not the only person in Edinburgh who has a grasp of Japanese, and I now know your name. When I clicked on the link it just took me to a bunch of pictures, with no explanation.  If you are going to use Japanese, make it relevant. 

Lastly, I am not going to sit in a board room and make the case for using a new graphic design to my own team when your site has swearing (unacceptable in my line of business), and crude language.  It's not professinal.

Considering how dangerous sarin is, and the fact that Al Qaeda are in the area, it is a danger to the US/EU. With terrorists, there is no target to directly strike as shown in Afghanistan, and with most chem weapons being colourless and odorless, they will be very easy to smuggle. As shown in the link above, if sarin starts to be produced worldwide, any container the size of a sports bottle becomes a potentially deadly weapon capable of killing hundreds of people. 

Personally I believe that the civil war shouldn't be touched as it's hard to determine the ""right"" side, but the known chem weapon facilities, stockpiles etc should all be destroyed.

true,Werevark,eccleston,Eccleston,"I'm exactly this way; the episodes Moffat writes are generally amazing; The Doctor Dances, Silence in the Library, and Eleventh Hour are amazing, and three of my favorites. I found his first season was solid, with the constant mystery of what the duck is going on with this crack in reality that is appearing everywhere, originally noticed in Amy's bedroom. But after his first season, the arc of a season became remarkably frustrating to plot and follow; not because it was complicated, but because of how scattered it was.

There became so many episodes that just seemed 'there'. A friend tried to point out how must stronger the plots are in Moffat's writing, pointing out as an example how Matt Smith was actively trying to figure out the mystery of Amy's baby. So I looked at the episodes, and it genuinely made no sense. In Curse of the Black Spot literally nothing is mentioned about the situation. Doctor's Wife was the same. Rebel Flesh; we learn what's going on! One episode out of three ain't bad. Strong potential arc. Good Man Goes to War was awesome, with an amazing twist done well. Counting the two-parter, that's three straight plot-related episodes. In Let's Kill Hitler, they kind of learn the fate of Amy's baby? They knew who she was, but at least now we know how she falls in love with the Doctor...five minutes after killing him. Night Terror's has no relation to the baby, the Silence, or anything. Girl Who Waited gives us an awesome potential growth for Amy, but nothing is made of it; she's the same woman after the episode. The God Complex was really cool with interesting explorations of fear and piety, but no noticeable growth from anyone or information gained. Closing time was awesome, but had no relation to Amy's baby, but it did have the Doctor's arc, so it's cool. The finale is the finale, even I couldn't screw it up.

There just seem to be so many episodes that have nothing to do with a character's arc, the seeming series' arc, or anything. It really just made the whole experience 'just another episode', and that got insanely worse with Moffat's third season.

&gt; Mr Hammond said he hoped that a number of those leaving the slimmed down regular forces would join the reserves and ""help change the ethos"".

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Do you believe Shaq holds a place in our strongest U-21 side (with loans and without)?

Without loans I see the strongest front three as:

      Pritchard - Kane - Falque

Perhaps you could argue that Falque shouldn't see time as he clearly won't break into the senior side in which case it becomes Shaq on the right until McEvoy returns from injury (assuming Townsend is now completely a senior player).

Granted Pritchard is on loan (as is Falque) I think the wings are a bit bare at youth level and Shaq can cover either.

&gt;Granted the player is showing ability at such a young age, what is the appropriate time to loan someone like this out, keeping in mind Coulibaly has 
seen a loan at a similar age.

Give him a full season at U-21 level again and let's see if he can make it his bitch. If he can then lets get Swindon on the phone.

&gt;Do you believe Shaq has the potential to crack the first team?

Too early to tell. At only 18 years of age we probably need to wait 3-4 years to see where he is at. He needs to be playing in the championship in 2 years I would think to be tracking properly.

I live in zone3 and share a 2 bed flat (620pcm inc bills and cleaning,) my travel cost to z1 is 136 a month direct to z1 near the office, however if i was less lazy and did a 30 min walk from london bridge, i could get a season ticket for about £87.20 a month.

I used to live in barking (z4) which is awful however it was cheap (£400pcm inc bills, sharing with 2 others), and the travel cost was about £150 a month. 

However when i was there i was looking at things along the c2c line - there were a few shares for 300-350pcm inc bills on the train line , with a travel cost about £200. That's into fenchurch street though, so you have to still get from there.

Also bear in mind that walking to zone2 and getting the tube from there is WAY cheaper than travelling into zone1 is - so you might save money by getting a travelcard for only to z2 and walking (or getting a bus, which are free with a travelcard).

Everton, under Martinez, are starting to build a style of play which is largely full of possession with a slow build up - much like the style which this current Chelsea team are accustomed to. Lukaku himself has said that he needs to improve aerially making runs into the front and back posts and he will have a big chance with players like Baines and Coleman playing those balls into him. Consequently, this loan move is extremely favorable for both parties.

But surely working for less than minimum wage is wrong, surely any job taken by the unemployed in this scheme is a job that could be an actual paid job, surely the number of real jobs will decrease if free labour is available.

It could give experience to the unemployed person, it could give them the motivation to get out in the morning and into a working routine. It could also be abused with ""workers"" being treated poorly and having no choice but to comply or lose benefits and turn to crime or starve.

I'd, begrudgingly, do 12 hours a week which works out as about minimum wage. But I'd want to see a proper system set up which treats claimants fairly, and puts them all into this ""work"" at say, 3 months. From my experience with this kind of thing though, people would just be sent to a provider where they'd just hang around in the kind of groups people cross the road to avoid, doing nothing actually productive, but needing to be there so they can sign something at the start and the end of the day.

I don't believe that the employment situation is improving, I don't believe it will and I think there should be a drastic change involving the dissolution of the JCP/JSA and have it replaced with a Green Party style [citizen's income](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec#EC730) - There should be a change in perceptions about the unemployed, this country does not need every single person that is able to, to work.",0,1378292603,null,0,false,0,cc1h20m,t3_1lpbjj,t1_cc1h20m,t3_1lpbjj,null,1429594887,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I was really surprised when I saw this in portuguese news (I'm portuguese) but being a Spurs fan I thought it was great to have Ceballos in the portuguese league. Arouca are quite the underdog side but they are seen as a rather surprising team. Just two years prior to their ascent to the first league they were predicted to finish last but managed to grab the fifth place. The season after that, still being contenders for relegation, they managed to secure their presence in the league with a 13th place finish. Last season again they impressed getting promoted with a 2nd place finish. They are seen as a very spirited, even if lacking quality, team. Their debut against Sporting CP didn't go well (having lost 5-1) but that was part due to Sporting's great quality playing (which is the complete opposite of what they showed last season) and part due to the fact that it was Arouca's absolute debut in the premier league. Since then they've lost another (which was expected) and won the other.

In conclusion, I'm hoping for some surprises from them since they always seem to make the most out of low expectations and I think it might be great for Ceballos because of the high spirit and the collective mentality (rather than a couple star players) that runs in the team.

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/17/private-firms-data-hospital-patients

&gt; On Monday the government slipped out the news that private insurer Bupa was approved to access England's ""sensitive or identifiable"" patient data, housed centrally by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). It is now among four private firms that have passed the government's vetting procedures.

&gt; The charging structure for ""bespoke patient-level extracts"" was revealed when HSCIC put up a ""cost calculator"" to work out how much prospective customers would pay for sensitive hospital data. **The ""indicative fee"" for a full set of 20 years' inpatient data was about £8,000 including £140 to make the records identifiable.**

&gt; On the information centre's website, the Data Access Advisory Group says it ""considers applications for sensitive or identifiable data"". Once they have been approved, organisations have to apply to extract identifiable NHS data.

http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/private-companies-set-for-access-to-patient-data-for-just-1/20003879.article

&gt; The body’s chief data officer has revealed he wants to reduce the costs for companies to access NHS datasets, from around £20,000 to £30,000 currently, to just £1.

&gt; NHS England said the data would be used to identify where improvements and efficiencies could be made in the NHS and that only approved companies would have access to the data.

**What is the data?** 

From Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre: http://www.hscic.gov.uk/dlesaac  
(However this should be technically under the new / transformed ""Care Episodes Service"").

&gt; What is personal confidential data?

&gt; Personal confidential data is data in which individuals are clearly identified, or there is a high risk of individuals being identified.

&gt; This includes patient identifiable data, such as:

&gt; * NHS number
&gt; * Name
&gt; * Address
&gt; * Postcode
&gt; * Date of Birth
&gt; * Date of Death

&gt; Personal confidential data also includes sensitive data which may include items such as:

&gt; * Racial or ethnic origin
&gt; * Political opinions
&gt; * Religious or other similar beliefs
&gt; * Physical or mental health condition
&gt; * Sexual life
&gt; * Criminal record

Yes and No.  I cycle to work every day, well except for when I had my arm in a sling, due to cycling.  But anyway, my biggest fear is actually other bikes.  Cars are easy to spot and hear, but you can people weaving between you in traffic, as I'm on a hybrid it's harder for me than someone with a fixed, I can't back up.  Yet these guys are really slow in the sprint compared to me.  I find its a lot of these 3 miles each way types who cause me the most brown pants moments, such as pulling straight out into me.

There are many, many elements to road safety for a cyclist.  My injury a few weeks ago was caused by a child running out in to the road, and my proximity to a van who was also doing an emergency stop, making me think it would be smart to bounce on to the pavement.  The piece of equipment that probably made it just a minor fracture was no doubt my gel padded gloves.

My speed before the accident was probably 24mph (I wasn't logging, this is my normal cruise on that flat bit).  By the time I hit the ground it would have been about 6-8mph.  A helmet would have helped if I hadn't pulled off the road, instead hit the kid then over my bars into the curb.

This is why I am in favour of promoting helmet use, but if I was going to make a law, it would be against listening to music with headphones when on anything other than dedicated cycle / bridal path.  I have never, ever once seen a cyclist in London who's got big cans or plugs on who isn't a complete liability.

**TLDR** As cyclists we have to acknowledge we are sharing the road, yes we are often treated as second class, but that doesn't in anyway diminish our personal responsibilities.",0,1378296452,null,0,false,0,cc1holg,t3_1lnf9g,t1_cc1holg,t1_cc14x9l,null,1429594594,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Film production, to my knowledge, is more about the technical aspects of making a film rather than writing one. Getting a solid understanding of literature, story, characters and writing can only help you if you want to move into a creative industry where *you're* the one producing the content. Even if you don't want to write prose forever, take the opportunities your course will give you to develop your style - a flair for the written word always transfers well into scripts.

UEA does have some undergraduate courses that offer screenwriting modules etc, and some brilliant professors, if you want to look at their website.

&gt;I don't think privatisation is some plan of Satan that the Tories have hatched to destroy the NHS, but when it's chosen it needs to be supported by evidence and outcomes.

Ah yes, good old hyperbole.  Any questioning of privatising our healthcare system is dumb liberals being retarded.

&gt;Maybe this really will improve services, I don't know, but refusing privatisation because of ideology is just as bad as rushing towards it for the same reason.

Yeah, you really don't know.  When a hospital works this well, again, the burden of proof is firmly with those who claim there's an even better way.  Why would you even want to test that out?  If it works extremely well why risk breaking it?

As others have pointed out, the worst hospitals, not the best, should have been taken over.

There are also strong points such as the profit motive corrupting the service.  The problem of information asymmetry and inability to choose inherent in a privatised healthcare system.

true,ladfrombrad,eng-yorkshire,bradford.reddit.com,"I asked 1000 Americans to name a British City OTHER than London. That’s not the opening line to a joke or a round on Family Fortunes. I really did…

I received an email over the weekend from Google with a promo code to try out Google Consumer Surveys. So, without really thinking of any serious or practical use of it (and realising that if you select UK for your audience, you get told you can’t proceed, so I had to run it in the USA), I decided to ask 1000 Americans to name a British City other than London.

I live in Manchester… so really, what I actually wanted to find out is how well known my own beloved city is. So, just for fun, here we go…

Top 10 UK Cities (Outside London) According to 1000 Americans

Anyway, here are the top 10 answers:

* Liverpool (15% of respondents answered ‘Liverpool’ – or a misspelt variant)

* Manchester (12%)

* Leeds (4.7%)

* Cambridge (3.7%)

* Bristol (3.6%)

* W(h)ales (3.6%)

* Oxford (3.0%)

* Birmingham (2.4%)

* Bath (2.3%)

* Paris (1.9%) – Yes, Paris

This isn’t the only contest in which Manchester has played second fiddle to Liverpool in the past couple of days. [Sniffle](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23830980), sulk, whine. But perhaps the biggest surprise of the top 10 (apart from the fact that 19 people thought Paris is in a British city and 36 people thought Wales is) is how few people answered ‘Birmingham.’ Could it be the football influence of Liverpool and Manchester? 1% of respondents also said ‘Chelsea.’

[Update] /u/MaddingtonBear, quite rightly suggested over on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1ll8q4/i_asked_1000_americans_to_name_a_british_city/cc0e40i) that Liverpool is actually likely to feature thanks to the Beatles… I didn’t think of that but it’s correct, I’d imagine!

Yeah, I think they could have a fairly comfortable existence on a collective income of 35k.  If they can't they are doing something really wrong. 

It seems like you have very high standards for a living wage, on that 2 people should be able to afford a decent enough place to live and be able to afford to go out everyone once in a while.

true,Elanthius,null,null,"Firstly I just want to say that I am a rule following fundamentalist. I follow all road rules even when they are inconvenient and I encourage everyone else to do so.

Now to answer your question the reason cyclists think it's OK to break the rules is because almost 100% of the time it is. You never get in trouble with the law, you never get yourself in any sort of dangerous situation - actually a lot of people argue that breaking some rules makes it safer, you're astonishingly unlikely to hurt anyone else - especially compared to cars just doing normal ""safe"" car stuff and, quite frankly, you get where you're going faster. The situation in reality is that there's no downside to breaking the rules for the cyclist or any other road user.

The reason for this is that ""the rules"" were deisgned for cars that can kill people with just a moment's inattention or even the slightest mistake from anyone on or near the road. Cyclists are not in the same category. I'm sure a couple of people have been killed or injured by being hit by cyclists but compared to car and lorry injuries it may as well be 0. People don't complain about pedestrians crossing the road when there's a red man showing - well cycling is closer to that than it is to driving a car.

As for most of the accidents that we see these days. They are often caused by cyclists coming up the inside of large vehicles and then getting stuck as it turns left. I suppose there is a general rule about not undertaking but the problem is many (most?) junctions encourage this sort of behaviour by having special cycle paths on the left and then an ASL before the light. So for those specific cases the problem is not that cyclists are impatient but that the infrastructure they are encouraged to ride on is inheritently dangerous. The same sort of thing applies when someone is trying to wobble their way across three lanes of traffic in order to turn right. There's almost no way to navigate a lot of the roads we have safely even though cyclists are actively encouraged to do so.",0,1378299338,null,0,1378300220,0,cc1ia83,t3_1lplb8,t1_cc1ia83,t3_1lplb8,null,1429594314,18,false,londoncycling,t5_2wcdj,18

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"I don't think anyone would dispute cyclists can be total twits in many situations - but the issues of life's lost, or even serious injuries are almost exclusively the fault of a driver, or as a result of a car (iv read stats that range from 65%-85% driver error - often SMIDSU). Factor driver error, a bicycles relative harmlessness (compared to a car), bad infrastructure or lack of any cycling infrastructure into account and you're still pointing the finger at drivers either asking them to give up road space or change their attitudes.

But its tricky - Iv only cycled in London once, and it scared the shit out of me. Idiot cyclists and idiot drivers in very equal measure I would say. But....I wonder how much of the behavior of both parties is as a result of their environment...For example: When I cycled though London I had 3 cars move across my lane within the space of an hour. I don't think this has happened once while cycling in my home town (sleepy Norwich). So im sure in a London environment I would be a very different cyclist to the one I currently have to be in Norwich.

&gt;This is why I am in favour of promoting helmet use, but if I was going to make a law, it would be against listening to music with headphones when on anything other than dedicated cycle / bridal path. I have never, ever once seen a cyclist in London who's got big cans or plugs on who isn't a complete liability.

Could it not be that those who are liability in spite of headphones and not as a result of the headphones? Personally I'm fine with headphones (don't wear them myself unless Im out in the sticks/dirt track. And even then I use only one ear bud). My opinion on the subject is its not the headphones that are the problem, its the volume. Like car drivers who drive with their windows up, and the radio on full I see the person who's at fault and not the gadget.

That said - I too recommend a helmet, lights and not to cycle with headphones...But I don't object to others ignoring my advice as I think its dangerous to place too much importance on the little things when the bigger things (infrastructure for example) are more of a problem that more often than not is drowned out by calls for helmet compulsion.

Anyway - I hope you're fixed up and back on you're bike soon, and the little kid didn't come off to badly.

Humm... 

So I will write what I wrote in the previous post. It seems that maybe making a post with an active example about the ""end game"" setup could be prudent...

""Good game"" / Goodbye to your NHS and personal life data.

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/17/private-firms-data-hospital-patients

&gt; On Monday the government slipped out the news that private insurer Bupa was approved to access England's ""sensitive or identifiable"" patient data, housed centrally by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). It is now among four private firms that have passed the government's vetting procedures.

&gt; The charging structure for ""bespoke patient-level extracts"" was revealed when HSCIC put up a ""cost calculator"" to work out how much prospective customers would pay for sensitive hospital data. **The ""indicative fee"" for a full set of 20 years' inpatient data was about £8,000 including £140 to make the records identifiable.**

&gt; On the information centre's website, the Data Access Advisory Group says it ""considers applications for sensitive or identifiable data"". Once they have been approved, organisations have to apply to extract identifiable NHS data.

http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/private-companies-set-for-access-to-patient-data-for-just-1/20003879.article

&gt; The body’s chief data officer has revealed he wants to reduce the costs for companies to access NHS datasets, from around £20,000 to £30,000 currently, to just £1.

&gt; NHS England said the data would be used to identify where improvements and efficiencies could be made in the NHS and that only approved companies would have access to the data.

**What is the data?** 

From Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre: http://www.hscic.gov.uk/dlesaac  
(However this should be technically under the new / transformed ""Care Episodes Service"").

&gt; What is personal confidential data?

&gt; Personal confidential data is data in which individuals are clearly identified, or there is a high risk of individuals being identified.

&gt; This includes patient identifiable data, such as:

&gt; * NHS number
&gt; * Name
&gt; * Address
&gt; * Postcode
&gt; * Date of Birth
&gt; * Date of Death

&gt; Personal confidential data also includes sensitive data which may include items such as:

&gt; * Racial or ethnic origin
&gt; * Political opinions
&gt; * Religious or other similar beliefs
&gt; * Physical or mental health condition
&gt; * Sexual life
&gt; * Criminal record

You only need to look at what happens to people's data on the Edited Electorial Register to know what will happen next.

If you are worried about this, it might be also prudent to start removing as much long-life data about you from some services as when the ""end game"" starts, you may lose control over it for an extremely long time... Currently, even if you do, the data would be restored after every month. (Because the data requests for it to NOT be stored are reset every month).

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; but the issues of life's lost, or even serious injuries are almost exclusively the fault of a driver

The issue is that a cyclist can (and many do) make manoeuvres which make it very hard for a driver to avoid them.  I nearly hit someone when driving, because it was pitch black, very heavy rain, they had no reflectors, and were wearing a black winter coat.  I only saw him because my indicator was reflecting on something.  He had pulled up alongside me on a tight left turn.  I had no idea he was there, luckily I generally always indicate when turning even when in a filter lane (you aren't required too).  But if it wasn't for that I would have smooshed him in my tiny 3 door against the railings.  There really isn't much space at many of these junctions.

&gt;Could it not be that those who are liability in spite of headphones and not as a result of the headphones? Personally I'm fine with headphones (dont wear them myself). My opinion on the subject is its not the headphones that are the problem, its the volume. Like car drivers who drive with their windows up, and the radio on full I see the person at fault not the gadget.

They are illegal in Germany.  I can not think of anyone who can ride safely in London without their ears.  The fact is many end up delegating all your defconfliction work to the other road users, that isn't right.  As for car users, I don't think that is fair.  Few car users ever pull out by a 30cm to find they have a car trying to overtake them, that they weren't aware off.  Even fewer would be able to have audible awareness for anything practical due to their own air noise.

Some things do come down to infrastructure, but it has a price.  It isn't going to be possible to quickly change things, heck it looks like it isn't going to happen slowly.  Cyclists and Drivers should really take more care of each other.

&gt;Anyway - I hope you're fixed up and back on you're bike soon, and the little kid didn't come off to badly.

So your saying, all I have to do is; Get involved with and reorganise the entire political and economic system of corruption and nepotism.  There's one clearly defined problem, this should be easy! 

I suppose the first thing to do is to decide whether the problem is (as you said) - the fact that getting away with doing things so blatantly an outright illegal is so blissfully easy, or, if it's just a situation of good old corruption.  Then all we have to do is propose alternative situations to the chaps already in charge of everything that will eliminate the issue, then implement them.  These fixed and measurable goals to which we endeavour compliance will be relatively easy to define, seeing as we're so clever as to know what the problem is.  

Now here's the tricky bit.  We are clearly very wise, so checks and balances will be necessary.  I propose we use checks and balances that are nothing like all the other checks and balances in that they will actually function in a beneficial way, be generally effective, and any problem highlighted by our checks and balances shall instigate reactionary action.  That way, whether our defined problem be illegal behaviour *or* corruption, we shall be able to effectively fix the problem with this one swift and mechanically delivered proposal.

I'd also say there are limited cases where it does work, for instance rather than handling all NHS eye check services in hospitals, you allow people to use their local optometrist. That's easier for the patient and cheaper for the health service, and that's money saved which can be spent on other areas of care.
 

One area I am genuinely enthusiastic about (stick with me) is the privatization of medical labs. Many tests are expensive because they take a lot of preparation, or because hospital labs have to buy equipment which for a lot of the time sits idle. With centralized labs there's the capital and the constant demand to massively automate those processes. If you can halve the cost of a lab test, that means GPs have far more leeway to prescribe the test, and the chance that a patient will get a quick accurate diagnosis improves dramatically. And we've seen from DNA testing that halving the cost may well be a conservative estimate of potential cost reductions. Lab tests are also objective- there is a single price, and you can check very easily by sending through pretested samples whether the service actually works.

Of course, the question is whether or not you can trust politicians to make intelligent choices about which services are suitable, and which are not. And in that sense I am just as nervous as everyone else.

    &gt;  
    Couldn't we just assume that the Doctor is observing some point 
    of temporal protocol. In other words the various Doctors can 
    remember the adventure from their previous experiences but must 
    behave exactly as they remember themselves behaving.  To clarify:
    Davison remembers his lines because he's heard them before 
    several times over and now musn't contradict his own history by 
    conflicting with his own memories.  He doesn't share his 
    fore-knowledge with his companions because, as he has stated 
    several times, such fore-knowledge is dangerous. So the poor sod 
    is forced to plod through the same cycle of events at several
    points in his history knowing the outcome but forced to behave as 
    if it's all a big surprise.  The Time Lord equivalent of reruns.
    
    Which means in ""The Five Doctors"" they're all only acting and
    it's just a pantomime.  Doesn't that have the ring of truth?

    &gt; indeed, past regenerations what strictly forbidden except in 
    the gravest 
    &gt; emergencies, that the Time Lords would erase the events from

    Not so.  Drs 1 and 2 remember the events of ""The Three Doctors"" 
    in ""The FIve Doctors"" (2 talks about Omega with the Brig and 1 
    enquires ""Where's the little fellow?"" on encountering 3.)  5 also 
    remembers Omega in ""Arc Of Whatever"".  I still think the simplest 
    and least fussy explanation is that he does remember but has to 
    go through the motions exactly as he remembers from the last time 
    round so as no to contradict his own history. This fits with what 
    he's always said about changing history and the dangers of 
    fore-knowledge.

true,Simoig,BE,belgium,"Marin and Oriol will start a lot of games. Moses is probably more of squad addition but will play a lot more than he did here as Rodgers likes to sub early and rotates every now and then. 

Lukaku is harder to say, he does not yet fit in Martinez style football (but that's what why he is there for), and Jelavic is just as much a proven goalscorer as he is. Romelu has to show progress from day one, combining better, improving his first touch,... and he MIGHT be there number 1 at the end of the season.

Wallace is harder to say, the fact that Inter want him, even on a loan, says how high he is rated, but  Mazzari is probably going to play a 352 so he'll have to take the entire right side of the pitch. Not sure who Inter has got as competition, although Zanetti will probably have the majority of starts on the right.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"The reason we conceded so few goals with Maka is because he was able to win the ball so much and with so few mistakes. That's a combination we lack. Luiz can tackle, albeit may foul quite a tad more but he certainly puts in more tackles and blocks than Mikel and I'd say he's more disciplined in the challenge than Ramires who's the other main alternative. Unless of course we utilise the Bison.

If a CB gets turned and the player has enough pace it simply is a goal, it's what Suarez does phenomenally well as do most other top strikers, being turned by an attacking midfielder is simply not such an issue because you have time to do several other things. There is only going to be a CB available to cover the other if they only play one striker, which does make it important you have a DM who is able to win the ball back. I'm constantly complaining because of the massive compromises each of the players we have yield. Because Luiz may be more adept at winning the ball back, he will be suited to a lot of certain game plans over many other players at DM. The simple fact is the more he's pigeon holed the less help he can be tactically. If we had another CB who could read the game similarly well I'd expect him to play DM far more. He's pretty much our Phil Jones.

Discipline is perhaps the most improved of Luiz's ability and I would have no real worries with Luiz in DM within our Midifield. The reason I would worry is because we lack another highly mobile CB. Highly mobile in the sense of agility and speed being combined with strength (we're not going to put Azpi there a la Bosingwa just because we're playing against Messi).

Finally if you're DM is turned and that's what is causing your team to be massively exposed I have no idea how the hell you're organising your team. If he's being turned by an AM then he's going to be looking for a pass or a dribble, rarely will this not be combined with 1 up front which leads to an immediate close down using one of the CB's whilst the other tracks the movement. Often with the full backs compressing to narrow the passing angles towards the byline rather than the touchline forcing your wingers back further to track the runner, all the while your two centre midfielders should be tracking back, at least one holding for a pass backwards from the AM providing you've set up a 4-1-2-2-1 sort of formation as a separate DM rather than a defensive and offensive pair in CM which is a completely different sort of partnership to the one you alluded to with the introduction of Maka into the argument.",0,1378303338,null,0,false,0,cc1jb7w,t3_1lpd8p,t1_cc1jb7w,t1_cc1gjfm,null,1429593834,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"CM and DM need to be addressed as different arguments here. As a DM I'd argue he is perfectly adept and mightier than anybody else our squad could muster, but as a CM I'd disagree particularly if you are playing a holding midfielder. Currently we do not so far this season. Both of the replies to my comment appear to have confused DM with CM. I suggest a DM which is sitting behind two CM's. Not one of the pair of CM's. Or perhaps two DM's which sit deeper and pull Oscar deeper or KDB or Lampard to pick up the ball from deeper. In either scenario, Luiz is at the deepest part of any possible Triangle.

As for roaming so much, it's rather obvious that he does this when we need inspiration from somewhere and it's quite effective because it essentially gives us an extra body for the first 10 seconds of the move. The positional discipline is intensively coached, as evidenced by Mikel, who more or less completely lacked it before he joined us and now it's almost his only asset.

It's been commented on by many pundits about Luiz's increased effectiveness from DM and his increased ability to affect the game, scoring rather impressive goals and helping to set up many. This is of course aided by the rotation of a CM to a deeper position again. This happening further back on the pitch doesn't afford the same benefit because of the extra man timing simply doesn't allow the move to make use of it when it starts further back. 

&gt;He doesn't get turned as much at CB as he knows not to go launching in to attempt to intercept the ball.

Really? He did it several times against Bayern, also it's not to intercept as such but tackle the player receiving it before he can look up. He gave away a few freekicks against Bayern for doing exactly that, from centre back and I think he picked up his card for doing it.

&gt;when you have the likes of Ramires, Essien and Mikel playing there he just isn't a risk worth taking.

Ramires has no where near the accuracy of long ball distribution of Luiz. +1 Luiz

He arguably covers more ground than Luiz. +1 Rami

Rami was constantly slow on moving up against Bayern, frequently could have pressed a man just receiving the ball and was often sharing the defensive line with the CB's instead of being part of the 1st bank of 4. +1 Luiz

Rami consistently gets sent of more for stupid challenges, or rather consistent stupid challenges throughout the game and over commits at crucial times leading to him not quite being turned but certainly passed. 

&gt;a risk worth taking.

A risk, now that's interesting because I would suggest that playing Ramires consistently as a CM is risky. Very risky. You're relying on his engine as a primary benefit. You're relying on him being more disciplined than usual, certainly more than he would be if he was out wider as a defensive winger or counter attacker. Of course if the game is really, really open, you may reap the rewards massively. But can you cope with him losing the ball every time over the top, or inviting pressure back on you by not pressing defensively but sitting when you need a counter attacking setup to utilise him best?

Mikel, now Mikel is brilliant at interceptions and breaking up extremely dense inter-play. But on the break? Not as confident as you'd like, also lacks the distribution of Luiz, also lacks his tackling ferocity, but is he risky? Nope. He's not whatsoever, he will do exactly what he's told to the letter. He will do absolutely nothing else mind.

I'm not really sure I understand either of your arguments because everything you've touted would make him a worse centre back, and simply put, he's the best defensive player we have, where-ever we should need to be defending from.

true,lovsicfrs,null,null,"&gt;Second, I think people need to realize what these agreements may or may not entail. Just because we have some agreement does not mean that we make decisions or go out of our way to make San Jose happy. That is the same with Real Madrid, and although I believe a lot of people are overreacting, I do think there could be more transparency about the agreement.

I agree with you. What you failed to realize in my responses is that I applied the same logic of those Spurs fans did in their rants. Spurs are RM to SJ when it comes to our agreement. If you want to talk transparency with another club you have an agreement with because things did not go your way, how about you do so in the other agreements you have with clubs first. Would make sense to practice what you preach would it not?

&gt;Third, I don't think you can blame Spurs for not selling Keane or Dempsey to the quakes. San Jose has taken a very conservative approach when it comes to the Designated player policy. Until revenues are increased in the new stadium, finances have been kept at a minimum. Currently, club legend Chris WondoWlowski (spelling intentional) is the only DP on the squad. I don't think the quakes were interested or could afford Robbie Keane or Dempsey. That's just uneducated sour grapes. Show me anywhere that shows the Earthquakes even considered acquiring either player as a DP and I'll reconsider my position. I know for Dempsey, the MLS front office basically arranged for the transfer to Sounders.

Show me when they were offered to the Quakes first. Aside from Dawkins, deals with Spurs and other teams happen way before we even get approached. Instead of being the partner club that we are suppose to be, we get treated like the step child no one wants. Feed all the other children and then see if the step child wants any scraps. Regardless of our FO deciding to stick with one DP (no one else would really be fit to be an additional except perhaps Goodson), the opportunity was never presented for Keane or Dempsey.

&gt;Next, about Simon Dawkins, I think we still had/have hopes for him developing into a Premier League player. At some point, a loan to a Premier League side was necessary to see if his development could continue.

Anyone with eyes could see that this was not the case. Never did Spurs even give him a chance to do more but ride the bench. He had a few subs with Villa and then what? Nothing. Instead of selling him to a team that wanted/missed him and where he wanted to go in the first place, they loaned him out again to sit. If you wanted to see him develop further, why not continue a loan deal at minimum with a club he is going to have significant play time at. On the flip side, you could have easily sold him when SJ was willing to buy him from Spurs. Some partnership.

&gt;Show me where Spurs have used the media to target/unsettle a San Jose star, have repeatedly talked about the player joining their team, leaked contract information, and publicly held a high-valued number for him.

All of this just sounds like a bunch of whining. No one respects Marca, so to even complain about them publishing articles about the likes of Bale and Modric are really sad. The players wanted to leave to play for Real Madrid. That's the bottom line. If they wanted to stay at Spurs they would have done so. To blame it on the media or another club is just plain sad and out of touch with reality. 

&gt;So, after you ignorant, uneducated, and aggressive request for information, there it is. I hope that's a sufficient answer for you.

Perhaps you'd like to take off those Spurs covered glasses and realize that when things don't go your way crying about it doesn't solve a thing. As I said before, the Spurs have acted no different than Real Madrid when it comes to their supposed partnerships. If you are going to cry about big ol Madrid treating you badly and buying up your players, then perhaps you should evaluate your own partnership policy with other clubs. Otherwise you continue to be apart of the problem and look like a cry baby ass club. But then again, this is Spurs we are talking about.

&gt; **the only way of getting people to cycle is to clamp down hard on minor cycling infractions through punitive measures like fines**.

Can you not see how that is completely stupid a solution or worse? Firstly, it's counter productive because who are very likely to commit cycling errors? **New cyclists.** If in their first month they've racked up 200£ in fines do you think they will likely continue?

Secondly and most importantly the real solution to getting people cycling is to improve road safety because it scares the shit out of people including very experienced and proficient cyclists:

1. build cycle lanes,
2. punish bad drivers. Scrap lenient bespoke driving offences like careless driving and go with the more appropriate ABH, GBH, manslaughter and murder.
3. actually pursue violent behaviour directed at cyclists (every person who rides on the roads will have a story),
4. improve the driving test to make sure drivers understand cyclists and the laws like leaving a car's width whilst overtaking,
6. more secure bicycling parking,
7. be more active against cycling thieves,
5. **do something about the 200 yearly deaths and 2000 serious injuries**.

true,cacafogo,num5,,"This may not be the best thread to write this up, but I think the videos support some of my points.

In my view, we've been having two main problems on offense.  First, a lack of ""ambitious"" passing.  It seems that when there is a defender even a couple yards from one of our players, whoever has the ball rarely even tries giving it to him.  That results in a lot of turning around and passing back to our defense.  There doesn't seem to be any trust that our players can bring the ball in and make something happen, whether it is beating the nearest man or passing to someone else.  Second, there is a lot of passing to stationary targets.  It isn't because of a lack of movement.  I've really lost count of how many times I've seen a good run from any of our players that is just ignored as we opt for a pass to someone else not moving.  When we get into the attacking third, that becomes a huge problem since defenders will be closer to their marks.  If the receiver of the pass isn't moving, they will get closed down immediately while the ball is traveling and won't be able to do anything.  In the home leg against Tbilisi I thought it very evident that once we started passing into space for our players to run into, we started moving the ball better and looked much more threatening (and started scoring).

I wrote all that because I think the videos show how Eriksen can help us.  He isn't afraid to play passes in to a player with a defender on his back.  He sees players making those runs and tries to get them the ball, even if it means threading it between several defenders.  Its something we have been sorely missing, and we will look much more dangerous with a player like him in the side.",0,1378306130,null,0,false,0,cc1k63x,t3_1lpanl,t1_cc1k63x,t3_1lpanl,null,1429593435,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

As for local environment well, I've yet to see anywhere that couldn't do with some extra work.

The point of this I'd say is two-fold. 

1. Social bonding or engaging with the environment is something that could help many people - even those in work, and I'd not be adverse to getting those in work to spend some time engaging with the community but that's a different point - to learn skills, to network and to engage in things they might otherwise not.

2. It could be a positive thing for society, people might start to take greater care of their environment and it would help remove the stigma of lazy scroungers, or at least highlight those that genuinely are.

Plenty of countries have no benefits system. Plenty don't have a healthcare system like ours or if they have benefits, they're not as comprehensive as ours. I'd say we're pretty damn fortunate. 

&gt; Benefits exist because it's generally quite widely agreed upon that it's not a good thing to let people starve to death in the streets.

You're right there, but that *still* makes us fortunate that in this country we provision and allow for that - rather than not. 

At least you can see that abusing benefits is wrong - but my issue is not with their abuse. You don't find me sat here commenting on 'dirty scrounging benefit spongers'. 

The point I *am* making with my original comment is that even if some work was forced in order to claim benefits - to a rational level, it would still be the benefits that you are fortunate enough to receive as compensation for this. 

As it stands it's entirely possible to put in a minimum of effort into finding work and to spend ones day watching Jeremy Kyle because looking for work is demoralizing. That's tough - but that's not what the system should be supporting. 

I would rather the benefits system associated money as a reward for work than charity with nobody to stop you sitting in the pub all day because searching for work was a bit too much to cope with. (That's not to say that all benefits claimants spend all their time in pubs - that would of course be unfair) - but the psychological benefits to being active and motivated are significant compared to having no driving goal and nobody to stop you doing nothing all day if you felt like it - that in itself is demotivating. 

If your approach is ""I'm entitled to benefits because I have no work, I'm not fortunate - I just should have this and since finding work is tough, I'm going to do nothing today"" - well why should that be supported? Plenty of people *are* working even in menial jobs to make ends meet - and plenty of those continue to job hunt *whilst holding down a job*. Why recoil at the thought of giving a bit back to the society that is supporting the benefits seeker through hard times?

And the few times that the leading team ended up finishing outside of the top 2, they weren't expected to be up there anyway (Bolton in 01-02, City in 07-08, Spurs in 09-10). 

All this tells me is that if a top team is leading after 3 weeks, they'll probably stay thereabouts. If a mid-table team is leading after 3 weeks, they'll probably drop back down.

 The deeper issue here is that there is an age limit on free education. I'll give you a very common example, girl gets pregnant at 20 and has to drop out of education as she is a single mother, by the time the child is in full time school and she is off IS and onto JSA  she has a 5 year gap in her CV and all the free education schemes have dried up - with the few that are left she has to sign a form saying that she will come off JSA within x weeks of her course being completed. The other option is being forced onto new deal in 30(? still don't know the exact timing on this) weeks, which is even worse because then she has to take pot luck when it comes to who she gets, and she can't get free childcare because she is on JSA.

All I can imagine is that quite a few different people decided that they didn't like how things were going politically, took the first boat out that they could, hit land here, and then headed north as far as they could before running up against the Appalachians, simply trying to get as far away from the population centers as they could and still eke out an existence.

They clearly cross the road with complete disregard for these rules.  You yourself probably do this very thing.  For a cyclist it is almost the exact same situation as a pedestrian.  You obey certain rules because that is sensible, but if you can reasonably see no problem in breaking it at that moment then you will probably break it.  It becomes a personal judgement call but its one that most intelligent humans can reasonably make.

That hypothetical is all well and good, but in the picture there are completely empty driveways so let's not pretend every one has a good excuse. You prove my point with the two cars—perhaps they should have bought a more suitable house rather than park there indulgence on the road making it a de facto extension of their personal driveway. I've seen houses brick up their garage turning it into a bedroom, turn the drive into a garden, then park two cars on the street. The value of their house has been subsidised. I find that taking the piss, but most don't bat an eye. Like I said pavement parking is a major risk to kids running out, car doors opening killing cyclists, and often pedestrians have to walk in the road because of it.

So basically house builders built houses and estates poorly then got the government to subsides car ownership by having them build and maintain roadways which become car parks.

The government are supposedly bending over backwards to save the children of the latest middle eastern regime that just so happens to have strategic oil related advantages, but they deliberately underfund and neglect the needs of children in this country.

The argument I suppose with the introduction of a salary cap (aside from the legal one) is whether this would mean the problem would just move. Would billionaires start funding asian teams and make the asian champions league the biggest competition? Or the MLS?

For example - 50ish % of cycling deaths in this London are killed by 5% of traffic (HGVs and the like). Would a helmet save those 50% or would better infrastructure and attitudes do a better job? Would encouraging helmets stop careless road use (cyclists included).

Whoop-de-do, he's helping us out. All strikers help us out.

And I'd rather Lukaku made those mistakes elsewhere. As an entitled Chelsea supporter who wants the best for one of the top teams in the world, we should be demanding the best quality striker possible. At this stage, Lukaku isn't ready. He's close, but not quite there yet. I'd much rather those mistakes were ironed out at a different club than made here.

I'm not trying to make it out that way. I'm just putting this side of the debate forward, as are you.

I admit, I love Brian and what he's doing with the club, it's obviously not on his part that we haven't signed a winger. We're strapped for cash, it's obvious to everyone and the fact that Noodles told McDermott to go out and buy two or three players and we haven't got one winger yet stands out as a bit of a piss take imo. Maybe wingers are highly rated, maybe all the wingers we wanted were too much, but the fact we've not brought in one single player who can play wide is worrying to me. Teams KNOW we are narrow, they know we can be exploited. It's only a matter of time before they start playing that way and we notch up the defeats. 

Brian has done so much for us, and to be stifled by a lack of width and cash would see all that go to waste. Our defence is the best we've had since we were in the prem, our CM is fantastic and our strike options is the best since we came up from League One but we're crying for some width. Someone to push the byline, someone to get crosses into Varney, Smith, Ross, Poleon. Gradel was that man for us in league One. I really am sad we lost him. Leicester fans must have been so annoyed when we got him, and I'm annoyed we let him go so cheaply. I think if Bates had fucked off, we'd have kept most of what we had. Three of our midfield in League One now play in the Prem. Becchio was there as well. Gradel now playing for a team heading for Europe. We've been left with players who really will be looking at Leeds as a stepping stone. if we'd kept those players, add what Brian brought in, we'd be sitting pretty in this league. I know that's a lot of ""ifs"" and ""buts"" but we have to admit the fact that Bates completely fucked us over and GFH are trying to sort it out. Bates did so much damage to our club it's almost criminal yet you still find people defending him. If the attendances alone don't tell you the story that Bates has fucked us for years, I don't know what does.

Second, I'd say privatization of police labs is a far more dubious case, for a number of reasons:

* The risk of corruption is higher.

* Crimes are one off, whereas diseases are in general ongoing. If you get a false positive for, say, Coeliac disease, then follow-ups will identify if that's incorrect. That's particularly the case for 'big data' approaches. If you cock up samples for a crime scene, you can't re-run it.

* Demand for medical testing is more elastic. The police will always undertake forensic tests at a murder site, but whether or not a GP runs a particular test when you go with a particular complaint depends directly on cost. If a test costs £300, and the probability that you have that disease is significant but low, the GP will hold back. So cost is directly connected with quality of care.

I agree that it doesn't say we are going to finish top 2, but I do think that it gives a fairly good picture that we could very well finish top 4 (and even that we at this point may be slight favorites for the spot).  As I said, don't bet the mortgage, but that 09-10 Tottenham team still finished top 4 (and I don't believe they were expected to do that, but I'd have to verify).  Since the advent of ""sugar-daddy"" owners, typically the teams that finish well are leading the pack early.  I would argue that the fact that Liverpool is leading the pack this year (and have already taken 3 points from Man U) means that our team is underrated on their top 4 odds and a bet gives good value on return.

A lot of Labour MPs always strike me as Champaign socialists hell bent on telling everyone else how to live.  Kinda like Diane Abort, such as how she called others for sending children to a private school, yet of course did it herself.

Everyone I knew at uni who was involved with the socialist workers party etc had the luxury of not needing a part time job.  I remember an interesting argument with a housemate about this, I was trying to draw to her attention the word *worker*.

I guess I think that people with the time and connections to get in to politics are normally from a very well of background.

Selling will.

So, learn your ABCs (Always Be Selling) and think SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Targets) and the job will be yours!

That said, I'm not necessarily arguing whether or not he would score more goals than Torres or Ba as our #2. But the fact remains that as our #2 he just wouldn't get as many starts or as many minutes on the pitch as he will at Everton. Right now he needs those minutes. His inexperience is the biggest mark against him. And for those who argue that chelsea should be the team giving him experience, we could only give him starts in the league cup and against the minnows of the league. He's not ready to lead the line for us against united or city, much less in CL. We all saw how he disappeared in preseason against Madrid, and how he floundered against Munich in the Super cup. The kid is just not ready for those matches yet. 

At the end of the day, the kid needs game time. And he'll get much more of it at Everton than he would with us as a #2. His hat trick vs united last season was brilliant, but he would never have had that opportunity with us. This is why loan spells are beneficial to youngsters like Lukaku, and we'll reap the benefits of his progression once he returns.

It seems like those are older comments (from previous season perhaps)?
Because Gylfi (unfortunately) hasn't done very well this year.
He seems to struggle. Looks a bit overwhelmed and confused out there on the pitch. 
Even against Dinamo Tbilisi he looked fairly poor (for the most part).
I hate to say this, but I can't see him moving up the chain to take over Holtby or Eriksen (or Lamela, depending on formation) for the #10 spot. 
Or even out wide for Chadli or Townsend.
TBH, I don't understand why he was retained on the squad with all the options we got.

He has been a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly since 2003. He has been suspended twice from the Assembly for unparliamentary language[7] in respect of allegations of Provisional IRA membership made against Gerry Adams.
In June 2009, he was appointed Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and it was in his capacity as Minister that in May 2010, after lobbying by the Caleb Foundation pressure group, he wrote to the Ulster Museum requesting that it display a range of Creationist and other anti-Evolution material, claiming that it was the Museum's job to ""reflect the views of all the people in Northern Ireland"" rather than to reflect the understanding of modern science. In response to McCausland's letter, the prominent evolutionary biologist, Richard Dawkins, said ""If the museum was to go down that road then perhaps they should bring in the stork theory of where babies come from. Or perhaps the museum should introduce the flat earth theory"".[8]
In 2011, he was appointed as Minister for Social Development.[9]",0,1378314646,null,0,false,0,cc1n30g,t3_1lq3cc,t1_cc1n30g,t3_1lq3cc,null,1429592003,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

You must have led a sheltered life. At 10 I was obsessed with horror and gore, but I never actually carried it out in real life, much the same as most of today's youngsters, playing ultra violent video games. You learn early on to have compassion for others and not want to cause suffering of another. And before you claim 'their past did it to them' there are plenty of people who went through much worse as children who never went on to torture and kill toddlers.

&gt; **The proof is in the reactionary comments to anything. Look at this thread, look at any other thread about people who commit horrible crimes. You don't need to show ""proof"" that the public will be angry. The public are going to be angry because they feel they have to be. It's just crowd mentality.**

So what, people were angry - so you believe people should feel how you perceive they should feel? That's pretty arrogant. You also totally missed the point of my question, which was how the did public being angry affect the decision of the judge and later sentencing for Venables being found in possession of CP? Let me answer for you, you don't have any proof at all, its mere speculation.

&gt; **We failed those two as children before they committed that crime. We failed them when they were in prison and we'll fail them as adults. If they were to kill themselves there would be very few people feeling sorry for them and a lot of people cheering and saying ""It should have happened earlier!"" and that's worrying and frightening for what it says about us.**

Cry me a river, I never failed no one, but if you want to play the white knight, then that's your prerogative. I would argue that the one who was failed was a two year old toddler who numerous people saw crying when in the company of eventual torturers and killers. But hey, why care about him, that's uncool and very 'daily mail' let's instead lament his killers and cry about failing them.

The ""big picture conflicts"" at the heart of Moffat's seasons have been meta and not very tangible.  The pandorica is about the entire universe ending, but in a weirdly conceptual way of everything disappearing, and then reappearing because Amy's brain, including and especially saving the Doctor.  The entire plot of season two involves the Doctor, essentially, saving himself because the universe needs to not know about him anymore, or something.  And season three had a lot of nothing to do with anything and then suddenly, AGAIN, the Doctor himself needing to be saved by a magical companion who is impossible and gets split into an infinity of people to rescue him across all of time and space.

My point is that RTD's big plots included threats personal to the Doctor, but which involved the Doctor, his companions, and humanity in the context of epic, galactic battles and conflicts.  Moffat somehow collapsed the entire show to being about continuously saving the Doctor and having companions (I'm including River as a companion) of transcendent importance and power, rather than regular people who become intertwined in the Doctor's story and whose innate humanity lets them make sacrifices to help him save everyone else.

I agree with your assessment of *Midnight*.  Every time I watch it, it still scares me.  It's unnerving to even think about.  I also agree that *Turn Left* fundamentally shows the difference between Moffat and RTD.  In RTD's world the loss of the Doctor is important because of its repercussions for the galaxy and humanity without his guidance and help.  In Moffat, the loss of the Doctor is important because Amy and Rory and River will be sad and we the audience will be sad.  That difference in scope is what Moffat's tenure as showrunner has really been missing for me.  I hope with 12 they are able to recapture a better sense of scale.

Depends, usually the vast majority waits on red, that is why it is easy to single out those that don't. Car drivers? They will park illegally anywhere blaming it on the warden if they get caught, they think talking on the phone is fine and they will break every possible speed limit out there except in front of speed cameras.

What a strange thing to assume from what I said. Since you think it matters, while I have some American blood, I was born in and have lived my whole life in England. That blood must be taking control of my political outlook.

The Discovery channel analogy doesn't really work when applied to this subreddit. They have to keep to a schedule, so the awful programs they put on to steal ratings have to directly replace the other content they used to be known for. That doesn't happen here. If you don't want to read bullshit transfer rumours from bad websites, you don't have to. I don't see how it replaces anything either. Rumour posts always attract enough downvotes so that they're never promoted ahead of more highbrow discussion. The system works well in that way.

If a certain type of redditor is more interested in discussing the Daily Mail rumours than the other topics and we outright ban them from doing so, they'll just end up discussing it somewhere else. They won't change who they are or what they want to discuss just to fit in here. The only thing that would be different is there would be somewhat fewer topics created. Is that really worth obstructing freedom over?

I might be overstating my opinion on this. I don't really care that much whether the Daily Mail is banned or not.

For Manx gp The nutters tend not to bother then you've just difficult roads and no speed limits but taking them steady mitigates that and the nutters won't be there to run into the side of you. It really is a completely different thing and sensible New rider should be okay.

If it's the TT stars you really want to see go to the NW200 all the same stars, all the same teams. It's better in someways for viewing because it's a mass start race not a time trial, and the lap is three mins not forty.

Secondly,I would highly recommend you fix the Gallifreyan before making any more (and also fix the image) because there are several mistakes in there. If you submit a high quality photo to /r/Gallifreyan, I'll be happy to go over it and tell you them since the LQ photo provided by the shop isn't clear enough to be 100% certain for some of them.

&gt;If they can't give us anything physical that has happened in the relationship then it will look like what people say at the end of a transfer to make it appear they've got a better deal than they have.

&gt;We understand the club has to do the commercial deals that they feel are best for the short term future of the club that may upset the fans. But that is substantial and offers something in return and is not just words at the end of a statement. I do think Spurs fans deserve to know that.

&gt;When the guys who have started the petition what to hand it to us, we will pass it onto the club. I'm sure they will accept it. We had already decided as the Trust board that we were actively going to contact the THFC board regarding this special relationship.

&gt;I'd love Daniel Levy to respond in person but he doesn't tend to do that. I hope the Spurs board understand where we're coming from. The best scenarios would be 'this is what we've achieved in the last year' or they turn around and say 'as far we are concerned, the partnership is over'.

No shit every striker helps us out, but he will be more productive than Torres. Torres kills everything about our offense. I made a post a week ago, talking about how Torres hurts our team. No one really wanted to talk about it, but I made good points.

You'd rather have the mistakes Ironed out at a different club, but are fine with Torres make all these idiotic mistakes here?

The only reason I mention the Miami Heat is because it is the only other sports team I follow closely. There are probably great examples in football of teams that start slow and improve as new signings are integrated; I just can't really speak with any authority about such cases. I'd be interested to learn anyway.

If anything I get the vibe that the comparison is so offensive because it is to an American team. Is that a false accusation? It seems that football commentary regularly compares a perfectly weighted pass to, for example, a snooker shot; I doubt this would be as offensive to you.

If that is the case, while I appreciate that it may be a mild annoyance to you, it's strange to me that, especially given the international make-up of the squad itself as well as of the following, you find it acceptable to berate me for ""Americanizing"" this subreddit. Do I have a equal case for berating you for trying to follow football on an American-run website?

I would argue no, but maybe you'll convince me otherwise...

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"&gt;The only episodes of 7b you needed to watch to understand what's happening with the Doctor and Clara were the first and last ones

This is something that I noticed while trying to recommend which episodes of 7b to watch to my parents(who are avid TV-watchers and frequently aren't caught up with shows they love, let alone Doctor Who which they simply 'enjoy').   It was really disheartening looking back and realizing that...well, ""Cold War"" and ""Crimson Horror"" were fun time-period romps...""Journey to the Center"" was a fun romp through the TARDIS(and only mildly interesting to long-term fans)...Akhetan and NiS were fun space romps...but only the first and last episodes were required watching. 

Almost the entirety of 7b were episodes you'd classify as ""fun romps""- well done, popcorn episodes that don't produce any real character or plot development.   That can be fun for a few episodes, but in such a short season(err...half season?  Whatever 7b was) centered so heavily around the new companion that is entirely TOO MUCH.    I honestly don't feel like I know Clara at all.   They were too busy making fun romps and showing the Doctor scratch his head at the end of every episode.

The worst of it is that this is particularly bad timing to have a dull companion.  Anniversary aside, a new Doctor is coming in and he's going to be a pretty huge departure from recent history.  Apparently Moffat wants the Twelfth's regeneration to be similar to the Fourth Doctor's regeneration, with a familiar companion helping to ease the audience through it.   Problem is, the Fourth Doctor had Sarah Jane Smith.   One of the longest running, most popular companions in the show's 50 years(she even had one of only two successful Doctor Who spin-offs).   Probably the only other companions I can think of that comes close to her is Jamie, maybe the Ponds.   The Twelfth Doctor has...Clara.   Not Victorian Clara, or Souffle Girl, just Clara.  The companion who might as well have had a bag with a question mark and the words ""mysterious eye candy"" on her head.

He's now got two specials to either give this(no-longer-so-mysterious) walking plot device a likable personality, or to add another character to our show's roster, to make that happen.  As much as I'd love to wish that Captain Jack, Martha, or even Donna or Rose would return in the first few episodes of season 8; I doubt that's going to happen.  

He needs to be careful, here.   A new Doctor that isn't instantly lovable, combined with a lack-luster companion, could be a very bad recipe.",0,1378323484,null,0,false,0,cc1qb9u,t3_1lnvso,t1_cc1qb9u,t1_cc19pbl,null,1429590497,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Putting forward an argument, or a claim/statement, and *having* an argument are two separate things.

Ok so you've just repeated your main argument, again. Learning in front of the best midfield in the PL? Yep, that's a perfectly valid argument but I don't think it's a definitive enough one to justify him not going on loan.

Look, I'm not a fan of Torres either. But currently he's much more proven than Lukaku. Sure, there's an argument for giving Lukaku a chance but Torres' experience particularly in European competitions is a valuable asset to have. Essentially all discussion about Torres is a bit of a dead horse now though.

&gt; I will take Lukaku over Torres 10/10.

And so would I. But getting rid of Torres isn't easy though that's the problem. Nobody is going to pay his wages. While we've still got him, we might as well form the player that we need for the coming years. All young players are nurtured into successful professionals through plenty of game time. Lukaku wouldn't have got that here this season.

A lot were even pretty subtle about things!  For example, rewatch The End of the World+New Earth.   This time, pay more attention to the throw-away 'joke' that Lady Cassandra was a trans woman.   It completely changes the tone of the end of her story, and WILL make you cry if you know how hard hard being trans can be.  Even her motivations to live longer make more sense.  

There are TONS of episodes that really stuck with you, despite not being of galactic importance.   Comparatively, I'm looking back at season 6 on, and I honestly can't remember most of these episodes outside of the first and final stories(including two-parters, of course).  The only stories which have really stuck with me have been the big ones; I even kind of forgot about Let's Kill Hitler!

They doddered around in the market and made a good signing in Flamini, and obviously an amazing one in Ozil, and a couple of young players. I don't think they really capitalised on the amount of money that they allegedly had to spend. They're better for the signings they made, but they needed another striker, arguably another keeper (and they could have had Cesar or Begovic) and some defensive re-enforcements.

Depending on the game I can see Aspas, Moses, or Henderson starting. But I think Henderson is such a stabilizing force for our team that it won't be for a while that he leaves the first 11. 

But where we are right now, I think Henderson is likely first choice at RW/RM/RCM (arguably the myriad of roles he fulfills while in the game) against our competition in the top 6. 

Against those teams we run the risk of too easily coming undone defensively, and their attacking abilities are great enough to pounce on it, that I think he's undroppable. 

But against any team below the top 6 I think we can enter games thinking we're good enough to hold possession and talented enough to score more than whoever we're facing. 

All the while, Moses and Aspas would remain invaluable of the bench. Honestly watching those Moses runs with all his power and pace just make me itch for a 1-1 game with 20 minutes to go.

That by itself is a huge blow and not an easy task to replace. Tottenham have no doubt made some quality signings and should be happy about it. But the first team has been completely overhauled. Also Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela, although both fantastic players, are still young and might need time to settle in. 


Yes, I agree that the fan fare about Ozil might seem a little over blown. But after all the criticisms about the lack of signings, we get access to a truly top class player, likely the best attacking midfielder in the world. The signing means no less than what bergkamp was to Arsenal. He is at the prime of his game, and hungry to succeed. No player is guaranteed to fit, but all signs in his history and technique show that he could be right up there. 


What should be a worry for both teams is the size of the defensive line-up which is thin in both cases. As always, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. Arsenal fans have to be wary of the fact that we indeed failed to sign a striker and add defensive re-reinforcements which could be needed if we have further injuries. But at the same time, Tottenham fans should be cognizant of the fact that Arsenal have held on to every single important player. And further more, with more experience in the league, players like Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud will continue to shine. And the youngsters in Wilshere and Ramsey are starting to shine.

One obscure post that's so terrible you can't visit this sub anymore is pretty extreme.

My lengthy post, on the other hand, while a waste of time, was an earnest attempt to understand why I've upset you so. This lengthy post, on the other hand, is a sincere attempt to tell you to fuck off.

&gt; A lot of that is due to the increase of new American fans who have joined on the back of UnderArmor and Dempsey and post when they don't properly understand football, Spurs or any of the culture surrounding it.

I've been following Spurs for a pretty long time. My first trip (which had a much longer commute than your first trip) to WHL was in 2004. I think long enough to be immune from this sort of dick measuring bs. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan, but my fanhood has nothing to do with Dempsey or UA or any of your bullshit. Your butthurt xenophobia is pretty ugly and frankly, if you want Spurs to be competitive at the highest levels, unproductive.

I'm sorry that Spurs aren't confined to London. I'd guess that you don't mind when Spurs sign Belgian, French, German, Danish, Argentine, Brazilian, Cameroonian, Croatian, Welsh, Dutch, Romanian, Spanish, and yes, American players.

&gt; Im sorry if you disagree but if the biggest contribution you can make is that this new Spurs team is like Miami Heat then maybe you shouldn't post. That's absolute nonsense.

true,william-in-the-hague,null,null,"&gt; extremism

By conventional definition extremism is defining all else by a single issue:

* religious extremism seeks to shape all human behaviour according to a central text,
* political extremism like fascism where all other thought stems from obedience to authority (eg' nationalism),
* veganism is extremism where all lifestyle choices pivot around avoiding animal products.

Nearly all planning since 1920—all road building, the supermarket design, the weekly shop, haulage, petrol stations, home design, suburban design, urban design, car parks, multi-storey carparks, street lights, even policy in the middle east, military action, special law codes—has pivoted around the car. It defines even the quality of air you breathe and the stability of the earth's climate. It even defines the value of your currency. Every link I sent you was infrastructure specifically designed to maximise **comfort** for drivers whilst increasing **danger** to all others, especially the one cycle lane running along car doors and next to a tram.

&gt; Pedestrians wandering in to the road? Cyclists running lights or trying to squeeze up the side of a truck? Motorbikes using country roads as a race track? Drunk drivers? etc. etc. etc.

Car extremism is blaming anything but car extremism and making excuses for preventable violent deaths which you have just done. The **car** (or motor vehicle) is the threat, it is doing the killing, but it's never its fault. It's pedestrians or cyclists getting in the way—or so you say. Actually, drivers are the cause of collisions and there are stats to back it up, for example, only [~70% of crashes with cyclists are the drivers fault](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/article3758677.ece). Ultimately though it's about design and it's awful—few like driving to work, the school run, even less like living on main roads, it kills.

&gt; Now you're not going to tell me all those cyclists died because of people opening their car doors are you?

You shouldn't have to rework my prose. I've been clear: cyclists die and are injured because they are not provided for in any meaningful way other than an after thought—that's why people don't cycle. Compare that to the extreme levels of provision given to the car.

&gt; It's likely, as stated in the article, because more people have cycled (probably due to the Olympics), and the increase seems to be in London, one of the busiest cities in the world.

Yeah, we can shrug off an increase in cycling related deaths because more people are cycling—it's just acceptable collateral damage. **That's car extremism**. Cycling has increased sporadically since 2001/2 for a decade because the car is obnoxious, expensive, less convenient and slower (for some) at peak times.

&gt; And stop trying to compare foreign aid to bloody bicyling and domestic issues that have no relevance to the subject.

No, because it perfectly illustrates that there is money for such-and-such when it suits especially when preventing death is the justification, and in that case the government are saying we need to do X to save lives. More cyclists die in one year than soldiers do in five. I'm comparing 2k yearly deaths, 20k life changing injuries, 300k total injuries **every year** and the state thinking this is acceptable, to a one of 500 death event that deserves us and the world's largest army destroying another country.",0,1378330385,null,0,false,0,cc1svif,t3_1lnf9g,t1_cc1svif,t1_cc1pvlq,null,1429589231,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The university has accommodation that it provides for students which, as you say, are mostly for First Years.

As far as commuting goes, it shouldn't be too hard to find somewhere within walking distance of wherever you're studying. Marchmont is popular among students and is pretty close to both King's Buildings and the main George Square campuses (is 'campuses' a word?).

I found the flat I shared last year on easyroomate.com, which was pretty easy to use, though I'm sure there are other avenues. Rent varies of course, depending on where you stay and how many people you stay with. I think most flats will be furnished, but don't quote me on that!

University accommodation isn't out of the question though if you'd prefer that. It is mostly for first years, but not absolutely exclusively, and since you're new to the city I'm guessing the university wouldn't turn you away.

Spurs, on the other hand, essentially broke even, losing less money than a parking spot in London goes for these days, and bought a half dozen players that were on everybody's radar at the end of last season. Superstars, no, but people the best and brightest were watching and eyeballing and whispering about being maybe the next break-out stars, most of them in the very early 20's.

I particularly admire the loyalty that Juan Mata and David Luiz showed to the Chelsea Football Club via their ""Chelsea is the only place for me"" and ""I will stay at Chelsea for the rest of my career"" messages via social media this summer.

May I ask, how do you explain Fernando Torres, loved by Liverpool and the Kop....yet he came to Chelsea because of loyalty?

At least Torres has the decency to keep his mouth shut, he enjoys playing for us and loves the money he is paid.

This is so much more than can be said for the ""legend"" that is Drogba.

But...you know...believe what you want.  The smoke and mirrors and poison that is Public Relations.

Luiz would love nothing more than to play with his mate Neymar and Lionel Messi, that Jose would not allow a deal to Barcelona and that Ozil was sold to Arsenal and not Spurs speaks volumes in itself.

true,QdwachMD,eng-lestershire,Bestershire,"&gt;I wouldn't have said no to it when I was on JSA. Instead I was warned that if I did volunteer for anything, they could reduce or stop my benefit altogether. Way to encourage initiative there, DWP.

I'm currently doing an unpaid internship, because it comes up to over 16 hours a week I'm not eligible for JSA any more. Instead I'm doing odd jobs through an employment agency but it's not really a steady income, one week I can earn a decent wage and another (like this one) I earn nothing at all. If I didn't have my parents to help me I'd probably have to drop the internship that will potentially get me a proper job.
