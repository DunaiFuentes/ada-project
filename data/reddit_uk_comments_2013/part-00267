true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; Freeview is a ""sunk cost"" though, it really doesn't cost the BBC any notable sum of money to support an extra 10 million viewers when the infrastructure is in place.

Of course it does - transmission sites don't run themselves without any maintenance. It is horribly expensive to maintain all of these sites, with huge (redundant) power requirements, redundant transmitters, redundant feeds, the works. Huge power bills too. The BBC doesn't own its transmitters so they contract it to Arqiva, the company that owns most TV transmitters in this country. They'll want a profit too.

&gt; Sky should pay the BBC for the free content.

That would only make sense if Sky were making a profit from the BBC's presence. They aren't - you can use Sky hardware to receive the BBC without paying Sky a penny. So why should Sky pay? 

Sky only pays channels that are willing to become encrypted/exclusive to Sky. For example Channel 4 HD (used to be Sky exclusive), Channel 5 HD  and the non-PSB subscription channels. Since this will never happen to the BBC it doesn't make any sense that Sky should pay. 

Everyone who watches the BBC via Sky is already paying for the costs in the form of the licence fee. Like how BT Sport is a separate subscription to any Sky subscription you might have. Sky certainly isn't paying BT...

&gt;  If terrestrial TV was not on Sky then people would use their in-built receivers and/or set-top boxes to pick up freeview.

So what you're saying is that 10 million+ people should have to make investments in yet more hardware when they already have something that is fully capable? That's not very fair.

If the BBC wishes to become a niche broadcaster with voluntary funding, they can pick and choose what platforms they are on. While they continue to force people to pay for them, they should be available on every platform at any cost - especially one of the largest (Sky).

I find it odd how no one seems to complain about the huge sums pumped into Freesat - something that wouldn't need to exist if the BBC didn't insist on having a proprietary platform (you don't need a special box in countries like Germany. Any DVB-S receiver works fine. Over here you don't get any EPG data)

&gt; seeing Sky channels with advertising provided by Sky.

Sky doesn't really provide advertising for channels other than their own. If you don't have a Sky subscription, you can't watch most of them. If you do have a subscription, you know why you want Sky already. And it's not purely to watch the BBC.

&gt; The primary beneficiary in carrying these channels is Sky, not the BBC.

The primary beneficiary are the people who watch the BBC using Sky equipment - a large group of people. The BBC are also fulfilling their obligation to be platform neutral and to ensure that they are available to as many people as possible.

Either that or he gives up and claims JSA. With what we know about KarmaUK's situation that is just going to push him downhill.

At least with an appeal he gets the reduced rate payment until the hearing date. Or did. The DWP have twigged onto this and just changed the rules. There is now a ""mandatory reconsideration period"" before an appeal can be accepted, and reduced rate ESA is no longer paid (edit: until an appeal is accepted). So for any future decision that he wants to appeal he will have to wait an unspecified period without reduced rate ESA before he is allowed to put an appeal in. Or give up and claim JSA.

Basically fucked, but he still stands a better chance of better quality decision making at appeal. ",0,1386666184,null,0,1386667579,0,cdy5o6w,t3_1sgwzk,t1_cdy5o6w,t1_cdy3ktq,null,1428301700,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt; Committing fraud is an option for the purposes of this thread, but not in real life.

I'm going to ignore this, as otherwise my other suggestions will be ""rob a bank"". If something is not a valid option in real life, then it is only a waste of time in the thread.

Rightyo, let's do this properly then, because there's very little we can do given the information you've posted.

* You earn 40-70 pw, that about right? You say &lt; 16 hours a week, this puts you at about 7 - 12 hours per week.
* You cannot / cannot guarantee getting more hours at your paid job.

Questions:

* Any debts? If so, list all of them, their minimum payments and interest rates.
* Savings?
* Car?
* Finances tied up in anything, have you put money into this business?
* What's your rent?
* What hours do you work at the unpaid job?
* What other benefits are you receiving, or about to receive (you mention both rent and housing benefit, what's covered by the housing benefit (all of the rent or some?), expected time for that to be resolved)?
* For any benefits, what are the conditions of them?
* What are the current major problems? How far behind on rent are you and how soon does it need to be sorted (have you heard anything from the landlord?)?

*The main areas of law that relate to body piercing and tattoos cover the health, safety and licensing of any premises that carries out 'cosmetic' skin piercing and permanent tattooing. These laws are: The Health and Safety at Work etc Act (HSWA,1974); The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 ( recently amended by the Local Government Act 2003); Laws relating to Age and consent. There is no legal age of consent for body piercing, and so it's legal for someone under the age of 18 to have a piercing as long as they have consented to it. Children under the age of 16 can't legally consent to a genital (or in the case of girls, nipple) piercing, as it's considered to be indecent assault.*

So basically if a parent consents, a newborn can have it's ears pierced ... which is the point I was trying to make. If NO bodily adjustment is allowed without the legal consent of the person in question, then that means NO cosmetic surgery of any kind before the kids is 16 or 18 (or whatever the UK would consider ""the age of consent"").

true,Morethanlikely,1986,Hasselbaink/Ramires,"Holy mother of kneejerk in this thread.

The guy had one bad game and happened to have one poor game (heck only his offense was truly dreadful - the defensive parts aren't something you could fault him for) and he wanted to take some shots and suddently people are shitting all over him for it? I never see the same reaction when Lampard or Mata blast 4-5 balls  out wide in a game.

One of Ramires absolutely strongest points is actually that is able to take those long runs - because he has the positioning and speed to cover up immediately. If you actually watch Ramires play (he is probably the player I've watched the closest past 3 years) you'll see that as soon as he has nothing more to contribute to the attack, he will prepare to make that 60 metre dash across the field to stop any counter.

I also do not understand why people call his crosses bad. His short range passes are honestly kinda iffy, but his *crosses* are delicious, especially when he drops them on a player like Hazard. My only issue is that he doesn't take those crosses enough - he seems to like those short passes which slows down play.

The good thing about that though is that it allows him to make use of his speed and very very often baits the opponent into making fouls on the border to the attacking third - it's a similar thing to what Hazard does but since he is more technically gifted than Ramires he will bring out a much higher amount of fouls as he gets deeper into the pitch. Still, they both are EASILY our most fouled players, not something to ignore. 

Seriously, do you people watch him? People are way too attached to Lampard and Mikel, thinking that obviously they must the ones we should compliment. If we get a ""big"" player like Yaya Toure, our central midfield would be very scary, because his skills compliment Ramires' very well. Honestly, just imagining Ramires at City instead of Fernandinho gives me the creeps. 

Finally the thing about him being individually strong but bad for the team - you haters should really look at a certain **Branislav Ivanovic** before saying such things. I don't mind him going in for the set pieces but when he rushes up the right wing trying to be Cole it essentially ends with Ramires becoming the 4th defender (unless Mikel is playing), negating all his strong points since it makes him very stationary.

You might try thinking back to the last time Mourinho was at Chelsea. It was the exact same story back then, everyone talked about how our squad's weakspot was up front, and how we were never going to win titles without a more prolific frontline.

All our goals came from midfield (mostly Lampard) and everyone said we needed a more consistent striker than Drogba, who people forget was not at all prolific in his first few seasons. His partners up front were Eidur, who was never a big goalscorer, and Kezman... nuff said.

Actually Chelsea succeeding in spite of misfiring strikers seems like a very familiar story indeed.

Edit: conversely seasons where we have had a big goalscoring striker up front have tended to be seasons where we didn't win anything, ie Hasselbaink for several years, and Anelka winning the golden boot in 2009.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt;  It is horribly expensive to maintain all of these sites, with huge (redundant) power requirements, redundant transmitters, redundant feeds, the works. Huge power bills too.

I don't think you understand the problem, if all Sky customers were to start using freeview this instant then there would be literally zero cost impact on the broadcasting network. They aren't taking up ""slots"" or using any dedicated capacity, they are passively receiving signals that are already there. 

The cost is the same regardless of whether these people use Sky or not. The only cost impact would be if there were an entire village in a transmission blackspot using Sky requiring a new transmitter which is quite unrealistic at this point as these repeaters are already in place. I'd be stunned if there was any town doing this and equally stunned that Sky aren't using this ""entire village of Sky customers"" in their marketing. 

&gt; That would only make sense if Sky were making a profit from the BBC's presence. 

They are. ""Can I still watch BBC"" is a customer demand which sells their system when the answer is yes. They are [using this very obviously](http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2012/olympics_channels) in their own PR. 

The BBC is immensely popular in the UK as are the other terrestrial channels. Sky only dominates sport and movies, for everything else they lose out big time to BBC, ITV and Channel 4. If these channels were not available on Sky then people would also install aerials to get freeview which drastically decreases the value of the Sky subscription. 

Last week ""Better Together"" tried to make the claim that Scottish independence would mean no more ""Strictly come dancing"". If it's seen as a viable point for a political  referendum then it's equally useful for product marketing. 

&gt; So what you're saying is that 10 million+ people should have to make investments in yet more hardware 

They already have it, their TVs have built-in tuners. 

&gt; Sky doesn't really provide advertising for channels other than their own. 

Yes, that's my point. If people had to turn to freeview for Strictly Come Dancing and The X-Factor (both of which are probably more popular than all Sky One shows combined) then they are far less likely to channel-hop to Sky when the show finishes. If they flick up and find something to watch on BBC3 instead of Sky One then Sky have lost out on advertiser eyeballs. That's the bottom line of why Sky provide these channels, it keeps people within their system. 

&gt; I find it odd how no one seems to complain about the huge sums pumped into Freesat 

That's a different issue entirely. There is maybe some small justification for it as it provides service to a few remote regions more cheaply than a transmitter network. Particularly in hilly places like the Scottish highlands and the Welsh valleys. 

&gt; &gt; The primary beneficiary in carrying these channels is Sky, not the BBC.

&gt; The primary beneficiary are the people who watch the BBC using Sky equipment - a large group of people.

*Who would be far less likely to pay for Sky if it didn't give them terrestrial TV*.

With their big 'homegrown' story, the tabloid hacking scandal, you have to wonder if they would've pursued it so heavily if it didn't mean a chance to get at the Murdoch papers.

I guess the problem I have with the Guardian is that it puts tabloid level spin on most of its reporting. Everything the Tories does is shameful, if something bad happens in the UK it's probably a result of the Tories (see their coverage of the Tottenham riots for one of the worst examples). 

Everything is also about class, for a paper that thinks classism is so horrible, they divide up people into classes more than any other paper and it infests huge numbers, they paint a ""us vs them"" picture of everything and stir up hate just as much of a tabloid. Of course the ultimate irony is that the readers and writers of the paper are largely middle class (which makes a lot of the articles involving class also come off a bit patronizing).

Well, OK then - if you insist on examining individual cases, as if that matters in some way - my Dad had a pretty good time in the war.  He was living in London, so he got moved to the country where he got to live on a farm.  He was conscripted to the RAF just after the war finished, where he got full board and paid, travelled to Egypt and generally had a brilliant time, by all accounts.  On the other hand, 31,000 people died of cold last year.  So that's 31,000 people who were worse off than my Dad was during the war.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"I'm not a soldier, but have had family in the army. In theory there is, but it's mainly concerned with breaking the law or regulations rather then being incompetent. 

If you read the article the accusation is that the Captain was essentially an arse to them in the way he was out drinking while they were all on exercises etc. Now if there are rules and regulations that the officers broke in regards to drinking while being on duty etc then it's possible they could get a dressing down for that. Other then that though, what does it matter if he was asleep or not? The soldiers were ordered to do the exercise, if the Captain isn't there to tell them how great they are (for any reason) that's not great but it's not against the rules.

Realistically though this is the army we are talking about, finding someone hungover on occasion happens all the time, and had those troops been found to be worse for wear one day (especially on a day that they weren't actually doing a drill) they would get bollocked but that's probably about it. 

The fact is they are the squaddies and the guys they are complaining about are the officers. If the Captain doesn't break any rules he can be as lazy as he wants, sure you can protest against it like these guys, but it is actually against the law.

It's not really a great system if I'm honest, but necessary when you consider the functions of the military. Anyone who has been in the forces for a while and served under different officers will tell you that their quality greatly varies, some of them are utter bastards and some of them are nice guys. You can't choose your commander though so you need to suck it up.

On the other hand, officers talk and the two officers mentioned in the article will likely get a talking to, and they will be remembered as the ones who caused the trouble. So while they wont be removed it will certainly be held in mind. If the Captain is a career officer chances are the stunt could have set his career back by a good few years.

The problem with the world is that too many people are subdued by the ""white-noise"" censorship and not enough people know and care about this to take action.

I'm not saying the law is necessarily right in that instance, just that there a better ways of effecting change than just breaking the law.

In that way, we don't decide what laws don't apply to us, we decide which laws we want to change. Then we elect people who are willing to make that change. No candidates that you find acceptable? Stand yourself, see how popular your opinion is in your community. Didn’t get elected? Guess your views didn’t resonate with the majority of people. In this case, why should the minority get their own way? (Obvious exceptions being matters of human rights, and I don’t consider getting high to be a human right).

The problems we face are, in my opinion, because of an entrenched difference in some beliefs between members of different generations.

Please explain properly why that is a perfect example of ad-hominem. I am claiming you are not competent to evaluate the nature of the reality in which you live. Is it forbidden to make this observation? 

I am not attacking you gratuitously. 

Again, **I am claiming you don't understand what ad-hominem means** and should refrain from jargonising in this way. 

I can't have a discussion with you about tax because you are apparently talking about something mythological as if it were real. 

Similarly, if I wanted to discuss dinosaurs and you claimed that there were no dinosaurs because the Earth was created six thousand years ago, there wouldn't be much to discuss. I would say that, as far as I am concerned, you are taking a fairytale for an accurate representation of reality. 

That would not be an ad-hominem, as I understand it. 

But, as I said, please **feel free to explain what an ad-hominem is** (in your own words, linking to Wiki does not demonstrate understanding). 

I will try to elaborate on why the notion that you are paying tax is a mythological construct based on cultural norms that you have accepted unthinkingly (it's not your fault) in due course but I am not at liberty, in terms of the temporal, to break down and reassemble your world view. It's a pet idea of mine (it's not mine insofar as I claim to have originated it, of course, but one that I like) and I intend to throw it about as much as possible. Hopefully I will get better at putting it across. 

Actually it might be impossible for me ever to do so. Maybe individuals can only do it themselves or it just happens by accident. I'm not sure how it works. 

Edit: Emphasised salient points. 

Edittit: The answer to your question - why should taxpayers pay for travellers to have somewhere to camp is: You would not be paying. Taxpayers would not be paying. The notion of taxpayers and that you are a taxpayer and therefore you are paying is false. Your question is invalid.

ECHELON? These aren't new and have been referenced plenty of times in both fiction and non-fiction works.

To answer the 'Why don't people care?' you need to look at the demographics of the country. I can pretty much guarantee if you said 'What is worse? A) The troubles, or B) Interception of electronic communication' you'd get a vastly different answer based on who you ask - the gen pop vs reddit's student room.

I know this might sound terse, but it's basically that what you see as issues aren't reflected in the general consensus. Not through apathy, just people don't give quite as big a fuck as you do, and know how to compare what seem to be non-trivial issues to trivial ones.

I'm not the lazy one. You're the one making the baseless claim that tax is in some way mythical.

&gt;Please explain properly why that is a perfect example of ad-hominem. I am claiming you are not competent to evaluate the nature of the reality in which you live. Is it forbidden to make this observation? 

That is ad-hominem. You are attacking my personal characteristics without actually dealing with the matter at hand. I'm not sure why you struggle to grasp this.

&gt;Again, I am claiming you don't understand what ad-hominem means and should refrain from jargonising in this way. 

But I do, and I've explained several times

&gt;I can't have a discussion with you about tax because you are apparently talking about something mythological as if it were real. 

Of course you can, you can argue why you believe that tax is mythological.

Don't be so lazy.

&gt;Similarly, if I wanted to discuss dinosaurs and you claimed that there were no dinosaurs because the Earth was created six thousand years ago, there wouldn't be much to discuss. I would say that, as far as I am concerned, you are taking a fairytale for an accurate representation of reality. 

And then you'd need to provide some reasoning as to why dinosaurs really do exist.

&gt;That would not be an ad-hominem, as I understand it.

No, that would not be. Saying that there is not much to discuss because I do not believe dinosaurs existed is not ad-hominem, but personally attacking my ability to learn because of an opinion I hold most certainly is.

&gt;But, as I said, please feel free to explain what an ad-hominem is (in your own words, linking to Wiki does not demonstrate understanding). 

I've already done this.

&gt;I will try to elaborate on why the notion that you are paying tax is a mythological construct based on cultural norms that you have accepted unthinkingly (it's not your fault) in due course but I am not at liberty, in terms of the temporal, to break down and reassemble your world view.

Not a future incarnation, but a stray part of the 4th Doctor's timeline. Other instances have demonstrated that, when multiple Doctors meet, various trans-temporal effects result in the earlier Doctor visibly aging from his appearance at the end of his actual incarnation.

The fact that the current Doctor doesn't remember would align with the story presented... if the 4th Doctor's museum experiences overlapped a later Doctor's experiences.

One thing strikes me: Going into the 50th, Moffat explicitly stated ""No classic Doctors"" would be appearing. While Moffat does frequently play fast-and-loose with the truth, he tends to prefer his lies to be technically true based on a nitpicky interpretation of his words. For his ""no classic Doctors"" statement to be technically true, then the previous incarnations we saw in the special are not ""classic"" Doctors.

Previously, the BBC has treated classic Who and 2005+ Who as two separate franchises (especially in the context of licensing for merchandise). That attitude seems to have been gradually changing of late, and the end shot of Day of the Doctor would seem to confirm it: There is no ""classic"" and ""new."" There is only Doctor Who.

Another thing strikes me: Fan reactions to Paul McGann's appearance in Night of the Doctor were overwhelmingly positive. There was a petition to get him in a spin-off series, to which Moffat's response was ""We're not going to do a spin-off with Paul McGann."" Not ""We're not going to use Paul McGann in future episodes,"" but ""Not in a spin-off.""

You know what the Doctor has never done? He's never *been his own companion.* Imagine two (or more) Doctors thrown together not for a single adventure, but for an ongoing series of adventures. And with the implications of the 4th Doctor's appearance, imagine that the 8th and (whatever number Matt has now been redesignated as) Doctors have to work with other previous incarnations for purposes of relocating Gallifrey.

Tax dodging, you'd tell HMRC that you're making £30,000 when in reality you're making £60,000. Drastically reduces your tax liability and relatively easy to do if all your customers pay in cash - you simply put it in your back pocket rather than in the till.

Money laundering is the other way around. You tell HMRC you're making £60,000. In reality you're making £10,000 - the other £50,000 is money from illegal sources and you're putting it through the business as if it was money you'd earned legitimately.

It's the hypocrisy which pisses me off the most, and the fact that most people seem to believe them.

We also have a massive problem with public opinion on protesters. The general public, media and government seems to hate them (a common opinion all around the West in general) and the media always villify them no matter what. If someone even  throws some litter on the ground suddenly people start calling for extreme police action and defend any police response as valid (or even if its a peaceful protest). You always see comments on the internet etc.. slagging them off all the time.

Yet have some protesters in Ukraine or Egypt that set fire to buildings and destroy monuments and suddenly our government calls for their government to resign and listen to the people (When was the last time a Western government listened to protesters? The civil rights movement in the US?) and everyone starts wishing them luck. If protesters in the UK destroyed statues and set fire to American flags you really think people wouldn't be calling for the military to shoot them, and the government would condemn them and justify police violence. So why be a hypocrite in countries like Ukraine and Egypt.

People here talk about ""democracy"" and ""respect the police"" and ""voting is the only way"" in the West (and always in general side with the police/government) when it comes to protests here, but are happy to see riots, destruction and condemn any police actions elsewhere.

There's no scope for change because people don't realise just how conservative the West is these days. We like to think we're better than everyone at all times so nobody wants to admit anything is wrong.

true,leviticusreeves,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"I couldn’t agree more.

I think it’s because of two long standing and related problems with British culture.

For a start, it’s only really other countries that really believe in human rights. In America they’re actually pushing for legislation and increased oversight over the intelligence agencies, because the average citizen is strongly of the opinion that all human beings are born with inalienable rights, and that nobody, especially the government, should be allowed to interfere with them.  

In Britain and much of Europe, we only believe in human wrongs. Even the Magna Carta was forced upon King John because the barons knew they had already been abused and exploited by the legal system. That first assertation of basic human rights in a society, in compact with the state, only comes around because of actual, palpable, historical grievances. Similarly, human rights legislation was only brought about in Europe in the aftermath of the horrors of WWII, and in Britain, quite recently, the Baby P case directly led to the GIRFEC legislation, enshrining further rights for children.

But this preference of only caring about wrongs and not rights is a sickness, it’s bad for us. Unlike Americans, we can’t design a system with the intention of avoiding tyranny, abuse, oppression and corruption, we have to wait for the bad thing to happen and act retrospectively.

The worst thing about this is that it means our legal system is prone to the vagaries of emotion and knee jerk reaction. In the early 90s, we lowered the age of legal culpability to age 10, because that was the exact age of Jamie Bulger’s killers. We threw all the reasons *why* we don’t prosecute children out of the window, and now we have one of the lowest ages of legal responsibility in the world.

 You only have to read the comments section on the Daily Mail or Telegraph to see people actually saying  “human’s don’t have rights, they have privileges.” It’d be rare to hear such a sentiment in America, and it’s an argument that makes me so very, very sad. Why would you want to think that? To actually prefer the idea that all the protections you receive in society, all the assumptions about how you should be treated by others, aren’t universal rights but something granted to you by the state, that can be removed at any time by the state, especially for transgressions.

And that leads me to the second point – British people are averse to change, and fearful of authority. I think maybe partly because the cost of living is so high, because most people live so precariously in a little corner of stability they have carved out for themselves, that we fear genuine change, we fear any further drop in the quality of life we’ve come to expect, even if it would mean genuine improvements in the lives of others.

People are being arrested for saying words, for reading certain books, having certain friends. Police forces are infiltrating any sort of organisation with any vaguely political bent. Maybe in some of these cases it might genuinely be for our security, but if the case is conducted through the secret courts then we’ll never know. But the general public don’t seem to mind. “Well, I’m not a member of any organisation!” they might say, and because of what they know they’ll never join one. I don’t know if that’s the intention, but it certainly benefits established power. Alternative ideas are treated as dangerous, and we come to identify with the mainstream, almost pathologically.

We voted Blair in because he had become Thatcher, and then we voted Cameron in when he became Blair. We voted No on AV, even though the argument from the No camp was essentially “it’s very complicated, you wouldn’t understand it”. 

We fear change. We have this tragic view of humanity that any attempt to make things better will invariably end in failure, so we allow the establishment and its institutions to cling on, to do whatever it likes to preserve its own power and position, and we support it, because we don’t want things to change, and because we fear the consequences of transgression.",0,1386677022,null,0,1386684621,0,cdy7a8p,t3_1sjffe,t1_cdy7a8p,t3_1sjffe,null,1428300948,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45

So if I offer an explanation, I am not claiming I actually understand it. 

It seems to me that ad-hominem refers to making claims about someone's character which are not pertinent to the subject at hand in order to divert attention from it. 

If that's correct, questioning your perceptual position vis-a-vis a subject being discussed is not an ad hominem. It's just questioning your ability to evaluate the subject based on your perception of reality. 

So, if I am talking about evolution with someone who rejects the idea, I would question their ability to continue the discussion on the basis that their underlying perception was not in line with the conversation. 

I would not be under any obligation to try to redress their perception. It would be exhausting to realign people's reality who seem uninclined to question it.

Allow me to apply a metaphor to lubricate my point. Say you personally had a big issue with cars and saw a fundamental flaw with them (lets call it some toxin in the fumes). Instead of trying to act as cars are growing popularity and are being produced and bought more you wait until it effects you. In this example it's been years now and the roads of the motor-vehicle extend to your street and now you are being effected by that hypothetical bad car thing first hand. You're breathing in the toxin, and so are your kids. 


You now look to take action, but already 80% or whatever of the UK's infrastructure is embedded around cars. Shops get their products in lorries now, there's roads absolutely everywhere. Wildlife has suffered, billions spent, research and development's been spent. Everything revolves around cars.


Now if you point out the toxin, people see it and agree it needs to change. Yet that *now* means your local store doesn't get supply, you have to walk everywhere, peoples with jobs away from their house can't work. Billions wasted etc.


The ""problem"" is already at an advantageous position and will be more likely to persist. Rather than when you first could have tackled it as it was a prototype.

Smaller doses act more like an antidepressant, euphoriant etc.  Not to say that it isn't addictive, in my experience there are certain types of people that do get hooked on it.  Some users like the extremely fast acting antidepressant effect of it and ultimately their tolerance grows until they are taking amounts that damage their livers, other users get hooked on the K-hole experience, I compare this to the difference between alcoholics who need a few drinks at the end of the day or the alcoholics who have to get completely blotto. Theres usually a reason for someone to want to block out all external stimuli whether through using alcohol, heroin, ketamine , benzodiazepines. 


Very few people abuse ketamine to such ridiculous amounts that they damage their kidneys, upgrading it to class B isn't going to stop people from using it to such an extent that they damage their livers.Its just going to cost tax payers more money to jail people who happen to be in possession of it.

No one actually thinks about the classification of the drug they are purchasing because it is irrelevant.  If your dealer offered you both cannabis (class B) and ketamine (class C for now) you don't go ""hmm I really do want to get high tonight , but I don't want that cannabis because its class B and might get me in more trouble if I'm caught""

The public was involved in an illegal war under false pretences with the US?  Well first of all I absolutely do not understand what you're saying here because there are multiple questions I need answered before I can agree or disagree.

1) Are you talking about Iraq or Afghanistan or both?

2) Did you not see the number of protest marches taking place around the country before both conflicts happened?

3) What in Gods name does the public have to do with it? After the Prime Minister is elected he doesn't need anyone permission to send the troops anywhere. He can just do it. Whether this will affect his chances of re-election is another matter entirely But. Well so basically the final question I have is.

4) What the bloody hell did you want the public to do more than it already did in the lead up to the conflict(s)? Violent overthrow? What?

&gt;Then we started buying out banks while simultaneously lowering support for students while freezing public sector wages (doctors, midwifes, nurses etc). Meanwhile the bankers at the banks that the public bought out - got very high bonuses (that's not an exaggeration).

I don't know about you but from what I saw of the press at the time there was a LOT of hue and cry over the whole issue of bankers bonuses. 

To wit. From the wikipedia article about [Stephen Hester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hester)

&gt;In November 2008 he left British Land and on 21 November 2008 replaced Fred Goodwin as Chief Executive of the RBS Group. Hester was paid an annual salary of £1.2million by RBS.[9] Alongside this, he took home £6.5m in bonus and pension payments in 2010. In 2012 he was offered a bonus of just under £1 million, following some considerable pressure from politicians and the public, he declined the bonus. Later in 2012, in June, he declined his bonus for the following year after RBS' computer problems.

&gt;Then we found that R.Murdock and NewsCorp were VERY entwined with both our government office and our police force - buying luxuries left and right. And it was us citizens which had to both expose AND stop this (funny enough Hugh Grant the actor had a hand to play).

OK seriously, I don't know who or what is the public in your statements any more. I just don't. I mean the latest round of phone hacking allegations and investigations came from the The Guardian newspaper. Are they the public or not? The way you see News International implies that they are not, but... Also the logic you employ is very strange. Crimes for the most part are committed in secret. So unless you want a full on state panopticon monitoring us 24/7 then how are the police and the government expected to act before public exposure or members of the public come forward with allegations of crimes committed against them. But in a further point below you rail against government spying and loss of privacy. So which is it that you want?

I've got to run now, I'll pick apart your other points later on when I come back to my computer.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"they are, but the *rate* of injury is symptomatic of the training and care regime. clubs spend millions of dollars in lowering the days missed rates, and that includes employing some of the best sports scientists and doctors in the world. every calorie taken in and burnt is measured and analyzed, every second of training is measured, players tracked with GPS, etc. all to keep the injury rate low. Having a good medical/care program can be the equivalent of purchasing 2-3 players, which is why so much is invested in it. 

50%+ of the squad being injured in 15 weeks is a *horrible* injury rate and simply not sustainable. IMO its because Brukner left, he had things back under control (Morgans isn't as close to as qualified as Brukner is[0]). We haven't even replaced him properly, which is a *huge* gap in staffing, we essentially only have physios, fitness trainers and a team doctor at the moment. 

Compare the injury rate with Brukner and now with Morgans, it is night and day

true,pandanomic,num23,,"* A LB, obviously. If nothing else, as least one that can play backup to Rose and is at the beginning of their career or the end (more likely). I doubt we'll be in for a Rose replacement.

* A striker would be nice, but only if defoe and/or Ade leaves. More than anything I want one that has good hold up play (like, could conceivably play midfield if needed) and, more importantly, has a high football IQ.

&gt; A note on football IQ: I'm talking someone that scores for no reason other than that they have great positioning and awareness on the pitch. These are the players that could ride on killer instinct alone, and sometimes seem incapable of making a poor decision and often are limited more by their physical ability than their decision making. Players like Zidane, Aguero, Lahm, RVP, etc come to mind. The thing is players like this exist outside of the spotlight as well. Dempsey is one I think, and other players that seem to be ""in the right place at the right time"" more often than not.

&gt; Defoe, Soldado, Kane, Adebayor all have this to some degree, but only Soldado and Adebayor have a semblance of that killer instinct I think, and even then they're not very effective (for now at least). I've watched the last two Fulham games and Berba I think would be PERFECT for this. History aside, I doubt there's many players on ours or Fulham's squad with a higher football IQ than him. The guy has an impeccable sense of the game, not only for himself but with setting his teammates up as well. The only one that comes close on our squad I think would be Eriksen.

* If not that, at least a striker that's just *quick*. Adebayor, Defoe, and Soldado are just not. Defoe is fast over 100m, but not really over 5m, if you catch my drift. Someone more Lennon-like would compliment us well I think.

* We need to drop some midfield weight. Sad to say but I think we'll see someone leave (maybe not January though since we have enough injuries to keep everyone happy). Especially with the eventual return of Carroll and Livermore at the end of the season.

* I could see Kane going out on loan as well.

Some are calling for revolution, which seems unlikely. Some think voting Labour is the answer. Some want to form a new party of the left. Some think boycotting voting altogether is the way forward.

true,exovolt,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"I served for 8 years and I've seen the alleged behaviour of their commanders demonstrated by higher ranks in my regiment, they probably tried a legitimate complaint. The official army complaints procedure is basically go a rank up. There are other methods of formal complaint but soldiers aren't generally aware of this. The army likes to keep complaints as internal as possible, you'll see why in a minute. So they would have complained about their captain (I'm assuming platoon commander) to a major or above, as that would have been their battalion commander.

The problem is that a lot of the officers ranks are extremely friendly with one another. The other problem is that a lot of the army traditionally still sees an officers word as unshakeable (an example being if you claim fuel money back while on a training course and you get audited you need either the course joining instructions or the word of an officer that you were claiming legitimately), so if they did make a complaint (which I assume they did as jumping straight from being a bit pissed off to staging a demonstration on a public parade is a bit drastic) then the officer in question would have been asked if he did what they said he did, the reply would have been ""No I haven't"" and that would have been the end of it. The guys were obviously frustrated and that's why they went to such drastic measures.

We are saturated with things like I'm a Celebrity get me out of here, Come dine with me, Strictly come dancing etc on TV continuously and then bombarded with advertising to purchase the latest thingy-ma-bob that we need to make our life complete. These have the effect of anaesthetising the brain to what's really going on in the world around us and desensitizing us to the harsh realities that millions of people face every day. 

The mainstream media also proclaims to us at the same time how dangerous the world outside is effectively suggesting we stay indoors and keep watching the glowing warm fuzzy comforter in the corner and stop complaining, stop questioning, stop thinking for ourselves. 

Also if we compare the readership figures between the Guardian and the Sun it paints a very expressive picture of the mentality of our culture in the UK: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_Kingdom_by_circulation#Circulation_since_2000

What does Bobby the tiler or Jim the van driver care about this kind of thing. Normal people on the street only care about politics when it it hits them in the pocket not in their personal freedoms. As I said above as long as they have their anesthetic (reality TV, Football and the latest Gadget) they couldn't care less.

I know I'm just as guilty of this as anyone else and it's really hard to break out of the cycle, although I'm trying. We need to go outside and re-connect with other people first in the real world and then we can start pushing back together on the injustice in society forced upon us by the current system. We need education, not from the establishment but from ourselves. We need to be willing to switch off the goggle box and look at the world through our own critical eyes and ask ourselves what really matters, what's really going and how do we address the problems.

Sorry for the slightly rambling reply but I get carried away with this type of thing.

Oh and instead of not voting as Russell Brand suggests how about a major campaign of ballot spoiling. Write in ""None of the above"" on your ballot papers folks, if enough people do it we'll get the establishments attentions.

And what do you expect people to do when the people preaching 'change' don't even appear to know what they want to change things to. Even less how they're supposed to achieve it by marching around causing nothing more than a slight inconvenience.

If the unions couldn't bring about serious change at the height of their influence and organisation, I don't hold much hope for a group largely made up of students dossing off lectures.

You're not being clearer by removing fluff. You're just being non-factual.

And I'm not wrong in saying many firms will loan to customers who are on JSA or other types of benefits, or otherwise unsuitable for the loan product. You haven't 'proven' me wrong by showing me 3 poor examples. As I said, many include JSA and other benefits within their definition of 'income'. 

And there is a big difference to what a lender says they do and what happens in practice. 

The market has had changes within the last 6 months as a result of the work the OFT has been doing with the Payday Compliance Review and audit process they have conducted - but it's still very far, in general, from what you are saying. The bigger lenders do tend to be better - for example someone like Wonga won't touch anyone with JSA, CCJs, etc. They can pick the 'cream of the crop' as it were - It's the mid-size and smaller lenders who accept the higher risk applicants and cause wider consumer harm.

As far as your assertion that there is a European imposed law from 2010 for 3 rollovers, that is entirely false. There is no current limit, but the OFT have put pressure on lenders to reduce their numbers, as it indicates irresponsible lending. The FCA are consulting at the moment on introducing a 2 rollover limit. I've personally seen consumers with 12 rollovers. I assume you might be referring to The Consumer Credit (EU Directive) Regulations 2010. These did bring in things like SECCI, but nothing like a rollover limit.

For me, it's really simple. I have nothing to hide. Though I know the insanely intrusive programs the data go into.


Agent Blue is sitting at his desk. Within 30 seconds of typing up a name he can have a map up. With a diagram of links coming out pointing to other places on the map. These are the people you contact regularly. He flicks a slider and now he see's dots on the map some are in dense areas and make paths, others are further out. These are the places your phone has recorded your location. He flicks another slider, he see's the people you communicate with most. He drags this info into another screen.


Here he's looking at key words, ""asthma"" and ""bdsm"" come up. One of the contact you speak to most if your wife and you discuss your son and his asthma and your private indulgences a lot. 


He clicks another button, suddenly the map is back and the maps gone mad. It's showing lines everywhere, he's clicked to include your ""friends of friends"". Turns out you're almost related (via 1 or 2 steps) to everyone in the town. He flicks a slider and now sees how you are related to what known threats. 


This is called a [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network). Social networks allow predictions and statistics. Did you know that if some of those ""nodes"" are friends of you'rs who are overweight - you yourself are more likely to be overweight? That's a statistical fact. But I bet what you didn't know, is that even friends of your friends (that you don't know directly) - their being overweight increases the chance of you being overweight. 


**important** That example's true and has been observed in research. Now we're introduced to the toolbar at the top of the program, ""terrorist"" is selected. A few moments of loading... it's not scrutinised your social network, congratulations you are ""36% likely to be a terrorist. When this reaches 40% maybe you're go onto a warning list. If you're emails or sms's have keywords maybe you'll go into another list. What other buttons are there, ""peadofile"", ""spy"", ""likely to do crime"", ""activist"" etc. There's been documented cases of activists being watched for centuries. 


This is very, very real. I dislike this it is IMMENSE power and as such requires immense responsibility. The government can't be trusted imho with that responsibility. But that's not all. Public records are regularly hacked and taken. This information has been collected, but it's not just the government that has access to it. It's like movies by companies. Leaks happen, the new ""harry potter"" might get leaked by one of the various employees with access. Just like peoples ""records"" get leaked by the government. There is a fully existent and thriving intelligence market which specialise in this - I don't recall exactly when but it was on panorama 2 years ago ish.

*Your policy does not cover the following*

All sounds very straightforward right? Well I am rechecking this section of the policy online now and it now reads:

""*11 loss of or damage to your motorcycle caused by a member of the family or household of a permitted 
rider taking your motorcycle without your permission.*""

Is it possible that they have amended the policy since then? It definitely read what the letter says it should read when I check it the other day.

So we're planning a new project... 'The State Project'
An amazing building that was closed back in 1988, after first opening its doors to the public, as a cinema way back in 1938.

Our project aim is to renovate and re-open the state by 2015.
Having a passion for theatre for many years, we hate to see such a fantastic building sit empty and unused, for many years, we need to get it back out there for everyone to enjoy.

To open the state, we would require major funding, we are looking for private funders to fund half the project, and then lottery funding will be applied for to match the private fund to create the full amount needed. 

With plans to open up the building again, its would be renovated to a standard to allow the following uses;

- Cinema – initially showing old films as it did back in its open days
- Theatre performance Venue for tours, professional productions and childrens entertainment
- Disabled and under privileged children’s events/adult’s events
- Evening Restaurant/ Day time Cafe
- Social area/Meeting Place for everyone
- Studio and rehearsal spaces for local amateur dramatics groups/dance groups
- Youth theatre skills and workshops running weekly
And most importantly a central hub for Grays

There are many other uses this building could have, and we welcome your input to what you would like to see at YOUR entertainment venue

To make such an ambitious project take off, we need your support, so sign our petition, share it with friends, to convince local private funders and the Council to back this project.

Check out the photos we have on our Facebook page of how 'The State Cinema' used to be back in its day, and how it is now, see if you can see the potential we can?

Eriksen and Holtby are more suited to play in the hole with how we are approaching things, as you pointed out Eriksen is more creative and Holtby is constantly running and is still more creative than Siggy.

Siggy is probably much more suited to play in a 4-4-1-1 behind a striker like Ade or a 4-3-3 that utilizes 2 more advanced CMs (like when he was at Swansea) where he isn't expected to be the creative force and he is allowed to take advantage of space in the middle to rattle shots on goal.  Unfortunately for Siggy, we don't utilize that type of strategy.

Really Siggy is a good player, he works hard, seems to be (and i hate using this term) ""A Top Lad"" and still seems to be learning. Really i think he is a good player who through no fault of his own has landed on a squad that isn't set up to play into his strengths and is trying to get him on the field and asking to play in a fashion that he isn't truly suited to do.

If he stays, i think you are right...he will be out left and even there i think he may start dropping down the pecking order even further.  If he goes there will be no shortage of suitors who play systems that can take advantage of his ability.

&gt; This is called a social network. Social networks allow predictions and statistics. Did you know that if some of those ""nodes"" are friends of you'rs who are overweight - you yourself are more likely to be overweight? That's a statistical fact. But I bet what you didn't know, is that even friends of your friends (that you don't know directly) - their being overweight increases the chance of you being overweight.


&gt; **important** That example's true and has been observed in research. Now we're introduced to the toolbar at the top of the program, ""terrorist"" is selected. A few moments of loading... it's not scrutinised your social network, congratulations you are ""36% likely to be a terrorist. When this reaches 40% maybe you're go onto a warning list.  If you're emails or sms's have keywords maybe you'll go into another list. What other buttons are there, ""peadofile"", ""spy"", ""likely to do crime"", ""activist"" etc. There's been documented cases of activists being watched for centuries.


&gt; This is very, very real. I dislike this it is IMMENSE power and as such requires immense responsibility. The government can't be trusted imho with that responsibility. But that's not all. Public records are regularly hacked and taken. This information has been collected, but it's not just the government that has access to it. It's like movies by companies. Leaks happen, the new ""harry potter"" might get leaked by one of the various employees with access. Just like peoples ""records"" get leaked by the government. There is a fully existent and thriving intelligence market which specialise in this - I don't recall exactly when but it was on panorama 2 years ago ish.

true,TheMentalist10,null,null,"Hello there,

I started /r/reinstatearticle8 so thought I'd chip in with a little of my own experience of apathy, both generally and of my own. 

There aren't many news stories in my lifetime that have angered me quite as much as the Snowden revelations have, and certainly none with such consistency. To that end, when I first attempted to get a bit of Reddit activism done it was with the /r/restorethefourth guys as a UK envoy of sorts. There seemed (and, disappointingly, *seems*) endemic a certain 'they know what they're doing' attitude amongst our British Redditors (and, of course, non-Redditors) which Americans, as much as we like to stereotype them as gullible fools simply don't have. My theory is that this is because of the fundamental distinction between rights and government upon which America is founded: despite their two-party, endless bickering, they always have the Constitution to fall back on and, as such, are proactive in ensuring that the government is following, not just creating, the law. I don't think the same is true of this country, and hoi polloi seem, on average, far less engaged with and knowledgeable about politics than in the old US of States.

Reinst8 (search the Sub if you're interested in the name's origins) was all I did for about a month. We had a regular core of people going on the IRC, a website in development, a social media professional who was willing to give up his time to assist, and an ever-growing subscriber base. I used the initial talk of a porn filter (which swept across Reddit, predictably, like wildfire) as a means to get people interested, talking about the deeper issues and, for the most part, it worked. Until it didn't. People, myself included, lose interest in that which is not directly relevant. I had work to do, holidays to go on and couldn't commit to idling on IRC all day as I had in the summer, writing threads, replying to comments etc. It's frankly too much work for one person for whom it isn't a full-time job. The sub lost momentum because I let it lose momentum, I'm ashamed to say, but the fact is that it shouldn't be one person, or a few people who are responsible for maintaining it and the problem, as OP notes, is simply that **not enough people care enough**.

I don't know that this is the kind of problem that we can solve ourselves. It strikes me that things aren't going to improve re: surveillance, censorship, civil liberty (and I think it would be incredibly naive to argue that we're on anything but a downwards spiral on these fronts), not of their own accord. At the same time however, as long as we have Reddit, as long as others have X-Factor, COD: Ghosts or whatever other fad devours our time and placates any latent worries we might have about the future, placing them gently out of sight and out of mind to be dealt with 'another day', we aren't going to change anything. It won't be until it's too late to change (which, I'd argue, it perhaps already is in a practical, if not ideological sense: no one gives up the amount of power GCHQ has without a fight, after all) that people will bother to try in any meaningful capacity. As long as we're well-fed, entertained, and allowed to sit in our living rooms relatively unhindered, I don't think any en masse opposition is on the cards.

This all sounds rather depressing, and it is, but it isn't the case that *nothing* can be done, just that I don't think people will bother with it. I don't want to sound self-aggrandising, but I think things were going pretty *okay* whilst I had the time to devote to the cause (subscribers growing, people talking about issues, lots of contact made to MPs etc.), and I've absolutely no relevant skills or experience. If someone who knew what they were doing took over, or at least helped those of us who are already keen to act to do something, then I think we'd be on to some progress. In fact, even if we just had a self-motivating core of people (who weren't reliant on one or two people to keep things ticking over), I think we'd see some positive steps.

All in all, it's up to the community here, and the country at large. That's democracy. Perhaps a badly-informed democracy, but a democracy nonetheless.",0,1386686467,null,0,false,0,cdy9bdn,t3_1sjffe,t1_cdy9bdn,t3_1sjffe,null,1428299929,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

For me the opposition (protest groups) lacks organisation and clarity.  As in most cases it is made of disparate groups with some overlapping principles.  Many of these groups still have their own agendas which do not quite line up with mine and I have a feeling this is going to be true with a lot people.  I don't want to walk around with people wearing Guy Fawkes masks and don't have time for some of Occupy's fluffy ideals to name a couple.

The only solution I can see is to present a simplified united front which isn't happening.  Pick 2 or 3 three strong points which are unlikely to ostracise the mass public and try and win on those first.  I'm not sure what these should be, but I'm sure people brighter than me have thought about it.  Get the easy one under the belt before you take the more nuanced approach.

They also need to make it as easy as possible to get involved.  Stuff ready to go, that is easy to delegate to anyone and which have provable results.  With this there also needs to be strong leadership from someone.  Someone who is charismatic and can motivate people.  I watched some of the speeches from the 5th November protest and it's just painful listening to them.  I'm on board with quite a lot of what they are saying, but they make me want to stop listening, instead of getting out there and enacting change.  Brand's rant a month ago got a surprising amount of people talking about it with a small amount of content.  Imagine that with the good content and a more legitimate presentation.

Jose Mourinho plays down Chelsea's chances of winning this season's Champions League.

""We are not considered one of the favourites to win. The favourites in my opinion are Bayern Munich because they are the current winners and have the same players, new manager and unbelievable stability.

""Barcelona, Real Madrid too - these teams are clearly in front. But any one in the last eight can win. It is an interesting competition as always.""

 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
Jose Mourinho clarifies his 'we're in trouble' comment after the Stoke defeat at the weekend: ""I don't remember the words. No. If we are in trouble, there are 17 teams in more trouble than us. The team that played in the first half [against Stoke] has to be winning 4-0 and at half time we were 1-1. Why? Because we did not score the goals we should and conceded from a mistake, so yes we were in trouble.

""We are creating a lot, we are playing a lot of nice football, we have to finish off opponents. In this moment if you train defensive corners against the dummies, I think one dummy will score. All the rebounds go to the opponents, so I think they will go to the dummies too. I meant we were in trouble in that game - it was unbelievable how we lost that game.

""I think this league is wonderful. Everybody around Europe must be very jealous about [our league]. We don't know the first, the second, the relegation. That gives everybody the chance to be in the fight for their objectives. We are not in trouble because we are there.""

Jose Mourinho on his strike options of Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba: "" We have three strikers which is the perfect number. Sometimes I like two on the bench, sometimes I like to play with two. All of them are getting minutes and matches and they are all working very well for the team.

""But the number of goals in the Premier League is not what I want or what they want - that is obvious. Between them they have four goals but strikers also live on other things and they are giving me other things, no doubt. But we have to try to improve and wait for better days to score more goals and feel happier.""

Jose Mourinho on Ashley Cole: ""I know him well, it is easy to feel that he is not happy, not comfortable with the situation, but the way he trains is super professional, as always.

Jose Mourinho says he will rest ""three"" players for the final Group E match against Steaua Bucharest.

""I don't want to call it rotation because when you say rotate comes with an idea that the team is weak. That's not the case,"" says the Portuguese boss. ""I won't play the same team as the last match because some players need a little rest. We have an important game on Saturday [against Crystal Palace] and then got a League Cup quarter-final tie [at Sunderland] on Tuesday.""

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho says he believes already-eliminated Steaua Bucharest will not visit Stamford Bridge thinking that defeat is a foregone conclusion.

""I read somewhere that the Steaua coach says he is coming here with his best team and best players to try and finish the group in the best possible way. I would do the same in his position.

""They have been important in the group phase because they took four points from Basel and also drew against Schalke. They were not a team - which we always see in the Champions League - who finished with zero points. They have got three draws and will try to do same tomorrow. We have to try and win game and finish first.""

More from Branislav Ivanovic: ""This Champions League group is a group of four very good teams. A lot of things in the Champions League is very different in other competitions. We hope we can finish at the top. We played Steaua maybe three times last year, they have great players and we have to be careful about that. They play a very offensive game, have a lot of positive things in the team and that is why we have to stay focussed.""

 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
Chelsea have conceded several goals in recent games and defender Branislav Ivanovic knows it is important the Blues improve their defending.

""It is very important to communicate on the pitch,"" he says. ""The last two games were very open. It gives stability to the team when you do not concede a goal and this is important. We know where we have made mistakes and we talk after the game about where we can improve.""

On Wednesday's opponents Steaua Bucharest, he adds: ""I think it is a very important game. We want to finish top in group. We have to be 100% concentrated, because they have nothing to lose.""

The other issue regardless of traffic is that a predictable number of people will ride teh bus.  During the summer, I remember during rush hour they had clearly identified that more people get on the bus and launching one bus at a time would not be enough to take all the people at all the stops in oxford.  As a result, they used to send two busses in tandem so that there are still seats available when they get to Thornhill.  They were still sending a bus every 10 minutes but it's just that when they sent a bus, they actually sent 2 so that there were enough seats to meet the demand.  I've seen it happening once in awhile over the last month or so but not nearly as frequently.  My complaint is that there are never enough seats and busses are often full by St. Clements roundabout so noone can even get on at headington or thornhill regardless of timing because when the bus does come, it's full.

This is cute, but rather a misrepresentation of what goes on, I think. But, no matter, let's take what you said at face value anyway. I want to focus on this, actually:

&gt; A few moments of loading... it's not scrutinised your social network, congratulations you are ""36% likely to be a terrorist.

Right. Okay. So what? I for one am overjoyed at the prospect of the government keeping tabs on people who are 36% likely to bomb the tube, or whatever. Aren't you?

&gt; This is very, very real. I dislike this it is IMMENSE power and as such requires immense responsibility. The government can't be trusted imho with that responsibility.

Why not? In order to effectively govern, we give the government powers over us that ordinary citizens do not have. We do this because we trust that the government is competent in what it does, and that it attempts to act in the best interests of the people. I believe that it *is* competent. If you do not, I am curious why you are ignoring the ""real issue"" (the government is not to be trusted with any power) while you protest this much more minor one (the government has this method of investigation that I do not agree with).

&gt; This information has been collected, but it's not just the government that has access to it. It's like movies by companies. Leaks happen, the new ""harry potter"" might get leaked by one of the various employees with access. Just like peoples ""records"" get leaked by the government. There is a fully existent and thriving intelligence market which specialise in this - I don't recall exactly when but it was on panorama 2 years ago ish.

This is a much more interesting point. I'm not opposed to the creation of records that help an agency carry out its function (e.g. health records, tax records, surveillance records etc etc etc), and I do agree that we need to act to protect these records. If the information is easily leakable it's really a question of governmental competence - proper steps need to be taken to ensure that information of this kind is protected. I'm not naive enough to think we can protect this information indefinitely. But please do remember that if there is indeed a market for it, it's at risk of being leaked *regardless of who collects the information*. There have been many stories of private firms' records being leaked. Funnily enough, one of the things we could do is use our surveillance network to give us greater power to prevent people from leaking information. Another thing we can do is set a legal precedent for the prosecution of individuals who *do* leak large quantities of government data to the press, such as one Mister E.

Some tough decisions in there. I think both Cahill and Terry need a break at some point, but unfortunately Luiz is still injured. I'd put Ivan at CB, except he needs some rest too. That being said, I think that Kalas and Omeruo (Omeruo in particular) are good players, and deserve to play. Cole should be well rested, and up for the game. Ramires-Mikel is pretty self-explanatory, our best/most consistent pivot methinks. De Bruyne to finally get another chance, Mata keeps his place, and Willian rounds out the band of 3. I'd like to have Hazard in on his recent form, but don't want to burn him out after two performances where he really pushed himself. I might prefer Schuerlle too if he's fit, which I'm not sure on. Ba to capitalize on the poor form of Eto'o and Torres, and the crossing of De Bruyne.

Forming a new party of the left is counterintuitive. Because of first past the post, all it would do is further fragment the progressive vote. The Lib Dems already cannibalise enough votes that would otherwise probably go to Labour, and because they couldn't get a coalition together back in 2009, now we're stuck with what we have now.

As much as I'd love the rise of a new party, like the Pirate Party (but with less of an emphasis on copyright law and more of an emphasis on everything else), it just wouldn't work until the UK had some form of proportional representation. That being said, I *really* don't think the answer is not voting. In my opinion, if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the outcome. Screw the arguments about it being some right guaranteed by bloodshed that you're too cowardly to honour - I think the real argument is simpler than that. 

What's the real plan? Because of the way the voting system really works, I think the best option is to throw weight behind Labour, but to try and transform the party away from the neoliberal third-way Blair bullshit that contributed to the current situation. I'd recommend joining the party so you can vote in leadership elections and try to strongly influence policies at party conferences and whatnot. It's only through a concerted effort that we'll get the kinds of policies needed out of Labour, and hopefully turn it back to its roots (although not pure socialism - I'm more of a social democracy kind of person). Hell, join and see what you can do about standing as a candidate in your constituency, or in another one if yours is a landslide Tory stronghold.

Revolution very rarely seems to accomplish what it sets out to do, especially because people who disagree with the government tend to have wildly varying views as to exactly what is wrong. Working to reform the democratic process also seems to be the best way to ensure that people don't lose everything in the midst of some violent upheaval.

We need to recognise this is something were not going to change overnight. We have a ConDem government so short of a vote of no confidence, this fact isn't going to change until their parlimentary term ends.

First we need to recognise the beliefs which bind the young and disillusioned, those whom strive to reduce inequality, protect freedoms, help those in need and prioritise improving living standards for the many. I believe for the short term the most pragmatic option is to vote greens where sensible, but in the majority of cases vote labou, we need to kick the Tories out. As for a longer term goal I really don't know, do we form a new movement, based on a shared belief. Do we organise to lobby the labour party for a future we wish to help build. The only thing that's clear is the desire to change the current situation although commendable is not enough, we need to organise to best utilise our message, make our voices heard and tell the government we will not continue down this path we've been on for far too long.

In isolation it might be misconstrued as harassment or abuse, so that doesn't seem practical to me. 

What I've noticed is that a lot of people, the majority even, are very dissatisfied with their MPs (who don't seem to represent their constituents any more, not on meaningful issues) ... and occasionally people will express that. 

Protesting isn't the outlet it should be with the police (and other authorities) coming down hard on protesters - considering kettling and other forms of stifling of public demonstrations. 

Then again, protesting has evolved in response. People wise up and react in innovative ways. During protests I've been on in recent years, they've been much more spontaneous (if there aren't easily identifiable leaders, it's harder to shut protests down as people demonstrate in amorphous groups and get away from police more easily). 

The 2011 riots started in London, but spread very quickly and without very much notice. It's almost as if people felt a sentiment without it being communicated to them. 

People (regardless of how they acted) just acted. There weren't observable commands (Blackberry Messenger communications aside). People felt something happening and got involved. Spontaneous movements like that are very hard to suppress. Which I find heartening. 

The authorities are always a step behind with media the way it is at the moment. It can be hours or days before they find out where disorder is occurring because individual Twitter and facebook accounts are difficult to monitor - and demonstrations can take place with very little notice.

Any punishment to a father is visited to some extent onto the child. If I'm held on remand for a month, that's a month without my child. If I get fined, then that's less to spend on my child. And if (as in this case) I'm obviously guilty, then it's ultimately my fault.

&gt;Deportation for something that is essentially a bit silly would be hugely disproportionate.

Putting people at risk is always easily dismissed as 'silly' with hindsight - which is why you can't get away with not wearing a seatbelt using the 'well, nobody got hurt' defence in that situation either.

If you're talking about the boat race itself being a bit silly...well, it's one of the biggest boating events of the year. Emily Davison thought the derby was a bit silly and so decided to protest about a much more serious issue on a blind bend, and we know how that turned out...

And in any case, if we're going to allow any sporting event to be interrupted by anyone with a grievance no matter how petty (like this guy)...other people's enjoyment shouldn't be treated as disposable simply because *you* don't think it's important and therefore can be disrupted. If this guy was that bothered about big money, etc. - he could have gone and disrupted a football match. That would have been much more entertaining...but probably not for him.

I think City can overtake them with a win better than 3-1 but that's so unlikely to happen with Bayern at home that I think most of us aren't even really considering it. This is the first time City have ever qualified in the champions league, the previous two years they had really tough groups and didn't make the cut.

City have been playing some good attacking football this year under the new manager Manuel Pellegrini. At home they've been really good, beating Man United and Spurs easily. The only bad home result actually came against Bayern, where we were dominated quite badly and lost 3-1.

Away from home City have been doing pretty badly though. There's been some bad luck involved but the results have been pretty unacceptable. 

In terms of players;

Joe Hart, the goalkeeper, has made a few high profile errors and was dropped to the bench a few weeks ago. I think he's going to start tonight though, so he'll be looking to try and impress and get back into the team.

Sergio Aguero, striker, been playing really well lately. Scoring lots of goals and doing everything else good too.

Yaya Toure, midfield, not playing tonight due to suspension, so his absence might be noticed because he's a very important player for City.

Samir Nasri, midfield, was underwhelming in his first two seasons but has been in the form of his life lately. 

Vincent Kompany, defense, captain and another very important player. Not sure if he's playing or not because he's only just come back from injury. He's had a lot of injuries the past year and his absence has been felt too.

&gt; Things were ok

No, they objectively weren't. This is significant, because every time people hear ""things are getting worse, Britain is on the brink etc"",  they stop listening, because they know that isn't true. 

&gt; Then it we engaged in an illegal war under false pretences with the US.

This is a good point, but it happened years ago, things have changed. Libya was under UN resolution, everyone is still officially holding back from Syria. Mali was under UN supported by ECOWAS, CAR is humanitarian. Thing have changed, though you might see a more radical change in peoples attitudes if the Americans try to do it again. 

&gt; Then we started buying out banks while simultaneously lowering support for students while freezing public sector wages (doctors, midwifes, nurses etc). Meanwhile the bankers at the banks that the public bought out - got very high bonuses (that's not an exaggeration).

This is another good point, the banks should have been bailed out differently with more authoritative conditions. However I think people generally didn't get as angry as you are for two reasons. One - enough people kept their jobs, albeit with paycuts etc so they weren't as interested in rocking the boat because they were still worried about job security. Two - the bonuses, people are used to seeing those figures in the news. Footballers, celebrities, etc, people are used to hearing about their extravagant salaries, and So when the bankers got it, it wasn't a new grievance. People weren't shocked enough by it, even if they were annoyed.

&gt; Then we found that R.Murdock and NewsCorp were VERY entwined with both our government office and our police force - buying luxuries left and right.

Firstly not many people were surprised, secondly not very many people were actually affected by phone hacking, thirdly, no one liked Newscorp anyway, there was no betrayal, people won't get that angry if you tell them that the guy who they think is a cunt, is a cunt. Besides Brooks and some others are in trouble, heads are being rolled. 

&gt; then we find out our state run media BBC - fresh from the churning 'Terrorist' and Iraq propaganda - then went into the business of actively covering up peadofiles. 

BBC is independently run, most people know this. Calling it 'state run' like some kind of insult just doesn't ring true. ""Churning out terrorist and Iraq propaganda"" also doesn't ring true enough for people to get annoyed. 

The Saville thing is very complicated and I think it is unfair to just blame the BBC as a whole for it, that strikes me as the easy option. Besides for all the shit you guys give the police, Operation Yewtree was extremely well run, and got 40 years of abuse out in the open, and made many arrests. 

&gt; Voting for 'change' and a the hope of low/no student fees somehow raised them by 300%

We were in an economic crunch, they had to decide whether it was worse pissing off students or pissing off the wider public even more. They decided the wider public was more important. I'm a student and I agree with their decision. Why should even more benefits and public services budgets be cut instead? Why should students be given an easy ride while more police are fired, more job seekers get even less, disabled carers are squeezed even harder? I think students should have been smart enough not to expect that promise to be delivered. 

&gt; Mixed with the pay freezes and economic injustice we tried to protest. Well that didn't work[1] - link just shows police brutality...

Our police force is one of the best in the world. Your idea of ""police brutality"" is made ridiculous by what we see on the news every night, let alone the uncensored stuff that gets posted on the internet. The public regularly sees reports of genuine police brutality from China, Quebec, al around the Middle East, America, South America, Africa, Russia in particular, who do far far worse things. Why are the public supposed see kettling as brutality when our actual idea of brutality is so much worse? Many people also don't fully engage with the ideas of the protestors or even disagree with the protests entirely as many of which have featured elements of violence, destruction of property or [acts of unfathomably low intelligence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12159581), all which don't help the causes involved. 

&gt; Then we have people being arrested for social media updates

This is ridiculous, people should be more annoyed about this. But again, there aren't that many arrests and the people who are getting arrested are usually disgusting fuckwits who don't make great posterboys for civil rights. It's hard for people to care enough about them to protest. They aren't exactly Mandela. 

&gt; We have people being arrested and detained for planning to stage a peaceful protest in London during the Queens jubilee

Don't know about this, but I'm sure there is more to the story.

&gt; The GCHQ/NSA/Snowden spying scandal and of course the internet filter.

NSA thing isn't anywhere near as interesting as Guardian readers think. It's mass aggregate surveillance. Some bits of information are recorded, they aren't specifically listened to. No one was that surprised, people have been making pop-culture jokes about it for years - one example - simpsons movie for example. It isn't the earth shattering news the guardian makes it out to be. I'll prove it isn't that intersting - You remember when the Telegraph released the expenses scandal? It was front page news of every newspaper for weeks and weeks. The NSA stuff makes the front page of other newspapers now and then, but nowhere near to the same extent as the expenses stuff.  

 People just aren't that bothered about it. Data which I may have thought was only accessible to the private companies who sell it to their various partners and clients, is also sold the government and kept on another server somewhere. I just don't care. Maybe I should care more, but I and most people don't. 

The internet filter is a joke, but that's just it, it is a joke. I can't get that angry about something I find so misguided and stupid that its funny. I mean they blocked pirate bay, and I haven't been on there in at least two-three minutes. 


&gt; The UK refusing to abide by the UN's notion that internet privacy is a human right.

UN rights get broken by everyone everywhere including the UN. Looking to the UN's human rights as some sacrosanct unbreakable pact we have betrayed is naive. Human rights have been widely criticised as counter productive and impotent anyway, so appealing to them isn't very valid. Plus most people once again are apathetic towards it.

&gt; We have the Guardian which is immeasurably awesome.

A lot of people including me would disagree with you on that. Plus if you have a genuine interest in politics, why would you read some pandering sensationalist piece of shit like that?  For basic news, fine. But for any analysis or indepth stuff, go on the internet. There are so many websites that do fair, balanced and easy to read articles on the same stuff. Don't just take the Guardian's basic, simplified, sensationalist article as gospel because it leans your way, go out looking for stuff that disagrees with you, that argues a different point, looks at things a different way. I use several sites, though I love the analysis on insightcrime.org and foreignpolicy.com. 

&gt; Some may argue it's not our nature or culture and we're more fitted to ""enduring"". 

I don't think we are, the British have just always been very suspicious and skeptical of authority. So when stuff like this comes out, we are't surprised. In some other countries, people tend to be much more positive, so when some company or the government fucks up, they feel genuinely hurt and betrayed. We tend to feel vindicated because it means our moaning was correct. 

&gt; Keep Calm And Carry On"" - I absolutely hate that saying now.

I absolutely 100% agree with you on this, people who display it to be edgy should be hung, drawn and quartered, it's so fucking annoying.

Two points.

One: All force is utilised to exert power over another, whether that other is stronger or weaker than oneself. I picked The War of the Third coalition because this is an example where you had the Grande Armée of half a million lads sitting on the shores waiting to pop over to Dover, so the UK went to war against Napoleon to prevent these half a million lads popping over. Of course that was an act intended to rob Napoleon of his power, but you say that as if it goes without saying that such a thing is always immoral or a negative, which is certainly not self-evident. What were we stealing of France during that war besides their power to invade us? Would you call such a thing immoral?

Two (my main point): You're obviously attempting to argue that war is evil and militaries shouldn't exist, yet you're restricting your arguments to the UK military. Are there militaries which have only ever been used for immoral goals? Most likely. But I don't need to disprove that. All I need to do is devise a situation in which any hypothetical miltary *could* be used morally to make your argument defunct, which is perfectly easy (and I'll go to the length of actually typing one out if you'd like but I'm sure you know where I'd be going).

If your beef is specifically with the UK military then I'll bow out of the argument, not because I agree but just because I think the argument which would follow would be quite tedious to me, but it seems like you oppose the existence of all military forces as immoral, and I think you've got a long way to go to justify that.",0,1386693568,null,0,false,0,cdybxyu,t3_1sjbjt,t1_cdybxyu,t1_cdybp78,null,1428298703,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

All you are doing is taking away from what could have been a look into the internal workings of an industry that is stigmatized so others can make informed decisions instead of going with the angry mob as usual.


If i wanted to pick the cream of the crop i would not have money shop mentioned anywhere as they kicked and screamed so much they got thrown out of the BCCA and started their own association called the CFA. The straw that broke the camels back? They tried to not put dates on the loans to bypass the 3 roll-over limit. So yea, if they could screw people harder they would and i think their FAQ gives a detailed set of reason why they can't.

Yes, I was referring to the ECCD (European consumer credit directive). A few of its changes include:
The SECCI, the adequate explanation (both verbal and written) and the rules regarding responsible lending. Part of responsible lending was ensuring customers are not ""locked into perpetual debt"" which is why hardship and roll over limits have been given a front row seat. 

I'm not saying we are all good but i am saying the entire industry does not deserve the hate it boils up in people, yourself included clearly.

I don't entirely disagree with you, arguably they do have better protection of freedom of speech, however there are many laws/legal precedents that do [restrict freedom of speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States#Types_of_speech_restrictions) and they currently don't have a culture conducive to people expressing their freedom of speech in many matters (ie. it may not be illegal, but you may face a lot of social pressure not to speak out about/criticise certain topics). And while an individuals freedom of speech is usually well protected, the same cannot be said for the media and the internet who are often subject to attempts at censorship.

I'd argue that spending such an inordinate amount of money on something just on the off-chance of something happening is a bit odd.

I'd argue that the chance of old-fashioned invasion in the modern world is virtually none - given the effectiveness of economics alone, there would be no point.

But all militaries in the modern world are used for aggression and not defence aren't they?

If we were talking about a standing army who's only purpose was to defend borders - that would be one thing, but what we're talking about here is more a formalised system of aggression based on the capability of one large economy to oppress another by being able to afford more guns (to put it very simplistically - you see what I'm getting at, I'm sure?).

If you accept this axiom (which I don't expect to you to - but that's what my reading of history leads me to believe), then no country can justify their military.

Our fullbacks are very important to our attack and Agger/Sakho cannot get down the flank to bring width to our attack the same way Enrique and Flannagan do.  It would basically remove that side of the field as a serious attacking threat (since we typically like to use inside forwards over a more traditional winger and the player on that side is usually Coutinho who will always pinch inside) and make us predictable.  If we make some changes to our attacking strategy and take a lot of forward moving responsibility off of our fullbacks then perhaps one of Agger/Sakho can have a go at LB but I don't really see us doing that. 

That said I think Skrtel/Sakho is the right decision for the big games coming up.  Both are in really good form and look like they work well together.  Sakho has something of calming aura about him it seems too, which is good to have.  He's a good leader and while he's new to the club those qualities can go a long way to keeping our defense well organized and focused.

EDIT:

Cleveland Police response, seems like I was spot  on:

At around 11:30pm on 1st August 2013, police were called to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a pub on Stockton High Street. The report said that the man had left the premises and was engaged in a dispute with a woman on Stockton High Street.

A male police officer arrived at the scene and was head-butted by the man and left injured on the floor. A female police officer attempted to handcuff the man, when she was kicked and head-butted.

Other officers at the scene attempted to restrain him so that he could be handcuffed and taken safely into police custody. Officers have said that the man was trying to bite them and was digging his nails into their arms whilst they were attempting to handcuff him.

In this case officers have used hands on tactics that are trained and recognised, they have not resorted to other tactics such as taser or baton strike which can be seen to be higher on the use of force continuum. 

Controlling the arms and head of a violent person is not easy particularly when they are in a heightened state and have just assaulted someone. 

Punches to the muscle group in the arm in order to “deaden” it and thus allow it to be moved to the rear are appropriate when encountering resistance from the arms. Once the man’s arms are secured he was then put into the back of a van safely, reducing the possibility of injury to him or others.

Cleveland Police Professional Standards Department have viewed the footage and are satisfied that the officers acted in accordance with legislation and their training when dealing with the man.

A Cleveland Police spokesperson said: “Officers operating in Stockton Town Centre know they are on CCTV and value the evidence gathering and support it gives them, they often direct where the cameras should point via the police radio link into the CCTV control room.

“Officers deal with extremely violent individuals on a daily basis who could be under the influence of drink or drugs, which also has a part to play in increasing the offender’s mindset and strength.

“There is a danger that this footage could be taken out of context on first viewing, but it is important to view it with full knowledge of the facts.”

The man pleaded guilty at court to two counts of assaulting a constable in the execution of his or her duty and possession of cannabis. He was given a 12 month community order with supervision, a four week curfew, costs and compensation to police.﻿",0,1386695828,null,0,false,0,cdycy62,t3_1sk3th,t1_cdycy62,t1_cdycwx0,null,1428298234,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Never said there was.

&gt;I'd argue that spending such an inordinate amount of money on something just on the off-chance of something happening is a bit odd.

Ok. I disagree. Provision of internal and external security are the foundation of the state.

&gt;I'd argue that the chance of old-fashioned invasion in the modern world is virtually none - given the effectiveness of economics alone, there would be no point.

Uh, wikipedia lists 7 serious invasions since the year 2000. So just shy of 4% of all nations on the planet have been invaded in a little over a decade, and human kind is the most peaceful it's ever been. Those odds actually don't look so awesome to me.

&gt;But all militaries in the modern world are used for aggression and not defence aren't they?

Are you asking or claiming? Obviously I think that's an absurd point, but to claim such a thing you'd need to provide some argument or reasoning.

&gt;If we were talking about a standing army who's only purpose was to defend borders - that would be one thing, but what we're talking about here is more a formalised system of aggression based on the capability of one large economy to oppress another by being able to afford more guns (to put it very simplistically - you see what I'm getting at, I'm sure?).

Well, I hate to stay on the topic of British wars but I'm most well versed in them. So take the good old Falklands war, there you had an economically inferior nation invading British land, and the British military being used to defend and retake that land. No oppression of anyone involved, no claiming of Argentine resources, no stealing Argentine land. What you're arguing *generally* is accurate for *one* side of a given conflict, but quite clearly not both, and that seems to be a major hole in your argument. How can you claim that all militaries are aggressors when by definition an aggressor is met by a defender?

&gt;Thank you for your email about extremism and civil liberties.

&gt;I believe that it is vital that we confront the poisonous extremist ideology, including that spread via the internet, which can lead people to violence and run counter to fundamental British values. The Government has defined extremism as ""vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs"". I hope this definition demonstrates that while as citizens we must be eternally vigilante against sacrificing basic liberty in the same of security, this Government strikes a sensible balance between the two.

-
&gt;The Coalition has also taken a number of important steps to &lt;assert?&gt; its commitment to the hard-won civil liberties of UK citizens, including passing the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Respect for civil liberties is always an important consideration during policy development, and the Government's counter-terrorism response reflects its commitment to protect the people of this country, and our interests overseas, in a way that is consistent with core British values of individual liberty.

&gt;Thank you again for taking the time to contact me. If I can be of further help on this issue or any other, please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Robert Martinez is all about the ""School of Science"" approach - David Moyes, to be fair to him, did sometimes have the team playing nice football, but against teams like Man Utd and Arsenal he would revert back to the ""Dogs of war"" attitude - a tactic that worked sometimes (we did surprisingly well against Man City, for example) but also left us with such long periods without away wins at Man Utd and Arsenal.

&gt;The problem is that the safeguard fund only holds £1.8m,... which covers £117m of loans, meaning the fund covers 1.5 per cent of the applicable loan book. 

if it was a regulated bank, Zopa would need to keep a fund 10% the size of its book (and savers would be covered by a government guarantee).

With Lescott you get a decent defender, but that's about it - he's not going to draw in neutrals, or sell merchandise, (without wanting to sound horribly insensitive) he's ugly as sin so probably not the man to plaster all over subway carriages, and at his best he'll be solid but unspectacular on the pitch.  I'd be happy to accept a bit of a drop in quality and get most of that from a non-DP.

With even an older, slower Yaya you'd get a star - a name to slap on coffee mugs, a player that will do the spectacular on the pitch and generate interest (and thus revenue) off it.  Also, aside from his bizarre ears, he's not a bad-looking lad.

With Guidetti you potentially get something even better than Yaya.  When players come to MLS from Europe they're typically either has-beens or never-gonna-bes.  Bringing Guidetti over is an opportunity to say ""come and see the *next* big thing"" because he is a much-hyped young player who *may* go on to be a superstar (I'm not sure he *will*, but he *may*).  On top of that, he's going to score goals, he's got enough genuine charisma and command of the English language (his Swedcunian accent aside) to make something of a splash as a celebrity as much as a footballer.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;That is to say a military met my a greater opposing military is pretty much useless - assuming we can agree than technology has made tactics almost moot? If you have better/more guns, you win.

Absolutely not. Resources are important, but a numerically and technologically inferior force can defeat a superior one. Look at Afghan.

&gt;If China wanted to ""invade"" the UK tomorrow (physically rather than economically, obviously - it's already done that!) it could do so with more or less hassle.

Again, not necessarily. Firstly because we have nukes we could probably stop them outright, secondly because they lack any serious heavy lifting capacit.

&gt;The reverse is not true, therefore our military might is only ever used to attack weaker states for motivations of profit (cause why else would you do that?).

That ignores the concept of a weaker or roughly equivalently powerful nation invading or attacking a part of the UK. It also ignores the concept of collective defence of allies or humanitarian aid/interventionism (something which I'm sure you don't believe in, but I don't need to prove it happens, just that it can happen in a thought experiment, to be correct here). 

You're drawing conclusions from very limited examples, which I'd argue you're intentionally limiting in order to justify a belief you already held, or at least desire to hold.

&gt;If we were at risk of invasion from France or some other similar nation, I'd agree - but we're not - the economics would make no sense.

But that's completely irrelevant to the point. Morality does not change with each little situation.

You would agree that the concept of a military could be just if it so happened that one sovereign nation on this planet would potentially invade another, but because the two sovereign nations in question aren't the ones you're cherry picking, you're saying that militaries are unjust. I mean, really man, I'm not attempting to be rude here but you *really* need to go back to square one with your line of thinking here.

&gt;Therefore the modern military is simply an aggressive expression of a state's financial might and therefore indefensible morally - in my opinion of course.

Yeah, I got that last part down. Even with your suppositions which, frankly, are relatively weak on their own, one doesn't arrive logically at the conclusion you've drawn.

true,gnutrino,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Your obsession with ""getting the tories out"" just looks at the past through rose-tinted lenses and further contributes to the political musical chairs that is the 2 party system.

Not really, it's a straight up pragmatic response to the first past the post system. Splitting the left wing/progressive/whatever-you-want-to-call-it vote even further won't make anything any better and neither will blaming people for reacting rationally to the voting system that we have. Ironically we may be about to see an example of why FPTP is bad if UKIP manages to take a significant amount of Tory votes and end up letting Labour saunter into power unopposed (contrary to popular belief, conservatives are people too and don't deserve to suffer due to a bad voting system either. Even if they did throw their support behind that system in the recent referendum).

But the British people were given the option to change the voting system and refused it, I really don't know what can be done after that. My only hope is that people voted ""No"" because of ignorance and they still don't really think the current system is in any way acceptable. After all no less an illustrious figure than Jeremy Paxman was calling for a ""none of the above"" option on ballot papers as though you need someone's permission to spoil your ballot; what chance is there that the average Joe understands how the system works? Well I can hope anyway.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Pretty poor article in my opinion, whilst it goes into a number of reasons for him not starting- it doesn't discuss the most pertinent and relevant one: our system. 

The fact is that Deulofeu doesn't fit into the standard strategic system that Martinez is favouring in most of the games so far. Whilst he has shown willing to shift this style (for example vs Stoke), most of our games thus far this season have been very much pressure based. 

What we have done is started games fast, actively closed down the opposition on the ball and generally made it very difficult for a team to generate momentum. As good as Deulofeu is, he is really not the player for this system. 

He is someone who works amazingly on the break, his link up with Barry and Barkley has been stunning when he has played. They receive the ball after the breakdown of an oppositions attack, and quickly distribute it to him out wide- and he uses his pace and confidence to create an overload in the oppositions final third, which is amazingly tough to defend against. 

Whilst this is a fantastic tactic, it is pretty much the inverse of the philosophy of football that Martinez is trying to transition to. Whilst swift counters are vital to any pressure cooker style (something that Spurs are struggling with), it is almost impossible to have a player like Lukaku play along side Gerard, as they both lack the ability to close down, break up play and work an intricate passing game as much as the gaffer would like. 

If we want to continue using this system (which I feel is smart in tougher games)- creating chances with sustained pressure rather than speed, I don't think that Deulofeu is going to figure an awful lot in the starting line ups. Whilst he could come in for Mirallas, I feel that the all round game the Belgian has is much more complete; boding well for his as a starter. 

He will start however against teams who struggle with ball retention (so we might not need the additional pressure that a Pienaar can give), and continue to appear late in the game, when the opposition will be tiring due to the constant pressure put on them. 

From what I have heard from those who watched him at Barca B, his all round game has improved dramatically, even in the short time he has been with us. I think the pressure of knowing he is not a shoe in for starting has driven him to work as hard as possible (where he may have stagnated destroying souls at Barca B), so perhaps some of the holes in his game will be sealed up sooner rather than later and he will become a nailed on starter by the end of the season. 

---

Whilst we are never going to have him on a permanent deal, this could be the start of a 'special relationship' between us and Barca. Under Martinez we play the sort of system they love, and clearly have the staff on board to develop the players in the way they would like. It is not unrealistic to think that Deulofeu could be the first of many young talents coming to Everton to cut their teeth.

Whilst it is not ideal to be a development club, I am actually happy that we get to see a potential future Ballon d'Or winner on the pitch every other Saturday. And you never know, if he goes back to Barca and struggles; we would probably be top of his list of places to go to.

Comments in the thread actually say the same, and the OP agrees.

Statistically, it's not at all valid.

Think about it like this, there are 84 possible outcomes, but, there is 1 that has a 90% chance of occuring, another that has 5%, and the other 82 outcomes make up the remaining 5%.

Now, lets say those two outcomes that are the 90% chance one and the 5% chance one are the ones where liverpool finish 5th, the rest being the ones where we finish 2-4th. 

There you go, we have a 95% chance of finishing in 5th place, even though there are only 2 outcomes that result in us finishing 5th out of 84.

If you treat it like you are saying, we would have a 2.5% chance of coming 5th, when using weighting, we actually have a 95% chance (in my example).

That is an exaggeration, but it proves the point that statistically, it really isnt at all valid.

My analogy is saying you cant simply go ""Oh I see, there are two outcomes, therefore a 50% chance of each one"", because that is treating them weighted equally. That simply isn't how stats works.

Indeed. An issue that could easily be appended to OP's list.

I won't accept that if everyone was up in arms things would be exactly the same.

Talk about stunning ignorance and stupidity.

No defence lawyer is disproving anything. They are just making arguments and sales pitches in a hope to convince the jury to make a decision in their favour.

Remember: **adversarial** system.

A juror isn't part of the adversarial system. They are not looking to find arguments one way or the other. So if they find evidence they can use that when weighing up their decision.

No lawyer is going to present evidence that doesn't help their case - even if it is material. So a juror who doesn't have a vested interest either way should be entitled to discover what the self-interested lawyers didn't want them to know.

Again: treat jurors as people. The *whole point* of a jury is to provide real people that make a decision about their fellow man.

Here's what the [LGBT rights in Scotland wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Scotland#Same-sex_marriage ) says:

&gt;On 25 July 2012, the Scottish Government announced that it will legalise same-sex marriage, pending the outcome of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. The move was announced despite the opposition by the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church in Scotland. Although Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move as the ""right thing to do"", she reassured churches that they would not be forced to perform same-sex marriages. During the consultation phase, ministers received over 19,000 messages from constituents about the issue.

&gt;On 27 June 2013, the Scottish Government introduced the Marriage and Civil Partnerships Bill (Scotland) in the Scottish Parliament.

&gt;On 17 July 2013, after several months of going through the parliamentary process, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill received Royal Assent, which will legalise same-sex marriage in England and Wales. LGBT rights campaigners declared that they would continue the campaign for equal marriage rights in both Scotland and Northern Ireland.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"&gt;If the website teaches how to make bombs or talks about attacking ""darkies"" then by all means ban it.

You really have to weigh up freedom verses safety here. In my opinion, banning websites that teach people how to make bombs are relatively harmless because only a very small number of people are going to use that information for malicious purposes, and those who intend to make bombs are going to find a way no matter how many websites you block. For example, images of child sexual abuse are illegal but it doesn't seem to stop dedicated paedophiles from finding it, so I'd be really sceptical of any attempt to block what is essentially just scientific information. You'll take away the rights of a lot of people for the benefit of almost nobody with this.

Then on the issue of websites talking about attacking ""darkies"", the problem with any law prohibiting speech is that it always ends up being misused. We have teenagers being arrested for ""racism"" on Twitter and guests on BBC Question Time being questioned for harmless jokes about Welsh people. The law doesn't understand nor does it care about humour. /r/niggers was the perfect example of a quite tongue-in-cheek website that would undoubtedly be labelled criminally ""racist"" by police. But it was so ridiculous that only an idiot could take it as anything other than a place with a very dark sense of humour.

The only websites I would like to see blocked are those distributing criminally obscene material or propaganda from banned groups such as Al-Qaeda. Anything else should be up to the courts.",0,1386705938,null,0,false,0,cdyhq22,t3_1sk0u0,t1_cdyhq22,t1_cdybzyv,null,1428282333,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can stop buying Murdoch's newspapers, you can withdraw your licence fee and stop watching the BBC. You can set yourself up in half an hour with an encrypted email service and a VPS / TOR to prevent casual government data collection.  The Iraq war you can also check off your list no matter your opinon, unless you've found way to travel back in time.  That's a fair chunk of the list...

&gt;Indeed. An issue that could easily be appended to OP's list. 

We could add a lot to OP's list, we could add a lot that might make it a list people aren't so apathetic about.  The list is bollocks, that's part of the point, people disagree that OP's burning issues are worth much effort.

&gt;apathy is a problem with evidently severe consequences

Sure, if it's apathy about important things.  If it's apathy about Murdoch being found out bunging a copper a few quid I think that's different.  Still immoral of course, but it's not going to have me marching on parliament.

&gt;everyone was up in arms

We can't all live our lives up in arms about everything, nothing would ever get done.

&gt;It's complicated, but what's certainly true is that we have more than enough resources to meet everyone's basic needs in this country.

Not convinced that's certain.  But if it's true, where are these resources coming from?  From the state, or are we forcibly re-distributing privately owned resources here?

&gt;social injustice

Sucks.  I agree.  But no system of government ever has managed to eradicate social injustice.  Either everyone gets screwed or a few people do - no-one's come up with a better way yet.  It doesn't matter how much you care about this stuff if there's not an effective way to put it into practice.

Membership is £42 if you live in Britain but £63 overseas. It's cheaper for over 65's or under 18's. Tickets vary on where you sit but will probably be in the £60-70 range. In order to get tickets you'd have to be online at 9:30 GMT on Tue 21st Jan (so during the night if you're in the US). Ultimately it'd cost you about £120 each, almost $200.

If you don't get tickets that way you could try Stubhub. There's a very good chance that you'll need to be a member to buy tickets on there, it was a requirement for the Man Utd game, and I foresee it costing another $50 on top so it makes a lot of sense to get memberships and try and get it directly from the club if you can.

The CofE situation is that they have their own independent laws on marriage, and the government can't really change them without the church's permission.  Well, in principle, its laws are controlled by Parliament, but in practice they only amend them when they are asked to by the General Synod.  Whenever the CofE want to do same-sex marriages, they can send a bill to Parliament.

The difficulty with the CiW is that they have a legal obligation to marry couples in Wales (dating back from when they were a fully established church).  At the moment, they don't want to marry same-sex couples at all, but they want to keep the obligation, and if they did change their minds in the future then they may or may not want the obligation to apply to same-sex couples.

The cutting of welfare and young in this country whilst increasing it for the older generation is lamentable, particularly the fact that wealthy individuals still have their benefits protected. As for tuition fees, its worth looking into some of the arguments for the increase. What is terrible is the visa restrictions on foreign students and the large reduction in funding that universities receive from the government.

No, no they should not.

What you are asking the government to do is to take even more of my money away from me each month and give it to those who earn less, so that they will have more money available to them each month.

Now that might SOUND good on paper, but all that will happen is that prices will rise due to the inflationary effects of all those people suddenly having much more money to spend.

Once the prices have gone up they will be in exactly the same position as they were before, except EVERYONE is now worse off due to:

a) Having a higher percentage of their pre-tax pay taken from them in tax

b) Spending more of their post-tax pay due to inflation

No, asking the government to unilaterally increase the minimum wage is NOT the answer no matter how much you might like to THINK that it is.

&gt; It's pretty widely thought that if it was at all optional for vicars, if someone refuses to offer same sex marriage, they'll go to the EU who'd rule that vicars don't have a choice.

Not by anyone who knows how European law works.  For a start, the EU courts have no jurisdiction over this area of the law - you mean the European Court of Human Rights, which is not part of the EU.  I think the argument that the people suing the CofE are making is that it should be considered to be a public body, and therefore the ECHR applies to it.

This is exactly the opposite of what it would do. Right now, you subsidise low-earner through in-work benefits, effectively paying extra for companies to have cheap labour. Shifting this burden to the companies themselves decreases the buden on you as a taxpayer, rather than increasing it as you imply.

But that being said he has made tackles, he has done OK in the box and he is yet to make an error (a quiet defender is what you always want)- which compared to every game he has featured us prior to this little run is quite frankly rather shocking. 

What else is shocking is that I think we actually play better without Baines. I am not saying Baines isn't an amazing, and vital player- but without him we use Barkley down the middle more and don't waste as much possession with Baines's crosses. 

It seems like the side have got into a rut with Baines, he was a true shining light for a long time and everything was built around him- but now we have a lot more about us, yet our play doesn't reflect that. 

Him being out has forced the team to think outside the box with their distribution channels- and I feel we are better for it. If he can come back in the team, and we can keep these lessons in mind- we will be even better. 

---

I think the big issue is that we have Lukaku and not Fellaini as a target man for Baines's balls now, and they are a very differerent player. Pretty much everything Fellaini did well, Lukaku is poor at, and visa versa. 

Baines and Fella worked so well together, because Baines could whip in his killer balls from deep and Fella would get a chest on them and either sneak a shot or a pass... Lukaku cannot do this. He is a player who is stunning when looking at goal, but woeful with his back to it... Having Oviedo cutting into the box on the left instead of the ball thrown in with Baines has allowed us to exert more pressure high up the pitch, and really force teams into their shells. 

I just hope Bainesey can learn from the games he hasn't played in, and also hope that this doesn't give Bill an excuse to flog him to United. ",0,1386711869,null,0,false,0,cdykr20,t3_1rlu0p,t1_cdykr20,t1_cdykgt9,null,1428280909,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

Milner was brilliant and just rewards for the effort he puts in week in week out. Dzeko held the play up brilliantly for others to come into play. Zaba had Ribery in his pocket all night and has shown us how good he really is.

Will a weed junkie who shoots up 5 times a day pay back into our economy to the same extent as someone who can get help and manage their addiction. Sometimes that involves patching them up first. 

For your budget concerns, picture how much we would spend on policing the junkie and their habits, should they spiral into crime without help. Then contrast that against them getting clean, paying taxes back in and retroactively erasing the debt that they have cost society. It's pragmatic.

Addiction is like anything else for human beings, second hand knowledge is only so good, most everything is learned by experience. People will continue to make the mistakes of addiction regardless of education because we all believe ourselves the exception. So instead of saying fuck it, your problem, you give them a chance to use their new knowledge and avoid that fate.

Also theoretical point, where would you draw the line? If someone had drunk responsibly over their lifetime and got liver failure in their 70s, would they be denied treatment or forced to pay because it could be drug-related? Would there be panels to decide? What about lung problems for those who live in a city? They also knew the risks. Or even free contraception, because teenagers are told about stis and pregnancy. I think that whole ideology is flawed tbh and would result in considerably worse living standards for everyone, not just those directly affected.

I also see quite regularly the Tube and X90 running in tandem, but not out of choice, one is probably running late/the other running early. so it's not a case of ""oh let's run 2 buses in tandem"" it's more a case of one coach catching up to another and both of them running at the same time.

Oxford to London is the busiest coach corridor in Europe, and demand is never going to be 100% predictable as you say, there are a number of universities served as well as that there are many businessmen/women who need to travel on a daily basis.

Oxford Bus are meeting this extra demand by introducing double deck coaches on some X90 journeys, but the Oxford Tube is currently running with all available resources, and as such cannot do anything. A new coach costs over £300k - £400k, so they;re not cheap. 

If you really want to get a seat I'd highly recommend getting a coach into Oxford, and then hopping onto one going out again, It's included on your weekly/monthly/annual pass.

I know it's not the answer you're looking for, but as a regular bus user I know what it's like not being able to get on a bus, and it's not just the Tube and X90 that's suffering from reliability, it's the local services too.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; They are. ""Can I still watch BBC"" is a customer demand which sells their system when the answer is yes. They are using this very obviously in their own PR.

I suspect this press release actually relates to Sky offering satellite capacity to the BBC so that the 24 channels could be broadcast to everyone, including Freesat users. The BBC probably couldn't justify the expense to do so otherwise.

I'd say this argument is a bit spurious anyway - of course Sky is going to advertise this. 24 channels is a huge commitment from the BBC, a big deal for users of Sky boxes (not subscribers), and it relates to a once in a lifetime event. It's not quite ""Get Sky and you can watch BBC1 HD"", is it?

Without that capacity no one would have got the benefits - as Freeview absolutely can't have 24 extra channels and only about 5 people can get Virgin so they wouldn't have bothered.

&gt; If these channels were not available on Sky then people would also install aerials to get freeview which drastically decreases the value of the Sky subscription.

The lack of terrestrial channels on the old Sky analogue platform did not prevent its rapid growth. What excuse do you have for that?

Even though Sky could probably survive without the BBC, we are in the age where people rely on one television viewing method. It would not look good for the BBC if they decided to stop doing something they have been able to do for the last 15 years - and in the process they force people to make investments in new equipment to retain the same service. It'd be pretty braindead if you expected people to have one box for Sky and one box for the BBC.

&gt; They already have it, their TVs have built-in tuners.

If you have a Sky HD box, you would have to buy a Freeview HD or Freesat HD PVR to get the equivalent level of service. You might also have to sort your aerial out - there's a lot of them on houses at a 45 degree angle and about to fall down since they have cable/satellite instead.

I don't think 10 million or more people would have to be happy at having to do this.

&gt; then they are far less likely to channel-hop to Sky when the show finishes.

People will switch to the channels that show what they want. If they want a programme that Sky One has, they'll switch to it. If it is on the BBC, they'll switch to that. 

&gt; That's the bottom line of why Sky provide these channels, it keeps people within their system.

They provide the channels since that's what people pay them for. That's the point of a pay-TV system. It's not there as an expensive way to just watch the BBC.

&gt; That's a different issue entirely. There is maybe some small justification for it as it provides service to a few remote regions more cheaply than a transmitter network. Particularly in hilly places like the Scottish highlands and the Welsh valleys.

My point is that the same thing could be achieved by not having Freesat at all. The BBC already transmits the channels to satellite. If the BBC didn't decide to have their own proprietary platform they could have done as Germany does and use the DVB-S standard to its fullest. Instead, while you can use a cheap DVB-S box to watch the BBC, you don't get a programme guide. You need Sky or Freesat to do that.

&gt; Who would be far less likely to pay for Sky if it didn't give them terrestrial TV.

I return to my argument of ""Sky was very popular before terrestrial channels were on it"". I don't understand why the pro-BBC lot always assume that people are paying Sky to get a box to watch only BBC content on. They pay Sky because they want pay-TV. They also expect to be able to watch/record the BBC on the same hardware. They pay for the ability to do so in the licence fee.

&gt; The only reason I continue with my Virgin Media subscription is because my aerial was damaged in bad weather a few years ago. 

Do you only subscribe because Virgin insists you have to in order to watch the BBC? Sky does not - you can use a Sky box without paying them a penny.

&gt;  If they did not carry terrestrial TV then I'd drop them in a heartbeat &amp; get my aerial fixed.

What you might do is different to the rest of the country. If the BBC wants to pick and choose what platforms it will be on, it should lose its guaranteed funding. ",0,1386714785,null,0,1386715497,0,cdym65t,t3_1sgdbb,t1_cdym65t,t1_cdy6bkg,null,1428280246,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

its certainly not implausible for the authorities to use some information gleaned from online communications to start a traditional investigation - meanwhile hiding the fact that it started with online surveillance. this is already happening in the USA, where the NSA shares information with the DEA who then fake a traditional investigation in order to hide the fact that the evidence came from the NSA in the first place (the evidence would be inadmissible in the US i think because there was no warrant or probable cause to start the online surveillance in the first place).

one of the big effects of pervasive surveillance however is that it has a chilling effect on speech, regardless of the content - which is something that will definately affect every citizen in the country.

im not with OP in how he depicts the issue with surveillance - however, combined with all the other issues the UK faces, the picture gets pretty grim imo.

Yes, it actually is. Sorry I genuinely don't mean to be rude but I'm starting to wonder if you're getting how this works. If you make a fundamental objection to all militarise which is rooted in their **always** being used for codified theft, then all I need to do to successfully object to that point is to come up with a plausible situation in which a military could be used for something other than theft and I've proven you wrong. Since that's easily done, I'm concerned because you don't seem to understand that that is a fatal flaw in your argument.

&gt;As ever - I come back to the core axion of my argument that all military aggression is an form of violent theft - therefor unjustifiable.

Right, and as ever, I'm saying that it's extremely easy to develop a scenario in which you're wrong, and therefore you are wrong. There are good justifications for pacifism, I happen to strongly disagree with them, but there are foundations which are at least moderately solid in a logical argument sense, yours is really not one of them buddy.

true,waydee,null,null,"Abusing ketamine is a silly thing to do as these effects have been noted for some time but the reality is that the classification of the drug has nothing to do with its use and availability.

As long as there's demand for ket then it will be available to buy, making it a Class B drug or even Class A will not change that.  Dealers don't care much if at all about drug classifications and neither do users.

Harm reduction is what the government needs to be looking into, not faffing about debating reclassification that is well known to have precisely zero effect on what should be their primary concern: harm.   

Teach kids the truth about drug use, not the cynical talk to frank bullshit or attempts to scare people - be honest.  A line of ket isn't going to kill you and accept that people are curious and will try things but a line a night or more for some time might just have you pissing into a bag for the rest of your life.

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"&gt; I'd say this argument is a bit spurious anyway

On that we'll have to disagree then. A [quick  search](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=can+i+watch+bbc+on+bskyb+site:helpforum.sky.com) against their forum shows a lot of people asking about BBC access, particularly with Sky Go. 

The actual payment itself is spurious imho. I don't know why the BBC don't go straight through SES S.A, the owners of the actual satellites then simply pay Sky the rate-limited fee to get on the EPG listings. Murdoch doesn't own them or have any direct connection to them afaik. 

&gt; The lack of terrestrial channels on the old Sky analogue platform did not prevent its rapid growth. What excuse do you have for that?

Every single user already had analogue, they weren't faced with a digital switch over, this is an apples and oranges comparison. When the switchover happened Sky was in a unique position to offer absolutely everything in a single package, making it very attractive. If people had to buy both a freeview box *and* a sky subscription then very clearly at least some of them would have only have opted for the first option alone. It's doubtful that many would choose only the latter unless movies/sports were their only interest. 

&gt; I don't think 10 million or more people would have to be happy at having to do this.

Exactly, that's my core point. If Sky stopped carrying terrestrial it would piss of their customers in quite a major way. Do you remember when Virgin lost Sky One and lots of people jumped ship to Sky? And that's for mediocre Sky One which at the time had little other than ST:TNG and Simpsons repeats and maybe LOST iirc. 

&gt; Do you only subscribe because Virgin insists you have to in order to watch the BBC?

Yes and it's me that is ""insisting"". It's either that or pay someone to clamber on the roof of my flat's building to fit a new aerial which would involve contacting my arsehole factors to get roof access. I plan on selling up soon anyway.  

If they did not provide the BBC channels then I would not have the cable TV service, even though I typically only watch less than an hour of live tv per week anyway. 

&gt; What you might do is different to the rest of the country. 

Perhaps but I suspect you underestimate the draw of the main channels. Things like X-Factor are (sadly) huge phenomenons. Every one of the highest viewed shows is on terrestrial. Sure, that's largely down to having the most potential audience but that doesn't matter now, they exist and people want them. 

&gt; If the BBC wants to pick and choose what platforms it will be on, it should lose its guaranteed funding.

But what if the offered terms are unreasonable? If Mr M were to demand one hundred billion dollars from the BBC should they lose it's funding when they say no?",0,1386716828,null,0,false,0,cdyn4fw,t3_1sgdbb,t1_cdyn4fw,t1_cdym65t,null,1428279803,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; I wondered what would happen if I was legally employed by the second company, so I asked them (the company) and they said it wouldn't work. However I could possibly register as self-employed and work for them on a contract basis (with predicted earnings of £0 for the current tax year). Inputting that into the benefits calculator gives me the possibility of Working Tax Credit (but the benefits calculator is just a computer program so I don't know how that holds up in real life).

This sounds possible, but I'd be extremely careful. There's a phenomenally fine line between making the most of the technicalities and fraud. If you set it up with the aim of not making any money but claiming then you may have problems but if you do it and try and earn money doing *anything* like raking leaves or whatever then that sounds fine. 

Be careful though, if you earn nothing you may still be required to pay national insurance or other fees (I'm really not sure, this is a possibility but I've not looked into it). 

&gt; £550 is the limit of my overdraft, it costs £20 per month.

Just to clarify, you have 550 available and are using all of it (so owe the bank £550) and this is costing you £20 per month in fees? Apologies for being pedantic but these things can be quite important.

I'm going to vaguely assume that the rent sorts itself out to the tune of the housing benefit. However, you've got £180 that you need to cover and although that's not as big as many other debts, as a portion of your spare income it's still an issue. It's also something that may leave you homeless if not covered.

Can you do the voluntary work over different hours, or are those hours reasonably fixed? The problem there is they are normal office hours which rules out temping. 

Summary of overall payments/mo:

* 20 on overdraft
* 20 on rent not covered by housing benefit

Income

* 160 - 240

Net result

* 120 - 200  

Are there any other outgoings that you can cut? Do you have a phone line (line rental)? Internet (possible reductions, or go mobile)? Do you drink or smoke? How much do you spend on food?

&gt; That makes it difficult to decide how feasible this is over simply quitting the unpaid work. .

I'm sure you know my opinion on this. Remember, you don't need to quit it until you actually have something else to go to, and I'm sure you can come back / do something to be part of it while you're earning elsewhere. Would they say no if you offer to do 8 hours per week, at irregular times? Then you could fit it around any other shift work.

&gt; There has been no proper survey of land ownership in this country since 1876 - That report, entitled ""The Return of Owners of Land"", contains the names, addresses, acreages and valuations for all landowners of over one acre.

&gt; The book 'Who Owns Britain' by Kevin Cahill revealed the hidden facts behind landownership in the UK and Ireland.

&gt; As Cahill put it, 'the UK's large landowners had been appalled by (the appearance of this report) and moved, with their academic friends, to bury it'.

&gt; Most UK citizens need to live on scraps from their table, when our national assets are treated as off-limits due to 'gifting' by William the Conqueror.

&gt; Time for a land tax? Hard to hide land in a Tax Haven, perhaps.

-Comment from OP article

*Edit - more on that book, from Amazon reviews

&gt; This is a remarkable and original survey of landownership in Britain and Ireland, detailed county by county.
For Britain, Cahill analyses this landownership, showing how a tiny minority exploits British society. 160,000 families, 0.3% of the population, own 37 million acres, two thirds of Britain, 230 acres each. Just 1,252 of them own 57% of Scotland. They pay no land tax. Instead every government gives them £2.3 billion a year and the EU gives them a further £2 billion. Each family gets £26,875.

&gt; By contrast, 57.5 million of us pay £10 billion a year in council tax, a land tax, £550 per household. We live in 24 million homes on about four million acres. 65% of homes are privately owned, so 16 million of us own just 2.8 million acres, an average 0.18 acres each.

&gt; The top landowners are the Forestry Commission, 2.6 million acres, the Ministry of Defence 750,000, the royal family 670,000 (including the Crown Estate 400,000 and the Duchy of Cornwall 141,000), the National Trust 550,000, insurance companies 500,000, the utility companies 500,000, the Duke of Buccleuch 270,700, the National Trust for Scotland 176,287, the Dukedom of Atholl 148,000, the Duke of Westminster 140,000 and the Church of England 135,000.

&gt; The Forestry Commission, Britain's biggest single landowner, runs its holdings conservatively and secretively. We could expand the forest estate by a million acres a year, producing rural jobs, getting profits from the sale of wood and pulp (cutting our balance of payments deficit) and reducing the output of greenhouse gases. This would cost between £588 million and £750 million.

&gt; Through the 18th century enclosures, the landowning class stole eight million acres from the people. They still hide their crimes and their takings.
Cahill compares Britain with other countries where revolutions have ended the feudal tenure of land. Denmark redistributed its land to the peasantry in 1800. In Ireland, in 1876, 616 landowners owned 80% of the country. By 1930, 13 million acres of Ireland's 20 million acres had been sold to owner-occupiers. Now, there are no landlords - home ownership is 82%, Ireland's 149,500 farms are 97% owner-occupied and owner-farmed, there is no poll tax, water is free and pensioners get free transport, TV and glasses.

&gt; Cahill claims that Blair's reform of the House of Lords ""definitively cut the permanent link between power and the landowners."" But just as in 1872, the state is defending landed capital by making it less visible. Class power does not depend on sitting in the House of Lords, but on private ownership of the means of production, protected and subsidised by a capitalist state. The Greens, like the heritage lobby, shield the landowners against public ownership of the land.

&gt; The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says its mission is to shift EU subsidies from food production to land management, but the EU already does this, with its £2 billion annual subsidy to the landowners, not to working farmers. We need to produce our own food: food production is in our national strategic interest. It is a national security issue that must not be determined either by the EU or by the market.

&gt; Landowners' wealth is a parasite on Britain, the least productive part of the economy, with the most state support. Their wealth comes not from farming, nor even from renting, but from trickling land onto the urban housing market. They sell land to property developers, at an average price per acre of £404,000 in 1999. The clearing banks and building societies strip our industries of investment capital, then support their clients the landowners by running the rigged and overpriced land market.

&gt; Britain needs land reform. ""Windfall gains on development land should be made subject to windfall taxes."" We should also tax land and stop the owners avoiding tax through offshore trusts; this could raise £17 billion. The European Convention of Human Rights says there should be no confiscation without compensation. Haven't landowners had enough compensation already? We need more land for housing. This would cut land prices, free more to invest in good quality, spacious homes and gardens, and revive the building industry.",0,1386718299,null,0,1386719476,0,cdyns4j,t3_1sk7wz,t1_cdyns4j,t3_1sk7wz,null,1428279495,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He likes to play a fast-attacking 4-3-3, on the floor, with a high defence, all about keeping hold of the ball, and working hard to get it back when you lose it. (or something like that, off the top of my head)

He's been given basically two seasons according to Mr Whelan to get us promoted.

I honestly don't know anything else, and all that stuff's pretty easy to find, but I guess we'll find out more as the season progresses.

Either way, from what I've seen, everyone seems to be behind him, and have a good feeling about him (except for the few numpty's), and I agree - he certainly gives me a good impression with the way he talked in his press conference. 

He just needs to put his words into actions now.

Hoping the ex-striker in him will help to kick some of our strikers into form, because we need it

I've been the the Vue in Oxford twice.

The first time, it was so crowded we couldn't even get into the film.

The second time, we got in but the film didn't start. We were left sitting in the dark for ~15 minutes without so much as an explanation from the staff as to what was going on. A handful of us eventually walked out and found some staff, who were just as confused as we were. They eventually found a manager, who explained that the projector was broken, but they'd get it fixed, but they only had one person capable of doing so, so it'd be a while. By now 20 minutes after the curtains opened, we demanded a refund and left.

Prior to that, a friend of mine - a former professional projectionist - was working part-time there doing front-of-house and cleaning stuff (he'd hoped to use it to break back into being a projectionist again, when an opening came up). He quit after only a few shifts, explaining to me that he'd been in a screen that had been slightly out of focus and had mentioned it to his manager, who'd told him to be quiet about it, because so long as nobody in the audience mentioned anything then they wouldn't do anything about it.

I keep meaning to give the Vue one last chance, but I don't often get the time to go out and see a film, and the George Street Odeon is more-convenient for me when I do (I work just down the road from it, so it's easy to get to on a weekday evening). I've only once been disappointed by the service at an Oxford Odeon, and that was at the Magdelan Street one (otherwise a fabulous cinema building) when I went there on a day that their heating system packed in.

Also, saying ""bless you"" opens up a whole chance for the person to start a conversation. I don't want a conversation with many many people in public in Britain. There are odd people out there.

&gt; b) asking a very drunk person if they need some assistance not walking into traffic is apparently rude.

I think people have covered this. However one alternative to try in the future:

""Oi, mate, get out of the feckin' road. You'll dent a car walking around like that""

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;So you're arguing semantics.

No. Semantics is to do with meaning, what I'm arguing is that the logical foundation for your opposition to military force is unsound.

&gt;I posit that some usage of the military which might possibly, theoretically exist is no reason to actually spunk billions of pounds and millions of lives on!

Well, you're entitled to your opinion but you've provided no argument for that opinion.

Look, I'm going to finish up here for several reasons, but I'd like to advise you to do three things. Firstly, read one of those short guides to logic you find in Waterstones, and read a little into the fundamentals of argument on the internet, because it's been clear to me that you've not been able to grasp that I've demolished your core argument about 4 or 5 posts ago (that or you've ignored it, which you seem like a sincere enough person not to have done). Secondly, don't use words like ""posit"" if you're in a position where you're not understanding the basic structure of argument, there's simply no reason to. Thirdly, once you've got a handle on the construction of a soundly reasoned belief, go back to your views on pacifism and military force and review them. As I say, I disagree with pacifism entirely, but there are some moderately solid arguments for it and you are consistently failing to make them, and in their place making some very weak ones.

Feel free to think I'm bowing out of the arguemnt, a condecending prick, whatever, I don't really care and I'm done with this discussion, but do yourself a favour and take the above suggestions as genuinely intended in a friendly (if somewhat unavoidably harsh) spirit, because while I can see that you do seriously believe in what you're saying and even that you've looked into the subject, you're really failing to engage in this argument here.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"I think people neglect the fact that most clubs aren't always willing to part with their star striker, regardless if the money is right or not. Great strikers can carry teams when the team isn't performing, and make a team *that* much better. The market for a front man who can bang home 25+ goals a season isn't as deep as most people seem to think it is. This isn't FIFA where you can bid on anyone and clubs just roll over and say 'okay'.

Most clubs (and potential targets) could probably read the writings on the wall. Chelsea has a three way striker problem right now between Ba, Eto'o, and Torres but they also have a highly rated striker on loan at Everton who has vocally expressed his desire to make a name for himself at the club and will most likely return next season. Why would a club want to sell their star as a stopgap measure, and why would a player who is a transformative player at another club want to leave and adjust to a new league  (mid season) to run the possibility of being a #2 striker next season?

Torres seems to be the present anomaly in this in which the money was clearly right for Liverpool to sell. He was banging goals in at LFC before moving here and having his form resemble something of a sawtooth EKG.

But Diego Costa is the #2 goalscorer in La Liga right now with 15 goals in 15 games. His teammate, David Villa is tied for 4th with 8 goals alongside Lionel Messi, Alexis Sanchez, and Benzema. This is a team that is tied on points with Barcelona with something like 2 goals short of being even on goal difference. I'm not an expert on Spanish football, but this seems like the season that a team outside of Barcelona/Real Madrid could finally break the two horse race.

So why would they sell in the January window? Why would anyone with a star striker right now sell in the January window?

I feel that when the Doctor fails to live up to his own ideals it is a reminder that nothing can ever be perfect, but that we must never stop trying to make it so. When The Doctor's emotions get the better of him and he makes rash decisions it is So. Very. Human. ""The Hungry Earth,"" Anyone? And when he contradicts himself it's The Doctor trying not to have the same outcome from a similar situation. The fifth Doctor, for example, almost never acted in haste. In fact, he is often considered the meekest of all the Doctor's incarnations. Despite this, his serials tended to have some of the highest body counts ever.

**Give communities more powers (localism and devolution)**

Simply hasn't happened. The AV referendum was a farce, and the Police and Crime Commissioners we elect now don't seem to have done anything. Turnout for some of those elections was barely 10% such is the political apathy.

**Encourage people to take an active role in their communities (volunteerism)**

I haven't noticed anything to do with this, except now that people in my neighbourhood are having to cut the grass verges and pick up litter themselves because the council hasn't got the funds to do it any more. I suppose that's ""volunteerism"". 

**Transfer power from central to local government**

Council budgets slashed. Power remains very firmly in London.

**Support co-ops, mutuals, charities and social enterprises**

The UN called the over-reliance on food banks in some parts of the UK a violation of human rights. Let that be testament to how that worked.

**Publish government data (open/transparent government)**

This is something the government does actually seem to have been taking steps towards. FOI is probably higher than it ever has been as far as the British government is concerned. However, the Tories are revising the ""official history"" of the party and we have a horrendous record on state surveillance, so it's one step forward, two steps back.

&gt;I suppose that's ""volunteerism"".

Something I've found to be a common theme in my reading is that people felt as though they were forced into volunteerism, and that that took away the ""giving spirit"" of charity.  I take it this is your view as well?

&gt;Transfer power from central to local government
&gt;Council budgets slashed. Power remains very firmly in London.

I found this in my reading as well.  I immediately thought as a result that it might have been a great idea to allow taxpayers to designate up to half of their tax dollars to their communities if they so chose (had the tories actually *wanted* to change anything rather than just make excuses, of course).  Wherever the money is, that's where the power will be.  Do you think this might have motivated people to get involved?

Thank goodness your government's actually trying to publish its data!  That's something we definitely don't have over here.  That was probably my favorite promise of the initiative, to be honest.

So what do you think about the basic principle?  Disregarding the cynicism, and the fact that the tories didn't *actually* want to go through with this, do you think the idea of putting more money and power into local hands while taking it out of the big state would be more beneficial or harmful to the nation as a whole?",0,1386733760,null,0,false,0,cdyurro,t3_1sl64c,t1_cdyurro,t1_cdyt26c,null,1428276222,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

I don't think that tax allowances are allowed to be designated, or at least as a taxpayer I've never had the opportunity to. I pay my tax via PAYE (Pay as you Earn) which is just automatically deducted from my pay. I don't have any control over where it goes. I usually get used to the idea that the government will squander it somehow.

Volunteerism definitely feels more like it's being forced upon us, especially where I am. The council won't cut the grass more than once every three months, so we have to do it ourselves. People are working so it often ends up being elderly people who do it.

You're putting emphasis on his pace but he's also skillful dribbler. He can beat his man, and he can do it in the box. That's an area where Mirallas, who excels where there's a lot of space in front of him, is lacking. With this new system, some opponents will sit back and Everton has had problems in the past with unlocking a defense (I believe they made the most passes in the opponent's third last campaign). Deulofeu has displayed some good bit of skill in that department. I feel much more confident with him trying to break a defense that's sitting back.

Regarding this:

&gt;started games fast, actively closed down the opposition on the ball and generally made it very difficult for a team to generate momentum. As good as Deulofeu is, he is really not the player for this system. 

That's sounds like what Barcelona did under Pep. I don't know what Barca B are about but I figure they're trying to get their players ready for the same. I figure someone with ""barca DNA"" should know a thing about closing down on the opposition. Can he do this right now? I'm not so sure but I don't think it's that much of a stretch of his abilities.

I just want to point out that McGann wasn't the problem with that movie. It was arguably most everything else in it which was, but even so, that movie in and of itself should not be blamed on the series falling dormant afterward, as it was a big gamble in the first place, since ""Doctor Who"" was never really popular here in the States --certainly not to the extent that it is now, which is thanks to cable television. But expecting FOX to buy into a series based on that 1996 telefilm wasn't very likely at all back then. I have no idea what was going on with the BBC at the time, but for whatever reason, they weren't prepared to move with reviving a ""Doctor Who"" TV series on their own, so they turned to American television for help to make it happen, also apparently in the hope that it would become fairly popular in the U.S., but the odds were against it back then, bottom line.",0,1386740177,null,0,false,0,cdyxnca,t3_1sk23p,t1_cdyxnca,t1_cdyretn,null,1428274879,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

The period that you mention, the next 10 games are probably the toughest 1/4 or so of the season. We play the other 5 clubs that make up the top 6, 3 of which are away from home. Assuming we win 4 of the 5 games against ""non-elite"" which in and of itself would be a good accomplishment, winning 2 of 5 against the other top 6 would be about par.

I think 18 points would keep us in the top 3 and within striking distance of the top spot, especially with Sturridge and Gerrard coming back for the second half of that stretch.

20 points would be a big deal and probably have us level or just a point or two behind Arsenal.",0,1386744063,null,0,1386747138,0,cdyyxyu,t3_1slmep,t1_cdyyxyu,t1_cdysw0a,null,1428274205,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3
