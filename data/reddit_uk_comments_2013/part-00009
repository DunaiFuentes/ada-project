Interesting theory, but I think it's been made pretty clear that the Master and the Doctor have a long, complicated, and somewhat tragic relationship, and I really love what Tennant and Simms did with it. (Disclosure: Just started Classic Who and haven't reached the Master yet.)

As far as the question ""Doctor Who?"" goes, it'll never be answered because it can't be. It's like asking ""birdandbear who?"" It's about the Doctor becoming himself through all of his travels. The thing that makes him different is that he's had so much longer to ask his question than we get, and yet he's still discovering, still enthralled with the journey. 
He knows what kind of man he wants to be, and he succeeds in being that Doctor a lot of the time, but he also falls short and gets lost. The beauty is in his refusal to stay that way. In his 1000+ years, he hasn't lost the capacity for love, or hope, no matter how many times his hearts have been broken.

true,[deleted],null,null,"To those saying this is to do with the internet, well I disagree. Hear me out: I went into an HMV recently, it was dark, dingy and full of really young people spending £1.50 on silly posters. (I'm young myself). The staff were also teenagers, who were rude and unhelpful, and seemed to want to play a game of either hide in the back rooms or hide behind the checkout, which is incredibly unhelpful in large stores with identical shelves, where it's difficult to find something small you are looking for. I'm not surprised they are going bankrupt, they could be turned around in less than a week if they hired one of the John Lewis directors.
It's got nothing to do with the internet, Amazon, Tesco or anyone else. They only have themselves to blame.

The internet can't provide face to face service, that's one advantage physical stores will always have, which is why if you run a physical store chain, and you want to do well, your face to face service has to be IMPECABLE. It has to go above and beyond, be mind blowing! This is why Waitrose and John Lewis are posting record profits year after year, despite being more expensive than the competition and during a severe recession. It's not rocket science, it's basic customer service, and HMV deserves to fail. 

I stick by my statement, it has nothing to do with the internet, it's lazy management not upping the game. The internet just makes that more relevant than ever. HMV can never compete on price, but they can compete on service like John Lewis and Waitrose. High street businesses need to realise this if they want to survive. Just existing and hoping customers walk in isn't enough nowadays.

90% of the country won't buy a TV, computer, stereo from the internet. They need people to talk to, and get face to face service.
All these companies going bust, from HMV, to Comet, provided terrible or non-existant customer service.

The bottom line is, this is greedy directors who don't want to invest in their staff, in staff training, in staff welfare and this translates over into how customers feel, and now all those staff are very sadly loosing their jobs. The directors will hawk over to some other company and the leeching will continue.",0,1358197490,null,0,1358198200,1,c7wvltw,t3_16kice,t1_c7wvltw,t3_16kice,null,1430959826,194,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,194

Apart from their rudeness, they're missing the point about *socialised* healthcare - or socialised anything, come to that. It's that anybody who is legally entitled to it (as you are) can get it, free at point of use. Your level of contribution isn't checked, and shouldn't be. Some people *will* pay more than others. Fine. At any given point in time in the lives of *any* of us, we almost certainly won't have contributed the same amount we've taken out!

I don't have children, but I don't ask to pay less tax because I don't need schools. Schools are a Good Thing and part of the society in which I live. Same goes for all the hospitals treating diseases I hope I'll never have. 

In America people get in accidents and don't call an ambulance for fear of the bill. One of the things I'm genuinely proud of about this country is that we don't ask questions before giving someone medical treatment! Puts us a few rungs up on the ""civilisation"" ladder!

Some are biker 'gangs' are nice, but most of them aren't: they are responsible for a large amount of the hard drug trade and they are considered to be a scourge and a pest as they are organised and unafraid to use violence or the threat of it to get what they want.

Public transport has been on an irrevocable march towards *greater efficiency* my entire life. This results in the entire experience being de-humanised.

Yes, the seats probably *are* easier to clean, and you *can* get more punters in a train per £ of investment in rolling stock, and Heathrow *can* handle more passengers than any other airport etc. etc.

But the result is the buses are like awful semi-mobile sanitoriums for the terminally bereft of aesthetic sense; the trains are fucking uncomfortable (especially the ergonomic seats, designed to cripple anyone not of Standard Build); and being ""processed"" through an airport is a more ghastly and alienating experience than the most fevered and sadistic mind could conceive, which is why they had to be designed by committees of project-managed-bullshitters wanking into their lattes.

If you want to understand everything that is wrong with British transport, just go to Birmingham New Street station, any day of the week, and stand there for an hour. There aren't any seats. There aren't any bins. There are humans, but they've pretty much given up. A robot will apologise to you continually, for things that won't change.

He once gave the contact details and address of a journalist to a school-friend who intended to physically assault the journalist. He is often outspoken and has offended people in Liverpool, Portsmouth and even Papa New Guinea with politically incorrect and insensitive remarks. Boris cheated on his wife for four years and lied about it.

These are legitimate criticisms of him, but all you are doing is exaggerating everything he says and does just because you're politically opposed to anything with a blue badge.

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"Is it just the jobs though? Or has a tipping point been reached in which a realization that most of our big cities are now so ""multicultural"" that we seem to have lost a sense of our own identity?

There is also this feeling that has been building up that any mention or talk of race, immigration, culture, etc.. and you are branded a xenophobe or worse a racist? As if multiculturalism is OBVIOUSLY the best thing since sliced bread and that anything but a whole hearted embrace is spitting in the face of equal rights.

Personally speaking I'm white british, so is my father, but my mother is not, She came here in the 80's looking for work when she met my father. Like father like son in some ways because I married a woman from Hungary who speaks Russian.

So my personal feeling on immigration is that we need it and that in many cases these people contribute massively to our economy but the stupid thing is we've tightened up legitimate immigration channels when the real issue was not immigration but the free movement of people via the European Union Common Travel agreements. So now you've got smart intelligent people with vital skills who cant come here to work but if your a poor bulgarian begger, COME RIGHT IN.

That being said I am kinda sick and tired of this continual celebration of multiculturalism. My wife likes to shop in the local eastern european supermarkets but I can't help but find their particular brand of bright gaudy signs and shoddy shop fronts to be fucking off-putting and quite frankly an eyesore. The same can be said for the Somali cafe's which litter some parts of London or the fucking mass concentration of bangladeshi's in Tower Hamlets, many parts are a disgusting ghetto, take a walk around Whitechapel in the cold light of day and tell me that multiculturalism is the best thing since sliced bread.

**not true**


While I'm not advocating the purchase of extended warranties, I feel that there should be a bit of clarity over this '7 year warranty' that gets banded about. Just FYI I'm not a lawyer or anything, but this is how it works in practice.


It's actually a 'limited liability' and not a 'warranty' most people think of a warranty as something where you can walk into or phone a retailer and with (relative) ease get a refund, repair or replacement. This limited liability is not the same for the following reasons;

1. You will have to prove the defect is caused by a manufacturing fault and not through misuse or wear and tear **once you have have been deemed to accepted the goods(usually within 30-45 days)**. 
Most retailers will ask for an independent report specifying the fault and that is down to a manufacturing fault. This will cost money and can be difficult to prove if the handle dropped off because little johnny was swinging on it or because it wasn't screwed on properly. You can however claim the cost of the report back from the retailer if it is due to a defective product.

2. You are not entitled to the full purchase price back as a refund. If the retailer decides to refund (instead of repair) then they can take into account the use of the product and give you a 'pro-rata' refund. So buy a £600 tablet, prove it's a manufacturing fault, and then return it 5 years in and you will likely only get around £100 back for it.

3. The product reasonably has to be expected to last for the full period. a £4.97 kettle wouldn't be expected to last for 6 years, and I doubt any court would expect a retailer to replace / refund such a kettle even under this directive.

4. A lot of retailers will try your case in court. Effort.


Whereas an extended warranty will normally entitle you to a relative 'no questions asked' repair in a reasonable amount of time, and the purchase price of the product back (normally on a voucher)  if it can't be fixed.

tl;dr - Please, British public, stop going into shops with your £15 grease laden, unwashed-since-the-day-it-was-first-used deep fat fryer after 4 years and demand your money back because 'you know your rights' /rant

Nobody can embody a perfect representation of everyone in Britain or even everyone in London's experience in one person. We all have to come from somewhere and we all had different experiences. His was different to mine, that doesn't make his better or worse than mine.

What evidence is there that he 'bushed' his way through school? I'm not saying that he didn't, but if you're going to make a bold claim like that I assume you can back it up given that a national newspaper would have dug it up and made mincemeat of him ages ago if there were any?

Every course at Oxford is exclusive. That's because lots more people apply than there are places, so by definition many people are excluded from attending. It's theoretically (and I'd argue these days factually) a meritocracy. You may have a point about nepotism getting people into universities in the 80s and it certainly wouldn't hurt your chances today, but given his educational background he was very probably qualified and groomed for interview to a standard where he wouldn't have to rely on it.

He procrastinated on his assignments? So what? When I was a student I handed things in at the last minute the same as just about everybody else, how does that make him less qualified than anyone else to run London? And of course he spent time making connections he wanted to in his spare time, it's called having friends. He had an interest in politics so I don't think you can call a wannabe politician a bad person for having friends with similar interests can you? And how exactly did he manipulate his peers? He was indeed in the Bullingdon club, who sound a thoroughly twattish bunch. But does being a bit of a self important twat at university bar you from politics? If so you'd have to bar pretty much every NUS president in the country because the few I've met are all on the verge of imploding up their own arses!

If someone can scrape a 2:1 from Oxford, they still got a 2:1 from Oxford. That's a pretty good qualification in my eyes, and I don't see exactly why you think it's worth less than a 2:1 from anywhere else?

I'm a floating voter with no axe to grind for Boris or the Tories, and there are plenty of things that Johnson has done that I disagree with or don't like. But at the end of the day I think you hating him for having wealthy family and a better education than me or probably you is just bitter small minded jealousy. Hatred of success is something I really dislike about modern Britain. Personally I'd prefer the people in critical positions in government had the best possible education for it, just as I'd like a surgeon operating on my brain to have a 1st from Cambridge rather than a 2:2 from Solihull in the interests of 'fairness'. It might not be 'fair' that we don't all get to go to Oxford or Eton, but it's not 'fair' that I don't get to be an astronaut either. We aren't all a homogenous mass of identical people with identical abilities from identical backgrounds, and yes some do have it easier than others. But don't hate the player, hate the game.

Edited to add TL;DR: Just because Johnson was a privileged background and had it easier than many of us isn't a reason to hate him. We're all different people, and hating someone for having had an easier upbringing than you or access to a better education than you is foolish, especially when it comes to picking people for positions of responsibility.",0,1358203719,null,0,false,0,c7wxvmt,t3_16k0uh,t1_c7wxvmt,t1_c7wxb0d,null,1435644033,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

They were involved in so much scandalous behaviour throughout the games and did so wasting public money. G4S didn't make the games - the athletes did and to credit them is taking away from the people who weren't in it for the cold profit. It's clear where this man's interests lie.

Wear and tear is built into the EU directive, the device has to function for 6 years, it only says that the use has to be ""reasonable"". So if a hairdryer that you used once a day, died after 4 years, even though it may have died from ""Wear and tear"" you are still covered. If you used it 7 times a day, then it wouldn't be. Normally reasonable use is written into a devices instructions so it's very obvious.

&gt;*You are not entitled to the full purchase price back as a refund.*

You aren't entitled to any kind of refund at all. You are entitled to a repair or if it can't be fixed then a like for like replacement. So if you bought a bottom of the range 32"" flat screen TV, you are entitled to another 32"" flat screen TV if the manufacturer can't repair it.

When we launched our digital offer with the Sony readers we had pricey hardware, a very limited catalogue of eBooks and staff ill trained on the devices or the ecosystem. We did sell the devices but had a near constant stream of returns/faulty units to deal with and an altogether complicated and unhelpful service from Sony to deal with them. It was a pretty awful implementation. Later we started selling other brands at other price points but the same problems that plagued the Sony arrangement continued with the others. Meanwhile Kindle was gaining momentum and making the jump iPods made to being synonymous with the product category: people asked if we sold Kindles, not eReaders. The notion of selling Kindles seemed absurd. It really did. But here is how I see it. Certainly in my branch training on the Kindle was far superior to any previous digital setup. Furthermore, Amazon are far better to deal with when customers turn up reporting a fault. Do we make much per device? No. Not a huge margin. But the volume sold since launch has still brought a **considerable** profit for us. Our own brand of Kindle accessories and the other third party ones we sell also have very good margin. As for eBook sales, purchasing Kindle titles through our website is still forthcoming, purchasing in store over free WiFi counts as us selling it, though I can't say what we see of that. It is probably very little, but almost every Kindle I sold in December was being bought along with physical books. We were probably never going to be able to offer the sort of catalogue Kindle has, and going the route Barnes and Noble did with the Nook was not possible this late in the game. Our own eReader would have cost plenty to develop and then we would have the uphill struggle of clawing back mindshare and market share from Kindle. Selling other eReaders had not really been much of a success in the past. So at the end of it we decided to sell the best eReader on the market, even if it meant making a deal with the devil. But if the company has handled Kindle like we have in our store then we have done our best to offer good service and information when selling the device. It is a risky move but in the short term it has been profitable and obviously we hope good experiences will keep us in people's minds.

true,Dark_ph0enix,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country [Dud-Lay],"Daunt could have had the Nook range in store, by Christmas 2011. As someone with no problem when it comes to Amazon - I was actually looking forward to you guys teaming up with B&amp;N - Amazon need the competition; their devices would still resemble the 90s prototypes were it not for competition from other retailers, however insignificant [in terms of market share.].

At that point Kindles - whilst yes, *beginning* to be synonymous with eReaders as iPods are to digital music, Hoovers to vacuum cleaners etc. still represented a bit of a niche market. The number of eReader owners - in any ecosystem, was still small enough that the countries biggest retailer, with a device made by the United States biggest retailer, could have made a significant impression.

Personally? I think Daunt thought the negotiations were going well - it would explain the increased vitriol that he was displaying at the time towards Amazon [""Serious"" readers don't use Amazon; Amazon are the Devil etc. etc.].

There's different interpretations on what caused the deal to fall apart - personally I think it had to do with B&amp;N anticipating the need to spin all things Nook off into a separate company to keep it viable in the future - having two massive book chains dragging it down wouldn't help.

Completes agree re: a Waterstone's branded eReader. I assume that idea died once someone figured out how much Amazon pump into Lab126 on an annual basis [I noticed they're hiring again]

I also completely agree re: the Sony models. Those early models were terrible - truth be told, I'm not exactly fond of the more recent models either. Then again I run - or should say - ran, custom firmware on my Kindle so I'll admit to being fussy.

But putting all that to one side? The following scenario sums up my problem with the state of Waterstone's when it comes to digital.

Waterstone's sell Kindles. The price is right - as you said, the staff are being trained up significantly better this time when it comes to selling them.

If I buy one from the store, not only do I have to put up with Advertising on the device - advertising btw, which was applied using a custom firmware update that is a bitch to remove, but I can't actually buy books via the website.

Why would a customer buy a device from a store, that's got adverts on it [I'll grant you they're hardly intrusive, but it's still annoying], that won't work with that stores own website, for the same cost as a device bought from Amazon.

Especially if that customer is already an Amazon user - if they are, it'll arrive automatically configured.

I agree that, at this point in the game, Waterstone's have to sell the devices. It's just annoying knowing that the opportunity was there to sell a viable alternative / competitor to Amazon.",0,1358205578,null,0,false,0,c7wylwo,t3_16kice,t1_c7wylwo,t1_c7wy3p6,null,1430961288,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Ha, I guess you haven't worked in customer service. When I worked at Sainsbury's I had a woman come in with some mouldy flour that she said she purchased last week and wanted an exchange.

But our policy was generally not to kick up a fuss about small items like that so as a sign of good will we exchanged it for her.

These days young people spend more time inside since gaming and the internet became more popular. Means less people hanging around outside - less people getting into trouble. Also the perception of crime has increased, so people fear it a lot more now than they did in the 80's or 90's. Stranger danger has been taught to young people so they're more cautious/fearful. The popularisation of credit cards mean people have less real money on them - so mugging someone isn't worth the risk as much as it used to be. CCTV is more of a thing, so people who otherwise would become criminals may be a bit more cautious and not take the risk. On top of that's, increased efforts to prevent organised violence (like hooliganism) have been reasonably successful. 

Lastly - assuming that there is an age range where people are more likely to commit violent crime (for ease lets say between 20 and 30). If we look at this population pyramid from 2008 http://www.politicalinsightmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ageGraph2.jpg we can see that around the turn of the millennium there would be more people in the violent criminal age range than there are today.

Of course the major labels always got massive priority over your product and had the money to take it on the chin if something didn't sell.

1. Drive to industrial unit area.
1. Go through shop, pick out one you find favourable.
1. Head to counter in an orderly queue.
1. ""Sorry sir, this is not in stock but we can order it in for you and you can pick it up here in a few weeks""
1. Politely refuse, ignore advice to buy the shitty freezer they have at the back.
1. Take note of product number, go home.
1. Research discount codes, order it online.
1. Go without freezer/desired merchandise till it is delivered straight to your door. 

I agree with bacon_cake and TheseusPerse, anyone who has entered a good record store can clearly see HMV's business model was outdated. One example is, my favourite one is in Brighton's North Laines. It's called [resident](http://www.resident-music.com) - it generally keeps an up to date indie collection that doesn't actually follow the charts, but what music-lovers who like buying physical music are willing to buy. 

Excellent customer service, once they made an easy mistake in not putting a Kings Of Convenience CD in the album case. It was easily resolved when I picked up the phone the day after, they knew who I was and sent the disk to me in first class post.

Can't comment on PC World - another store that I'm convinced we'll be reading about calling in administrators in the [admittedly not quite to near] future.

They're not *terrible*, I just think it's a mis-step to sell a device with advertising, at the same price as without - if it was sold in an identical state to the device as ordered direct from Amazon? I think a lot of people, particularly upgraders, would opt to buy it from Waterstone's.

I know I could make use of it - grab a coffee in one of these new cafes that are being rolled out, ""borrow"" a book from the device over wi-fi for a while, and if I like it, buy it there and then. 

I'm heavily invested in Amazon at this point - I picked my ""side"" as it were, when it comes to ecosystems, but not to the extent that I wouldn't switch - DRM is, after all, so simple on eBooks it's not difficult to jump [I personally have a script that will take my Amazon purchases; remove the DRM, convert to .epub and copy to a desktop folder that's synced with Dropbox, to ensure my books are safely backed up.]

But I don't entirely agree with your argument. I like to buy my food from a shop where I can choose the actual item I buy, not just get given the pack of bacon which is all fat, or the mankiest bag of potatoes. And buying high value goods such as TVs from an online supplier could cause huge amounts of hassle if things go wrong. This is why people still use Waitrose/John Lewis.

A CD, though, is the ideal online purchase, low value, you know exactly what you are going to get, and it is much cheaper if you can bear to wait a whole extra day or two.

Joking aside - the whole ebook vs ""Real books"" debate / argument / screaming fest that goes on, whereever books and book lovers are to be found? It distracts attention from issues like this. It should be perfectly legal for me to have the ability to safe guard what is after all, a considerable investment. Yet it's - to put it nicely - a grey area.

true,flagondry,tardis,TARDIS,"I'm certainly no expert in writing but I've always been taught to put the solution near the beginning of the story, but you don't necessarily give enough information for it to become apparent as the solution until later. Moffat seems to do this within episodes and at least to some extent within arcs.

For example, within episodes such as in *Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead* River's sonic screwdriver and the neural relays are presented early on, and these later become the solution. In *Let's Kill Hitler* we see Mels regenerating and regeneration energy is later the solution. In *The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances* Captain Jack heals Rose's hands with the nanogenes early on and this later is revealed as the cause/solution for the gas mask child, etc etc. 

However in plot arcs such as River, we don't get any hint of her being Amy's daughter until *The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon* when we meet the little girl in the spacesuit and find out Amy is pregnant. The reveal happens half a series later in *A Good Man Goes to War*. It's fair enough that we don't get any information on this in *Silence in the Library* because we haven't met Amy yet. We do, however, get a (not very subtle) hint that she's his wife. We think this is the key to who she is, however it actually becomes part of the solution to the Doctor's death in *The Wedding of River Song*.

With the Doctor's death in *The Impossible Astronaut* Amy says ""maybe he's a clone or a duplicate or something"". That is the solution, but we don't have enough information until we meet the Teselecta in *Let's Kill Hitler* to begin fitting the pieces together. We also meet the Silence at the beginning of *The Impossible Astronaut*, but it's only once we piece that together with the above information about River's arc that it all becomes clear.

So basically, plot arcs are way more complicated than episodes but generally there is usually a hint at a solution to *something* near the beginning. So it is likely that what we have already seen about Clara in *Asylum of the Daleks* and *The Snowmen* will be part of the answer but we need more information before we can fully figure it out.

For me, I like Gabe Newell's nanogenes theory but I don't think that's the full story. There will probably also be things we have seen so far that don't seem important but are. I'd go for the nanogenes from *Asylum*, and ""born behind the clock face of Big Ben"" and The Great Intelligence from *The Snowmen* as things that will be relevant later, but no doubt there is still more to be revealed before we can fully figure it out.

**TL;DR** - Plot arcs are complicated and we probably don't have enough information to figure it out, but things that have been previously established will form part of the answer to *something*. I guess I sit somewhere between theory type 1 and theory type 2. Theory type 1.5, if you like.

**Edit:** It's also worth checking out how many episodes Moffat is writing in series 7b. If it's just the usual two (first and last) then I would bet we will have pretty much everything we need to work it out by the next episode. Unfortunately we then have our mere mortal brains to contend with in deriving a solution among all the red herrings he will no doubt throw in.",0,1358208783,null,0,1358212671,0,c7wzpd2,t3_16kj9r,t1_c7wzpd2,t3_16kj9r,null,1430961883,12,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,12

true,SushiSnuglet,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"I live in Bristol, where First Bus pretty much has a monopoly. There is one other bus company but they only have about 5 routes, all of which centre round one of the universities. The tickets on the First buses are extremely expensive and penalise you for shorter journeys, so there's no ""I'll just hop on the bus to go a mile"". The buses aren't as frequent as they should be, even on the main roads, and they're often late. Add in the usual bus problems like screaming kids, nasty chavs etc etc, and it's easy to see why people take their cars and the congestion is so bad. We desperately need another system of moving people around, but we'll never get it. 

As far as mainline rail services go, prices are just horrible unless you book really, really far in advance. This seems to be stuck in the 19th century when people only used the train to go on holiday. Overcrowding is also a problem, but every intercity train seems to have 3 first class carriages which are always practically empty. Surely they would make more money by taking some of those out and filling them with standard class passengers instead? That's if you even get a 'normal' train. If you're going from, say, London to Oxford at 10pm you'll get one of those tiny tin-can things which never has enough room. There's nowhere to put luggage in the tin-can trains, but on the other end of the spectrum, the trains running all the way from Cornwall to Scotland never have enough bloody luggage room either so people put the stuff on their seats, further reducing space. 

Lastly I just don't understand why nothing ever gets done. If you go to certain European countries, their trains are so much better, yet there's no attempt to get to that level here. We can't even do one high speed line that's still not that fast really. I just don't get it.

I like to believe we come out of it quite well but the moment I say that you can guarantee a flood of nightmare experiences.


As for Amazon. They are a different kind of beast. They are a digital age retailer. I might be well placed to recommend you a fantastic book based on the vaguest of criteria. The only thing that qualifies me for it is loving the books and knowing my sections. Amazon doesn't know this. But between user generated content like ListMania! and Customer Reviews and data gathering and algorithms, well, it can do as good a job. The problems faced never change, just the solutions. Are Amazon guilty of tax avoidance? They pay what they have to within the letter of the law. The law is at fault. Petition government, phone your MP etc if you are outraged. Any company trying to operate in these conditions or indeed any other is fundamentally chasing profits and will pay as little as it can get away with. That's big business. It is up to government to fix that.


Obviously I would love you to shop in our store but, for me, it comes down to this: I don't care where you buy your books or what format they are in.

true,helplesslyselfish,mcgann,McGann,"Because it's an inspiration. Doctor Who is a show about facing challenges, and succeeding (mostly). Bad things happen, of course, and facing their challenges and consequences is undoubtedly difficult for the Doctor, but what DW teaches us is that life goes on. **And that is its overwhelming message to me: there will be struggles and challenges but inside every person is the capability to rise up and meet those challenges, for not only our sake, but for the sake of the entire universe.** Look at Rory. Look at Craig. Look at Sarah Jane. Look at the Doctor himself. He's lost his home, his species, his family, everything, and yet he continues. Because he must, and because he can.

The Doctor inspires all of us, but especially me. I remember being a freshman in high school when I first discovered the show. As anyone can tell, high school is a very intimidating place, and it was especially bad for me. I was short, pimply, and my friends seemed to be deserting me. DW showed up on Netflix, and when Nine told me to run, I was captivated. Here was something unique, genius, and wholly honest. The Doctor was all I could hope to be someday. He faced his enemies, dealt with his problems, and was never afraid to take that first step into insanity. He simply showed me how to live.

Maybe I'm making this sound like a religion. I admit it sounds oddly similar to how people say they found Jesus. But if Doctor Who is a religion, then I'm okay with that. The Doctor's an excellent prophet.

Perhaps he learns of the phone being invented way before it's time or another anachronism that changed history. Eventually he realizes someone is trying to send him a message.

Perhaps this is why she breaks the fourth wall by looking at the camera? Not just to reinforce the "" and remember"" line, but because the whole concept of Clara breaks the fourth wall.

Either Ambleside or Keswick have plenty going on with a lot of tourists so plenty of places to stay, restaurants and pubs etc. Where to find accommodation - there are a lot more B&amp;Bs and self catering cottages type of accommodation than chain hotels, try a site like http://www.lakelovers.co.uk/ for cottages.

Ambleside or Keswick are in close vicinity to plenty of outdoor pursuits like your list there. I'd definitely add hiking, there are a lot of good walks up mountains, from Ambleside you could head up the Fairfield Horseshoe for a good day's walk straight out of the town, near Keswick there's Skiddaw and Blencathra. Mountain biking too, there's some great trails and a good place to start is Grizedale or Whinlatter where there's handy bike hire! Caving/potholing strikes me as an odd one for the Lake District as the slate doesn't lend itself to caves like the limestone in the Yorkshire Dales does (closest I can think of is the old mines and there's quite a good tour at Honister).

Public transport isn't the best, it will limit your options so hiring a car might be your best bet - no idea where to start there though. Haven't been to Keswick much but I vaguely remember a market, Booths in Windermere (near Ambleside) is a small supermarket selling a lot of local stuff. Shouldn't be any problems with your 'ethnic' mates, its a surprisingly multicultural area and you'll notice a lot of diversity in the restaurant choices, and the place is choc full of the Japanese in the summer!

I imagine that those who have messaged the mods are those that have invested time and energy into promoting good discussions on this sub. And if certain users, especially those with inside information and better understanding of the club than most of us want memes gone I'm aboard.

true,SenorHedgehog,yorkshire,South Yorkshire,"The fact that rail fares are said to be not only the highest in Europe, but also the highest in the world.

I think its because the infrastructure is completely broken.  The trains are not owned by the operator but are leased from the government for a fee, then operator is given a huge subsidy to cover the costs of operating the line and then hikes the fare up to cover admin costs and turn a profit.  

It really annoys me when I go to Germany/Switzerland and see the government run trains are newer, cleaner, cheaper, more efficient and faster than the 50 year old re branded inter-city 125 trains that we have.  Don't get me wrong I know the rail infrastructure in our country is one of the most complex in the world and costs a lot to maintain.  But I cant help thinking it would be much more efficient if the whole network was managed by one organisation again.

The progress that is being made up north on upgrading the rail system is abysmal, they are aiming to get the line between Manchester and Sheffield electrified by 2017.  It should have been done years ago.

One more thing, can someone tell me why we don't have double decker trains? I know its not because of the tunnels because the trains in Germany can get through them with no trouble and the increase in space would greatly assist in the overcrowding issues that have arisen over the years.

The only thing keeping consumers thinking that HMV were a casual purchase zone only was their high street location... and given the high prices of the majority of their stock towards the end of its life (headphones, ipods, tablets), this ultimately contributed to their demise.

Avalanche Records up in Edinburgh doesn't seem to be doing well either: over the last month they've been discussing a change of direction. Anyone  saying that this will help indies - I sincerely doubt it. As Avalanche said on their website last month, as small companies they don't have the ability to get large loans or even credit from suppliers, unlike chains.

The best hope that we have is for Gordon Montgomery, founder of Fopp, and his son Lawrence to buy back the Fopp branches. In 2007, they started a new record shop in Bristol called Rise. It has since grown to four branches: Bristol, Cheltenham, Worchester, and Swindon. However, it is pretty unlikely that they will expand so quickly as that's what led to the end of Fopp. Many people think that Fopp failed because they weren't making enough money, whereas what *actually* happened was they expanded from 50 branches to 87 by buying 37 branches of Music Zone. Shortly afterwards, they had an argument with their bank about funding and the bank decided to call in their loan. Having already bought the 37 branches, they were unable to pay the money back immediately and so were forced into administration. At the time, they were very profitable - more so than any competitors - and so naturally HMV bought them!^ramble^ramble^ramble",0,1358218249,null,0,false,0,c7x2oea,t3_16kice,t1_c7x2oea,t1_c7wx6cy,null,1430963388,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Marijuana is also non addictive so if a larger percentage of the population was using it over alcohol there would probably be less prisoners addicted to alcohol.

&gt;5       Harassment, alarm or distress

&gt;(1)  A person is guilty of an offence if he–

&gt;(a)     uses threatening, **abusive** or insulting **words** or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or

&gt;(b)     displays any **writing, sign** or **other visible representation** which is threatening, **abusive** or insulting,

It's the ""abusive"" words, writings, signs, etc that are of note.

The OED defines **'Insult'** as:

&gt; 1. intr. To manifest arrogant or scornful delight by speech or behaviour; to exult proudly or contemptuously; to boast, brag, vaunt, glory, triumph, esp. in an insolent or scornful way.

while defining **""Abusive""** as:

&gt; 1. a. Wrongly used, misapplied; improper; perverse; erroneous.

and

&gt; 4 . That mistreats (a person or thing); characterized by ill-use or mistreatment; injurious, damaging, harmful; (in later use esp. physically, emotionally, or sexually).

Soon, people are going to get sick of their shit and shop online.

Three years ago, I was anxious about using Steam and other digital stores to buy games. Now, they're my go-to-place and if I can't get the download digitally, I rely on Amazon. It's just *so* fucking convenient to buy something instantly, already have it downloading to your device and not have to travel all the way to the high street.

I still think that the only tipping point that will truly kill off high street retail is connection speeds and whether the government and ISPs would man up and provide better service and infrastructure.

true,Jdforrester,uk,Londoner in San Francisco,"&gt;Would you really describe Lloyds TSB and RBS as state-owned?

Yes, I would, and more importantly, so would the government, the EU, the IMF and World Bank, and others.

The Office for National Statistics (a UK government non-ministerial department) publishes a monthly ""Public Sector Classification Guide"", that lists every organisation in and around government. Per the [latest one](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/na-classification/national-accounts-sector-classification/classification-update---december-2012/public-sector-classification-guide--december-2012.xls) (*Excel file* for December 2012), both ""Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc"" and ""Lloyds Banking Group plc"", and all their subsidiaries, were ""reclassified from the private to the public sector from 13th October 2008"".

See also [the ONS's National Accounts Sector Classification](http://data.gov.uk/dataset/national_accounts_sector_classification) document set for further (detailed!) reading.

&gt; As far as I'm aware, the government doesn't own a majority stake in either (although, since I don't know the other stakes, it could very well be a plurality stake).

This is not correct. The government (through a subsidiary company of HM Treasury called UK Financial Investments(!)) [owns](http://www.ukfi.co.uk/about-us/market-investments/) 82% of RBS - 90.6 billion shares - and 40% of Lloyds - 27.6 billion shares. The theory is that at some point HMG will be able to sell these shares back to the open market at (or above) the cost of financing RBS and Lloyds, but this does not appear to be close to occurring.

Also, UKFI used to [own](http://www.ukfi.co.uk/about-us/wholly-owned/) (100% of) Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, but those have now been sold to Virgin Money, and so UKFI (and so the taxpayer) now have a bunch of money ""invested"" (owed) - £19.7bn with what remains of Northern Rock, £8.4bn to Bradford &amp; Bingley plus £18.4 bn of statutory debt, and £150m in Virgin Money shares.

Liverpool play a possession-based game so that results in high possession and high pass completion. WBA and Stoke are counter-attacking and direct. Their numbers are on the lower end. Obviously the stats correlate with a team's playing style.

For passing statistics, they're usually more useful when looking at individuals than a team as a whole. For someone like Gerrard, who is involved in the build-up play, they need to be high to indicate the level of control and involvement he is with the team.

Looking at the stats, I'd say Liverpool are doing well. High possession and high shots on goal. So it's not possession for possession's sake. The team is actually doing well to create chances. The thing is, with the way Liverpool play, the defence will have time to organise and that means when chances are created, they're not typically one on ones more common when a team counter-attacks, but usually are the result of intricate passing and that final touch required in the box which needs to be precise.

The end of the final episode of season one of Torchwood links up directly with the beginning of episode 12 of season three of Doctor Who. I recommend watching them back to back.

In all honesty, the idea of us getting Sneijder would be awesome for the 9 million transfer fee. The only issue is the 200k/week. Getting him would be the exact opposite of what the club is trying to do is recruit young players with potential/use homegrown players.

Totally agree with you on Sahin thing. He was extremely under-utilized/ not used at all and should have been put in a playmaker role instead as a holding/defensive mid. He is a cheaper version of Sneijder and I would have liked to him to have had a successful loan spell with the club and possibly join the club.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's a comment I've been meaning to make for a while, and I imagine this is the best place.

A big part of FSG's transfer policy the last couple seasons, which I don't think has been touched on much, has been an active avoidance of making the same mistakes that their last Red Sox GM made.

It has often seemed as though we don't have the money to buy real top players, but as Ayre has said, it's less about capacity, and more about buying at the right time.
A couple years ago, the Red Sox made moves for several big name, big money players with plenty of seasons left in the tank. That year was talked up as possibly the best Red Sox side in decades, with huge expectation.

What followed was very much the opposite.
Huge instability and negligence in the management, an imbalanced squad, and top stars losing their hunger post-payday resulted in a snowball of mediocrity culminating in missing the playoffs.
The Red Sox have now shipped out several of their formerly top class players for prospects through smooth dealing, and shed enormous salary commitments, but a harsh lesson was learned:

When you try to bring in elite players, you must be certain that you have the structures in place for them to go from strength to strength.
FSG need to see first that Brendan and his staff were the correct choice, that the squad is stable and balanced with no more PR chaos, and that the team is ready to make the step up to competing for top honours.

A perfect example of us making these mistakes in the past would be Joe Cole. An excellent player coming from a top club after a good season. With his free transfer, he stepped into a minefield. A Chaotic management situation, top players leaving along with squad overhaul, and going from a prem-winning CL team to a club fighting to stay in the European spots all contributed to his total loss of desire, fitness, and form.

Some clubs have such overwhelming financial power that they can pave over these issues as they arise, or just hit the reset button.(See: Chelsea and 50m Torres, City and half their squad, et al)

But for Liverpool, Arsenal, Spurs, and even more powerful sides like United, Juve, and Bayern, there is a need to be measured and certain that any big money you spend isn't going to go up in flames should cracks begin to show at the club.

Our recent run, Old Trafford aside, has certainly given confidence going forward, and if we can carry these performances into the summer, we may likely see FSG ready to say ""Yes, now is the time to bet big. This hand can win the pot.""

At the very least, we sure have a damn lot of potential in our squad these days.

**TL;DR: Throwing top players into an unstable situation can often be a destructive move, instead of a positive one. FSG want to be certain we're stable, before they make a risky large investment.**",0,1358226441,null,0,1358227005,0,c7x59e4,t3_16lj8a,t1_c7x59e4,t3_16lj8a,null,1430964695,55,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,55

Wenger's argument has always been that the clubs with oil money artificially inflate the ""market value"" of these players, effectively pricing out teams who use money from football operations to buy players.

Arsenal bought Cesc after Barca said they didn't want him. Once he learned and got better at Arsenal, Barca came back and tried to disrupt his position (captain at Arsenal) and eventually bought him back.

Additionally, Henry, RVP, and Cesc have said after moving on that they owe a significant portion of their development as a player to Arsenal and to Arsene Wenger. Hell, Nasri just said that this week. That's why 
Arsenal fans feel that players owe more to Arsenal.

Vieira, Song, Hleb, Henry, Flamini are all examples of players who left the club and had their careers decline.

You are right about the wage structure and it should be addressed. 

I don't think speaking about ""principles and class"" is bullshit. It's always been a club that has stuck to its philosophy (the same way Spurs have) and don't tolerate players acting like asshats. They play clean football and Wenger seems to have the respect from most other managers (except for Tony Pulis).

The most refreshing aspect of this subreddit has been the discussions I've had here. With every passing day, I find that to be diminishing. 

As someone says, ~4000 subscribers doesn't make it a big subreddit to worry about circlejerking and quality of content. But it isn't too small a number to ignore, either. In fact, it is at that precarious balance where things can go perfectly right, or horribly wrong.

Don't get me wrong; I am NOT saying banter and other such 'unrelated' humor is unnecessary - it is VITAL for a healthy community. But when, banter and such 'unrelated' humor starts to take up your discussion space, that's when you (should) know things are going south.

Remember, not everyone votes. The ones who do, determine what everyone sees, though.

The community seems to be casting its vote more and more exclusively through its upvotes and downvotes these days, rather than comments. There are those who say it will automatically help the most when things get out of hand, there are those who don't want things to get there in the first place.

Interestingly, the one thing that both parties seem to (somewhat) agree upon is that things *might* get out of hand.

true,AgentUmlaut,null,null,"For the nth billionth time. I still believe in Ricky Van Wolfswinkel. Yeah if he was in consideration, Spuds would likely troll him. Regardless, he's keeping in damn good form and he can be pretty versatile with various formations.

Yes we just bought a forward, but I see Van Wolfswinkel as a younger RVP, basically someone to link goals to and have solid runs. The concern of course is, while sporting isn't having too great of a season, their owners and board may not sell cheap. If they ask more than 16mil, that's a pass.

He also has said in interviews that he'd only come to England if the money was good. Not sure if he'd be a brat and demand absurd amounts of cash, but who knows.

Lastly Portuguese league is a different animal, it's too hard to say how he'd adapt to the pace of PL. He plays at such an impressive level though, I think he could do great things.

true,caprosmaster,nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Ooooh ok, my apologies. I'll give that a run down, as I've seen in another post that you're interested in perhaps finishing off your pre 18 education here. For the sake of succinctness, I'm going to run down the last two years, as I assume that's kinda the age you're looking at. Ages 16-18, is when you take your A-levels.This are either taken at a Sixth Form, or a college. Both words kinda mean much of a muchness, but often a sixth form is attached to a school, whereas a college may be just for these two years. An A-level is comprised of ""AS,"" the qualification you get in the first year, and an ""A2,"" done in the second year. AS+A2=A-level. 


As for subjects, all you need to enter university is 3 A-levels. So typically, students do four A-level subjects in year 12, and then drop down to three, in year 13. If you want to do 4 for both years, it's perfectly doable. Honestly, the work load for A-levels is not that tough, with only taking 3 subjects in the second year you are left with a mettric shitton of ""study periods,"" or as we liked to call them - ""frees,"" much to the chagrin of any staff members!

At current, many of the A-level subjects (sciences,maths for example,) are all modular - you take a total of 4 modules over the two years, each being examined seperatley, so you can ""retake"" a module at another examination time, if it didn't go well the first time around. I think the government maybe planning on changing this to a final exam at the end style course, I'm not sure though - I'm out of the system now!

Also I'm skeptical on the Joe Cole point - he's certainly the opposite of a player Roy Hodgson would want, but he wasn't an excellent player coming off a top season when he joined us. He had a good season for Chelsea, but even then it was obvious that he wasn't the same player as the one who had excelled in Mourinho's early Chelsea teams, with injuries taking a big toll. At no point in his career for us did he ever look fully fit.

And the 'top players leaving + overhaul' didn't happen until after his first full season with the club. Honestly Dalglish all but discarded him from the moment he walked in as caretaker - hardly a ringing endorsement. Even with Rodgers, he was living on past glories (and possibly a decision that it would be easier to ship him off if he was still playing in England rather than out of sight overseas).

But that doesn't really take away from your bigger argument, necessarily.

I hope you're right, that FSG are willing to bring in top quality players (who are available to us - the likes of Isco and Eriksen are beyond us, let alone Falcao &amp; Cavani) when they believe in their manager, because the alternative is that they're too committed to building a team that will peak in a few years' time - at the expense of our best, irreplaceable players right now.",0,1358233539,null,0,false,0,c7x70rg,t3_16lj8a,t1_c7x70rg,t1_c7x59e4,null,1430965452,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

The 1st Doctor: 

- An Unearthly Child - **WATCH** the first episode, but avoid the other 3 in the serial.

- The Daleks - **PASS** - I know you want to see the first appearance of the Daleks but, watching this, I got so bored I fell asleep. Four times.

- Edge of Destruction - **WATCH** - this is just great scifi

- The Azteks - **WATCH** - it's the first doctor at his most interesting

The 2nd Doctor:

- The Mind Robber - **WATCH** - it's actually pretty entertaining

- The War Games - generally **PASS** but the last episode is worth watching

The 3rd Doctor:

- Spearhead from Space - **WATCH** for as long as you can stand it. this is the intro of the 3rd doc and he's kinda interesting but the Autons are really boring

- The Three Doctors - **PASS** - the only worthwhile moments are when the first doc insults the other two via television

- The Carnival of Monsters - **WATCH** - this is probably the best 3rd doc story

- The Green Death - **PASS** - the villain is a goddamn room-sized computer who dumps toxic waste into a mine which makes giant maggots that are killed by a hippie's magic mushrooms... And they still make it boring.

The 4th Doctor:

- The Ark in Space - **WATCH** - fun episode, even though the bad guys are giant evil boogers

- Pyramids of Mars - **PASS** - honestly this is just a mediocre episode that you can easily just skip

- Genesis of the Daleks - **WATCH WATCH WATCH** - easily the best classic episode I've seen

The 5th Doctor:

- Earthshock - **PASS** - Adric sucks more than a Dyson factory

The 6th Doctor:

- Vengeance on Varos - **WATCH** - a lot of people hate the 6th doc but he's pretty damn awesome and Peri is hot

The 7th Doctor:

- Remembrance of the Daleks - **WATCH** - it's a decent enough episode but I spent the whole time hoping Ace would die

The 8th Doctor:

- The Doctor Who Movie (1995) - **PASS** - the movie is terrible. You want the 8th Doctor? Listen to the audio dramas. At least he has a personality in those.

true,APeacefulWarrior,null,null,"&gt;So do you think he doesn't really have a solid storyline plotted out yet or just not a fan of the way Moffat runs the show? 

Frankly, both, because they're sort of one in the same.  I feel like it's lazy plotting to do like X-Files or BSG (reboot) or Lost and just constantly leaving loose ends lying around so you'll have something to hang future retcons on.  It makes it easy for writers to keep a show going for an indeterminate number of years, but inevitably results in angry fans noticing that nothing ever seems to get resolved or, when it does, it has to ignore major unresolved plot holes to do so.  

(Consider: every BSG episode started with those fateful words, ""And they have a plan..."" but the truth is, the writers didn't have a clue what that plan actually was until the very end of the show.  And, in fact, when The Plan is revealed, it turns out it was just Cavill who had the plan and was stringing everyone else along.  And everyone was unhappy about how it ended...)

One thing I liked about RTD's tenure, as well as some of the other previous showrunners like JNT is that they had a larger vision.  Hell, look at  the 'Trial of a Time Lord' season.  They were looking for ways to tell individual stories within a larger framework so that everything built *towards* something.

With Moffat (as showrunner), he's always building, but it's not really towards anything.  He just sort of throws out ideas and sees what sticks.   So I get frustrated because he'll do things I think are really cool and neat -like all the random guest companions like Nefertiti this season- but then go and do something totally stupid and inexplicable like the ""Statue of Liberty"" gag in ATM.  

He needs an editor, basically.  That's why I think his work under RTD was so much sharper than his solo stuff.  I just don't think he quite has the ability, on his own, to separate out good ideas from bad ones.  If he had a larger vision, I think he'd better able to do that winnowing.",0,1358235148,null,0,1358236605,0,c7x7bu5,t3_16kj9r,t1_c7x7bu5,t1_c7x28y5,null,1430965602,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Good old Guardian. This is not news and also lacking some context. 

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Consent):

&gt; In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II, **acting on the advice of the government**, refused to signify her consent to hearing of the Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill, which sought to transfer from the monarch to Parliament the power to authorize military strikes against Iraq. Due to the Crown's refusal to consent to the bill's hearing, it was automatically dropped

true,DimReaper,null,null,"What's 'unconstitutional' about that? The unwritten constitution of the UK reserves the sole power to go to war to HM as executed through the privy council, that bill sought to amend the 'constitution'. That's what a constitutional monarchy is. The bill would have essentially made declaring war operate on a republican basis excluding HM. 

I actually think one of the strong points of our governing arrangements is that we have someone experienced, trained for life, in position permanently and with less concerns over short term popularity who has a one-shot power of veto over legislation that is bad for the country. Doing so would provoke a constitutional crisis if the government of the day was sufficiently committed to the law to call a general election on the basis of it getting through, but that would at least make the country really stop and think about if it was right and give an opportunity to get rid of that government if we thought it was not. 

To take Weimar Germany as an example of the benefit of this, if the UK had a PM come to power who sought to centralise powers to himself in a totalitarian manner that would allow him to establish a dictatorship during a short term emergency, HM could veto the legislation if she thought that it was a power grab and not in the interests of the country. That didn't happen in Weimar Germany in my opinion partly because as a new and weak republic the head of state was a politician with a short term horizon who was subject to political pressures, and bent in the wind in the same way that the rest of the (at that point) democratically elected government did.

The article is disingenuous because the Queen clearly HASN'T exercised her (constitutional) right of veto, it would be massive front page news and an emergency general election would probably have immediately followed. She has been consulted and asked her opinions certainly, and why not, she's the head of state? I also think it reflects entirely the republican slant of the guardian that they are trying to imply that there is something rotten about her being consulted on laws relating to royal succession and the management of royal estates. The government is obliged by law to consult people affected by legislation, that's why so many decisions are subject to judicial review where a consultation has not been held.

How much is due to population increase through factors like birth rate and prolonged life expectancy? What is the figure for outward migration? 

I'm pretty sure that sort of info isn't yet available.

It will be over the next 12 months or so as the minute detail is released that we can start to make such assertions. But at the moment you can't say: pop increase of xxxx, must be because of Y. It may be that you're right but I think the true picture is a little more complex than that.

For what it's worth, I live in area that has been a focal point for immigration historically. While there has been a steady population decrease (arrested slightly over the last 10 years) I'd also say the nature of the immigration has diversified. Whereas it has historically been from the subcontinent we are seeing an increase in Eastern Europeans migration.

The *service* may not have moved online but the *knowledge* certainly has. I can research everything about a CD, DVD or most any other product, from its availability and lowest price *in the whole of the UK and maybe the world*, to whether or not it will read .mov files, will have the same noir atmosphere as Payback or how long it might work before the dustbag needs to be emptied.

All of this extremely specific and technical knowledge is out there. A downloadable product manual (which are often available free of charge for the great majority of electrical devices) is for me as valuable as face to face service, moreso because a user manual contains a searchable index of exactly all of the things about that product that I want to know; it won't be constantly hassling me to hurry up, make a decision and hand over my cash; and it will never try to upsell me to a better model.

While there is still a lot to be said for face to face service even this may well ultimately die a death as people simply become more educated about what it is they want.

The final analysis will show that the internet isn't to blame for the death of physical retail, any more than the lion's hunger was to blame for the death of a gazelle.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","&gt; At least with Comet there was a lengthy period of time after administration. Jessops must have been very seriously fucked if in 2 days it went from administration to immediate closure.

Not always that simple.

Both of them would have had massive debts. But you want to try and avoid closing the stores because if you do that, there's no money coming in. The only thing left to pay the debt with is things like the fixtures and fittings in all the stores and the brand (assuming you can find someone who wants to buy, say, jessops.com). It makes far more sense to keep the stores running and try to sell the business as a going concern - which is precisely what the administrators wanted to do with Comet.

The problem is that you're not allowed to incur any more debt if you're in administration - not even to the electricity company by turning the lights on. So really you either need to be in a position whereby you can continue trading for at least a few weeks until you can find a buyer **or** you need someone (quite often an existing supplier who doesn't want to find nobody's selling their products any more) to take a stake in the business in exchange for enough cash to continue trading. Usually if the latter is taking place, it'll happen within 24 hours of going into administration because administration is part of a plan to allow them to restructure debt.

Jessops had already had a supplier do just this a couple of years ago. They'd decided not to invest any more.

true,Jimboobies,welsh,Wales,"Where I live (south Wales valleys) the geography seems to misunderstood by people who don't live there and planning is based on everything being flat. E.g I tried using a route planner a few years ago for a train journey.  It gave me a list of 3 possible train stations to use based on distance from my postcode, all were about 4 miles away. Sounds reasonable to walk or get a bus there doesn't it? Problem is that 2 of the stations were in the valleys either side of mine, which would mean having to walk through country lanes and over the mountains. This would take about 3 to 4 hours. To get there by bus, it would take a journey with a few changes to get there; about an hour. The other station was in Newport which is a much shorter journey by bus and ironically, was one of the possible changes for the bus to the other stations.

Thankfully, things are much better now, as the passenger train service for this valley was relaunched after about 40 years. But there are still a few problems with it. The trains once an hour, there is usually 2 carriages, sometimes 4 at peak times. I heard off someone that the train line operator doesn't own the carriages, it has to rent them from some 3rd party. It's often packed at these peak times and on Saturdays when people are going to and from Cardiff. It would make more sense to run it every half an hour during typical commuting times, say between 7 and 9 in the morning and 4 and 6 in the evenings.

The other problem is that the roads infrastructure of towns is often neglected because of the concentration on large bypasses.  The bypasses themselves are great because they open up so much of South Wales and allow much faster travel times for commuters and business.  They also take a lot of the strain off small towns that were never designed for heavy traffic.  The towns themselves however never seem to be considered properly when the larger bypasses are put in.  You often see queues coming off A roads going into small towns because the junctions and infrastructure of the town can't handle the volume of traffic at rush hour. It also makes the buses that run through the towns more problematic because of delays and getting stuck in tight bends etc. it marginalises people who rely on public transport ""not wealthy enough to run a car? No problem you can use a bus that takes longer than it should to navigate the winding and hilly roads just to make your day even longer!""  

It seems in the larger towns and cities, that roads are just shoehorned into to each other every time there is some kind of redevelopment without proper thought into the long term affects. Going back to South Wales (sorry it's where I know the most having been here all my life), take Cardiff for example, a few years ago they completely redeveloped the area around the st David's shopping centre and John Lewis built a huge store there.  It has been a great boost for the city and generally well done. However, the roads to get into that part of town are awful. The entrance to the car parks are on tiny dead end streets that are just off busy junctions and cross roads.  You have to go through lots of junctions, traffic lights and filter lanes to get to them which just creates large queues and more problems as people try to sneak through red lights.  This snowballs the traffic into other parts of the city centre. They have had to dig up and redesign several of these junctions in 4 years since the redevelopment. 
I just wonder if someone had stopped and thought about all these tiny roads and silly junctions that were built on top of other roads designed for pedestrians and horses and thought ""lets change this whole road system so that actually works in 21st century for the amount if cars we have, it can work with our public transport system and also accommodate bikes and pedestrians safely, it make take a longer time to build and mean more disruption in the mean time but it will last much longer"" instead it just seems that all people care about is building things as quickly as possible so we can get back making money as long as not too many people complain it's worth it.",0,1358245346,null,0,false,0,c7x8op2,t3_16jw5j,t1_c7x8op2,t3_16jw5j,null,1430966788,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The days of specialist shops for each segment of the economy are gone. 

_Everything_ where you need to physically go to a store will eventually converge to being bought at a supermarket.

First it was the bakers, butchers and corner shop types. Now it's gobbling up other businesses.

The Tescos' of the world have huge economies of scale. They have a huge number of stores. They also have a huge number of customers.

If something stops selling, Tesco can simply replace the floor space devoted to that with some other goods. They can do this at a moment's notice. 

&gt; Tesco senior manager: CD sales are down this year? Let's change that space over to selling electricals.

In a few weeks, every store in the land has reconfigured their shop floor to follow this edict.

With HMV the DVD/CD sales _were_ their business. They're unable to adapt with the speed that Tesco can.

This is why the high street is getting crushed under the might of the supermarket chains. You have these massive companies with deep, flexible supply chains with configurable floor space selling _everything_.

I just realised that in the last five years, I've bought pretty much every DVD I had from Adsa. Why? Often I was picking up some vodka for a Saturday night in. Why not buy a cheap bargain bucket film while I'm there? At less than a fiver it's not even a real decision.

That, right there, is why HMV and its ilk have been wiped out. 

Their entire business model has been turned in to an impulse buy. People have become accustomed to buying films like they buy their toilet roll.

true,[deleted],null,null,"My grandmother, the target for the Curry's scumvertising system, recently went to buy a new telly and asked me to come along. I went along, and we went to look at their selection. I noticed that the employees were very diverse in age. Within minutes a 60-70 year old female employee stops by and starts talking to my grandmother. I found out that she had served my grandmother before, which seemed a bit suspicious.

So I looked around. As I suspected; the employees were purposely targeting people of ages groups that would trust them. My grandmother is very much more likely to trust a 70 year old woman than me on the matters of technology, despite my profession and education in the area. So, this woman sold my grandmother a shitty £200 speaker bar, a load of insurance she didn't need, and tried to sell her an ""ethernet HDMI cable"". I managed to stop that, since we didn't need one, but that was the most I could save her; £40. The employee got very argumentative about it. ""Does *your* cable have ethernet?"", ""You *do* need one, I don't think you have one"". I eventually got very angry and told her that I'm a computer scientist, that I've been repairing technology for over 7 years, and that I know more than her about  HDMI. 

So we get home and my grandmother realises she had been duped for £200 on this ""speaker bar"". The woman told her that the TV had awful sound. ""tinny"" sound. Even if that was the case, I could have gotten £50 speakers on Amazon, or even at PC world, that would have been good enough.

So we took it back. We resealed all of the packaging to make it look like we hadn't touched it, returned it, and left. Fuck Curry's. I think my grandmother will be listening to me next time, not the manipulative employee.

You might say ""Well books have a physical quality"". Yes, they do. I prefer physical books. So for that we have Amazon. They are able to undercut with physical books due to the scales of economy and their huge evasion of taxes. Borders in the US, a huge book chain, closed down. Waterstones is quite likely to follow this trend. We've seen it with other book shops here too.

If they don't fully close, expect a reduction in availability. One day we may have one huge Waterstones per major town center, but that'll be it. I don't expect places like Milton Keynes, Coventry and Woking to continue having Waterstones over the next few years.

true,BoltenMoron,num11,,"I was having a conversation with a guy at work the other day who has been trading soccer for the past 20 years or so and we were discussing the slow decline of the ""rivalry"" in football. Traditionally, rivalries were brought about by location (North London, Merseyside etc), socio-economic factors (Olympiakos vs Panathinaikos, Ajax v Feyenoord Stabæk vs Vålerenga, Boca Juniors v River Plate), poitical or religious reasons (Celtic vs Rangers) or due to the continued success (Manchester United vs Liverpool).

Over the years, the geographical rivalry has been perpetuated because of the internal culture of the clubs involved. Premier League teams no longer draw their players or support from a specific area. Players no longer bleed lilywhite or any other colour. The majority of fans no longer hold the same animosity toward their traditional rivals, the reason being, they have not and could truly have not experienced that culture. My friend's father grew up supporting Spurs in the 60's and would tell stories about his trip from Brixton to Tottenham and how there were areas you never went into for fear of being beaten to death. There are isolated incidents of acts like this occurring but these days they are the exception, not the norm.

I think it is very difficult for a present day fan to hold that level of animosity toward a rival geographical club, especially if one is not from that are. Any dislike is for no other reason than because it is the done thing. I am also a New York Mets fan and the reason I dislike the Phillies is because of their fans and the fact that they are direct rivals, the reason I dislike the Yankees needs no explanation. For us present day fans, the rivalry with Arsenal is similar to that of Manchester United vs Liverpool. It is a direct competition for league supremacy. You would be hard pressed to find a Spurs fan who would trade a higher finishing position for two NLD wins.

Such rapid change alarms people, and causes problems with integration and cultural erosion. Older people in particular have the biggest problem with it, as they have known their local areas for such a long time and cannot deal with it changing so quickly.

It also showed that a lot of the swing from the conservatives to UKIP is predicated purely on the offering of a referendum.
  
What important to note is that it's the elder (and more likely to vote) block that make up the vast majority of those who have a problem with the EU and are actually pushing for this. This along with the UKIP swing is why our illustrious leader is pushing so hard for a referendum. It's not because he thinks that most people agree with him it's just the people who are mostly likely to vote and most likely to vote *for him* do. It keeps his back benches quite, reduces the UKIP swing and gives him the best chance of being reelected. It's not hard to imagine why this is all so very temping.

While people do get more conservative as they age I honestly don't think that is the issue here, younger people have grown up with the EU and a very different sense of identity and I think if anything the country is the lest xenophboic it's been over all for a long time. That the extremist and fringe parties are making a lot of noise is, in my view, because they are been squeezed out.

All in all this makes the idea of a referendum a really very bad one for those of us who are actively pro EU, the people's who's future it will actually change are those who are most in favour of but also less likely to vote.

That fact that the ceremonial head has a veto. This makes a mockery of the elected Parliament being the supreme legislative body - its supremacy apparently stops where Monarchy's interests begin.

&gt; I actually think one of the strong points of our governing arrangements is that we have someone experienced, trained for life, in position permanently and with less concerns over short term popularity who has a one-shot power of veto over legislation that is bad for the country.

You forgot unelected, and unaccountable. Imagine trying to pass a law detrimental to the interests of the Ducy of Cornwall, for example. I know that mother knows best, but are you sure she loves you more than her own son?

&gt; HM could veto the legislation if she thought that it was a power grab and not in the interests of the country

Yeah, she could. She could ~~, and probably has been, vetoing~~ also veto anything that encroaches on her and her establishment's privilege. That is the thing with a veto - it is great as long as it is exercised in line with your interests.

&gt; The article is disingenuous because the Queen clearly HASN'T exercised her (constitutional) right of veto

She didn't have to, because the civil service apparently spikes bills that might be vetoable.

&gt; they are trying to imply that there is something rotten about her being consulted on laws relating to royal succession and the management of royal estates. The government is obliged by law to consult people affected by legislation

People affected by legislation don't carry a veto, else you can bet they would never be negatively affected by legislation.

If he isn't equally discriminatory to all these, his ambiguity in his beliefs needs to be updated to accept there are gay people in this world and treat them fairly. If he objects to all these examples he's pretty much useless in that job and no company would carry dead weight, him being Christian shouldn't mean a company pay him to do 1/5th the work someone else without unsuitable religious beliefs could do, I wouldn't keep my job if I didn't keep my skills set up so I could do all the work, if I objected to training key to my job that'd be grounds to fire me.

If a relationship counselor refused to treat Christians then they, too, would be sacked.

There is no part of the Christian faith that requires they not interact, or provide their professional assistance to people the faith considers sinners. Quite the opposite in fact. 

There is no major faith in which such discrimibation is actually part of type practice of the faith. Followers are required to behave/not behave in certain ways. Not to demand it or expect it of others.

Nor is a counselor or a registrar being asked to provide their personal opinion. They are merely being asked to be a conduit for their professional training and provide the opinions if their profession. That's what being a professional involves, whether they are a lawyer, accountant or doctor.

Personally a counselor may think or feel lots if things. It is not their role to communicate those views, nor is it required of them by their faith. These people were sacked for refusing to do a job. A job that had no bearing in their faith. They were not being asked to handle pork, or violate some other actual requirement of their religion.

Likewise if someone feels the same way about the Christian faith, the Christian will be similarly protected from being excluded, or otherwise worse treated due to said person asserting their beliefs to justify actions those beliefs do not justify.",0,1358259127,null,0,1358259441,0,c7xagb5,t3_16lzeu,t1_c7xagb5,t1_c7x97p9,null,1435643665,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Diego To Liverpool

&gt;Diego has become something of a journeyman after moving to Porto from Santos in 2004. The Brazil international has played for five clubs in the last six years, with an impressive spell at Werder Bremen followed by mixed form at Juventus, Wolfsburg and Atletico Madrid. The 27-year-old is back at Wolfsburg this season and has shown glimpses of his immense talent, but would surely be open to another move to avoid a relegation battle in the Bundesliga. Liverpool could certainly benefit from a player of Diego's skill and experience and there would be potential for the playmaker to strike up a good understanding with Luis Suarez in the Reds' attack. At the moment, there is no obvious candidate to play behind Suarez in the centre, and Diego would be perfect for the role.

true,DimReaper,null,null,"To deal with your points in turn, in the UK the monarch is not simply ceremonial, she has a constitutional role in approving legislation put forward by the government of the day to Parliament and passed in her name. We live in a monarchy with democratic aspects, not a republic. Parliament IS the supreme legislative body, in that it is the body that puts forward legislation. The Queen doesn't legislate, she just approves legislation put forward by her parliament.

You're right that the Queen isn't elected and isn't directly accountable (though she'd not last long if she did something totally against the public interest as I outlne below; we aren't a dictatorship). Lots of laws passed even in the last ten or fifteen years have been against the interests of the Royal family directly or indirectly. The fox hunting ban, changes to the vote of money parliament gives the monarchy which mean she will get less over time, plenty of things. I think the system works because the current Queen acts in the public interest as she sees it. It's a time limited system because it'd only take one total nutter becoming monarch and refusing to step down for the system to fail and the people to declare a republic, but that's an inherent downside of our system. If you don't like it, do something about it. Move to a republic like Ireland or France, or start a revolution to have David Cameron made the President rather than Prime Minister, or maybe even stand for Parliament on a republican manifesto and become El Presidente yourself.

I don't see where you're disagreeing with me on her power of veto? She COULD use it selfishly, but hasn't. That's exactly why I call it a likely one-shot. If she used it selfishly an election would be called with one or more of the parties standing on a republican manifesto, and they would probably win. But she hasn't, so where's the problem? The PM could propose legislation to make him prime minister for life, but he hasn't. Your argument seems to be against anyone holding a position of power, whether they abuse it or not.

The civil service spikes bills that could be veto able? So you're picking a fight with the civil service as well now? All bills are vetoable, that's how our form of government works. One of the Queen's constitutional roles is to advise the government of the day on matters of policy, it's why the PM has a meeting with her every week. If that advice influences their policy, well that's a part of how the system is designed to work. Bear in mind that she has been working in politics for longer than anyone in her government, and as a result has a unique insight.

You're right that most people affected by legislation don't have a veto. So what do you propose? NIMBYism is already a major obstacle to any major development in this country, and a form of government giving everyone a veto on every law is called an anarchy and doesn't work. 

Finally, on your TLDR, while I'm fairly sure I'm big and bold enough to get over an Internet badass calling me names, launching ad hominem attacks against me when you don't know me is just silly and makes you look petulant. Where have I been disingenuous? I offered a very small number of easily verified facts about how our country is run. And you clearly either misunderstand what the word apologist means or didn't read my post. I'm not apologising for the monarchy, I'm pro-monarchy (along with a large majority of everyone else in this country in every IPSOS MORI poll ever taken). So the word you are looking for is 'monarchist'. If you want to have a grown up debate about how the monarchy works I'm happy to engage with you. I respect your right to have a different view to me and I'm not going to lower myself to attacking you because of it.

But the highstreet saw a rather large drop in sales; the majority of sales being done online.  So even if the whole of the retail sector fully recovers... it's just going to be even more people shopping online. 

Hopefully this will encourage councils to look at discounts in rent/local taxation to make the highstreet locations places small specialised indies could open up for business in; we don't need more coffee shops, McDonalds and fast food take away places.

Most the time its because the support acts don't have their own sound engineers so the guys set them up for the best they can do during sound check and generally leave it at that, this generally happens at smaller venues and events. To effectively mix on the fly at a live gig you'd have to know the artists music quite well otherwise your just constantly guessing. 

Another reason may be what DoorsUK said below and that the engineers want to create a build up for main act so they do a slightly lower quality mix for the bands which isn't unheard of then maxing out the EQ for the headliner act.

My last reason is that the venue has an in house engineer that might either be someone starting out and getting the hang of everything or you get the old guys who just come for the money and don't care for the music so they won't put their heart and soul into your show.

&gt; And I am not buying the argument that we arent attracting players because we arent in the Champions League.

Why not, though? I mean, this year, Spurs pipped us to both Dempsey and Sigurdsson - that would be unthinkable 2-3 years ago, especially Sigurdsson where he had contract talks with both teams. And Spurs aren't even in the CL, they've just been finishing higher than us in the league.

That's the thing - it's not just that we aren't in the CL, we haven't even been close to the CL for three seasons. If we were regularly coming 5th or 6th, 5 points off 4th or whatever, then players would be more willing to take a gamble on us - our history &amp; reputation would sway them. 

It doesn't mean we can't get quality players and have to cut our cloth with youth - we just have to look harder for them - pick up quality players cast out by other clubs, e.g. Sturridge; or make signings that make the rest of the league think ""why the fuck didn't anyone else go for that lad?"", which is what Newcastle did with Cabaye, Papiss Cisse, etc.

true,Interceptor,null,null,"I work in digital marketing, and we've been covering this a lot recently (even producing a report that responded to Mary Portas' findings last year, which largely ignored the opportunities for retailers to join-up their digital and in-store experiences to make things easier for customers). 

HMV were a guilty of a little bit of arrogance unfortunately, and failed to invest properly in online. As an example - how many people go to a shop to try something on/check out the quality, but at the same time check on your phone to see what the online price is, or use something like Red Laser to compare store prices? I'm betting a LOT - apparently only 4% of shoppers never use the internet to look for information about offline purchases.

Shops are really struggling to join that up - if someone is in the shop, using their phone to get price data, then they should be matching that data up and offering you the best price. Personalising the experience across all those channels is hard, but not impossible. 

In the future I think we'll see more 'experiential' shops. Some luxury brands are already experimenting with them, and they revolve around the idea that shopping for non-essential items is as much a social experience as anything. You go in, try stuff on/out, hang out with your friends and order what you want. Then you leave and it all turns up at your house ASAP. Getting it delivered quickly is the main challenge, but it's doable (and hey, 3D printers are coming, so eventually you can just print off your new jacket at home - give it 20 years). 

I think people are returning to the idea that they want local, specialist retailers as well. Although in London (Just where I live so using it as an example) rents are very high for retail, there's been a rise in lots of individual stores (not so much on Oxford street obviously...), who offer expertise and a customised experience. Imagine if HMV had hired people who were mental for music and let them choose the playlists, or the specials in-store. Add a coffee shop/bar and a stick some live bands on (and not just big acts, get staff to pick upcoming acts too). Wouldn't that make going much more worthwhile? It's the reason you go to a quality butcher rather than Tesco. That way online offers the convenience, but the store is all about the experience and people still go - I bet you'd get more teenagers hanging out there too, and teenagers grow up into people with disposable income... 

So the store might end up being about branding as much as actual sales, but there's also plenty of ways that they can drive visits using online stuff as well, even if they don't have a site, it's easy for a shop to set up a simple landing page, set up some local ads, and get involved and respond to people who talk about them on Yelp or Google reviews (And Twitter, Facebook etc etc).

Finally the kid has always talked about his desire to play in Spain and Italy. Only recently has he added England to the list. Smart money says that isn't from a new found desire to play in England, but from a desire to bring more competitors to the auction block to raise his value. Further, he already told Liverpool he was interested in a transfer here just a few months ago.

true,sanbikinoraion,null,null,"As it currently works, it is more expensive to have bespoke items if you're buying from a UK tailor. If you order online it's way cheaper both because the labour can be outsourced and the retail footprint can be eliminated.

And I think that at some point someone's going to crack mass-manufacture bespoke, through some combination of technology and low-cost labour. 

I just look at how clothes shops work right now and see so many inefficiencies: 

* They either have to keep enormous inventory or miss sales opportunities (as they often do because they've run out of your size).

* Then they have to end-of-line a load of inventory that hasn't been picked up on a regular basis. Full-price sales have to subsidize these markdowns, making regular shopping more expensive.

* They are mostly located in the most expensive commercial property in the area.

* They employ a much greater number of staff than equivalent warehouse footage would require. And it's not as if the jobs are rewarding, anyway, being minimum wage dead-end jobs.

* Their sizes are absolutely hit-and-miss, and anyway having a single dimension for sizing clothes on people gives poor-quality results. And womens' clothes shops generally don't carry larger sizes, even when a large minority of the population needs them. Womens' clothes sizes are a joke anyway, they're a made-up number designed to flatter or insult the customer.

I forsee a future where people at most have to pop into a booth in a community area to get their body shape reliably scanned every few months, and then can get clothes run up overnight in in-country factories (that employ a combination of smart hi-tech workers to run the plant and moderately-skilled workers who do the pieces that the computer-aided-cutters can't).

Suddenly, clothes retailers don't need to maintain multiple copies of inventories across hundreds of high-street locations but one or two small UK factories (in fact, the retail brands would survive initially mostly as content-curators but would quickly get knobbled by a combination of smart indie labels leasing time in the factories and aggregator sites that aren't tied to particular labels and so are more easily able to curate content across different brands).",0,1358266988,null,0,false,0,c7xcdjt,t3_16m0j0,t1_c7xcdjt,t1_c7xbcjv,null,1430968613,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Our next level of 'upgrade recruits' (guys like Damiao, Llorrente, Moutinho, Isco etc) are all CL quality and just aren't going to come if we don't have CL football unless we blow a huge amount of cash. It is better to make small/cheap/no buys in January and save the money for summer.

AVB also needs to be worried about keeping the squad happy. How quickly do you think bringing in a new striker would unsettle Ade? Would signing Sneijder push both Siggy and Dempsey to the bench? We can't afford to pay the wages of those two just to have them on the bench. It is more important to offload deadwood (loan Livermore, sell Huddlefro/Jenas/Bentley) to free up room in the squad and create wage space so that new buys actually fit into the team.

Also, there is no such thing as a cab company 'run by the IRA'. I'd certainly believe that there are cab drivers in the city who probably have had links with republican terror groups in the past, perhaps there's a few now, but I'm pretty sure that there are no cab companies 'run by the IRA'. 

In the past, there were unlicensed taxi companies, I don't think they really exist any longer, so links with IRA or any other dissident terror groups are unlikely. 

But in saying that, taxi drivers know the city best, and if you ask them, they definitely wouldn't turn down a tour of the city.

""Bob Paisley bought 20 players who played league football for #LFC. Of those 20, EIGHTEEN were 24 or under. The other two were 25 and 26.

Average age of Paisley's signings was a mere 22.3. Dalglish was oldest, at 26. Game has changed, but not *that* much.

Paisley's 10 best signings, with an average age of just 22.5 (!), played an average of 464 games for the Reds. 464!

These players were Hansen, Rush, Neal, Whelan, Grobbelaar, Nicol, Dalglish, Souness, McDermott &amp; Lawrenson.

Paisley (with help from Twentyman) discovered young unpolished talent; swap lower divisions ('70s/'80s) for worldwide scouting should be aim

Point of all this is: #LFC buying in the right age bracket. The main difference is the scouting. Right ages, but right players?

New #LFC scouting set-up only been in effect since September. Age range is v.sensible, but must find gems. I hope they can; they have to.""",0,1358269064,null,0,false,0,c7xczxb,t3_16lj8a,t1_c7xczxb,t3_16lj8a,null,1435643568,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,rablenkov,uk,Southend-on-Sea,"I was told an interesting story today about HMV.  This happened within the last year or so and I'm being careful not to reveal specific details of the band involved.

A chap who runs a relatively small indie record label was promoting a new album by a band who have a reasonably decent following.  He approached HMV to ask them to stock the album and they responded that, yes, they'd be happy to do so and it would cost him several thousand pounds for the privilege.

He didn't have as much money available as they wanted, so a deal was brokered:  for about three grand (a rough figure) they would stock the album in their larger flagship stores.  He coughed up the cash.

This chap happens to work round the corner from their Oxford Street store so, on the album's release date, he popped in to have a look.  They had one copy of the CD on the shelf.  He wasn't terribly impressed.

The following day, he popped in again and was delighted to see that the CD had been sold.  Unfortunately, they hadn't replaced it with another one.  He was slightly miffed.

He went in again every day that week and never saw another copy of the CD.  HMV had happily taken several thousand pounds from him and then spectacularly failed to hold up their end of the bargain.

This is the reality of HMV now.  They'll stock all of the big titles only, unless you can cough up thousands of pounds for the privilege of having a single fucking CD on the shelves.  That, to my mind, has to be another of the reasons they've folded - they've simply stopped caring about music and are only interested in ""stack 'em high, sell 'em quick"".",0,1358269265,null,0,false,0,c7xd27j,t3_16lyv9,t1_c7xd27j,t3_16lyv9,null,1435643597,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also, you don't need to be on a tour to explore the ancient city walls. Feel free to explore them yourselves! There are also two large shopping centres nearby.

As for bowling, there is a bowling alley, cinema, restaurant etc. in Pennyburn industrial estate. If you hop in a taxi and ask to be taken to the bowling alley, they'll know where you're talking about. 

There are plenty of good bars around town, to suit all tastes. Downstairs Sandinos or the Metro are lively enough places at the weekend. If you're looking for some Irish traditional music, the Gweedore and Peadar O'Donnells play Irish traditional music (I think) - or at least bars on that street do. Wetherspoons (either on the Strand road or at the Diamond) is often a good place to get some cheap drinks before venturing elsewhere. 

If you're taking out a girl there, I'd probably avoid places like Sugar, Earth nightclub and Strand nightclub. Lots of younger people there (often under-age). 

As for restaurants, there are plenty as well. Popular restaurants include Quay West, Timber Quay, Mandarin Palace, O'Briens and... that's all I can think of for now... Da Nano's is a decent Italian restaurant that serves pizza. Most other pizza places around town are take-aways. 

If you've a car, you could explore a wee bit of Donegal too. A few minutes across the border and you can find Grianan Fort, a neolithic fort which has spectacular views from the top, and you could also take the short drive (30 minutes max) to Buncrana which has some nice beaches and a really beautiful public park (Swan Park)... bit cold this time of year but still some great scenery. 

Or you head up the other direction to the town of Muff... the footpaths along the coast there are beautiful (but probably really cold again...). Some nice restaurants and bars up that direction too. Most places in the Republic take sterling, but you'd probably get a better rate if you got some sterling exchanged for euros in the North. 

Another thing, you could check what shows are on around the city, and what live music is on. This weekend marks the opening concert for the UK City of Culture at Ebrington (the Sons &amp; Daughters concert), but I believe tickets have been sold out. You could see what's on at the Millenium Theatre (within the city walls), or at the Playhouse theatre. Some of the bars and clubs have some great local musicians playing too. When you're in the city, keep an eye out for adverts/leaflets advertising what's on.

Alex Rodriguez gets $23 Million a year for the next 4 years. He is 34 years old. So when he is 38, he will be getting paid $23 Million even though he isn't producing the same numbers that earned him such a contract to begin with. 

This is just one example. There are about 6 players that make this kind of money. Contracts that earn players +$10 Million are extremely common and the minimum salary in the MLB is $350,000.

MLB is the most lucrative of any sport in the world. It's based entirely on capitalism, allowing teams unfiltered access to funds without having to share anything. They negotiate their own TV contracts, use money from merchandising sales (which is global), and they get a ton of sponsors, despite non being on their jerseys. 

Despite all this, it's always anyone's game as to who is going to win. MLB teams sign players from overseas at the age of 16, the MLB draft is the biggest part of baseball, second to the free agent market. 

The free agent market is also the main reason for such inflated contracts. Instead of having to pay a team $15 Million for a player, you use that money to sign him to an outrageous contract.

And if you want a player from another team? Ha! You have to trade some of your best players for him. But what if the player doesn't want to go? Well, tough shit. Their contracts don't allow them to choose what teams they want to go to. They are essentially forced to go to whatever team they are traded to. 

The MLB is really interesting and different from the world of soccer. This is why so many people have issues with the MLS structure. It's completely different and unlike everything that the world knows.

Good starting points for a watch-through are An Unearthly Child (very first episode from 1963) or The Time Warrior (Sarah Jane Smith's first episode with 3rd Doctor John Pertwee).  The Time Warrior is good if you want to skip past all the black and white episodes to a point where the show has matured quite a bit.

Here is what I recommend for sampling:

* 1. The Dalek Invasion of Earth
* 2. The Tomb of the Cybermen
* 3. The Time Warrior
* 4. City of Death
* 5. The Caves of Androzani
* 6. Attack of the Cybermen

true,corourke,tardis,TARDIS,"Well for starters as an invention of mankind religion is bad since it replaces actual facts with mythical supposition (it rains because the gods are displeased; there are rainbows because god promised to not slaughter everyone using a flood again). 

A child does not understand fact and fiction, they look to their parents to help guide them in that. Parents choose to teach them that one myth is real and the others false (especially a monotheistic myth like Christianity), without a single bit of evidence or logic processing on the part of the parent. No evidence you say? By all means prove your myth is legit without also proving the rest equally so. 

Lastly claiming the Doctor is accepting of beliefs shows you only watch the new series and not very closely at that. The Doctor has always been contemptous (albeit politely so) of myths that teach violence, bigotry, and require ignorance of science and logic (again with those monotheistic myths eh?). 

By all means, believe what you want but when you choose to teach your kids these myths and then post a ""funny"" story of a 5 year old freaking out because he doesn't grasp that wibbly wobbly definition of ""real"" angels expect derision. You have programmed a kid to not apply logic uniformly, find it funny when he gets confused, then act surprised that trolling a kid's logic processing with myths offends people. Gosh.

Where as for most women (I assume), the very same action has a very different dynamic, is seen as predatory harassment and isn't something that's welcomed unless they already know the person. 

So in an environment such as a university where you have a load of fairly immature young people experimenting with both drinking and flirting it's bound to happen quite often. Most guys will figure out that slapping a girl on the ass is a dumb move relatively quickly and either stop doing it or stop thinking it's something to try.

true,tlisia,null,null,"There would be a regency until the unborn child reached its majority. Whilst a legitimate child lives (even unborn) in such a situation, it is the rightful heir. 

There's an historic precedent for the Duchess of Cambridge to be Regent, **not Harry**.

Edward III's mother, Isabella; Mary, Queen of Scot's mother, Marie de Guise; Edward VI had an entire council (though Edward Seymour seems a key player), in spite of his sisters. James VI/I's illegitimate uncle, and then paternal grandfather were among his regents. 

I feel it is more likely that a regent who has a minimal claim on the succession would be chosen, probably in the theory that they would have less inclination to harm the monarch or his cause, to favour themselves. It generally seems to be the mother, and alternatives put in place only when this is not possible. This is of course basic, and issues such as with Isabella and Edward III can arise. 

George IV is a clear exception to this, as he was regent for his father and not a minor - this was simply a 'speeding up' of the succession, as it were. 

Historically, Harry would never be regent, *but* in the modern age, it may be more of a possibility. I can't see a regency not involving the Duchess of Cambridge, however. My bet would be on a council, like with Edward VI - *maybe* involving Harry, the Duchess of Cambridge, an aristocrat or two, a Law Lord (almost certainly the Lord Chief Justice) and probably a few experienced politicians, most likely those given life peerages. I imagine the Duchess of Cambridge would probably assume most monarchical public duties, escorting her child.

* Housing - mix of type and tenure
* Local / farm produce
* Live music venues
* Cheap rent for artists / galleries
* Cheap rent for startup firms
* Indoor public space (places for gathering and communicating with others away from the elements, e.g. Royal Festival Hall - Ideas drive innovation).
* Public realm improvements (ones that are cheap to maintain; so when that fancy paving slab cracks the council don't have to fill the gap with tarmac).
* [Pocket parks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_park)
* Replace one-way streets with two-way operation, which [in theory](http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/saferjourney/library/countermeasures/13.htm) slows traffic.
* Where it is missing, re-introduce leisure facilities to support a range of ages/interests (swimming, skateboarding, gyms, tennis, football, etc.)

It’s not their blood.** They’re going to come in and out of baseball. It’s different for me. Baseball is my life.”

The most important piece of advice I think is to 'do it properly' when it comes to banking and money. Get a separate bank account for the business, balance the books, and keep track of what money goes where. Draw a salary, sure, but don't muddle your own money with that of the business. When it comes to doing your tax return (which people all over the country are fretting about now) you'll have a horrid time of it if you haven't kept decent records. Register yourself as self-employed or incorporate a limited company - most of your business expenditure will count against your tax liability, which will make a huge difference if you start earning over the thresholds.

As far as promoting your work, get a decent website and **keep it up-to-date** - that means posting at least once a week. An unkempt blog or site just looks a bit forlorn. I think much more of an ancient, badly-designed website than a brand new but unloved HTML5 masterpiece. Link your site to Twitter too, and work with Twitter to gain a following. Don't spam, and remember that social media is a way of *engaging* with potential customers rather than just broadcasting to them.

I found a book though! Rang up my dad to see if he wanted it as he asked if I ever see anything for him, to buy it! Sadly, he already had it... and the other thing he wanted wasn't in stock :(

I've noticed that HMV, recently anyway, have been rather generous with their prices! I bought the Skyfall 7"" single for the same price as it was on Amazon. I went in the next day hoping to buy the CD single as well, they had none left so I ended up going to Amazon! Bad times :(

Christmas 2011 I bought The Omen Pentology for £12! For that price I had no justification to look else where ;)

HMV is a place I would hate to see die, as do most people I know! When I was in there, whilst there tills weren't overflowing with customers, people were still queuing up to buy things, and I did see some people walking around with half a dozen CDs in their hands going for the tills. Sometimes I wonder how they got into such a mess, as whenever I'm in it's full of people!

Edit: I've never had any problem with the staff instore. Always found them to be very helpful and ever so kind, as do other people I know! My dad has especially commented on it.

When I returned from holiday in 2010, I found that my xbox 360 wasn't working! I had £40 in HMV vouchers so went and just bought a new one from HMV. The guy there was ever so kind and helped me with it, and also what to do about the game! (none of the ones it came with I liked) 

Stores I'm talking about are Shrewsbury and Manchester ;)

I went to the Manchester store with a friend to play Halo 4 MP before release, it was full of people as well! Then again, new game, I guess it would be...

You'll hear a lot of people talking about fourth place, this is very important as it qualifies you for The Champions' League, which is worth around £40m more per season, as well as being the most coveted trophy in football.

true,ClassySphincter,null,null,"The biggest problem is that town centres are actively driving people away. Parking is either nonexistent or prohibitively expensive, with restrictive time limits. Public transportation is often inefficient or poor. It's not just customers wanting to get away either, and not every empty shop equals a failed business. Even successful businesses have been driven elsewhere due to the obscene amounts of rent they have to pay. They often take up a spacious warehouse on the edge of town, giving them the additional opportunity to expand their business. There is just no incentive for anyone to be in the high street anymore.


But what can we do? You only have to look at the likes of Westfield to see that brick and mortar is very much alive and well. What's their secret? They've made shopping an experience, primarily social. Compare it to the online shopping experience. It is very limited: you find the product, and you buy it. Perhaps there's a little interaction if you have a query or problem, but that's it. The high street and dying town centres need to leverage this advantage, and redevelop into social hubs and meeting places. Create some residential development to bring people permanently into the heart of town. Bring in more specialised businesses, unique bars, proper restaurants, arcades, hangouts, activity centres. Some of these could be adopted by existing businesses (e.g. games shop/arcade, book shop/cafe).


Get rid of parking fees. Improve public transportation and cycling infrastructure. Most importantly, unsustainable property rents need to somehow change (this is the trickiest issue of all though). 


In end, yes, many businesses will die. These will be like the village blacksmith; one day no longer serving any purpose. They cannot be saved. The high street will need to downsize, but with enough incentives, and not punitive measures, I think they can draw people back to the town centre. It just needs to realign itself and adapt to the modern age.

Luckily I steered them onto a dd-wrt router downstairs beforehand so it was just a case of doing this with old netgear router they had and which I was able to load dd-wrt onto.

He was unable to sell the work to any cylinder phonograph company, but The Gramophone Company purchased it later that year, under the condition that Barraud modify it to show one of their disc machines. The image was first used on the company's catalogue dated December 1899

true,Skemocore,null,null,"The rules for the English PL and the UEFA competitions are slightly different.

A. The rules of English PL state that a team can have a maximum of 25 players who are over 21 years of age in any given season. Of these 25 players, at least 8 **should have trained with any club within the English FA jurisdictions between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years.**

If a team cannot fulfil the above criteria, then an equal number of spaces must be left in the squad selection. In other words, a team playing in the English PL can field a MAXIMUM of 17 foreign players in a 25-man squad i.e. players who do not fulfil the above criteria. All players under the age of 21 automatically qualify and do not need to be included in the 25 man squad sheet.


B. The UEFA rules state that a team can have a maximum of 25 players who are over 21 years of age in any given season. Of these 25 players:
- **at least 4 should have trained within the country** (i.e any club within the English FA jurisdictions) between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years 
- **at least 4 should have trained with the same club** between the ages 15 &amp; 21 for 3 years. 
An unlimited list (called the List B) of players under the age of 20* who have trained for at least two years at the club, can be submitted. If a team cannot fulfil the above criteria, then an equal number of spaces must be left in the squad selection.


Im talking mostly about being homegrown in the eyes of UEFA.  According to UEFA's homegrown rule for club trained players, he loses his opportunity to be club trained if he doesn't spend 18 of his 24 months left before he turns 21 with Chelsea.  He can still be association trained if he spends part of that time in England, but we desperately need Club trained players to fill those spots. Also the parent club has no bearing.  That's why Ryan Bertrand only qualifies as association trained and not club trained.  He spent those years away on loan and not at the club being trained.  We only have two players on our books that qualify as club trained (JT and Hutch).",0,1358289608,null,0,false,0,c7xjxp8,t3_16m3dd,t1_c7xjxp8,t1_c7xfvjf,null,1430972525,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

I honestly think if Liverpool was more prudent with their spending in their first real transfer window that FSG was in charge they would have a lot more capital to spend now.

Yes the Red Sox made a few unwise moves, but I really don't think that has as much impact on Liverpool as what Comolli and Daglish did.  Also I think FSG takes the financial fair play rule seriously and are making sure it won't be an issue for them in the future.

Also now a days in the football market players are more concerned with Champions League Football instead of Club history or prestige.

* The Doctor's Wife - Seriously a lovely episode that really expands on just how the Doctor feels about the TARDIS.  You get to see lots of it here; a very sweet episode all in all!

* Let's Kill Hitler - I like this one because so far what we've seen of River is that she really *adores* the Doctor, but it's vague at best of how he really feels about her.  In this episode, though, their relationship is expanded on, and it's clear that he really cares about her a lot, which is really sweet :)

Or, alternatively, people can write about minorities and even what they think is wrong with them without resorting to epithets, insults and baseless attacks. Particularly when that minority is one of the few remaining groups that has members suffering probably daily abuse, a lack of equal rights and mistrust and disgust from a large section of the public.

&gt; As long as you are able to debate it, it's fine.

My first paragraph: Do you think a newspaper would be a-OK in publishing that or could it be rephrased, preferably into a manner that doesn't result in upsetting a disadvantaged group for no reason other than ""We have the right to say what we want""?

You think that people are just out to get upset: That is not the problem at all, and I really recommend you think about the issue a little harder. Reading up on why certain words or phrases upset minority groups would be a start. That doesn't mean minority groups have a 'right' to be offended, but understanding *why* they might isn't a bad thing to know.

With the relationship councillor, I would argue that their position makes them fundamentally unqualified to act as a relationship councillor for same sex couples. You can force someone to do it as part of their job, but they're going to have absolutely no empathy and in the end the same sex couple seeing the councillor seem to be the ones that lose here. It's a more complex case with more complex overtones, but I do feel there's a result that may go against the spirit (no pun intended) of what the ECHR was trying to achieve.

With the registrar I wonder whether or not the registrar is happy marrying couples of other religions, or whether the registrar works mainly with Christian weddings. If it's the case that the registrar works solely with Christian weddings then I think same sex couples could lose out again - after all why would you want to be married by someone who fundamentally (again, no pun intended) opposes your very existence on the grounds of it being a sin?

If on the other hand the registrar works in a civil registry office and marries people from all walks of life, then they can suck it up and crack on, although I do sympathise with people having to do things they don't want to do, it's an experience I go through every monday morning when I wake up.",0,1358295344,null,0,false,0,c7xloqg,t3_16lzeu,t1_c7xloqg,t1_c7x8nur,null,1430973865,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"For the romantically minded at least,  Spurs are the most interesting team in football. You can say a lot about Spurs, but there's never a dull moment with this club. We may not have been successful as some other clubs down the years but our past is as colourful as it is chequered. 

Let me tell you our story. This is my memory so forgive me for any mistakes, someone will correct them I'm sure.

Lets talk about history. We're one of the oldest clubs in the league, about 130 years old. When we were founded by a group of schoolboys, Jack the ripper hadn't even terrorised victorian london. Our rise was slow at first, in 1901 we won the FA Cup for the first time, the only time a non-league team has won it. In subsequent years, the FA cup became ""our"" competition, by 1991 we'd won it 8 times which was a record, although money has changed the game since then and certain teams have come to dominate.

There are other firsts. We were the first team to win the double (winning the league and FA cup in the same season). We were the first British team to win a european cup. We were the first team to win the UEFA cup. We were the first team to have sponsors on the shirt and the first to become a public company. When we signed Jurgen Klinsmann we started a trend that now sees many of the best players in europe playing in the Premier League

We've had ups and downs. The 60's were our golden era and we were really good in the 80's. The club almost went bust and Alan Sugar (later Sir and now Lord) bought the club and ran things very conservatively. It was certainly needed but it can be argued that he went to far and held us back. 

For most of his reign we were stuck being a mid-table club so much so that a lot of fans were resigned to this and even today a lot of non-fans percieve us as a mid-table club. In the past they often expressed bewilderment that Spurs fans claimed they were a big club and thought we should be achieving more than we had. In their eyes we had ideas above our station, but most of us knew better.

Things finally changed when ENIC bought the club from Sugar. There was a lot of concern from fans, especially that we were ""just"" part of their portfolio, as they owned clubs in various leagues in europe. Daniel Levy became chairman and ~~hired~~ inherited former Arsenal manager George Graham to manage Spurs. While this was a fairly sensible choice the fans were unwilling to forgive and forget and even though he won the League Cup, he was fired and replaced by former Spurs hero Glen Hoddle. 

Hoddle had a pretty poor reign and was sacked early in the season and former manager David Pleat was appointed until a new manager could take over at the end of the season. This was probably the worst period I've ever experienced as a fan, we were truly awful. However, to use an American expression, it's always darkest before the dawn. 

That summer saw the start of the Spurs rebirth. French manager Jacques Santini was appointed manager and former dutch player, Martin Jol, was appointed as his assistant. Frank Arnesen was made director of football. This was a bit of a coup, to put it mildly. We bought in some very promising players that summer. The first was Paul Robinson who was a very impressive keeper. We also bought experienced Morrocan defender Norridene Naybet to shore up our shameful defence. 

That season we got of to a decent start. The team no longer looked like they were playing against themselves, they were disciplined and organised. The fans weren't too happy, many believe that the team should play the ""Spurs way"", open attacking football that's entertaining rather than necessarily doing what's needed to win. 

For reasons that were never fully explained, Santini left before christmas and Martin Jol took over and former player Chris Houghton was made assistant manager. From then on the team went on an amazing run, finishing the season just outside the european spots. It was calculated that if the team had achieved the same points average before Jol took over as they did after, Spurs would have finished 4th. Something most fans would never dreamed possible.

The following year Jol went one better and took us above Arsenal for most of the season. We dropped some pointed in the spring but so did Arsenal and we maintained our lead going into the final game of the season, away to West Ham. We were confident that we could finish the job, all we needed was not to lose and the team had been playing very well throughout April. I can not describe the horror I felt when I turned on the radio just before kick off on that final sunday. If there was any reason to believe the club was cursed then this was the only evidence required. 

Although seemingly nothing could go wrong it was announced that many players had been extremely sick at the hotel the night before the game. There were calls to reschedule or merely delay the game but, because it was the final day, the premier league would not budge. The game was to go ahead, regardless. The players that could play, played. In fairness the team was more or less the one that would have played anyway but it was clearly not ideal to play having been sick and awake most of the night. We tried but inevitably we lost. We lost and Arsenal won. We finished 5th despite being 4th for most of the season. Life isn't fair, and Spurs fans know that feeling all to well. 

Accusations and rumours started in the wake of the game. Was the team deliberately poisoned, perhaps by a betting syndicate who could make money if Spurs failed to finish 4th? Others suggested that the players who ate lasagne were the ones who got sick and the incident was named lasagne-gate. Subsequent investigations determined that it was just shear bad luck rather than malice that had been our undoing. The players had contracted the virulent norrovirus or winter vomiting bug as it's called. Last year, just before christmas, a million Brits were thought to have caught the virus in a wide-spread outbreak. None of them had to play football the next day however.

The next two seasons saw us finish 5th twice and some fans started to wonder if Martin Jol had maxed out our potential. Not long into the season Jol was sacked and replaced by Sevillia manager Jude Ramos. Ramos had done a fantastic job with Sevillia and it was clear that Levy thought he could perform similar miracles here. 

The team continued to play well and in January we faced Arsenal in the two-legged semi-final of the League Cup. We surprised ourselves somewhat with a 1-1 draw at the emirates stadium so the fans were optimistic but nervous about the home game. We needn't have been, it was one of the finest moments in recent memory. We beat them 5-1, it was the kind of result that only a lunatic would have dreamt of. Not just a win but total annihilation. 

A final against Chelsea was the reward and the cagey match went into extra-time when a free-kick was launched into the box. Chelsea's keeper, Petr Chec tried to punch the ball but Jonathan Woodgate was too close and the ball rebounded off of Woodgates face and into the goal. It was too late for Chelsea to find a response and Spurs hung on to win the cup, the first trophy since Grahams in 2001.

It's late so I will leave the rest. I hope you enjoyed the story, stick around because I can't wait to see how it ends.",0,1358296186,null,0,1358373976,0,c7xlxow,t3_16mphk,t1_c7xlxow,t3_16mphk,null,1430974073,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

Basically this article rather succinctly sums up what I would like to say, except in a far more eloquent way: [link](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/airing-controversial-views-is-the-great-skill-of-julie-burchills-career--and-something-the-observer-should-never-shy-away-from-8452774.html)

From that link:
&gt;After 30 years, you know what you're getting with Julie Burchill, which makes the stance adopted by her current employer, The Observer, puzzling. The story is this. Suzanne Moore, also a fine columnist of long-standing, wrote a magazine article in which she railed against the pressure for women to look like, as she put it, “Brazilian transsexuals”. Cue uproar on Twitter, where Ms Moore was subjected to a barrage of insults from transsexuals, who claimed offence. Burchill stepped in to defend her friend and, as is her way, went that little bit further, describing transsexuals as “a bunch of bed-wetters in bad wigs”. The Observer was bombarded with complaints, and - outrageously - the MP Lynne Featherstone demanded Burchill's sacking. The Observer, the paper that bravely opposed the invasion of Suez in 1956, immediately removed the article from its website.

&gt;What kind of country is this? Are we so cowed by vested interests that free speech, which includes the freedom to offend, is now constrained? Does the Twitter mob now set the rules on fair comment? In a statement, the editor of The Observer said his paper “prides itself on... airing challenging views”. True. He ends by saying: “On this occasion we got it wrong”. Surely some mistake. That should be: “On this occasion we got it right”.

true,byzant1n,null,null,"Since everyone is reacting like this is the worst thing in the world without actually reading the piece, here it is. I can certainly understand how people would find it offensive, but I think people have overreacted, and censoring it was too far.

&gt;The brilliant writer Suzanne Moore and I go back a long way. I first met her when she was a young single mother living in a council flat; she took me out to interview me about my novel Ambition (re-published by Corvus Books this spring, since you ask) for dear dead City Limits magazine. ""I’ve got an entertaining budget of £12.50!"" she said proudly. ""Sod that, we’re having lobster and champagne at Frederick’s, and I’m paying,"" I told her. Half a bottle of Bolly later, she looked at me with faraway eyes: ""Ooo, I could get to like this…’ And so she did.

&gt;I have observed her rise to the forefront of this country’s great polemicists with a whole lot of pride – and just a tiny bit of envy. I am godmother to her three brilliant, beautiful daughters. Though we differ on certain issues we will have each others backs till the sacred cows come home.

&gt;With this in mind, I was incredulous to read that my friend was being monstered on Twitter, to the extent that she had quit it, for supposedly picking on a minority – transsexuals. Though I imagine it to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep, as Denis Healey had it of Geoffrey Howe, I nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time-wasting by a bunch of dicks in chick’s clothing.

&gt;To my mind – I have given cool-headed consideration to the matter – a gaggle of transsexuals telling Suzanne Moore how to write looks a lot like how I’d imagine the Black &amp; White Minstrels telling Usain Bolt how to run would look. That rude and ridic.

&gt;Here’s what happened. In a book of essays called Red: The Waterstones Anthology, Suzanne contributed a piece about women’s anger. She wrote that, amongst other things, women were angry about ""not having the ideal body shape – that of a Brazilian transsexual"". Rather than join her in decrying the idea that every broad should aim to look like an oven-ready porn star, the very vociferous transsexual lobby and their grim groupies picked on the messenger instead.

&gt;I must say that my only experience of the trans lobby thus far was hearing about the vile way they have persecuted another of my friends, the veteran women’s rights and anti-domestic violence activist Julie Bindel, picketing events where she is speaking about such minor issues as the rape of children and the trafficking of women just because she refuses to accept that their relationship with their phantom limb is the most pressing problem that women – real and imagined – are facing right now.

&gt;Similarly, Suzanne’s original piece was about the real horror of the bigger picture – how the savagery of a few old Etonians is having real, ruinous effects on the lives of the weakest members of our society, many of whom happen to be women. The reaction of the trans lobby reminded me very much of those wretched inner-city kids who shoot another inner-city kid dead in a fast-food shop for not showing him enough ‘respect’. Ignore the real enemy – they’re strong and will need real effort and organization to fight. How much easier to lash out at those who are conveniently close to hand!

&gt;But they’d rather argue over semantics. To be fair, after having one’s nuts taken off (see what I did there?)) by endless decades in academia, it’s all most of them are fit to do. Educated beyond all common sense and honesty, it was a hoot to see the screaming-mimis accuse Suze of white feminist privilege; it may have been this which made her finally respond in the subsequent salty language she employed to answer her Twitter critics: ""People can just fuck off really. Cut their dicks off and be more feminist than me. Good for them.""

&gt;She, the other JB and I are part of the tiny minority of women of working-class origin to make it in what used to be called Fleet Street and I think this partly contributes to the stand-off with the trannies. (I know that’s a wrong word, but having recently discovered that their lot describe born women as ‘Cis’ – sounds like syph, cyst, cistern; all nasty stuff – they’re lucky I’m not calling them shemales. Or shims.) We know that everything we have, we got for ourselves. We have no family money, no safety net. And we are damned if we are going to be accused of being privileged by a bunch of bed-wetters in bad wigs.

&gt;It’s been noted before that cyberspace, though supposedly all new and shiny, is plagued by the age old boredom of men telling women not to talk, and threatening them will all kinds of nastiness if they persist in saying what they feel.

&gt;The trans lobby are now saying that it wasn’t so much the initial piece as Suzanne’s refusal to apologise when told to that ""made"" them drive her from Twitter. Presumably she is meant to do this in the name of solidarity and the ""struggle"" – though I find it very hard to imagine this mob struggling with anything apart from the English language and the concept of free speech.

&gt;To have your cock cut off and then plead special privileges as women – above natural-born women, who don’t know the meaning of suffering, apparently – is a bit like the old definition of chutzpah: the boy who killed his parents and then asked the jury for clemency on the grounds he was an orphan.

&gt;Shims, shemales, whatever you’re calling yourselves these days – don't threaten or bully we lowly natural-born women, I warn you. We may not have as many lovely big swinging Phds as you, but we’ve experienced a lifetime of PMT and sexual harassment, and many of us are now staring HRT and the menopause straight in the face – and still not flinching. Trust me,  you ain’t seen nothing yet. You really won’t like us when we’re angry.",0,1358297291,null,0,false,0,c7xm9hv,t3_16mm5x,t1_c7xm9hv,t3_16mm5x,null,1430974415,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,widgetas,null,null,"&gt; Don't be sensalionalist prick. 

I thought it best to make my point quite clear, that way we avoid the pitfalls common to subtlety. But from your response - by the by... you sound to me like you're just looking to get all offended by my approach? - I get the impression that you were sightly irked by my example. To me that implies that you understood where I was coming from. Just to check: Did you read past the first paragraph?

&gt; I think there's actually an interesting point to be made here without turning it into childish hyperbole.

Interesting perhaps, but misguided in my opinion. I can draw a number of (non sensationalist, you'll be glad to hear) analogies when it comes to something like this. But I think it's fair to say that whenever something like this comes up, one usually (not always: Burchill is a partial example) finds it's a group almost entirely unfettered by oppression (for want of a milder descriptive term) that takes umbrage and bridles at what they perceive to be a restriction on their free speech. A notable example is when there's even a hint that sexualised language (notionally unwanted attention aimed at women in public settings) or similar might be restricted in some way: guaranteed there'll be a number of men taking exception to their rights being attacked.

Once again I'll make the point that you appear not to be accepting, or too aware, of exactly *why* transgender people (and people who know much about their predicament) might get upset. Many of these people suffer discrimination, insults, mistrust and danger on a daily basis. The fact that you could recognise puerile insults directed at 'obvious' minorities who have suffered historical persecution and take exception to it only goes to outline my point that you seem to be overlooking the issue here. Why?

By the by, just to confuse you: I don't think Burchill should be sacked, nor do I think that the article should be removed. I think it should stand as it is, perhaps with an editor's note prefacing it, with all the comments below. However: I can understand entirely why people are disgusted that the Observer published the article.

Further with regard to the hand wringing and lamentations about ""free speech"": No-one is stopping Burchill from saying anything. I assume she has a blog? I imagine she can post it there as she wrote it. The Observer, like any privately owned publication, is free to publish or not publish anything it wishes. The reason it has removed this article is because they feel: “On this occasion we got it wrong”. One could argue that ""they're only doing that to stop people attacking them"" but there's the more preferable alternative that ""they now understand the problem"".

As my first comment attempted to make clear: A challenge to nearly any other minority, if it were couched in such insulting language *for the sake of being insulting* (which is what Burchill was clearly doing in order to defend her friend) would receive almost universal condemnation (with obvious exceptions, of course). The reason it has not in this case is because of the lack of understanding for the trans-gendered community's problems. Burchill didn't write this to start or continue a debate, she wrote it to get back at a community she thought were out of order.

Free speech shouldn't really be something that's worried about in a case like this.

In goal, we have Hugo Lloris, France's best goalkeeper and an experienced newcomer this year to Spurs. His backup is Brad Friedel, a 40+ year old American who still starts the occasional game and is a joy to watch.

Our best ""back four"" in defense is among the best in the league. At left back, Benoit Assou-Ekotto is a finesse player, with great ball control and quarterback-like delivery of the ball over long distance to the left and right wingers. Jan ""Super Jan"" Vertonghen is the new rock at the back after the retirement of Spurs' long time legendary center back Ledley King who retired this year. (Listen at the 26 minute mark of every Spurs match for the fans [singing their homage to Ledley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7IpiFZNTEg), who wore number 26). Vertonghen is a well-rounded player, able to be physical as well as agile. His ideal defensive partnership is with Younes Kaboul, another Frenchman, currently injured, who has risen from decent prospect to outstanding defender with Spurs. For now, you'll see Kyle Naughton, who has been steady filling in for the injured Kaboul. Kyle Walker is at right back. Where Assou-Ekotto tends to distribute the ball from defense, Walker uses speed to push up the pitch to contribute to the attack.

On the left in midfield, there's Gareth Bale, who you'll have heard of for sure. He is one of the fastest players in the league, has a wicked shot, but occasionally has ""Kobe Bryant"" syndrome trying to put the whole attacking effort on himself. Sandro, our defensive midfielder, is basically Godzilla crossed with a [ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66PckPfMENE). When the other team has the ball, Sandro makes it his business to ruin their day and win the ball for Spurs. Sandro may be injured long-term, but his replacement, Scott Parker, is an equally adept day-ruiner. On the right wing, Aaron Lennon is having a career season. To make another basketball reference, he breaks ankles and gets by defenders. Finally, Moussa Dembele, a newcomer from Belgium (by way of Fulham) has been brought in to be the creative man for Spurs. He generally favors attacking to defending, and tries to thread passes through to the wings or our forwards.

Up front, you'll see long-time Spurs striker Jermain Defoe, who is having a tremendous year. The new manager (Andre Villas-Boas) who was hired this year has built a system that has really unlocked Defoe's scoring touch. Also up front is Emmanuel Adebayor, a larger and more physical type of forward. He is known for great ""hold-up"" play, where he receives the ball and slows down the attack for the rest of the team to set up.

Don't be alarmed when Spurs fans use the word ""yid"", there's a lot of history with Jewish supporters and it has been claimed by the team as a badge of honor after it was used insultingly by other teams.

Spurs have had periods of greatness, but supporting this club can be a rollercoaster! You're going to swear at your TV for half a match only to be amazed when the boys finally click.

Shanks was the ‘special one’ before anyone else, tongue firmly in cheek he made so many mischievous and funny comments. Any others following him are just a facsimile with a modern twist.  

He also was a tactical master before ‘he who shall not be named’ was a manager. He conjured Liverpool’s success from nothing. 

He took a second division side and achieved his dream of making Liverpool Football Club a bastion of invincibility. And on those strong foundations that he built Paisley, Fagin and Dalglish were able to continue his dream.

But in addition to these things, Bill Shankly never forgot where he came from and what he was. In fact where he came from and what he was informed his ethic of hard work, the struggle of the common working class man and his also dreams...and the dreams of others.

Shanks was a one off, a creation of his times. He was an inspirational individual. He not only inspired a team but a whole city. 

Shankly, with all of the mischievous and funny quotes aside, was an honest and dignified man. 

His honesty and dignity were born out of his working class upbringing and his socialist beliefs, in a time when socialism was not a dirty word. 

And his lesson to his team and the people who watched his team was simple, hard work and being part of something greater than your self will make you a better person and by being a better person, the thing you are a part of will be enriched.

And with this he gave the common man and woman a blue print for dignity, hard work and achievement. 

If David Pearce can capture this, with a mixture of fact and poetic licence, he may well help inspire another generation with the pure magic that was Bill Shankly.
