I don't understand that about spurs sometimes, you've got Dembele, Siggy, and Holtby who are all central attacking midfielders and yet they'll throw them out wide and think they'll excel there.
Siggy isn't totally wrong as an inverted winger, he does score some excellent goal but he'll never be the kind of guy who scares fullbacks in a one-on-one situation, and he isn't the kind of guy who looks for a good cross. He passes well, has a great shot and can head the ball.
He looked great at the end of last season and he got us out of some nasty situations with critical goals early in this one. He gets a pass from me, to be honest, I'd love to see him be used as a sub for Erikssen because he could get us some excellent goals late in the game, but he shouldn't be on the wing unless there's been injuries and he needs to cover. That's the situation we're in right now, so he gets a pass because he's playing out of position to help us through a rough patch.
Chadli has been poor, but he gets flack because he actually is a winger. Although I keep hearing that his injuries have been why he's been so poor so with any luck we'll see another side of him soon. He was good for Twente, but he hasn't looked anything like that. When we see the real Nacer Chadli, people's views will be changed but right now they're getting a little frustrated with him because they heard he was supposed to be good and he's been terrible for the most part. Once he gets his speed back, he'll change some minds.
Naughton has been awful though, there's no reason he should be a part of this squad. He's only supposed to be a backup, but I've never seen anything out of him that made me think he'd be good for this squad.
Dawson has been alright but with all the injuries in defence his pairings have been all wrongs. He should never be paired with Chriches, neither of them are quick and they get exposed, but with the injuries on defence they're having to put them together and they get roasted. Pair Dawson with Kaboul though, or Vertonghen and he'll look good.
The real reason that Naughton, Dawson and Chadli are getting the brunt of the outrage is that they've made some plays that make you scream at the TV. You watch a quick striker and winger run at Chiriches, Naughton and Dawson back there and your face goes white.

Honestly, the sheer desperation of Saatchi and his mates in the right wing press to make her look bad just keeps failing, it's hilarious to watch.

I saw a desperate front page article in the Sun (was at my parents for Xmas, I didn't buy it.)  It was all about how, despite being a TV chef, she didn't actually make the dinner all the time, and got people in to do housework and the like.  So apparently her 'domestic goddess' persona is a lie.  Guess what, most personas are 'a lie' because they're personas, rather than being the actual person.

I can imagine Lorraine Kelly sometimes gets grumpy too, despite her cheery TV side.

It really was the worst kind of hatchet job, who'd have thought a millionaire celebrity type didn't spend 16 hours a day in the kitchen handcrafting everything from scratch?

How dare she hire people to do some of the work for her, right?

Fuck me, I'd be in the same boat, if I had a few million from being famous for cooking, I'd probably make stuff every now and then, but bugger the daily grind, someone else can do it.

Does Stephen Fry get hassled for not carrying around a little set of cards and asking everyone he meets unanswerable questions, because that's what he does on the telly, therefore we should expect it of him all the time too?

Or perhaps the more rational ones out there realise there's a difference between a TV persona and the actual person. I personally wouldn't be that upset if it turned out one of the Hairy Bikers occasionally got the bus into town.

Now this may be biased coming from me as I volunteer at an RSPCA shelter. Everyone there has noticed since all of the bad press the charity has been getting we have seen less and less people willing to goto these kinds of shelters and adopt and animal, more just going to visit animal breeders.

In the article Sir Barney says &gt;""The charity has become more interested in animal rights than promoting welfare""
Fighting for animal rights is a huge part of promoting welfare for animals. Take [Dover port](http://www.rspca.org.uk/media/news/story/-/article/monitor_live_export_in_dover_May13) for example with the importation of live animal s. Currently RSPCA inspectors are not allowed on to check these animals. This allows for animals to be grossly mistreated and can even die in these environments.

What I'm saying is really that please don't believe this or go along with the growing hivemind that the RSPCA is bad. I've seen the RSPCA do such amazing things, it would just be a shame to let the already collapsing reputation of such an amazing charity to fall to a point where nobody has any respect for it. I know that would be a very extreme point, but you get where I'm going.

Sorry for how long this has gotten.

It's good that no one ever comments blaming cyclists when a driver hits one then, isn't it?

You keep saying that, but you've not answered my question. What agenda?

&gt; Hell, with a bit of searching I think you can bring up my post into a thread about some motorist who did something stupid and got charged. I didn't mention dangerous cycling. There was simply no need to make it about anything but the topic. I guess that's where we differ.

It's very easy to to see the swashbuckling displays of Henderson and signal it out for praise. I think Joe Allen hasn't been getting his due credence. Don't get me wrong, he hasn't set the world on fire. But he's been our metronome. Keeps possession ticking over. Always there to take a pass and keep the ball moving. This is a key role for our team, it allows the men around him to make runs and free up space. He picks up the ball, moves it on. In that time, a few runs have been made and the team can go in transition. Defensively, he has been pressing SO much. In the Anfield Index podcast, episode 6 (released before City game) they were presenting statics of pressing pairs that won back the ball the most.  Allen and Hendo and Allen and Lucas won back possession most of any pressing pairs in our team! He hasnt been anonymous like he was most of last season, he is bombing forward. He's just not as effective in attack as we'd like. Let's hope that changes. 

And I can't say, again, that I agree with your Alonso comment. Perhaps I am misunderstanding it. But Alonso was incredible in his first season with Liverpool. I remember when Gerrard was injured for a few weeks, he really carried the team. He came on at HT when we were 2-0 down at Fulham and we ended up winning 2-4, with him proving pivotal in creating two goals and scoring one. He took to us really well. He was deep lying but he had a Hamann/Mascherano around him. And I'm not sure he bombed forward too much, I can only remember a few instances when he ran into the box to get a shot off (Arsenal is the only one that springs to mind).

If it's 'no', then what would we really do about it? If you genuinely need the backing of an oil tycoon or Arab royalty to win the league, then I think we're stuck - with or without FSG. It's hardly like we've got a queue of people saying ""let me hand LFC £500m to spend on players"" and FSG are turning them down. Our financial situation is what it is at the moment and I can't see it getting too much better.

Plus with the empty promises of Gillet and Hicks (or just look at Vincent Tan) I'd be incredibly sceptical of any 'dream' owners that did come in saying they were happy to spend big.

We have owners who are putting in decent money right now, who seem to care about the club, who support what the manager is doing and are prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt if results aren't amazing (so far anyway), and who have a track record of successful club management with the Red Sox. That's a whole ton better than most Premier League clubs at the moment. 

Plus I feel the FSG model is sustainable. If they up sticks and left the club I think we'd be OK. I'd raise the question of what Man City and Chelsea will do when their owners decide they can't be bothered supporting huge expenditure on wages and transfers every year. Having a system that works around spotting and developing young talent will always do well for you so long as you retain that knowledge of how to do it. Having a system that's based around just buying the best players only works for you for as long as you have the funds to do that. I don't think Man City and Chelsea have as good an infrastructure at the club once they lose the ability to spend big.

To me Hoilett looks like he's more useful as an impact sub, where he can flog a fatigued opposition with his pace. I just don't undertstand why the coaching staff aren't trying to get him to vary his final decisions...defenses and goalies know exactly what they will be up against when his name is on the team sheet. I suspect due to his hamstring issues he'll get a rest over the next few games - the mystery is who will take his place on the left? I hope Traoré but chances are SWP will grin his way onto the pitch against Donny or Everton.

Kranjcar I guess I'd go with, if only for the fact that he actually likes to have a pop at goal. Obvious quality there.

The rest are O'Neill, Carroll, Benayoun, Jenas, Henry and Diakité. O'Neill I'm just not convinced was a worthwhile addition. Carroll's youth, energy and mobility perhaps compliment the rest of the more mature guys in the middle well, but we're pretty deep into the season and his inclusion isn't exactly helping us score goals. Dunno about Benayoun, still too early to become a moaner or a groupie. Jenas I think is deadweight. At least Henry knows his place - unglamorous muscle at the back. Diakité probably isn't worth talking about as it seems clear Redknapp doesn't wanna know. If I'm lucky I'll get to see him at Everton. In any case, the fact that I'm trying to choose one man out of six is indicative of how unbalanced the squad is. It's all well and good have a large squad to give you the edge over opponents down the stretch, but unless it's swollen in the right places it won't be much good to you, as we found out up front on Thursday.

Mackie asked to leave because he wasn't getting the chance to play here. He's an international, so I can't hold that against him, he needs playing time. I just wish someone had sat down with Redknapp and explained that at this level the man would definitely have brought something to the team.

As for up front...I agree I'm not convinced Hitchcock is the answer, although it would have been far better to have him in the Boxing Day squad than Zamora. I think Austin is doing too much legwork, and Hitchcock is too small to be able to relieve some of that burden. If they bring someone in, I think a large target man would be wise so that Austin can get down to business as a poacher. Mind you, that might require breaking the 5 man midfield orthodoxy, and thus having to sit out even more players.

If Onyewu is off then they are kind of obliged to bring in a new defender as well, although I would happily give Ehmer game time if this turns out to be a mid-table season.",0,1388232150,null,0,false,0,cebtm0u,t3_1tsytm,t1_cebtm0u,t1_ceb7whl,null,1427958099,1,false,superhoops,t5_2swvo,1

I think it's interesting that you mention things that take place between ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Let's Kill Hitler"" as I personally view this era as the worst during the modern show (The one notable exception being ""The Doctor's Wife"" which I regard as one of the best).

If anyone can tell me what Stephen Moffat was thinking at this time please let me know because it seems like the episodes here didn't live up to anything about the series. The same thing happened a little bit with the beginning of the 7th season and I have a hard time determining in what order ""Let's Kill Hitler"", ""The Power of 3"" and ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" should rank as the worst episodes of the past 7 years.

I know this is really ranty but I really do like the show, it's just that it feels like they can set up a really interesting plot/prophecy/challenge etc. and then they resolve it WAY too quickly. A lot of my non-whovian friends criticize the Doctor's Screwdriver as being the magic wand that fixes EVERYTHING and this is no clearer than in Power of 3 when he revives 1/3rd of the planet with it.

So now that I'm closing my rant let me address your post OP.

&gt; ""On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer, a Question will be asked, a question that must never, ever be answered.""

I think that the difference between what we say and what people spoke into prophecy has enough embellishment for this to be a mistranslation. Or more strictly The Church of Silence did not completely understand the truth field and played it up in their prophecy.

As far as the regeneration issue is concerned it is not new for the series to have problems keeping the continuity straight here. I believe that in some of the side material (books, radio drama, games, etc.) the Doctor was quoted as having said that since he was the last time lord he could regenerate ""hundreds of times"". His psuedo-regenerations may not count as full regenerations and the relatively small uses he put them two may not have prevented him from completely regenerating this last time.

Legal unskilled immigration may have a negative impact however more evidence needed. Legal immigrants need to eat and therefore they might take up a food prep job, but they increase demand for food prep. They need to live in a house so they may take up a bricklaying job, but they increase demand for housing and therefore bricklayers.

Therefore, if a British person smiles, and they're not a nutter, they truly are happy. Smiles in that sense are worth a lot more.

We're very cynical compared to Americans. For example, patriotism, if someone says they hate America, it's near-blasphemous, whereas if someone were to say they hate Britain, it could be a conversation starter (eg. I don't like it either! The weather's rubbish and I dislike the Queen and her toffs etc.) Of course, there's a difference between saying you hate Britain and actually hating the place. Our patriotism is more reserved, but make no mistake we wouldn't want to be anywhere else, and will defend it against anyone who genuinely and maliciously insults it.

In terms of world affairs, I think we're going through a 'time-out' phase, before we get stuck in again (eg.19th century).

Personally, i hate the 4-4-2 because it leaves our midfield so light, but i realize that with a team sapped by injuries and struggling to score it is worth trying the 4-4-2 to get Ade/Soldado on the pitch together.  Long run it doesn't seems like we should stick with it, short term it is worth a shot to see if we can jump start the attack.

I don't know if we are better off having sacked AVB, sounds like the relationship between AVB and the front office had completely broken down and on the final day both sides knew it wasn't going to be repaired. In that situation i get the reasoning for the axe falling. I have no idea if Sherwood is the answer, my instinct tells me he isn't, but i am hopeful he is.

The distance any vehicle travels has nothing todo with the volume of traffic on the road at any one time. If cyclists represent 2% of traffic it's that 2% that has to be measured against the remaining 98% at that time or over a course of time.

Or... an hour on the road a bike might travel 20 miles and a car 60 miles. That does not mean the car is 3X safer than a bike. It simply means it traveled 3x the distance. Which is why it's a very bad way to measure safety/dangers.

Hope that sorta makes sense.

I really don't need to elaborate further, I articulated fine.

His first point was that there are any number of solutions from proxies or VPNs to get around this, you don't need the Darknet to get around it. Your response to that was, for some reason, to make up a new definition. Darknet never has meant ""non-commercial"", so you're talking out your arse there. What's worse is it doesn't even make sense as a reply if it did mean that.

His second point was very specifically that the Darknet (the actual one, not whatever the hell you're referring to), in all its forms, is infiltrated by those it was created to avoid. Your point was ""take care whilst on the Internet"". If you genuinely don't see the difference between the two, then Christ.

His third point was that none of this is hacking (or, if you want to use a specific definition that some dirty bearded guy made decades ago that skiddies have cited ever since, cracking). Your response to that was ""No-one said it was hacking"". Which was, let's admit, an odd response since the very first comment in the thread begins ""It's inadvertently helping kids learn about hacking"", which is the one that you replied to, which Eddie then replied to.

Do note, though, that ""buhhh huhhh"" is simply the sound you were making whilst typing your entirely useless response. It isn't hostility, I'm just really, really trying to get across how clueless you sound to anyone that a) knows the subject matter and b) can plainly see your ""tactics"" for arguing.

Now, since I've rather blatantly called you an idiot, you're simply going to shout ""ad hominem! ad hominem!"" and walk away. Or, perhaps not now that I've said this - I'm interested. But I do hope you take home the message that you really are clueless on the matter you insist on talking about. Maybe you won't reply, or say something while mentioning that you didn't read all of what I wrote, or maybe you'll take the high road. Maybe you'll tell me I have issues! Exciting.

What you *should* do is actually argue the points - support your definition of a DarkNet. Back up how your 'trust' point supports/refutes his.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"To be fair to Sherwood, he has had the team for a little over a week and in that week he lost Townsend, Dembele, Lennon, Sandro, Paulinho to go along with already missing Jan and Kaboul. Considering all those missing and the short time frame the 4-4-2 is effectively an ""idiot proof"" (takes far less instruction to implement a 4-4-2 than a flowing 4-3-3/4-2-3-1/4-1-4-1) system to put in and get some attack.  I am hoping that once the injured return to the lineup we will see him move back to the 4-3-3 that he ran with the kids.

Hoddle (and to be perfectly honest, i hate the man) is always preaching the 3-5-2. Most of the time i have seen him preach the 3-5-2 for us he has wanted 3 CBs plus Walker/Rose pushed up the pitch with 2 CMs and a CAM (effectively dropping our wings for fullbacks and Sandro for a CB).  I get what he is saying but i think it doesn't play to the team's strength.  We lose our wingers in favor of fullbacks, while Walker and Rose look good, they aren't as effective as Lamela/Townsend/Lennon (when healthy and on form) in attack. and we are light in the CB position and Sandro is along with Walker probably one of our best players this season.  In short Hoddle was asking to put more attacking responsibility on Rose and Walker at the sacrifice of Lamela and Townsend, and take away the midfield defensive responsibility and putting it on the CBs at the sacrifice of Sandro/Capoue.

Ultimately i think everything about our players makes it seem like a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 is our best formation, i think that is how the squad was built to function.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Eto'o might start, even though Ba is a preferred option among many of us. Apparently, Mou liked what he saw from Eto'o in the game against Swansea and might just give Eto'o another shot at redeeming himself. 

The left flank is likely to be a match up between Hazard and Glen Johnson, while the right could do with Willian tracking back on that kid, Branagan(?). Hendo will need to be closely marked, and Essien rather than Mikel would be a better idea, if Jose decides to go with zonal marking. Ramires would have been the better option but he's out. Mikel might still make it as the defender between the lines, clearing up stray passes and helping out the back 4 with Suarez and Coutinho. 

Speaking of, the back 4 is likely to see Azpilicueta return to LB, and JT + Cahill marshaling the center, with Brana on the right. Alternatively, JT + Brana with Cole and Azpilicueta flanking them could be another option, should Jose try and surprise Liverpool - but this as likely as OctaChaz wearing his CL Jersey again. 

The only position left is the advanced midfield. Should Jose go with Lampard, packing the midfield as he did with Arsenal, and hope to spring a surprise on the counter? Should Jose go with Mata and let him float behind the striker, doing his thing, hoping to keep Lucas occupied? Should he opt for Oscar and hope he puts in a defensive shift as he did against Swansea? The first option relies on counter-attacking opportunities and needs a striker who can finish. The second requires a striker who can get on the end of Mata's excellent creativity. The third option relies on the wingers - Hazard &amp; Willian creating and/or scoring chances for/with the striker. 

It is not just Suarez we have to be wary of - it is the people who feed him that we need to target. Keep Coutinho, Sterling and Henderson busy and cut off their supply to Suarez and he will be forced to drop back to the midfield. And this is why I believe either Lamps or Oscar will start on Sunday. Maybe both, with Oscar taking Willian's place in the line-up.

Now I'm not saying that everyone should be aiming to be the best in the world at something, that's not realistic and there is a lot to be said about the lifestyle from living in smaller countries. But put it this way, if you're in a band in the UK and you're awesome there is nothing stopping you from becoming one of the biggest bands in the world. Do you think if the Arctic monkeys were playing a few gigs in Malta they would end up being one of the biggest bands in the world in 5 years? Well the same can be said for any industry or any ambition that someone has.

So according to my friend the impact growing up somewhere where you are *forced* to either limit your ambitions or leave is huge and that's why all of his friends are getting their education abroad and not planning on going back.",0,1388240040,null,0,false,0,cebus8z,t3_1tvi3g,t1_cebus8z,t1_cebuhw2,null,1427957550,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,gomez12,null,null,"&gt;Except, this is censorship. Any method of banning or restricting access is censorship. 

Seems like an extreme definition. TV has broadcast standards. You can host your own pirate radio station. You can't say whatever you want in public. We don't consider those things to be evil censorship.

&gt;And this isnt about restricted porn really, its about what this might lead to. We have conceded this, just wait a while and see what they want to do and expand the restrictions. If we don't fight it now, we will lose more and more because they know now that they can get away with it.

Who exactly is the ""they"" in this situation? ISPs? The contract holders who decide to block things?

I fail to see how being given the option to filter content (which was possible to do with some router firmware or with 3rd party software anyway) is any sort of slippery slope.

&gt;THIS is why people are mad, the future of internet freedom is at more at risk since this.

Blocking content has always been possible. Simply making it easier for technologically inept people to block content on their own networks isn't scary at all. A much more worrying thing is something like the piratebay block by court order.

&gt;Yes it may be easy to avoid now, but just wait and see what they want to try and do.

Again with the ""they"". Who exactly is out to censor us?

&gt;You also seem to be under the impression that every adult out there has complete control of the internet in their property, this is not true. Some landlords supply internet into houses now (in my area at least). 

So? If your landlord supplies the internet then they could have already restricted it if they wanted to. And they are perfectly within their rights to do it. After all, if you do illegal stuff online its their name on the contract. But its a free market. If your landlord changes terms, tell them to unblock it or you can leave. But really, all of that is irrelevant because they already could have blocked things if they wanted.


&gt;Hell, even in my house share only one person of eight has control. 

Not the governments problem or your ISPs problem. You could say the same for your electric bill when one of you runs an electric heater all day. Work it out.

&gt;Also this is opt-out not opt-in like you say.

Only if you are using the most ridiculous definition. You get a clear yes/no choice. ""Opt out"" would mean that you are automatically filtered until you tell them otherwise. A straight yes/no choice isn't opt out simply because the yes box is selected by default.

Coutinho and Sturridge weren't low risk either, since they were both basically on the fringes of their clubs. Carroll, Henderson, Allen and Downing were hardly low cost.

true,Nickini,null,null,"I would be very surprised to see Diego Costa leave in January given how well he and Atletico are playing, and he's seemingly very settled in Spain. Perhaps in the summer Atletico would be unable to refuse a big bid given their financial situation.


Lewandowski did an interview a month or two back (with Sky Sports IIRC) saying he'd already decided where he was going, but couldn't say until January. Would love for that to be us but everything is pointing towards it being Bayern. However, given Pep doesn't always play with a true number 9 he may then consider Mandzukic surplus to requirements, who could potentially be fantastic for us. 


At this point it looks to be either Liverpool or United who'll miss out on top 4. If Liverpool miss out I think Suarez will leave, potentially to Real Madrid which could make Benzema available. Or if it's United I think Rooney will want to go (he may regardless and will only have a year left on his contract, he could still command a £30m+ transfer fee so I doubt United will want to see him leave for free). Think we have a fantastic chance of signing Rooney should this be the case as I doubt he'll want to move abroad and Arsenal are unlikely to meet his wage demands.


Although I think a striker in January would give us a massive boost, I think we'd be better off waiting for the summer as there'd be a lot more options. I don't want to see us buy a striker for the sake of it, would rather we paid the premium and got a top striker.

true,lolman1234134,wales-Ceredigion,Kentishman in Ceredigion,"&gt; Seems like an extreme definition. TV has broadcast standards. You can host your own pirate radio station. You can't say whatever you want in public. We don't consider those things to be evil censorship.

But that is censorship, people just don't realise it because its been there so long. If we allow this to continue we wont see this as censorship and it will be the norm, that is why we need to fight it now. As it becomes the norm, more restrictions will start to come about.

&gt;Who exactly is the ""they"" in this situation? ISPs? The contract holders who decide to block things?

In this case, its the government, they are forcing the ISPs to impose restrictions. David Cameron was an avid supporter of this system.

&gt;I fail to see how being given the option to filter content (which was possible to do with some router firmware or with 3rd party software anyway) is any sort of slippery slope.

This is in fact one of my personal largest gripes with the system, they are imposing a system on all of us that was not needed. Cheaper, easier to implement and more efficient systems already exist (parental control systems installed on local system). Why would they want to impose a system on us if it already exists? This just stinks of censorship, especially considering the blocked list is controlled by them and not the user/ ISP (which as you might have seen has blocked some useful websites like sexual health sites).

&gt;So? If your landlord supplies the internet then they could have already restricted it if they wanted to. And they are perfectly within their rights to do it. 

This point is more about having an awkward conversation with your landlord than anything else. The way that the filters have been presented to us is a porn black (which it is right now) but if for instance your favourite website say the national library was blocked and you want it unblocked you have to have a conversation with them about removing the filter. And of course they will think you just want porn, while not a big problem I admit, its not the best situation ([also the British Library was blocked](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/12/25/the-best-story-yet-about-the-uks-online-porn-filters/) ). If they wanted to block stuff they could, but now its turned on by default. And again, if they have had access to block this stuff for years, why has the government decided to start imposing blocks?

&gt;Not the governments problem or your ISPs problem. You could say the same for your electric bill when one of you runs an electric heater all day. Work it out.

This is more of a personal issue true, but I shouldn't need to talk to a housemate to sort this out. It should be opt in. See landlord issue above.

&gt;A straight yes/no choice isn't opt out simply because the yes box is selected by default.

Yes it is. That is quite clearly opt out. You said it yourself, it is already checked. How many people will say yes to the recommended settings?

Our tax system is reasonably fair on low earners (especially since the increase in the personal allowance), our financial system is very advanced (almost all shops will take debit/credit cards and online shopping is popular even for groceries - the Continent is quite backward in that regard).

Also we are much less religious than many other countries, I'm not a rabid atheist, but I'd rather just not have to think about it.

Our trading laws are pretty relaxed too, unlike Germany where everything is shut on a Sunday (that might sound lovely and twee, but it's just a pain in the arse if you are working). Our licensing laws aren't great but aren't horrendous either.

It's mainly the things like the weather being grim so often, the housing crisis swallowing up so much income etc. that I care about - the housing crisis mainly. Internet censorship is worse in Germany with GEMA blocking most of Youtube. And tbh the filter thing is a pain (and just smoke and mirrors to avoid economical debate and housing etc.) but it isn't *that* bad.

&gt; The RSPCA has successfully challenged the interpretation of a will to secure a greater share of a deceased donor’s estate.

&gt; George Mason’s will provided that his friends Norman and Patricia Sharp on the one hand, and his brother John Mason on the other, should be given an amount equal to the maximum possible without inheritance tax being payable. The amount would be split 78 per cent to the Sharps and 22 per cent to George’s brother. The will also provided that the Sharps would inherit his house, with the RSPCA being entitled to the residuary estate.

&gt; In addition, any IHT payable on the transfer of the property would be paid out of the residuary estate.

&gt; The animal charity challenged the executors’ construction of the will, saying the property should have been taken into account to calculate the value of the estate. 

They disputed it because the will stated that tax was to be paid out of the residue leaving less money for the RSPCA. The end result was that the Sharps ended up paying IHT that should have been paid out of the will so the RSPCA could get more money.

I think Tim Sherwood just needs a clearer understanding of what he's doing. He has no anchoring midfielder, but is still playing a high line. He has a flat four but has tactics that don't encourage wide midfield play. I think he basically is grounding his philosophy in numbers at the back when defending and numbers up field when attacking, but the players need direction.

Redknapp's ""kick it about"" plan worked because we had some real tactical minds at the club (Modric, VdV, late stage King, etc.) and the competition for places wasn't as fierce, but one thing you will see with any club that is punching above their weight and challenging that top 4 (Everton, Southampton, Newcastle) is that every single player has a perfect understanding of his job.

What I would like to see happen is the back line push back about 5 yards, Capoue (or Bentaleb, I guess, although I'm not sure if he's physical enough for Stoke) anchoring the midfield in a very disciplined and restricted manner (think Makelele) and a flat three of Lamela on the left, Eriksen in the center, and Chadli on the right told explicitly that when the ball is at their feet they are to take on defenders from the outside or look for crosses.

so that's why Drogba, Anelka and to an extent Gudjohnsen and Kalou have struggled over the past few years?

&gt; all this taken in to the fact that torres has lost touch and flunks attempts and foremost he is not a physical player and due to lost pace he falls down rather quick, but to argue that he is a complete waste of a player is not true

I'm not arguing he's a waste of a player. I'm arguing that he's simply not good enough for our team.


&gt; he has insane work rate

Does he? His work rate for the vast majority of games since he's been with us hasn't been good enough. He sometimes doesn't even look interested in what's happening on the pitch.

&gt; he has progressed a lot through his worse years

Fundamentally, a £50m striker shouldn't have to progress a huge amount,  especially when they are playing for a top club.


&gt; the revival of torres is insane

Revival? These 'revivals' have happened every season since he's been with us. They last a few weeks before he dips out of form again.

Naughton, Dawson, Dembele, Rose

Lamela, Holtby, Eriksen, Defoe

Soldado, Adebayor

subs are Freidel on for Holtby at Half. the theory behind this is Timmy will be hoping to confuse Stoke into thinking that Holtby suddently aged 18 years and morphed into Hellboy, thus striking fear into them. I think he tried a similar tactic in the U13's or something.

Sig on at 66 for lamela. I hear tell Les is a big fan of alliteration and peotry and I can totally imagine him thinking (superb sig sent in sixty-six sending stoke sadly somewhere sans points)

finally Bentaleb on at 70 for Naughton pushing Soldado over to RB and moving defoe up top. because the media loves him (bentaleb) and Defoe is a ""GOALSCORER""  it will be hailed and the media will quesiton why AVB was not that flexible. also the added bonus of just saying ""Fuck You to Soldado"" lieterally making it impossible for him to score, so lets do it!

I fully expect this lineup because we didn't score goals so obviously we need more attacking football hence dembele and defoe coming on. I think Timmy is supposed to be a ""go kick the ball about"" type manager so why the fuck not?

if spurs don't score 3 goals I fully expect Timmy to keep whacking away defenders with attackers until the lineup looks something like

The purpose of this episode was to wrap up an era. The 11th Doctor, as played by Matt Smith, has lived for centuries and been involved in several epic story arcs, most of which were left with loose ends. The Silence, the cracks in time, the Daleks' having the Doctor purged from their memories (not sure where that was supposed to be going) and most recently the retcon of Gallifrey surviving the Time War. They also had to finally address the issue of the regeneration limit.

When they wrapped up David Tennant's Doctor they did so over the course of several specials and it was a very satisfying experience. This time they had only one episode to do it in. With so much meta to fit in there was very little room for actual plot, which is a shame because it cheapened what should have been a very emotional ending. The gratuitous shoehorning of Karen Gillan in at the end was symbolic of the whole episode: it was all just stuff crammed in to tie up as many loose ends as possible in 60 minutes, leaving a clean slate for the next round.

So yes, even for someone who has been keeping up with the story it was still a bit of a rubbish episode.

Except when little Timmy wants to use his tablet or his phone or PS3 or some other device which can't have a filter installed onto it.

It'd be better if the ISPs had an opt in filter, TalkTalk style, though.

&gt; This point is more about having an awkward conversation with your landlord than anything else. 

Why would it be awkward? If they want to scoff over it, you say ""well you will have to turn it off or I might go and find somewhere else to live - I'm paying the rent, I'm over 18 and I don't want a filter"". 

&gt; its not the best situation (also the British Library was blocked[1] ). 

Intentionally or due to incompetence? These ISPs have only been filtering for a couple of weeks, either it takes time to get things perfected or perhaps they're demonstrating how shit a filter can be to try to get the government to drop the idea. State censorship? not likely.

&gt; And again, if they have had access to block this stuff for years, why has the government decided to start imposing blocks?

It's not filtering for the same reason. The existing filters are intended for child porn (and thanks to the courts, the pirate bay). These filters are designed to block specific pages/files, not entire sites. Useful for government censorship, not useful for age restricted content.

&gt; This is more of a personal issue true, but I shouldn't need to talk to a housemate to sort this out. It should be opt in. See landlord issue above.

Seems like a mountain out of a molehill.

&gt; Yes it is. That is quite clearly opt out. You said it yourself, it is already checked. How many people will say yes to the recommended settings? Or just click through each page dumbly because they trust that the ISP has made the right decisions in advance for them? This is opt out.

Why does that make a difference? If the user then tries to access a filtered site, they will be told as such. They can then engage their brain and think ""maybe I should turn it off"" and then do so.

Looking at the screenshots from ISPs like BT, it seems like you have to make a decision either way - not a simple ""next"" but ""yes I want filters"". Hardly opt out.",0,1388246823,null,0,false,0,cebwejs,t3_1tuffv,t1_cebwejs,t1_cebvp1j,null,1427956795,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

* Tuition fees are relatively low compared to say, the US 
* NHS is free at the point of use
* Good profits if you're a BTL investor
* Good profits when buying shares in privatised public assets (e.g. royal mail)
* Free press, safe haven for stories like Snowden etc to be freely reported

Negative things about the UK

* The rail system is cripplingly expensive
* Tuition fees are still very expensive
* The most popular newspapers are The Daily Mail and The Sun 
* The Daily Mail is the number one news website in the world
* Most of the cabinet is run by millionaires with extremely privileged backgrounds
* The average house price is currently £170,000, requiring someone to have at least £30k saved up for a deposit + moving costs. Add a significant amount more to both figures if you live in or around London

true,pastpresentfuror,null,null,"The combination of the players is not the only facet of a formation, though, and that's what I think /r/soccer and /r/coys struggle with. At the beginning of the season, I was a heavy endorser of the 4-2-3-1 as it is my favorite formation (along with its cousin, the 4-3-3) to watch. It is tactically exciting and really allows for the expression of attacking players (why the German teams have been so exciting lately--particularly 11-12 &amp; 12-13). However, it depended upon total trust of the manager (obviously not the case) and the team developing an understanding with each other quickly (obviously not the case) 

In a 4-2-3-1, you are either conceding a lot of the wing play (restricting your fullbacks to mostly counter attacking play as your 3 attackers will all need to find space in the center of the park to link up with each other) or numbers in the box (as your extra man in the midfield has pretty significant defensive duties or if you use outside wingers instead of inverted).

If Paulinho turned out to be a Lampard type with the versatility in passing as well as defensive strength, Soldado turned out to be your RvN-esque two touches then shot on goal high efficiency poacher and either of Chadli or Lamela turned out to be a Robben-esque dual threat with the ability to find a killer pass or shoot accurately for goal, we would be in business. But none of them have been good enough to really rely on.

With a 4-4-2, you win games with your tempo, your press, and pure industry. You run harder, you ping balls in from everywhere, and you make chances. You don't necessarily need technical brilliance, just decent balls into the box and neat passing.

With a 4-2-3-1, you really need players to take complete ownership over their duties and provide something special in order to completely unlock defenses (a la Gundogan, Reus, Goetze in Klopp's Dortmund). We don't have the confidence to do that currently. Also, being an English footballer through and through (born and raised in the 2 up top tradition) with literally no managerial experience, I don't trust Tim Sherwood to enact complex and tactics heavy formations, to be honest.

Right now we should be playing a 4-4-2 (really more of a 4-1-4-1 (with Sandro/Capoue anchoring midfield and Adebayor linking up with the midfield) and pray that Capoue can handle that holding role well enough until Sandro returns. We should be asking for energy and efficiency from our players rather than intricacy and genius. That's our best bet until we can get someone in who actually has some experience managing and can train and develop players in the way necessary to really unlock that upper level of tactical sophistication.

true,ZombieWomble,null,null,"The total quoted radioactivity looks to be fairly small - 180 millicuries in the Belfast site, and less than 0.1% of that at the Derry site. They say the main component is Iodine with a half life of around 2 months, which would make it [Iodine-125](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-125). Which makes sense, as it's used in a number of diagnostic and radiotherapy techniques. The total mass of radioactive material is very small, in that case - 1 gram of I125 has an activity of about 25,000 Curies, so that's on the order of a few micrograms of actual radioactive material. 

In terms of danger, it's hard to tell without exactly knowing what form the Iodine is in. I suspect the most likely form is that this was a small number of brachytherapy seeds. These are small (few mm) implanted metallic radioactive sources, used for treating localised cancer. The systemic risk of these is small, because the range of the radiation is low. If you somehow got one embedded in you for a long period, it could cause some local toxicity at that site, but only if it was ingested and stuck within you for many months, from right after it was disposed. (Range of the radiation is a few cm in water, and a couple of meters in air).

Nowadays, the risk from radioactive iodine is effectively nil, as less than 0.1% of it would have been present a year later, let alone now. The ""industrial waste"" may be a more significant issue, as it might have been something with a longer half-life, but if the iodine is the major source of dose, then there's little to worry about.

And why didn't he rest the mythology of a hidden galllifrey for longer than one episode? That was a gigantic reveal on the 50th. You're supposed to let that breath in the viewers mind for a bit in the background.

Not have them firing life energy spunk at him through cracks in the universe in the very next episode. That was such bollocks. In a way he fundamentally damaged the grandeur of his gesture reworking the mythology on the 50th by piling a ton of crap on top of it one episode later.

It feels like he has damaged the new mythology extremely early by having it be a stupid deus ex machina. Literally *one* episode later.

I'm really annoyed with him basically. He kind of screwed things up in that episode. I get there may have been issues with Matt not being able to run another series, but if that's the case, then you almost have to presume that he tried to collapse nearly a seasons worth of mythology into three episodes. He got away with it in the first two, but by Christ the wheels came off in a big way on the Christmas episode. It was hard to watch - it was a narrative structural car crash.

They had to have known it in the edit suite. But as the man says - too late then. Or worse, Moffat couldn't see there were massive problems with the pace and structure of the ep. 

Either way- annoying. Not the end of the world - but annoying. He's basically a genius and we're lucky plebs to a certain degree, but he needs to lay off the 'compressed storytelling' for a while methinks.

true,ImThe10Doct0r,tennant,Tennant,"But Steven Moffet hadn't even come up with the idea for The War Doctor yet! That episode was over 2 years ago. You can't criticize him for not  taking into account about an idea that he hadn't come up with yet! He can't predict the future. And he's certainly not a time traveler. When he was planning the 50th, basing it around The Doctor ending the Time War, that's when he realized that he needed to create another version of The Doctor to be the one that fought in it, since he didn't see 8 fighting in it (I agree with him on that. Could you see the 8th Doctor fighting in battle? Cause i certainly can't), and since 9 was newly regenerated in the episode ""Rose"" (his line when looking in the mirror about it how ""it could've been worse. Look at the ears""). So he just created another version of The Doctor. But he couldn't have known that at the time of ""The Impossible Astronaut"". At the time, he thought he still had at least one more regeneration left. This show is constantly changing and adding new things, and no one could possibly predict any of them. There will always be times where things that somewhat contradict each other,  and you just have to let them slide, because not every single small detail from the past determines what the future is going to be. The future is not set in stone because of our actions from the past. Yes, Steven Moffet made an error, but it's a necessary error so we could've had the wonderful 50th anniversary that we did. I could not see Paul McGann or Christopher Eccleston in John Hurts place, nor would I want to. So at the end of the day, Steven Moffet made a mistake because he had no idea that he'd make a show changing decision 2 years in his future. So please, stop criticizing him for not planning for his massive decision he'd make 2 years later.

true,citrusphoto5,smith,Smith,"&gt; Doctor Who? The Doctor. Exactly that. The Doctor IS his name, any other name doesn't matter because that's what he lived by...

Disagree. I found that answer to be a total cop out on ""The Question"" and had every feeling that they would dance around it like this. I think its way too risky for the producers to ""name"" him after this long. Tho, I read on another thread somewhere yesterday that in an old ep, another timelord refers to him as ""Alpha Sigma,"" which would almost be abstract enough to be satisfactory... at least more so than if he turned out to be named ""Jal"" or ""Trak Do"" or ""Kevin""

Regardless, his name is still entirely relevant, since the Crack still clearly has the ability to show up at will, and can be blown wide open by the mention of the Doctor's name.

So, I think that it would make a GREAT season plotline for him to be searching for his own name, all the while not knowing that if he succeeds, that he'll bring about the return of the time lords and the end of time.",0,1388249598,null,0,false,0,cebx96h,t3_1tv76y,t1_cebx96h,t1_cebrhkv,null,1427956328,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I am not condoning hitting or smacking, but what is a light smack?  Is it what I call a very light tap?  Am I being abusive to my child because I chose that hand tap as a physical reminder of what no is?

I feel very judged by people that don't have children and from some who say that they have taught in schools but never experienced life with a child under the age of 5.  Would you prefer if I just left my child pulling out wires, or perhaps touching something hot?

Sorry for the rant, but really, I would prefer if people would state exactly what they mean by ""smack"" and when does a tap transform into one.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Lundy island is the origin point of the greater temple that includes Stonehenge.

&gt; Last night I had a subtle inspiration to draw a line from the center of Lundy at the precise latitude of Stonehenge to a specific location within Mexico City. The line I drew in Google Earth has a length of 8645864 m. You can download the kmz file [here](http://secretsinplainsight.com/kmz/DF-DC-NYC-Boston-Lundy.kmz) and see for yourself.

&gt; The line passes right over Boston, a stone’s throw from the location of the original tea party…

&gt; …and continues over Manhattan—just 200 meters from the United Nations complex…

&gt; …then passes directly over the White House in Washington DC…

&gt; …and finally terminates at the center of the 330 foot diameter Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City.

&gt; Just think about that for a moment. How likely is it that one line should pass over five sites of such global significance? I can’t begin to calculate the odds. This alignment seems to be about leaders, from the ancients who created Stonehenge and its greater temple, to the founding fathers of America, to the leaders of all nations, to the President of the United States, all the way to the Great Mother.

Dzeko, well I hate on him, but he moved a lot more in the second half, played the full 90 and got another important goal with a great finish.

Lack of shots on target I think had a lot to do with how Palace parked 10 players around the box. Also a lack of runs from Dzeko made it easy for them to keep this position.

Joe had a great game, still looked a little shaky when dealing with some balls in the air, but I'll chalk that down to a lack of depth perception.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; we have the credentials of a top 4 club is something a lot of people on this subreddit can agree on.

Can agree on us having credentials, sure, but I think like vladedivac says there are a few too many people who seem to just be assuming we'll make it. I'd say we're probably more likely than not to finish top four, but it's stupidly tight this season. Man Utd even with a shitty start are now only two points behind us (albeit with one more game played), Everton have been up behind us all season (easy to dismiss them because they're the blue shite, but it's not like they haven't finished above us in recent years), and as much as I can't see them above us at the end of the season Spurs and Newcastle aren't totally out of the hunt either. 

I think we should get there, but realistically there are 8 teams with a reasonable hope of finishing top four right now, and I think it'd only take a bad string of results to really drop us out of it. When people are talking like we're 100% definitely in the Champions League next season it is getting a little ahead of things somewhat.

There's a lot of ""maybe we'll win the title, but if not we'll deffo get top four lad"" positivity around here lately, which isn't necessarily wrong, but I think people are getting a bit too hung up on how well we're playing and ignoring how close things actually are points-wise right now. In one weekend we went from top of the league to 4th and only two points ahead of 5th. It's that kind of close this year.

Kerrang covers a fairly wide variety of genres these days, not just metal, or guitar based rock, and I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to show that these are the most popular ones with music consuming teenagers. The trouble is that they listen to copies of things they already own though, they don't go to the radio for it. Which is why Radio one is so off the pulse.

The line also passes within a couple of hundred metres of the peak of Elati, which is the highest mountain on the Greek island of Lefkada (the site of Homer's mythical Ithaca).  And who was born on Lefkada in 1821?  None other than Frederick TEMPLE (!) who was later to become Archbishop of Canterbury and crowned King Edward VII (who himself was a well-known mason).

Your fullbacks are the most important players in the 4-2-3-1, and if they are good enough and you trust your midfield anchors and center backs enough to efficiently fill in the space they leave behind them, then they can bomb up and down the field all game. For us however, having been skinned by almost every team we've played in the last 6 weeks down the flanks, I don't think they should be given so much attacking responsibility. I should have said ""we should be restricting our fullbacks to mostly counterattacking"". Chiriches and Dawson struggle enough suppressing attack through the middle to have our fullbacks out of position the entire game.


To pretend like Lampard is not one of the best English two way midfielders of the premier league era is absolutely laughable, as much as I hate his club. He is an outrageously good passer of the ball and an exceptionally good decision maker. If you need proof, ask any Chelsea fan and/or look at any of the I'm sure dozens of passing compilations on YouTube. He has a decade long tradition of beating players with long balls, short balls, diagonal balls, one twos, etc.


A 4-4-2 is a high tempo formation. It always has been. Every formation has its limitations. There is no way to make a 4-4-2 a defensive formation. It is difficult and ineffective to make it a possession heavy formation (usually involving the second striker dropping back frequently for link up play). It is frenetic, it is exciting, and it is open, which is why few teams use it any more. It exposes large parts of the field for large passages of play unless your team is unusually good at compression (which involves taking up a much more defensive formation when not in possession).

Man City play with Aguero running channels and heavily involved in link up play (much like Adebayor), and since he has been injured, they have played a 4-2-3-1 with Negredo in front of Silva. They also have the current best two way player in the world in Yaya Toure who can be efficient enough both in defense and attack that you can entrust large amounts of responsibility in him (which we have no equivalent to).


There, of course, are many ways to employ formations, but the 4-2-3-1  requires a high level of tactical thought from the players (particularly the second holder with the freer role and the three behind the striker), and with no real leaders on the pitch in midfield (think a Modric or VdV), it runs the danger of looking like a bunch of idealess players running around like headless chickens (a la the first 15 games of the season).


If you are going to sit here and try to convince me that, from a tactical perspective, coaching a bunch of 20 year olds against reserve coaches is even remotely comparable to managing a team of millionaire professionals against the Mourinhos, Wengers, Martinezs, etc. of the sport you are underestimating just how difficult the manager's job is, and how much tactics are about outthinking your opponent. It is not about just putting out your best 11 and hoping for the best. It is about having a deep understanding of both your players and the opponent, and understanding which of your weaknesses they will exploit and which of theirs you will attack. If I see us line up with a low confidence not scoring striker alone up top and three underperforming midfielders with limited understanding of each other's movements behind him, I'm going to do what any team did and going to tell my defense to hug close to them and play a frustratingly physical game, like every single team did to AVB (to pretty good effect). 

Tim Sherwood is making the step up from being a top high school basketball coach to taking the job at the LA Clippers (College, by the way, being the Championship or League One). Not a single manager in the league this year hasn't coached senior professionals for many years before getting the job in the premiership aside from Muelensteen, and he is about to oversee Fulham's first relegation in many years. I hope Sherwood comes good, but there is absolutely nothing he has done tactically that makes me think he has any idea how to out think top managers.

He didn't attack well enough to supplement Navas and made a couple of bad reads in his own end with attacking players moving in. Thankfully it didn't cost us anything besides a couple shots on goal but he really didn't mark wingers well nor did he close down on central attackers at good pace. 

Boyata's determination in staying in his own end also meant that Kompany had to make a few more runs than I think he felt comfortable doing but Palace never really chose to counter-attack to test us too much. Good experience for the youngster but not my favorite defensive line this season today. 

Javi Garcia was an interesting takeaway from this game. Not much involvement and with Palace's style of play today (sitting down in their defensive zone) I'm not sure why he wasn't subbed off for Nasri. Instead they took Fermandinho who seemed to be in good form today with a couple close-calls and calmness on the ball in the attacking end. 

Milner is still a work-horse. 

Dzeko played a decent game. Had a couple good opportunities and obviously nabbed the winner but Navas is really the one to thank for that goal and his vision on the pass. 

As for our abysmal shot target percentage: I think there were a lot of opportunities which were deflected and a few more which could have been allowed to mature for a second or so more. Good to see they can get shots away but they need to come with more conviction if we want to win on New Year's Day.

There is almost a twenty year gap between us, yet when I see him, I can't help but observe what an obnoxious, self-entitled and manipulative little shit he is. I never faked crying, and after what happened the first time, I certainly never through a tantrum more than once. 

Am I saying that children should be beaten? I don't think what I went through, even though I feel I have not inherited any lasting emotional damage, is the solution. However, I do not believe that a society that does not punish its children is in any way more or less grown or matured than another society where punishing does occur.

The real solution is to avoid being so materialistic. If children were raised to be even a fraction more ascetic, so that the need to smack their child never crosses the parent's mind, then social workers would be all the better at seperating punishment from genuine physical abuse.

My main question for people who get bogged down in the details is, ""How did you make it this long without blowing your brains out?""

Given that you could throw a dart at a random episode and it would probably break some rules, the show has been training you to accept that these things happen and happen often. I can't imagine how someone's nitpicking brain circuits haven't overloaded by now if they care more about the how than the why, as you put it.

""Humans learn by pain and particularly in young children they occasionally need a temporary pain stimulus to learn not to do something until it becomes natural behaviour, sometimes to avoid bigger pain (using the fingers in plug socket example) or sometimes to learn modern morals that dont have pain stimulus of their own (such as lying, throwing a temper tantrum, being rude etc) and as reinforcement of other techniques (naughty step, time outs, groundings etc) so that they learn that if they dont comply with being told 'No' or the other methods that there are painful consequences.

Then as they get older smacking is no longer necessary as they have learnt the importance of the consequences of their actions.""

Kids say stupid stuff at school. She knew whose parents were rich, whose were criminals, whose were growing drugs in the attic. She knew when something wasn't right with a kid. With that many kids coming and going every day, the outliers weren't hard to notice. They wouldn't be picked up at the right time by their parents, or they wouldn't play like the other kids when she was on watch. The parents might make strange requests, or keep their kids away from the school for long periods, or just not show up at all. I'm sure there were other things I didn't know about, I was essentially a janitor.

Sometimes she would be sure that a child was in danger. There was a mother who kept insisting that her children were sick, too sick to be taken to school, when they were perfectly fine. Then she tried making them sick, I can't remember how but it obviously wasn't safe. The head contacted the council, and that was it. She couldn't do anything more.

This isn't rare. In the staff room teachers talk about the kids (It's true!) and occasionally one would casually mention, ""he gets beaten at home"" or ""his dad's a pedophile"" while they were chatting as if it were nothing. This happened maybe once a week, idk. Nobody made a big deal out of it. They informed the council and kept an eye on the kid but what more could they do? To them it was nothing, since that's all it could be. Never stopped bothering 

This was in a pretty rough part of Dagenham, so it's probably not as common in other schools, but teachers get a huge insight into family lives like you wouldn't believe. Children make a family, and children are teacher's business.

The option to enable the filter should be made abundantly clear, but not at the expense of the option to disable it.  The filters should also be explicitly described as only really being targeted at parents of young children, and not as a substitute for good parenting.

A lot of people aren't very tech-minded, and will know little-to-nothing about the filters.  They'll just click through all the setup defaults, including enabling the filters, and then find that they are blocked from legitimate and constructive discussion of important issues, without even knowing that they can do something about it.  We've already seen sex education and LGBT support websites blocked.

UI design influences the way people use services.  Designing the options page so that most people will indeed have such sites blocked just seems absurd to me.  Even though that are clearly more important factors to complain about, I can't think that this is anything other than a bad way of implementing the choice.",0,1388257075,null,0,1388257316,0,cebzvs3,t3_1ttaok,t1_cebzvs3,t1_cebyzrm,null,1427955102,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Your fullbacks are the most important players in the 4-2-3-1

It depends what type of 4-2-3-1 you play! With inverted wingers they are extremely important. And es for us they are very important.

&gt; For us however, having been skinned by almost every team we've played in the last 6 weeks down the flanks

I havent really seen that as a massive problem personally. I certainly wouldnt be in favour of reducing the role of our Full-backs in our attack.

&gt; He is an outrageously good passer of the ball

Noone is doubting that he is an absolutely word class player however in his prime he was still a rather limited player and he was certainly not soeone who spraying balls around the pitch and setting the tempo. He wasnt in any way shape or form a deep-lying playmaker.

And Chelsea fans actually continuously give out about how often lampard gives the ball away.

&gt; A 4-4-2 is a high tempo formation. It always has been/There is no way to make a 4-4-2 a defensive formation 

It isnt neccesarily though. Its often used as a defensive formation - Ireland used a 4-4-2 under trapottoni and were the most defensive and slow tempo team around! Not true at all!!

&gt; Man City play with Aguero running channels and heavily involved in link up play (much like Adebayor), and since he has been injured, they have played a 4-2-3-1 with Negredo in front of Silva. They also have the current best two way player in the world in Yaya Toure who can be efficient enough both in defense and attack that you can entrust large amounts of responsibility in him (which we have no equivalent to).

Yes...  Most of that is true however you said earlier that 'With a 4-4-2, you win games with your tempo, your press, and pure industry. You run harder, you ping balls in from everywhere' which is clearly not the case with all teams that play 4-4-2 so Im not sure what you are really trying to say here....

&gt; (which we have no equivalent to)

Actually Dembele is a similar player to Yaya... Last season he was very effective in a 4-4-2 

&gt; There, of course, are many ways to employ formations, but the 4-2-3-1 requires a high level of tactical thought from the players (particularly the second holder with the freer role and the three behind the striker), and with no real leaders on the pitch in midfield (think a Modric or VdV)

A 4-4-2 requires a creative lynchpin in midfield also so there isnt much of a dirfference in that respect.

Stop assuming that the 4-2-3-1 is this incredibly intricate formation with high levels of tactical intricacies involved as opposed to any other formation

&gt; If you are going to sit here and try to convince me that, from a tactical perspective, coaching a bunch of 20 year olds against reserve coaches is even remotely comparable to managing a team of millionaire professionals against the Mourinhos, Wengers, Martinezs, etc

It worked for Guardiola, De boer for example.

And considering on our coaching staff we have Chris ramsey - One of most highly rated coaches in England who thinks very highly of Sherwood - Its clear that Sherwood isnt some isiot ad might actually know what he is doing.

&gt; It is about having a deep understanding of both your players and the opponent, and understanding which of your weaknesses they will exploit and which of theirs you will attack. If I see us line up with a low confidence not scoring striker alone up top and three underperforming midfielders with limited understanding of each other's movements behind him, I'm going to do what any team did and going to tell my defense to hug close to them and play a frustratingly physical game, like every single team did to AVB (to pretty good effect). 

Yeah thats great and all but Im not sure what point you are trying to make with this.. I mean call me crazy but i think that the guy who who has helped develop loads of premier league players and has ran the most fluent and modern development squads in the country and who i highly rated within the club he works might actualy understand how football works!  The arrogance you have to believe that you somehow know more than him is incredible!

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; You're right that it's hardly the most pressing issue of the whole saga, but my main issue is that the filters are supposed to be narrowly targeted at parents, particularly those with younger children. Instead, they are being implemented as the default choice for everybody. And the visual presentation of the choice is part of that.

But it's not ""the default choice"", if the BT screenshot is anything to go by - there is no default choice. You have to decide to have it on or off.

&gt; The option to enable the filter should be made abundantly clear, but not at the expense of the option to disable it. The filters should also be explicitly described as only really being targeted at parents of young children, and not as a substitute for good parenting.

Bad parenting will be a problem if there is a filter or not - since the bad parents are hardly likely to install a filter if they had to make an effort to do it. I'm not sure how you would solve that.

&gt; A lot of people aren't very tech-minded, and will know little-to-nothing about the filters. They'll just click through all the setup defaults, including enabling the filters, 

Is that really a criticism of the filters? That there shouldn't be a filter because people don't want to learn how to do anything?

&gt;  and then find that they are blocked from legitimate and constructive discussion of important issues, without even knowing that they can do something about it. We've already seen sex education and LGBT support websites blocked.

Is this intentional? The filters are pretty new, after all, so how much of it is down to that things need to be bedded in. I don't agree that they won't know what they can do about - presumably the ""blocked"" page will explain why it is blocked and how it can be adjusted, just like how any commercial filtering product that might be used at work, or how it is on the mobile networks. 

&gt; UI design influences the way people use services. Designing the options page so that most people will indeed have such sites blocked just seems absurd to me. Even though that are clearly more important factors to complain about, I can't think that this is anything other than a bad way of implementing the choice.

I'm not an expert in human interaction but I really can't agree. Both options are prominently displayed (one more so than the other, admittedly). I'm not sure what else you could write about turning the filter off other than that it ""allows unrestricted access to online content"".

For all of the scaremongering over these filters, it seems odd that the years-long filter that has been implemented on the mobile networks hasn't been much a problem.

How much punishment would some face for doing this? If the child is to remain with the parent and the parent is now stigmatised because he/she slightly smacked their child in the supermarket and is then escorted away by the police what will this teach the child?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The only reason for EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) is in the proposed spec is for DRM.

Yes, I do believe I have already stated that it is for DRM implementation?

&gt;due to DRM and open source being opposing mutually exclusive ideologies.

The ideology of a minority should not prevent the addition of something which a lot of content providers are pushing for. If the minority don't want it then they can just not implement it and become irrelevant. Firefox in particular have already shown that their 'ideology' is a sham and that they care more about staying relevant by their implementation of H264 playback.

&gt;open source platforms such as linux that would require binary blobs in the OS as DRM wont work with an open source OS (incompatible ideologies). 

Not really. There is a ton of binary-only software (mainly drivers) already for Linux which most distributions bundle as the OSS drivers tend to be shite. If you're one of the hardcore Linux users who is obsessed with freedumb then you can't use any of the Flash-using sites which EME will replace anyway.

&gt;Which ever it is, it would require a different module per OS/Architecture, and just like flash it would have incompatibility issues with different platforms if not more so due to different modules from different content providers.

So instead of having a tiny blob which it would be easier to port to other platforms you would rather have the giant behemoth which is Flash which is extremely hard to port to other platforms? There is nothing major in a license key verification system which would be platform specific unlike Flash which touches pretty much every part of the OS.

&gt;Not forgetting the whole host of security issues that could arise from poorly written DRM modules

As I have previously mentioned, the surface area between the DRM module and the OS is extremely small when compared to Flash. This makes the risk to the user *considerably smaller* than if they were to use Flash. Also, the amount of varying DRM modules would make it less of an attractive vector for attack unlike Flash as smaller amounts of users will have certain DRM modules installed.

Things are not as good as they should be, so I think the complaints are valid.

The NHS while still fairly good is no longer the shining beacon it once was. There is no free dentistry or opticians, the food is shite, wait times are too long and the countries life expectancy isn't as high as it could be.

The trains are waaay too expensive making travel difficult, which either takes up loads of our income or stops you going out, both of which are bad for people and the economy.

Better solution: Your own filtering proxy server which integrates with authentication so peoples filtering is automatically done based on who they are. But this is difficult and expensive.

Compromise solution: Don't rely on technical means to force traffic to the filter. Nail the proxy in a group policy and then apply this to students. Set the proxy to the unfiltered proxy in another policy that applies to staff. Cheap and easy to manage, but not too difficult to work around.

That is a precious thing that we ought not to take for granted. 

I'm constantly bewildered by how laissez faire some redditers are about the lack of democracy and basic services in other countries, foreign leaders who are known to rig their elections and politicise their judiciary and do all sorts of corrupt things are lauded for insincere cynical populism. 

Case in point Venezuela - people talk about their nationalisation of oil production as if it's a socialist paradise - but they don't bother to check what actually happens with the money - which is one of the top 10 most corrupt in the World according to transparency international. There are many accounts of things like school buildings being built to meet goals for 'available school places' but no teachers  being hired or text books being provided - even though the funding has been taken out of the sovereign wealth funds to provide for those things. Even when we have the most economically conservative governments we still have an expectation of basic services being delivered.  


Many seem to magnify beyond all proportion the smallest problem in this country yet give other nations a free pass because they would rather believe in simplistic caricatures that reaffirm their world view than to look beyond the propaganda. 

Every time there is a genuine issue which needs addressing reddit runs around like a headless chicken, turning molehills in to mountains, with the result that instead of doing anything constructive people just pass around scaremongering exaggerations and half truths. 

It's especially galling when a sensationalist story appears in foreign news media and people repeat it here, when they could just leave their houses and talk to people find out the truth for themselves what the truth of people's everyday experiences is.  

How many times have I read on reddit that the UK is a hot spot of violent crime, 'because knives are just as dangerous as guns' (not they're not) and because we all binge drink and fight (okay that's partially true) yet they fail to account for the fact that any violent crime beyond a scuffle here is a news worthy event, locally and often nationally, because they are relatively uncommon. Again it's the making of mountains out of molehills, it's seeing relatively small problems that affect us as being huge and the actual huge problems that affect other countries as being not a big deal because 'socialist paradise' or 'that foreign leader may be corrupt and have gaols full of political prisoners but he says bad things about the US and UK governments so we'll give him a free pass and indulge in cult-worship'

* Gulf stream means our winters are mild for the longitude and summers are pretty decent too  
* NHS means healthcare is free at point of use  
* We've got pretty countryside and nice old buildings  
* We get Sherlock on New Year's Day  
* In fact a lot of British TV is awesome. Downton Abbey, that recent BBC programme on Istanbul, QI, to name but a few  
* Relatively cheap internet deals and internet and TV packages, compared to other English speaking countries  
* Good public transport compared to a lot of places - in the US it's almost not even there, and in places like Italy the trains are covered in grafitti.  
* We don't get imprisoned or executed for being gay or giving out information about homosexuality or gender identity  
* We have a judicial system which is generally pretty fair and not heavily skewed in effectiveness by political alleigances, wealth or race of parties involved.  
* Maternity and paternity leave is pretty damn good, along with a number of other employee rights like sickness and holidays and unfair dismissal laws.  
* Clean air laws limit pollution  
* We have Kinder eggs, creme eggs, jaffa cakes, Thorntons alpini, Terry's chocolate oranges and various other delicious chocolatey things that many countries do not have, or don't have in the same quality we do.

I think that last point is probably the most important. I recently learned that Sweden doesn't have chocolate oranges.",0,1388260927,null,0,false,0,cec1ah3,t3_1tvi3g,t1_cec1ah3,t3_1tvi3g,null,1427954445,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As an expat living in a Middle Eastern Muslim country Sharia law is not compatible with Western values.

Sharia law, which is based on Islamic religion and beliefs, unfortunately does not necessarily equate to want could be deemed good interpretations of the Quran.  Examples would be: woman and children are not treated equally in law, Islam respects others rights to practice their religions, however, the reality is that you can not openly practice or acknowledge your beliefs. There are strict punishments for 'perceived' relations outside of marriage which include rape and incest.  Many nationals and non nationals are jailed and persecuted here for expressing any opposition towards rulers, laws and differing religious ideals especially with the onset of new cyber laws here.

There is a separation of church and state for a reason and the current system in the UK is more than adequate.

I abide by the laws of the country where I live and it should be expected that others do the same. I am subject to the same laws as everyone else here so why should it be different for those who move to either of the countries I call home (UK and Australia)

For those of you who think I am anti Islam, anti Muslim blah blah blah I am definitely not and there are some great parallels between Islam, Christianity and Judaism. At their core it's all about doing the right thing and being a good person but it unfortunately doesn't actually turn out that way.

Nearly every study into the question has demonstrated corporal punishment to be completely ineffective and counter productive. There is a link below with a meta-study dealing with the various negative side effects of the practice. Including an increased incident in children growing up to be violent or antisocial. The only good thing about it is enforcing immediate compliance at the expense of long term degenerative behaviour.

The only reason anyone thinks corporal punishment is a good idea is because we've always done it. OTOH I'm not sure banning it is practical. Certainly government should warn that it does more harm than good.

This goes far beyond Tennant vs. Smith or Davies vs. Moffat, though.  It speaks volumes to the evolution of the Doctor's character under Matt Smith.  The 11th has lived for centuries, and gone from being the secretly self-loathing Doctor in ""Amy's Choice"" to the Doctor fighting tooth and nail against any sort of change in ""The Angels Take Manhattan"" to a personality of acceptance.  He has plenty of opportunities to run away in fear, plenty of opportunities to save himself out of spite, but he simply chooses to let go.  He lets himself age, devoting himself to protecting the people of Christmas the way he's protected Earth for centuries.  And when death finally comes for him, he doesn't face it with fear or sadness, but again with the attitude of acceptance.  He waits, letting his enemies destroy themselves or simply fade away.  And when it comes down to the final choice, whether to release Gallifrey and plunge the universe into a new Time War in order to save himself, or run and let Trenzelor be destroyed in order to save himself, he elects to give up his life in order to protect those in his charge--not with the overwhelming sense of grief with which Tennant did, but smiling, even while believing that his life was finally ending for good.  He had found his purpose, something that made him feel like he didn't need to run anymore.  He remembered Amelia, again, not out of grief--he remembered the friendship they had shared, how much her love had shaped him.  He remembered her carefree innocence in childhood, and the strong, confident woman she had grown to be.  It was his memory of her that finally allowed him to let go, knowing that he had done his duty.

She did sat down. But again she up and climbing onto the table again. This time the mother, got up and quickly lifted my niece from the table and placed her on the floor.

You cannot use them as an example of how morality has changed over the years when they were, on the whole, NEVER morally acceptable. So comparing 'slightly smacking' to these only serves to malign it unfairly.

 We are discussing something that has always been seen as the parents right. Most parents love their children. They do not want to hit their children. They will do all they can not to hit their children, and most times, even when they are at their limits, it is only ever a threat to hit, not an actual hit.

Most people have been hit by their parents at some point or another. It is something that happens. It defines the rules. It shows when something is unacceptable. 

If you claim it does not work, if you claim it is so wrong and does so much damage as to warrant it being labeled ""abhorrent"", prove it. Why is it so horrible? What damage does it do? What is so wrong with it? Why is it that most people who have been smacked by their parents at one time or another don't think it was such a big deal? Surely something ""abhorrent"" would be remembered as being a bad thing and something they wouldn't do to their own kids, and yet most of them would probably think the idea of illegalising 'slight smacking' is going way too far.

Firstly you need to understand that children especially younger ones do not react to a well thought out argument. Although if you repeat something enough times eventually it might sink in. A child once ran out into road and was nearly hit by a bus. The father pulled him back and smacked him. What other way is there of ensuring the seriousness of the action which they took? 

Children think much more primitively than you or I. Therefore naturally they try to avoiding pain. They will think, ""Daddy (or mummy) is smacking me because I ran in-front of a bus"". That thought must be re-enforced with the parent reminding them that they are loved but the reason they are being smacked is because they did something unacceptable. The phase ""Cruel to be kind"" is so true.

As I explained somewhere else is that Under 10's are exempt from Criminal Responsibility, this is because its been determined that they don't have sufficient cognitive skill to understand the difference between right and wrong.

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"Well I'd like to think I'm not one of those people but I guess I'm not really in a position to comment on that. I've worked in retail and seen how people often patronise people just because they're in a wheelchair and do my best to avoid doing so and generalising, and also try not to stare if someone could be viewed as 'different'. 

Somewhat yes. Do I see people staring at straight couples? No. I don't really see why I should attract attention when all I'm doing is shopping. Why should I have to start altering my behaviour just to avoid being stared at? 

It's those little things that I mention that really become annoying, such as if I go into a restaurant with my partner, will people assume we're a couple? Will they not notice? Will they treat us differently if we are? Am I standing too close and it's clear we're a couple? Am I standing too far away and it's obvious I'm trying to avoid it looking like we are?

Obviously it sounds very petty, but when you're second guessing your every action to reduce the effect it has of people staring/glancing/tutting/commenting it becomes incredibly invasive and you can't relax.

It's why I enjoy being in Brighton so much, I can go out for a meal with whoever I want and know that no-one is going to bat an eye lid. 

I think the problem is you're assuming I'm going around calling everyone a ""vile homophobe"". I realise they're not, which is why I'm not saying they are. I'm merely commenting that it would be *nice* if I didn't have to consider all the above, and that while I appreciate the legal advancements I still feel it would be *nice* if culturally being gay  wasn't seen as being something that is noticed. 

I accept that the majority of the population are straight. I accept that I am a 'minority' in a fairly small way.

Furthermore boards of directors are also legally required to get the best possible returns for their shareholders, and so there will always be immense pressure on any private business to skimp as much as possible on the unprofitable parts (assuming it can't just do away with them altogether).

The selling of the family silver is purely ideological, and in a range of areas has produced an inferior, more expensive service and increasingly means the subsidising of shareholder dividends though taxes. The slippery slope began with cleaners in the NHS, there is nothing intrinsically cheaper about a private provider taking a chunk of the tender in profit than a hospital simply employing a cleaner direct. What happened was the cleaning staff would remain the same, only the companies undercutting the price would change as each contract came up to tender. So what happens? Corner cutting, inferior cleaning products and utensils, and lay offs. So from two cleaners to a ward, you end up with one cleaner to 4 wards. This is occurring across a range of areas in differing ways, the MOD is a prime example, further outsourcing creates increasing procurement costs, and worse more beurocracy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;But it's not ""the default choice"", if the BT screenshot is anything to go by - there is no default choice. You have to decide to have it on or off.

The BT screenshot clearly shows that the filter is the dominant option.  They are deliberately presenting it in such a way that people are more likely to select 'turn the filter on' rather than 'turn the filter off'.

&gt;Is that really a criticism of the filters?

No, it's not.  I'm talking about the visual presentation of the options.  They are deliberately set up in such a way that people who don't really understand what's going on are more likely to click the giant glowing green option that takes up twice the space.  To a certain extent, it feels like these people are being tricked into restricting their internet access.

&gt;Is this intentional?

It doesn't matter.  No filter is perfect, so we know for a fact that that this will continue to happen to a greater or lesser degree.  The UI presentation will influence people to turn the filters on, which means that people are going to have such content blocked when they otherwise wouldn't want it to be.

I don't think that the default assumption should be that everybody should be recommended or influenced to turn the filters on.  Most people don't need to be 'protected' from naked bodies and discussions about guns.  The assumption should be that the filters are only really appropriate if you have kids in the house.

&gt;I'm not sure what else you could write about turning the filter off other than that it ""allows unrestricted access to online content"".

Something simple like 'unless you want to add an extra layer of safety to protect your children from seeing content you deem inappropriate, this option is probably the most appropriate for you - you can enable and disable the filters at any stage if you want'.

At the end of the day it would be a very minor redesign but I feel that it would present the options in a far less biased manner.",0,1388269890,null,0,false,0,cec4j0i,t3_1ttaok,t1_cec4j0i,t1_cec07bq,null,1427952934,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As a taxpayer and a healthcare consumer, I'm only concerned with what the NHS is charged for that service.

Maybe the company does other things and offers other services to the private market and maybe they overcharge there, if they overcharge anywhere.

So long as I get my scan, it's the same quality as an NHS facility and costs less money, I'm still not seeing any real problem.

In reality the situation above is exactly how it would work anyway. Bulk equipment like MRI scanners are sunk costs - you are talking millions to buy and install a scanner.

 There probably isn't enough private demand to recoup those costs in a quick enough timescale for the shareholders and if they can open it up to the NHS - for a reduced fee - and cut down on dead time where the scanner is sitting idle, that's a pretty good deal for the company (who recoup their costs) and for the NHS (who adds cheap capacity).",0,1388269992,null,0,false,0,cec4kd5,t3_1tvoc2,t1_cec4kd5,t1_cec4cry,null,1427952917,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

If it is done for the wrong reasons or is too harshly then of course that is bad, but you can say that about almost everything.

I am reading a book at present that is talking about the damage to society that has been caused by the idea that there is no difference between genders and that boys and girls should be treated exactly the same. For a while there were lots of studies telling us that treating boys as boys and girls as girls was a bad thing. Now the studies are telling us that it is damaging to the children to not allow them to be boys and girls, which is what most people with common sense knew all along. I honestly think this is another one of those type of subjects. It makes common sense to me that if your child is doing something dangerous or harmful then they may need to be physically shown that it is bad, I see his as part of my duty as a father. I haven't actually ever smacked my boy but I would reserve the right to do it if I felt the situation needed it.

&gt;The political system is rotten 

It isn't great, but looking around the world we really aren't that bad. Look at American politics. Or Italy/Spain/Greece where corruption and bribes are blatant and accepted in a way that simply wouldn't happen in modern day Britain. France is a mess politically too. Not too sure about Germany, but obviously a lot of people aren't happy with the party in power there either.

&gt;and more and more of our precious 'family silver' is being sold off. Education and NHS both rapidly ongoing through the back door over the last few years.

I see it as change. And the NHS has changed constantly since it was first introduced. It is now larger and more comprehensive than ever before. If that involves bringing in companies or changing things, that's fine. Quality of care is still ranked excellently worldwide and the NHS is the most efficient healthcare system in the world.

&gt;House prices are a fucking joke. 

They're bad, but affordability isn't too bad. Super low interest right now, and 90% mortgages are back.

And inevitably once people own houses they want the value preserved or increased. So for every person complaining there are probably some people happy about it.

&gt;Local councils are totally batshit crazy and have far too much in the way of power over individuals WHO THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING FOR! 

Quite possible. But this varies a lot depending on who your council is. As for too much power - I suspect you wouldn't say that if the council was doing a good job. I'd rather have local people with the power rather than someone in London deciding they know what to do in my Northern town.

&gt;The roads in many areas are never going to be repaired as new - ever. 

Safest roads in the EU though. 

&gt;Putting people through the legal system costing 10's of thousands of pounds for a handful of plant material that just grows out of the ground is beyond insane. 

Eventually it will be legalised. It does seem silly but it really isn't a major issue for the country. And you can avoid that prosecution very simply by not growing or smoking plants. I mean it's not like they trick you by hiding the rules or punishment. 

Looking at how we treat alcohol and addiction/moderation in general, you can see why no government is keen to expand our access to drugs though.

Like you said, all minor problems. Everyone country has problems but we are still pretty awesome!

In a B2B role he would have been behind both Dembele and Paulinho and probably Holtby. He isn't capable of playing a CAM or wing role, so by all reasoning we had no reason to keep him because we had no place to put him and a 3rd string CM/DM isn't a priority for most teams.

For the long haul i still think it was the right thing to move him, we have players who are more talented who would always be ahead of him and the guy is good enough to be playing somewhere in the league.

He is having a great season, that doesn't change the fact that we made the right decision at the time for the team and in truth, the player.  He wouldn't be getting as much playing time and wouldn't be playing in the same role as he is at Hull to put him in the position to succeed.

* Round the clock use of an MRI scanner requires someone to operate it - a radiographer trainer and experienced in the protocols, and expecting a bonus to their pay for working unsocial hours.  Possibly other staff as well for certain patients (frail, obese, disabled etc.)

* It also requires a radiologist to read the request and determine exactly what modality and protocol etc. are best suited to answer the clinical question then read the scan and send the report back to the requesting doctor.  The radiologist would also expect an enhanced rate for their work (if you get them to just do it in the day on top of their scheduled NHS work, then you'll introduce delays into it, negating the point of getting the scan done outside normal hours.

* Then if the machine is being used more frequently it will require more maintenance - do you schedule this to co-incide with the time it used for NHS patients or the privately funded patients?  If you do it at weekends - cost goes up and who pays for the increased maintenance? The NHS who use it 5 days a week, or the private company using it evenings and weekends? 


* What if it breaks completely (perhaps more likely if its used more with less downtime or poorly arranged maintenance practices)?  Who gets priority for using a scanner in a neighbouring hospital that doesn't have any arrangement with a private organisation to use their stuff?

A lot of these questions come up whenever there is any mixture of private and NHS patients using the same resources i.e. a consultant has a list of private surgeries but does them in an NHS hospital, they receive care from other doctors, nurses, caterers, cleaners etc out of the NHS budget and take up a bed the NHS provides.

 There is a lot of hidden cost in determining who pays for what, who pays for deciding who pays for what (think about lawyers who bill you for time making up your bill).    And ultimately if a company is able to provide a similar service for less money, in such a way they make a profit on it, why not simply have the NHS adopt the same practice and save themselves money?  Often this won't work because there is hidden overhead that the NHS pays for (think of IT systems for requesting/reporting, building maintenance &amp; utilities, staff training and education) that the private organisation doesn't need to worry about, but ultimately this means it is milking profit from the NHS and the public purse, which some people are against in principle.

Ok. So you can't afford something but aren't willing to take the sacrifices you accept are necessary to get it? Are we supposed to have sympathy?

&gt;The problem with the UK is there is so much, but it's just so expensive and jobs are so scarce that getting your hands on it is way harder than it has been in the past.

This is temporary right now and primarily applies to people without much skills or experience.

&gt;The NHS while still fairly good is no longer the shining beacon it once was. There is no free dentistry or opticians

Sure there are. Children, elderly and those on benefits get them for free.

 &gt;the food is shite, wait times are too long and the countries life expectancy isn't as high as it could be.

Food is always shite. Waiting times are down (but are generally a shit metric to consider anyway) and life expectancy... we don't exactly help ourselves with our drinking, smoking and eating habits. I'm not sure we can blame the NHS for that one!

&gt;Education is not free, this is not good enough. There are not enough jobs and they don't pay enough.

Education isn't free? News to me! All your compulsory education is free. And your optional education at A-level is also free. Even adults can go back to college and get all sorts of qualifications or retraining for free. I assume you are referencing university, which is entirely optional higher education that you pay for years after graduation once you have a good job. I don't think you can say much fairer than that.

&gt;Petrol is way too expensive. It wouldn't be such a problem if public transport was cheaper. You cannot have both being costly it just cuts up too much of our wages.

People have gone without clothes and occasionally been just fine, such as in nudist communities. But there are occasions on which it would result in being very cold, being sunburnt or just being very socially uncomfortable.

There's something in survivalism called the 333 law. 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food, 3 months without shelter. I'm no survivalist expert, but if those who are put it on the same list as food and water, I'm pretty sure it's important. If that doesn't convince you, think of a time when humans didn't have houses. Cavemen, neanderthals, that sort of thing. Again, I'm no expert, but I think you'll agree that to go from living in a cave or a mammoth-hide tent to living in a house is a step up.

Electricity. We KNOW we wouldn't be better off without it because we've been without it throughout most of human history. With electricity we have advanced medical equipment, computers, reliable lighting, mobile phones, etc... I could go on forever.

Now, in the case of child beating we have many examples. People who grew up occasionally being hurt by their parents, and those who didn't. Guess what scientists have found...

That's right. Having a parent or guardian occasionally hurt the person they are taking care of is actually bad for the child's development. So we do know that as a society, we're better off without it.

I was talking at more of a personal level. A single person will never know how they turned out if they were never spanked and will consider the fact that they turned out fine justification to hit their own kids. I'd say the same for clothes, houses and electricity. As a society we're better off with these things, but since we've had them our whole lives, we can't know that as an individual we wouldn't be better off without them.

they've replaced the series with similar webisodes called ""behind the scenes"" which are ~10 mins long

which is a shame because 10 mins isnt enough for fans. i would have liked to see more emotional moments on set. in the video i linked in my previous post, im sure theres more to the scene where matt was crying, but they cut it off short.

true,DrellVanguard,null,null,"I remember an otherwise very boring 4 hour lecture we (a group of medical students on an orthopaedic rotation) were forced to attend, where 2 American hip surgeons came over to share their experiences/learn from their UK counterparts.   They'd been operating with the UK consultants as well and looked with envy at the database that UK orthopods keep of all their joint replacements and outcomes nationwide.

It eventually dovetailed into a general Q&amp;A about orthopaedics in the US, and the shocker was when they revealed that there are still 'general orthopaedic surgeons' in the US, working at these smaller rural hospitals, who will be the only orthopaedic surgeon in a 100 mile radius and as such do all the operations - hips, knees, ankles, feet, back, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands; joint replacements, trauma, nerve releases...  most of which will be operations that in larger centres and nearly all UK hospitals fall under the remit of a surgeon who subspecialises in that field.

UK hip surgeons typically do between 3 and 6 hip replacements a week, maybe approaching 150-200 a year.  This is how they become experts at it, and is the standard expected for the most part of a consultant who advertises themselves as a hip surgeon.  Same for knees etc, although often hip &amp; knees go together.  In contrast, there are thousands of US orthopaedic surgeons who might only do 10 hip replacements a year.  The consultants in the room were very vocal about how they would view that as dangerous, and that actually some of their 4/5th year trainees were probably better qualified to do that operation as they do it so much when they work with the hip specialists. 

 
Extrapolate this to the whole population and all medical/surgical areas, and actually you find a large proportion of the USA has access to significantly lower standards of care compared to the population in the UK.  Obviously they have the choice of travelling to a specialist centre to get the expert surgeon, but a lot of people are ignorant of this and just assume that because their doc is a fully qualified surgeon, the level of care they can provide is identical to all other surgeons so it doesn't matter.

When people compare the NHS to the US, they often pick the cream of the crop in the US  and stack it up against the typical DGH here, which isn't really an accurate comparision.",0,1388274920,null,0,false,0,cec6cui,t3_1tvoc2,t1_cec6cui,t1_cec3odj,null,1427952013,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Second time I kept pushing a BBQ (not sure why). Again, I was warned MANY times, kept doing it, and I got smacked across the arse. But again, it was bloody dangerous and stupid to play with a lit BBQ.

Third time I was a teenager and I called mum a bitch and she hit me across the head. I still remember it vividly and I feel terrible about it to this day.

And currently I have a very close relationship with my parents and don't consider them abusive at all. I think every single incidence was necessary and drove home valuable lessons and discipline.

And from talking to my friends, most who are foreign or have foreign parents, they had the crap beaten out of them on a regular basis and all have good relationships with parents. We are talking discipline, not abuse. My Pakistani friend had his mum beat him with a sandal when he didn't get good school reports.

He has been great for Hull, no question about that....but would he really have been getting as much time for us as he is for Hull?  Would AVB (who tried to sell him the summer before, and the January before) have given THudd time over Paulinho/Dembele/Holtby/Sandro/Capoue? Rightly or wrongly i don't see THudd getting nearly as much time with us as he has gotten at Hull.

THudd is benefiting from playing constantly.  He is getting increasingly more comfortable with his teammates and the system because he is playing every game.  with us he would have been in a rotation, and likely the tail end of the rotation.  With Hull he is being asked to set the tempo, with us he would have been asked to fill in at DM and put the ball to Dembele/Paulinho/Wingers.  

Thudd with Hull is in a perfect situation for him to succeed, we wouldn't have put him in the same situation.

true,ImThe10Doct0r,tennant,Tennant,"I never once said he shouldn't take into account what he did 2 years ago now. I agree that he should come out and admit that he made a mistake 2 years ago. And what you are saying about Tom Baker and Peter Davison makes absolutely no sense and as no correlation to what Moffet did. Matt Smith said he was the 11th Doctor, but he never actually said he was the 11th version of The Doctor, since he doesn't consider John Hurt The Doctor at all. And I'm sorry, but if i blew up my own race, even if it was a good reason, I wouldn't go by my own name either for awhile. And he doesn't consider TenToo part of his line even though he did use up regeneration in order for him to happen. So Matt Smith's Doctor considers himself as the 11th Doctor even though he knows that he's used up all of his regenerations. So Matt is still the 11th Doctor since John Hurt didn't consider himself The Doctor and TenToo isn't part of his part of his personal timeline. TenToo is a split in his timeline, where we see a glimpse of an alternate reality of The Doctor. So, just to repeat my point, Matt is still the 11th Doctor even though he had used up all of his regeneration because of the reasons I have stated, And why are you complaining. Steven came up with a way to keep the show going for a good number of years. 

Also, it's not Steven's fault that Russel T. Davis did the Meta-Crisis thingy in Journey's End. When I first saw that episode, I thought to myself ""The Doctor definitely just used a regeneration right there. I bet that'll come back and bite him in the in a few years or so"" and I was right. So, at least in my mind, the inclusion of the Meta-Crisis as an actual regeneration was justified. And I also think that the creation of The Warrior was needed as well. But neither one of those count as The Doctor. So in conclusion, for the 3rd or 4th and final time, Matt Smith is the 11th Doctor, but the 13 incarnation of the time lord's body. And now we have 11 more (Smith-Capaldi counts as 1) because of Steven Moffet. And just in case you are still confused, here's a list:

1st - 0 regen

2nd - 1 regen

3rd -2 regen

4th - 3 regen

5th - 4 regen

6th - 5 regen

7th - 6 regen

8th - 7 regen

War (isn't considered The Doctor) - 8 regen

9th - 9 regen

10th - 10 regen

TenToo (not considered The Doctor) - 11 regen

11th - 12/final regen


I'm just making sure that you got what I was trying to say. Stevn is not one to take rules like this lightly, so he came up with a lovely way to get around it. A way that has been used in the show before with The Master. Yes, if you try to think about it too hard, your brain starts to hurt and it becomes confusing and you just end up thinking like you did, that it's bullshit and steven doesn't know how to right a good story or plotline (which i disagree with, but everyone has there own opinion). That's why i created this list to help myself to see why Matt is the 11th Doctor but is on his last regeneration.

true,ToughAsGrapes,null,null,"&gt;I was smacked as a child and it never did me any harm.

You can't say that it never did you any harm because you don't have a version of you that has never been smacked to compare it against. Its also incorrect to say that smacking a child doesn't cause harm and there is considerable scientific evidence to say otherwise.

&gt;One summary of the literature found that use of corporal 
punishment by parents was associated with more mental-health problems in all twelve studies examined. In particular, the more frequently or severely 
children are spanked or hit, the more likely they are to have symptoms of 
depression or anxiety, both at the time they are corporally punished and in the future.


Also when ever I hear people talk about smacking children they always try to differentiate it from more serious cased of child abuse, they say that they only give them a light slap so its not *real* absue. The problem with this is it ignore the uncomfortable evidence that the two are more connected than most people think.


&gt;Interviews with physically abusive parents about the abusive events for 
which they were referred to child-protective services expose a startling and 
compelling theme: Nearly two-thirds of the abusive incidents began as acts of 
corporal punishment meant to correct a child’s misbehavior. The authors of a 
review of 830 substantiated cases of abuse observed that “no factor was so 
universal, so ubiquitous, as some identifiable behavior on the part of the child 
which precipitated the parent-child interactional sequence culminating in 
abuse.” A review of physical-abuse cases in the 2003 Canadian Incidence 
Study of Child Maltreatment revealed that seventy-five percent of these 
substantiated cases were intended by the parents to be corporal punishment.

...

&gt;What these findings make clear is that most physical abuse is not inflicted by 
a sadistic parent whose behaviors are not contingent on the child’s behaviors; 
rather, most physically abusive events begin as corporal punishment intended to 
discipline a child but that escalate to the point of injury.

I appreciate we have a huge population and a small amount of land but there are ways to bring down prices.

The jobs thing is not limited to lack of skills or experience. Hopefully it is temporary but the thread is not about future prospects it's about current ones. Currently finding a job is a nightmare, if you have experience you will find work but it's likely to be well below the standard you expect and paid poorly. If you don't, well...

University is free in Wales, Scotland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands and plenty of other places, why the hell do we have to pay? It used to be free, it's even going up in price!
If it's too expensive then it's a symptom of making degrees a requirement for a job, fix that instead of financially ruining an entire generation.

The biggest problem with the education is that you are expected to get a good job from having a degree, which is bollocks because there are very few good jobs. The unemployment rate is the worst it's been since the Great Depression. Even if you do get a job there is no guarantee it will pay well.

&gt;In this case, its the government, they are forcing the ISPs to impose restrictions. David Cameron was an avid supporter of this system.

Impose restrictions? They aren't restricting anything. They're just giving the contract holder a choice or whether they want filtering or not.

&gt;This is in fact one of my personal largest gripes with the system, they are imposing a system on all of us that was not needed. Cheaper, easier to implement and more efficient systems already exist (parental control systems installed on local system).

I agree it wasn't exactly a pressing issue that needed dealing with. However, most parents wouldn't know how to use router firmware. And 3rd party software solutions can't cover every device that their children have access to.

&gt;Why would they want to impose a system on us if it already exists? This just stinks of censorship, especially considering the blocked list is controlled by them and not the user/ ISP (which as you might have seen has blocked some useful websites like sexual health sites).

The filter list is controlled at least partly by parents. For instance, you could block porn but still allow chat forums etc. But that's really down to ISP implementation as I think each system differs.

But really, if whoever pays for the internet wants to restrict access to things on their network, they are more than within their rights to do so.


&gt;This point is more about having an awkward conversation with your landlord than anything else. The way that the filters have been presented to us is a porn black (which it is right now) but if for instance your favourite website say the national library was blocked and you want it unblocked you have to have a conversation with them about removing the filter. And of course they will think you just want porn, while not a big problem I admit, its not the best situation ([also the British Library was blocked](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/12/25/the-best-story-yet-about-the-uks-online-porn-filters/) ). If they wanted to block stuff they could, but now its turned on by default. 

I think you're stretching a bit here. 

&gt;And again, if they have had access to block this stuff for years, why has the government decided to start imposing blocks?

Government aren't imposing a block. At the worst they're forcing the contract holder to make a decision.

&gt;This is more of a personal issue true, but I shouldn't need to talk to a housemate to sort this out. It should be opt in. See landlord issue above.

Even if the other box was ticked by default, whoever controls the contract would still have the same yes or no choice to make!

&gt;Yes it is. That is quite clearly opt out. You said it yourself, it is already checked.

That doesn't make it opt out. Proper 'opt out' filtering would be this: All connection become filtered automatically unless you specifically call up or fill in something online to turn it off.

At the worst this is opt in, with the default already set to ""yes I want it"". But you're still presented with the clear choice. From the BT screenshot going around, it couldn't be more simple.


&gt;How many people will say yes to the recommended settings? Or just click through each page dumbly because they trust that the ISP has made the right decisions in advance for them?

Well they might, but its their internet connection so they can do whatever they want with it. It sounds like you are worried about people making the ""wrong"" decisions for themselves. If they don't read properly that's not the governments fault. And of course if they do try to access a site and find it blocked, they can go back and change it.

This just seems like such a mountain out of a molehill. The biggest issue IMO is that it's pandering to lazy parents who might get a false sense of security. I don't see it as censorship at all. And it's far less worrying than court orders to block tpb, or removing google search results. Or prism and any of that other mass surveillance shite that's been going on. Providing technologically incompetent parents an easy filtering solution just doesn't really seem a problem to me.

Whilst they are great in their own respects, without a true playmaker type, we didn't click. We played brutish, physical football and hence had a hard time recycling possession and unleashing out attacking 3.

With the sale of Paulinho, we'd be forced to play our more technical players, Eriksen (who was playing anyway), Holtby and Siggy. They're quality, whatever that Andreww arseface says. I would hope with some game time, they'd click a little better, and we'd see a more fast paced, technical Tottenham.

Support for individual policies doesn't necessarily translate into votes for the people proposing them.

I'd like to forget Florida is part of the US.  You should sub to /r/FloridaMan.  Now I can't say I've been everywhere in Fla., but I've been up and down the Atlantic Coast, to Miami and to Orlando.  It really is just everything wrong with this country stuffed into one place.  Traffic, crime, ignorance, etc. etc.  I am biased, but I really hate it.  I love New England, and I always consider Florida the opposite of New England.  

Florida did give me some insight to European thinking though; I was ranting how everything was so new, there was no history, too many ugly roads full of ugly signs and chain restaurants, and then I realized, everything here must seem like that to people who live near castles and Roman ruins.  So I guess Florida has been useful to me in that regard.

But no one ever said the NYC 'Burbs don't sleep.  To the great annoyance of my British flatmates, I'd always say that there is more going on in NYC on a 2AM Sunday night (well Mon. morn really), then there is going on in London at 11PM (23h) on a Sat.  While maybe that isn't literally true, but NYC has shit going on non-stop. 

Yes, I traveled a bit around the UK.  Wales (Cardiff and the countryside), Brighton, Bournemouth, Salisbury, Bath, and a bunch of other places that I can not remember.  

Coming from NYC, I was SHOCKED that pubs closed at 11pm (this was '98), for a few days I was so depressed that I wanted to go home.  Then we realized that the pub across the street was able to stay open until 3AM, because they purportedly served food.  All was saved by that.  I lived in Shoreditch ""before it was cool"" and there were so many awesome little clubs and pubs, but it was still kind of a shithole (in a good way).  Reminded me very much of what was going on in Alphabet City, NYC at the same time.

The only other major shock I had in the UK was when we stopped in some tiny town in Wales, and I bought a hot dog or hamburger at a snack stand.  The lady charged me 5p for a mustard packet!!!  I thought it must be some kind of scam to rip off tourists, but nope, she really did charge for that!!  I was only there 2 days by that point, so maybe I hadn't acclimated....

But yes, you are right, one of the oldest most  tactically astute Italian managers couched in the catenacchio tradition of 70s Serie A football managed to play a suppressive and smothering 4-4-2.

Of course Sherwood is infinitely better at his job than me, I'm not a Premier League manager (Neither was he two weeks ago to be fair). I am, however, allowed to disagree with his tactics and say so in the forums. Your argument from authority doesn't negate that our midfield was entirely anonymous (Holtby doubly so) and we were only an incredibly fine Lloris save from losing to one of the most currently out of form teams in the league at home.

Once again, if you are trying to compare the tactical prowess of Cruyff's European cup winning Barcelona to the 95 Blackburn team, you are mad, and probably suffer from fairly typical sort of myopic Anglocentrism many English football fans suffer from. It's not even a contest. One team was a managed by a man who literally helped invent a tactical philosophy. The other was the poster team of the flat 4, 2 up top run and gun 90s English game that happened to have two of the leagues most in form strikers at the same time. 

I'm not going to respond to your insults because, regardless of whether or not you want to take it personally that I disagree with you, we are both on the same side and want our club to succeed. I just don't think Sherwood is the way forward and I think after using the 4-2-3-1 for the better part of eighteen months, we should try something we have the players and coaching for.

Moffat has said that this will be a more difficult Doctor.  He's said that Peter Capaldi starts out being Matt Smith's performance in Peter Capaldi's body and then takes things in a very different direction.

I think we may have seen that already.  It's possible that the ""frenetic"" part may have been the complaint about the kidneys.

I also have to disagree with you about the slower pace making for solid drama.  That's not what it did.  The slower pace made for frequent padding.  Have you seen The War Games?  You can cut six episodes of that monster and it's still six episodes long, makes sense and keeps all the mythology.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm going to take a slightly different route:

Flannagan, Sturridge, Gerrard.

Flanno because while Cissokho was ok against City, I still don't trust him at all or feel remotely comfortable with him at LB.  The way he gets forward and recovers is great, he has good intuition and understanding of his position.  You know he's going to run himself ragged and give his all.  I'd rather have Enrique back first of course, but Flanno is proving to be really good cover.

Sturridge isn't first because we look so freaking good in our current shape/formation and Sterling is in great form.  Bringing Sturridge back in means changing shape or pushing Suarez to a wider starting role.  While I think the latter is not too much of an issue in the scheme of things, I'd prefer we get a couple of games in like that against lesser opposition to figure it our first.  If we go back to 2 strikers then we have to change our midfield again and I don't think any 2 man pairing of our current midfielders can really win the center of the park.  As a 3 man unit they're great together, but as 2 it just won't quite work or give us the kind of control we're looking for.  I'm really excited for his return to the first team, but I'm curious about how he'll be accomodated.  He isn't going to be happy at all with being deployed wide and we'll have midfield issues if we play in a 4-4-2.  Perhaps more of a 4-2-2 akin to what City does will work very well for us as we have very good attacking fullbacks and our current wider attackers like to come inside anyway.  I still think our personnel just isn't right for running just 2 central midfielders though.  The issue isn't with Sturridge since he's an outstanding player and I love him, it's more what his inclusion likely means for our shape.

Gerrard third because our midfield is just beast right now.  Lucas, Allen, and Henderson are playing great football together and really imposing themselves on the game.  Bringing Gerrard back means we lose a fair bit of our wonderful pressing game and get a bit weaker defending quick counter attacks and transitions.",0,1388283355,null,0,false,0,cec9173,t3_1twno4,t1_cec9173,t3_1twno4,null,1427950765,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

His stories were just... really bad fanfiction, almost. He made everything so 'emotional' that by a few seasons, I just couldn't feel compared to care. He beat Rose to death, kept using the Daleks as the baddie for nearly every finale, and his best stories were either written by Moffat or derivatives of previous Doctor Who stories (Rose/Spearhead from Space, Dalek/Jubilee, Human Nature/Human Nature).

Whereas with Moffat, it feels like he's bringing back the old show. Less overly angst-driven stories, more 'adventure'! Less Cockney Soap Opera, more Doctor Who.

They were simply working with what limited resources and budgets they had.

We also have to remember though that Moffat didn't write every S7 episode, and that there was plenty of weakness written in by other people. We can blame him, however, for the direction he pushes S7 in, which was high-octane action blockbusters all season long (which I personally believe hurt the show).

Sometimes he tries to have big epic episodes too often and they get tiring (The Doctor died ""for real"" 6 times in Series 6), his changes to the Weeping Angels were really stupid and Clara is a bland companion.

But I like his writing a lot of the time. I think his scarier episodes like *Blink* and *Silence in the Library* are brilliantly done. I thought the River Song story arc was really interesting. I loved The Silence and how he used their memory-wiping abilities to make for some awesome/terrifying scenes. I love the 11th Doctor because while he looks and acts childish with all his enthusiastic yelling of silly catchphrases and running about, underneath with his great big speeches and the help of Matt Smith's incredible acting you can still see a very, very old, wise man behind that 27 year old face.

true,RedScouse,lfc12,,"I think we could do with another attacker who's star quality coming off the bench and we could also do with another DM and defender. I personally think our first eleven is good enough to be challenging for a top four but we need depth. 

A lot of people have made comments regarding Lucas. Lucas is a great player and DM. I think people just need to realize hes not a destroyer. He is a hybrid who's decent at defensive work and moving the ball on. We could do with a out and out destroyer like we used to have with Masch. This is not to replace Lucas, but just to give versatility to our game as I think both could be very important players going forward. 

Similarly, I'd like someone like Yarmolenko coming in who's a big, quick winger who has excellent dribbling skills and can pose a threat. This would also add versatility because our attackers seem to be slightly on the small side. We were linked with him in the summer. 

We could honestly do with another full back for depth. Although, I think Martin Kelly coming back may just be like a new signing, especially with Flanno coming into his own as well. Our injuries have exacerbated some of the issues people see in the fullback position lately. 

For center back, I honestly think Skrtel either needs to pick his game up a little or Agger needs to play.

Had the BBC gotten their way, The Master was to be the Doctor's brother, and they were going to be off looking for their father. (For an awful taste of this, McGann's audition tape has a snippet of a draft of this script) They also wanted a multi-Doctor story starring Tom Baker, but Fox were the ones that insisted on an Eighth Doctor. The BBC wanted Eight to look like how Nine eventually ended up, Fox wanted a more traditional look. This is how Eight originally looked: http://i.imgur.com/X2qZU9z.jpg

You're right about the throwback to pace in the old series. I don't call for a reform that crazy because of audiences and TV today. But damn... there is something to be said about brief continuity and not just a snappy overarching theme for a series. If a slower pace is not suitable, then at least better, compact storytelling.

It's true we don't need six episodes for a story, but a really good two-parter in any series can stand out beautifully. The key thing is that it holds the viewer's attention after airing. Series 5 had three two-parters (including the finale), Series 6 had two (including its finale), and Series 7 had none. Unless Moff figures out a way to tell a solid story within one episode, we're going to be seeing 12 all over the place in Series 8.

Those last two sections I take particular issue with. Clark Kent is not a critique of the human race, it's a warped parody of it at best. Kal/Clark knows perfectly how well strong and brave humanity can be in spite of not having superpowers. He always says that he's not the real hero, ordinary people are. What the Clark Kent identity is is Kal/Clark creating a mask for himself that is meant to appear even more ineffectual than the average person in order to make him seem the least likely person to ever be Superman.

Just this week I wan back in my hometown for Christmas and had time to reflect jsut how shit my hometown of Mansfield is.

Personally, in the last 10 years I can recount the following examples of myself/family/friends being direct victims of crime:

* My dad's house was burgled
* My dad's house was burgled, again
* My grandparents house was burgled
* My mums house suffered an attempted burglary
* Best friends house... burgled.
* My car was broken into
* My motorbike was stolen
* My sister was violently attacked by 2 girls, at random, dragged to the floor, knocked on conscious and then whilst unconscious kicked in the head with enough force to fracture her skull
* My friend had his jaw broken, on christmas eve, ostensibly for ""being black""
* I was assaulted ""for being there"" in an unrelated incident

I moved abroad 5 years ago and lived in Germany and then now in the Middle East.

In 5 years, aside from 1 incident of pickpocketing, I have not been the victim of crime.

Take a look at the following news stories from the town, in the past 2 weeks, in which innocent members of the public were subjected to horrifically brutal violent attacks.

* http://mansfielduncovered.com/brutal-assault-near-old-bus-station/
* http://mansfielduncovered.com/appeal-after-man-attacked-in-mansfield-nightclub/

Of my close school friends; My best friend now lives in China, I live in Dubai.

true,P1meTaradox,null,null,"Well Fernando has been a porto player for a few years at least and most likely(just an educated guess) priced way too highly for any clubs to take it seriously. Now that hes on the last few months of his contract, a lot of clubs have supposedly been circling because porto have to accept a relatively low offer to to what they normally would so that they can make some sort of profit before he leaves on a free.

And M'Vila was highly sought after but he did have a poor attitude and was seen as a bad apple I guess at the time when his stock was sky high. I assume clubs didn't want to take that risk and basically only Rubin Kazaan were willing to see how he was. Now that he's settled down in Russia with a wife and child, he's apparently been a lot better attitude wise.  

One of the best? Back before his injury, I thought he was decent, but again hes too much of a ball chaser and gets out of position far too often to be considered one of the best. That's a big stretch. Yes a replaced for him should cost plenty, but its important so its all understood that its very much worth it.  Lucas just isn't a DM for a CL competing side in my eyes when it comes down to it. At least not anymore.

Yes, I'd like at least a winger so moses can be prevented from playing as much as possible which will most likely be Salah who I'm intrigued by. And a LB and and GJ replacement are needed. Hope at least an LB or a RB can be found in January because that is a big need but not as big as DM in my eyes. Box to box player will most likely be Hughes possibly.  And I wouldn't mind a player like Firmino or Kono, but Suso might be the depth for Cou and probably one other position.

It really bugs me as to *why* people are complaining about the quick regeneration- it's mostly not for continuity reasons, as that is plausibly explained easily enough, but for the most part, the people I see complaining are saying that they didn't get a chance to say goodbye, that Smith deserved a longer regeneration.

This complaint makes no sense to me, because we *got* our long goodbye- Smith's last confrontation with the Daleks was clearly provided as his ""official"" regeneration scene; the scene in the tardis, as far as I'm concerned and as the Doctor himself basically confirmed, was just a bonus- a reset, a twilight point, wherein we got to intimately part with the character as he was best known to us. They even put aside the old-man visual metaphor just so we could say goodbye to a familiar face. I thought it was beautiful (even if it did *technically* change his last words from ""Regeneration number 13...it's gonna be a whopper!"" to ""Hey.."", the emotional value of the scene was worth it.)

And Amy coming back...that was just..that was the only thing that made the whole painful process (11 was *my* Doctor) feel any better.

I could go on.. but let me just say, that as someone who had yet to ever lose ""their"" Doctor to ""some new man sauntering away"", I feel qualified to say that this whole episode was an excellent send-off for 11, and for Matt Smith.",0,1388301829,null,0,1388302015,0,cecfeon,t3_1tvw0n,t1_cecfeon,t3_1tvw0n,null,1427947513,19,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,19

Whereas 10 held off on the regeneration as long as he could so that he could say goodbye to his friends and family, 11's was mostly done on the tower. He just didn't fully change until in the TARDIS.

11's on the other hand is extremely fitting. Earlier in the episode he mentions how he's pretty much accepted his death. He has no more regenerations.

And especially, you cannot deny that what happened to Donna was tragic and borderline unfair, lotto ticket or not.  Plus Wilf now gets to spend the rest of his life trying to shield her from information that might make her head explode.

Trapping Amy &amp; Rory in the past just to permanently dispose of them was still totally unnecessary, too.  They had happy lives in their own London, no worse for wear for their adventures.  *That's* what leaving Companionship is supposed to be like. 

And maybe it's tacky, but it feels like meta-Amy deserves a mention too.  She plain got fucked.

And my point being, out of all the modern companions that had more than a couple appearances, Martha is the *only one* who managed to return to the planet she wanted to be on, in the right time, in the right dimension, and without brain damage.

I didn't realize just how much affection I had developed for him until TTOD and this last Christmas special, especially his final moments. Seeing him interact with 10 brought out the things I loved about both, such as their playfulness and amusing self-adoration that both expressed so well in their own ways, and I felt like I really appreciated Smith's spin on those traits for the first time by seeing them contrasted with his predecessor's. When it came time for his last hurrah, I found myself interpreting his speech as almost... defiant towards that ""jerk"" syndrome I mentioned. I wasn't expecting to get choked up but by George it was happening. I'm really looking forward to 12 but I think I'll miss 11 more than I ever thought I would. 

Side note: TTOD also made me understand why Tom Baker is many people's favorite. The camera being so focused on his face made me realize just how expressive he could be with it, and how quickly he could shift emotional gears even in the middle of sentences.

It's worth noting that the episode makes a very clear point in why the TARDIS taught River--according to the Doctor, it's because River is a 'child of the TARDIS', and the TARDIS considers River her daughter. 

Even the Doctor had to learn how to fly the TARDIS. The early series had a big point of the Doctor not really knowing how.

true,dispatcher_83,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt;She can fly the TARDIS. Something only River and the Doctor have been shown to do. She even describes it as being easy, which it was for River.

So?  That doesn't mean she is River - that means she can fly the Tardis.  It was heavy implied they had a past romantic relationship and River wasn't the only person the Doctor ever had a romantic relationship with.

&gt;And then what I believe to be the biggest piece of evidence, because it comes across as a really, really blatant direct callback: Tasha mentions that they built a psychopath to kill the Doctor. 

Yes, *they* being a renegade sect of the Papal Mainframe that she didn't have any part of.  How is that evidence stating she is River?

&gt;The Doctor tells Tasha only a couple of minutes later, not even a different scene, she's been fighting the psychopath inside her entire life.

River was never a psychopath or described as one.  The only time she acted that way was when she was intent on killing the Doctor after regenerating from Mel.  That's it.  Thats the **only** time.  She has never been shown or described that way in any episode.

&gt;That's not the first time River's been called a psychopath, nor references been made to her fighting her brainwashing.

Citation needed because I disagree.

&gt;I'm sorry, that came across as a really, really deliberate callback. Say what you will about the other piece of evidence, but if that wasn't intentional, that was some damn shoddy writing. And since it comes across as intentional, I think one would have to be purposefully in denial to dismiss that out of hand.

All of these theories and thoughts that she IS River is wishful thinking and people taking too many doses of Confirmation Bias.  and FAR too much of it.  It seems people only think the Doctor has had 1 marriage, one romantic interest and one person that he has loved and that it MUST be River.  **IF** Moffat did that, then **THAT** is shoddy writing, not the other way around.  I think its clever to introduce a new character and one they can use later down the road.

&gt;So? That doesn't mean she is River - that means she can fly the Tardis. It was heavy implied they had a past romantic relationship and River wasn't the only person the Doctor ever had a romantic relationship with.

Yeah, and flying the TARDIS is somehow related to that, because? Again, *two people* we know of that can do that. 

&gt;Yes, they being a renegade sect of the Papal Mainframe that she didn't have any part of. How is that evidence stating she is River?

I didn't say that specifically was. Jesus, you accuse *me* of reading too in depth?

&gt;River was never a psychopath or described as one

Sorry, you're just wrong there.

""River: We'd only just met. I'm a psychopath. I'm not rude.  
Amy: You are not a psychopath! {to the Doctor} Why would she be a psychopath?  
River: Oh mummy, mummy, pay attention. I was trained and conditioned for one purpose. I was born to kill the Doctor.  
The Doctor: Demon's Run. Remember? This is what they were building. My bespoke psychopath. ""

From *Let's Kill Hitler.*

And even if she hadn't before...how can you *possibly* say she's never been called a psychopath when they *just called her one five minutes earlier?*

&gt;Citation needed because I disagree.

Provided one.

&gt;It seems people only think the Doctor has had 1 marriage, one romantic interest and one person that he has loved and that it MUST be River.

You seem to be deeply in denial about how, what, and why people are suggesting this to be the case. I didn't forge connections where there were none.

Can you *honestly* not see how River = someone fighting psychopath insider her and Tasha = someone fighting psychopath insider her, and River = can fly TARDIS easily and  Tasha = can fly TARDIS easily and River = Doctor's flirty romantic relationship and Tasha = Doctor's flirty romantic relationship and River = not aging and Tasha = not aging and other things are not notable connections that can allow someone to reasonably theorize they might be the same person?

Can you honestly not see it?

I can't actually remember the last time I got to stay asleep past 8. OK, I have always been an early riser but since I started breeding 13 years ago, any chance of a lie-in has gone out of the window.  Summers are the worst though as the little buggers tend to get up when it gets light.  I have seriously considered moving to the tropics just to stop them all waking up at 4am.

Take this morning for example. 

7am(ish) - Wake up with The Baby trying to get my eyes out.  Extracted her tiny fingers from under my eyelids and lay there listening to The Lad and the Crazy Toddler having some kind of violent altercation regarding the Xbox downstairs for 10 mins.  I then go down stairs to rescue The Lad from further attack  by the Crazy Toddler.  After applying first aid to The Lad, I sense the the dogs are going mental and need to be let out.  

7.30 - Start to make coffee.  Suddenly realise that the Oaf Beast dog has not returned and is going mental barking at something.  After about 10 mins of shouting, I don wellies and stomp up the garden in a dressing gown (in the rain, I might add) and retrieve a very excited Oaf Beast from behind a shed some 100m from the house.

7.45 - Get back to house and realise that The Lad and the Crazy Toddler have poured milk and cereal all over the kitchen in an attempt to make breakfast.  The already exited Oaf Beast knocks over The Lad and the crazy toddler in a feeding frenzy - much crying ensues.

7.50 - Need to get dressed as very cold and wet from the excursion outside, so decide to get dressed.  Oaf Beast barges her way into the bedroom, re-awakens The Baby who starts crying and then jumps on the bed, this wakes Mrs Dwair momentarily and spreads mud and wet dog all over bed.  I get dressed and go downstairs to give The Baby some toast, abandoning Oaf Beast.  

7.55 - Make some toast for The Baby, while Oaf Beast repeatedly barges against the door as its simple mind thinks its missing out on food.  Go and retrieve Oaf beast, and I lose The Baby in the 45 seconds it takes to open the door.  Crazy Toddler seizes the opportunity to provoke The Lad again and launches a full on attack with a plastic play mobile truck.  At this point the Moody Pre-Teen is screaming from her room.  The Baby has woken her up by climbing up her bunk bed ladder and sitting on her face with a full nappy.  The toast is now burning.

8.05 - Retrieve Baby and secure in high chair, apply first aid again to The Lad, take toy/weapon away from Crazy Toddler, open windows to let out smoke before alarms activate, put on more toast for The Baby and find that my coffee has gone cold.

8.10 - Change The Baby's nappy as she has done a massive, stinking liquid crap,  Shout at Crazy Toddler for standing on the coffee table shouting ""I am Zule!"" and start to think about making another coffee and feeding the Baby.  At this point the Oaf Beast dog discovers the bin bag in the kitchen I didn't take out out last night and starts going through it, spreading coffee grounds and other detritus everywhere.  

8.15 - Realise that its Sunday morning.  ",0,1388312285,null,0,1388312503,0,cechezc,t3_1txl1m,t1_cechezc,t3_1txl1m,null,1427946576,9,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,9

&gt; Not many people can fly the TARDIS, and the Doctor wouldn't go teaching everybody to fly the TARDIS. River knows how to fly the TARDIS since she's a TARDIS child. The way Tasha flew the TARDIS (better than the Doctor) can only mean one thing. She's either a timelord, or River. Since the Doctor is the last Timelord, take a guess.

&gt; Yes, they being a renegade sect of the Papal Mainframe that she didn't have any part of. How is that evidence stating she is River?

It's a hinch, but it could be that the reason River (Tasha) she let the Kovarian chapter break up is because she has to keep her timeline safe. Since she was kidnapped by the Kovarian Chapter, she had to let em break out in order to not corrupt her own timeline (Classic Who, if you asks me)

1) [Wedding of River Song. The Doctor is obviously referring to River song, if you see the quote in context](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1824359/quotes?item=qt1564784)

Having to save her own timeline, the Doctor, and his timeline has always been an integral part of River's story.

true,LadyLexieBaby,null,null,"Am I the only one who feels like the character depth for 11 was a lot better explored than 10?

I've been doing a lot of analysis on the last 6 seasons and I noticed multiple trends. 

One are the memorable, wisdom-filled quotes/speech that 11 is infamous for.  10 was just as wise, just as human, just as hurt, and just a much a man of words--so why is it that I had a hard time finding ""speeches"" or memorable lines from him? Those that are are mostly comedic. That's not the actor's fault... It's the writer's.

Two, our episodes in 5/6/some 7 became a lot more rich in character development in general. While I can describe the previous 3 companions in one sentence, it would take paragraphs for me to fully explain Amy, Rory, and River (Clara hasn't had much time yet).  

Next, the long plot arcs of 5/6 lent very well to creating tragedy (and consequently memorable and emotional episodes). While 10's series were mostly standalone plots with a big finale at the end of the season, 11's series was full of main character deaths and continual plot lines that caused shock.  Again, this is thanks to the writing--not Matt.

By the way, this is all coming from a 10 and 11 lover. I love the way Tennant embodied the Doctor, but I think he has been overshadowed in the writing by all the drama/speeches Matt got to give.

 It's hard to envision what an atheist would say, given this format. There are no core values of atheism, besides non belief,  and definitely no holy book. Not simply that, but being an atheist doesn't really effect British people in day to day life, as part of the point of atheism is not being affected by some belief system. 

I understand what you are trying to say: many atheists do have interesting things to say. But there is no atheist perspective to say it from, they are simply talking as individuals with their own views. This is why the alternate thought for the day sounded more like a personalised, blog type, speech rather than the application of a belief system on current affairs. 

Maybe one day, Humanists will be able to get a slot on thought for the day as they do have a set of shared moral values. Of course, humanism may have to gain a popularity similar to mainstream religions first.

The point about the NHS isn't valid; we wouldn't be being annexed by the south, there'd be long negotiations and continuity in health care provision would certainly be one of the top priorities for both unionist and nationalist politicians.

The economic argument isn't valid either, since under the UK we have no real economy and require subsidising. The economic policies of the UK are not remotely to our benefit, and as less than 3% of the UK, they would be insane to consider tailoring UK policy to us.

As part of Ireland we would be ~30% of the population. Altering national policy to suit NI would happen by necessity, although not much would need to change since overnight our corporation tax would be cut in half, bringing a flood of investment into what is one of the poorest regions in the EU.

That carries over to political representation too. At the moment we're in a situation where a political party with no representatives in NI, no mandate to govern here, is demanding and blackmailing our Assembly into passing welfare reforms that will hurt NI a hell of a lot more than the places those people are actually elected from.

Anyone who claims that the south is more conservative on social issues than us doesn't follow the news. Ireland is soon to have a referendum on gay marriage, while the NI Assembly will have to be brought to the UK Supreme Court and/or the European Court of Human Rights before there is even a chance of it happening here. As for abortion, we aren't really in a position to judge, we have one clinic and ministers looking into prosecuting its staff. Reunification will leave us in virtually the same position we're in now.

The cost is a big concern, but not a massive one. We'd almost certainly have help from the US, the EU and possibly even the UK. We'd probably have to take on more debt and cuts for a few years, but we're going through that anyway to prop up a failed financial system. At least reunification offers us a reward in the form of economic growth.

Reading the PDF, these are really horrible questions:

&gt;The government must enforce the minimum wage so employers can’t squeeze out British workers by employing Europeans on the cheap. But if we have a level playing ""eld and Bulgarians and Romanians want to work hard and pay their taxes, they will be playing by the rules.

(agree/disagree)

Why are those two phrases put together? They're different points not entirely compatible points. I suspect because this is because they know people will agree that the minimum wage part, but they will publicise ""People a happy for immigration if they work hard and play by the rules"".

&gt;The government’s right to put tough limits on access to benefits for new European migrants. People come here to work hard, pay taxes and contribute to Britain, but not if they’re looking for an easy ride

(agree/disagree)

Another example. They get people to agree to the anti-immigration tinted first sentence, publicize the second, tolerant sentence.

&gt;People are worried that immigration from Romania and Bulgaria will put
pressures on local public services and we need to manage that. But let’s not prejudge people and stir up tensions before they’ve even got here, we can deal with issues without being prejudiced

What's happening is unfortunate but I'm certain it's something that would've happened in any other country in a similar situation to the UK. 

It's simply human nature, and politicians using whatever pieces they have on the board to win more power.
There are many people who do not care to look beyond whatever image of the world the latest news article or TV show paints for them, and they are the ones the politicians usually try to manoeuvre into doing whatever it is that benefits them most.

true,fatfook,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt;It isn't great, but looking around the world we really aren't that bad. Look at American politics. Or Italy/Spain/Greece where corruption and bribes are blatant and accepted in a way that simply wouldn't happen in modern day Britain. France is a mess politically too. Not too sure about Germany, but obviously a lot of people aren't happy with the party in power there either.

Corruption is absolutely endemic in UK politics. When you have legislation created in the favour of banks AFTER a publicly funded bail out, you know it's rotten. Do you think Cash for Questions and similar practices just stopped?

&gt;I see it as change. And the NHS has changed constantly since it was first introduced. It is now larger and more comprehensive than ever before. If that involves bringing in companies or changing things, that's fine. Quality of care is still ranked excellently worldwide and the NHS is the most efficient healthcare system in the world.

It's not change, it's just moving toward the American model where insurers take over the financial control and we end up in a similar boat paying £20k for a CT scan or maybe just a grand for a bandage. It's all about making it for profit, as with all other privatised aspects of our country. It was shown that these things couldn't operate for what was a basic business model sustainable growth return regards profit yet they still went ahead. To see profit they would have to spend less on infrastructure investment or charge more. aaaaaannndd, what do you think has happened to our privatised companies in the last 10-15 years? Exactly that per chance? It's because you have to and education and the NHS will go the same way. We've seen the insidious creep of privatisation in education and now all of a sudden a massive hike in tuition fees to almost £10k a year (another American model) in some cases doubling the previous costs. Of course Uni's will charge this not only to provide parity of perceived quality but also to get the bucks rolling in. The quality of the care won't change agreed, you'll just end up with a life changing debt that will scratch out the inheritance to your children if you happen to have a stroke or something later in life.

&gt;They're bad, but affordability isn't too bad. Super low interest right now, and 90% mortgages are back.

First time buyers are stuffed, with an average 8% rise year on year they can never keep up with what is required to save to get a deposit. It will forever be out of reach. Super low interest, but with it GUARANTEED to rise, they can't keep it artificially low without major compound problems attached to that, meaning anyone with half a brain only needs to do back of a fag packet sums to realise that if it rose only 4% they'd have to hand over their entire salary to pay for their mortgage each month. That is what I mean by fucked. The whole mortgage system is rotten too. Why should you write an IOU to the bank, creating your own money out of thin air and then pay some twat who had almost nothing to do with the deal almost the same money back in interest as what you borrowed? How on earth is that a fair system? The housing market is based on fear and greed and it needs to change. We just need somewhere to live, we need to forget about the constant profiteering and reliance on it as an economic mainstay in our country. It's the banks, lawyers and the rich landlords who win whilst we get shafted yet again.

&gt;Quite possible. But this varies a lot depending on who your council is. As for too much power - I suspect you wouldn't say that if the council was doing a good job. I'd rather have local people with the power rather than someone in London deciding they know what to do in my Northern town.

I've never had much experience of councils doing a good job. When you discover how much money they're spunking on inflated salaries, trips, jolly's, parties, unsustainable projects and plush new offices as well as the nightmare of bureaucracy they've created, it reeks of needing a strip out and complete re-think about what they're actually doing for us. Agreed better that it's local but they are still causing problems for millions when they should be helping us, that was their original remit.

&gt;Safest roads in the EU though.

I think roads in Northerm Europe are far better: Germany, Sweden, Norway etc. I think the safety has a lot to do with driver training and modern car performance. It doesn't change the fact that there is never going to be enough money to adequately
 care for the roads we've built - it's a mathematical impossibility. They can only hope to keep the motorways and A roads safe. In my locality there have been problems with some large roads for close to 20 years with the councils solution to keep shovelling tarmac into potholes and not any kind of proper resurfacing policy. Again, lack of money has put paid to that and that is directly connected with the privatised tendering process we now have. Everyone down the line needs to make a little profit and whilst it may have been done at cost 30 years ago by council employees, it's now Fitzpatrick or similar doing a shitty job for a load more money.

Yes, look at how we treat alcohol: A devastating drug that kills wholesale and creates misery for literally millions each week directly or indirectly. From dying of cirrhosis to having some drunk tit piss in your garden or scratch your new £30k car. Ties up the police in city centres 3 days a week plus, causes death and destruction on the roads etc etc. And, easily available by the boat load at your local friendly supermarket-oh and of course at the in-house bar in the houses of Parliament where they dream up all these silly rules. Yet Weed, without a single confirmed death directly attributable to it's name, is banned, demonised and legislated against. Tying up yet more police time and filling good prison beds for no reason at all and costing the tax payer untold in all associated costs. What a fucked up load of bollocks that is.

It is all relevant, compare this luxury with a Manillan slum but with what we know it could be so much better and I'm sure it WAS better not so long ago. We just need to take the control and the greed out of it.

true,darreno_bentos,null,null,"i think we need to be very particular about the defensive minded player we buy for midfield. i personally don't really want us to sign a big powerful player like some people are calling for unless they are extremely mobile. 

after watching the last few games and how well Hendo, Allen and Lucas played together without Stevie i think mobility and passing is the way forward and the way to get the most out of the players we have. someone said a player like Paulinho and some pundits are suggesting Dembele but we played right through Paulinho the other week and Dembele would simply be no good for us. our performance in the City game did nothing to change my mind about it. another 'runner' like Ramires would be very interesting but I can't think of others apart from Barkley and neither are realistic. haven't seen much of Yann M'Villa but i don't think coming from Russia he'd arrive in great shape (altho i'm aware they've changed their league so it has a break from dec - march). don't really want Cabaye either, good player but he'd suit Man United a lot more than us

Lucas hasn't reached his previous level but at the same time i don't think he'd get absolutely bossed in Europe. unless you're playing Dortmund it's often slower and he is the master of the tactical foul. but like we saw last season if he gets an injury and Allen has to fill in at DM we will struggle. or similarly if Hendo gets injured we'd need to reshuffle things and would leave as light in the attacking positions. i think Matic would be the best but maybe this Fernando is more realistic. buying players from Portugal is seemingly impossible for english clubs these days. is Fernando co-owned? if he is i think we can forget it

we need goals from other positions so i think left sided or right sided forward should be high on the list. someone like Tello, Salah or Shaqiri would give us loads more options. Rakitic would be handy too. i think any of those would make an impact here

no idea who we could get to replace but i think Glen Johnson needs to pull his socks up. on a huge contract, hasn't signed on again and probably wants another big payday. isn't currently winning us games and seems to sleepwalk through games. and whenever we lose he has usually been our worst player",0,1388319298,null,0,false,0,cecic2f,t3_1tx2rd,t1_cecic2f,t3_1tx2rd,null,1427946148,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Later in the article it identifies the overall half-life as two months, although that's not a direct quote.

Yeah, I have done that and now you're either trying really hard to save face or you're truly that clueless that you still don't understand what was said, likely due to your own pretentiousness.

Here, let me make it clearer for you.

I established the context of this entire discussion by saying we probably should sign ""a striker to throw on late in the game when we're chasing a result as we were this week"" suggesting that Aspas should not be the player we rely on in those situations.  Your reply?

&gt; We did throw a striker on late in the game, Aspas.

I then reiterated that Aspas was not suited for that role because he has had no success in positively influencing the game when brought on as a sub.  You beg to differ, suggesting he's not being asked to change the game even in the City game, which is the situation I was talking about and which you were aware of **since you decided to mention that Aspas was brought on late against City**:

&gt; No-ones asking Aspas to be a 'game changer' just for him to get acclimated to the Prem and start contributing. Time will tell whether he can do that.

I then said that Aspas isn't being brought on late in the game a goal down just so he can adjust to the English game.  You stuck with the ""he is just getting acclimated"" argument:

&gt; Aspas needs to be playing matches, that's the only way he will (if he can) improve. After the Chelsea game we have 4 straight matches against weaker opposition before the 2nd derby. I would hope Aspas gets some time in those games. I'm not writing him off yet like so many on here seem willing to do.

Most of which is completely off topic.  Who cares about future easy fixtures?  I'm talking about why Aspas was brought on late against City since you decided to basically say ""we don't need an impact sub striker, we have Aspas"" after I suggested we should sign such a striker in January.  You still with me?

I then say he's not being asked to adjust to the game when he's subbed on under those circumstances (still referring to the Man City game, since I'm spelling it all out for you).  

You then **changed your tune** and replied:

&gt; *Aspas was put on with 8mins left to hopefully help find an equaliser.* It didn't happen this time but it's a bit much to ask of the lad. I think people like you are expecting too much.

First of all, *that's the reason I was saying he was brought on this entire time despite you trying to contradict me.*  Secondly, I didn't expect anything of him.  If anything Rodgers is the only one who was expecting too much as he thought his influence would change the result of the game.  I didn't expect him to bang in 2 goals and get us three points just because he set foot on the pitch.  However, I also do not feel that he should be the striker to call upon in those situations when he barely gets playtime when we're ahead against weaker opponents when fit.

Welcome to my ""fantasy world.""  I hope you are caught up now, or are you still lost?  I don't think I can walk you through this any slower.

Is missing the point - can you give me an example of one of these secular programmes and show where any non-theistic viewpoints were discussed? Does The Archers have a slot for the British Humanist Society that I missed because I was so wrapped up in the problems Leonie is having?

If there is a show about needlecraft and the people who knit complain that it only allows discussion of crochet, then its not much of an argument to claim that lots of other shows aren't non-crochet.

But mainly your argument is a strawman because the argument wasn't that slots like thought for the day should be closed. TBL didn't try to close it, he wanted to end the protectionism that only allows that slot to be used by certain people. 

If we are to have protected non-secular programming - and we should, there is no good reason to cover matters of interest to a segment of the population - then there should also be access to worldviews such as humanism, there is a clear amount of interest in humanism (go see the stats of officiants at funerals or weddings) and such a world view should have representation in these protected slots

Lifted wholesale from Wikipedia (although not personally verified):

&gt;In 2002, 102 people put their names to a letter to the BBC Governors, drawn up by the British Humanist Association, the National Secular Society, and the Rationalist Press Association. This protested that the slot was available only to religious views. As a consequence, Professor Richard Dawkins from Oxford University was given a two-and-a-half minute slot to deliver a reflection from an atheist viewpoint, although this was not broadcast in the Thought for the Day slot itself. The Editors of the BBC World Service's version of the same strand Pause for Thought, were not so dogmatic about contributions and between 1997-2002, over 20 secular thought pieces were recorded with Chris Templeton, Nicolas Walter and Anthony Grey. 

&gt;However, the BBC commented that it wanted to keep Thought for the Day a unique offering of a faith perspective within an otherwise entirely secular news programme. In response to this decision by the BBC the Humanist Society of Scotland created their own programme 'Thought For The World' to accommodate these non-religious views. The last secular Pause for Thought was recorded for BBC World Service in 2002.

Yes and no.

If you have insurance the charges for each item are completely different, this is shown in the ""adjustments"" section where 80% of the cost is written off (i.e. phantom, was never going to be paid in the first place). This is part of a contract between the hospital and the insurer which involves a separate payment from the insurer to the hospital.

If you don't have insurance a simple request to the billing office will usually wipe off 50% of the bill, you can also apply to the hospital's charitable arm to pay some of the bill (which I suspect is done as some kind of tax dodge). And you can hire a negotiator to argue about the bill with the hospital. That's job creation!

OTOH if you don't know that's what you're supposed to do, or the hospital is ""out of network"" with your insurer, or, or... then you're fucked.

the other end of the spectrum though is because he is so outspoken, opinionated, a strong personality, he will want full control of the spurs team to shape us through his own methods, and him and levy butting heads would not be uncommon. him and the english media will be interesting too.

still he has said that managing in england is his last ""dream"", our team is going to be in desperate need of a winner and a leader in the dressing room, we are a club situated in london, and will have pulling power with him.

Getting an NHS contract doesn't reduce your profit margin, it increases it. The NHS would rather accept a $0.2m rise in price than drop your contract and pay the $1m to buy the equipment itself. Or the $0.5m required to switch to a different private provider (IT costs etc). This is why privatisation contracts get renewed repeatedly even after failing to meet their targets.

-Balotelli = ineligible for u23
-Benteke = ineligible for u23
- Yesil is not nearly as polished, confident, and honestly not as highly rated. Also listed as a forward, but often/usually plays winger.
- Wellbeck? Really? He's been decent at best this year, and hardly warrants inclusion in this list. Also ineligible for u23. Listed as a forward, but plays winger consistently.
- Sordell is a silly addition. He can't even get a loan to a top flight team in any country, so he's at Charlton. Wow, what a talent.......
- Will Keane is in a similar situation to Sordell, AND he's coming from Man U. If he was so highly rated, wouldn't Sunderland have gone for either him or Sordell *instead* of Borini?
- Deulofeu is definitely a winger, and when you are 19, what you've played fro the past few years, especially for all your major clubs, is definitely your position. I'd also question if he is better than Borini; he is often a benefit of his situation much like Javier Pastore before PSG.

All of your choices have had more playing time than Borini, and most of them have less competition for their places (pretty much all of them except for the Real/Barca players). Borini excelled before coming to the Premier League, and the majority of your selections have never played in England. Are you comparing Premier League form from Borini, or his whole career? He scored 9 goals in 24 appearances for Roma - a better rate than Soldado at Tottenham thus far. Give the man time now that he's playing regularly (on a team with essentially no service).


I tend to see it like this: your first 5 (Neymar, Balotelli, Benteke, Lukaku, Morata) are arguably the top 5 in the world (granted). After this, your list is extremely questionable, and by no means a consensus. Borini is very highly rated, especially as a u23, and has Italy national team caps - a **very** good national team with lots of competition at the striker position.  As recently as May 2013, he was named to the UEFA u21 (read u23) European Championship's Tournament First team. He's getting more and more time at Sunderland as the season goes on, with more starts and more on-field involvement, taking time from older, more experienced players like Giaccherini (who is an established regular in the Italian national squad), to the point that Poyet adjusts his formation to accommodate Borini when he's fit and it fits the opponent.

Not sure why you're hating on Borini so much, but everytime *I* see him play, I wonder what he could do with just a little more playing time and experience, and I'd love to see him recalled in the summer, especially when we're back in European Football.",0,1388326718,null,0,false,0,cecjgvj,t3_1tvyn3,t1_cecjgvj,t1_cech4ut,null,1427945546,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,lossaysswag,lfc12,,"While I do agree that someone needs to be signed to play centrally, I don't think it's an out and out defensive midfielder (or ""destroyer"") we need.  We need a big/strong box to box midfielder who is adept at playing defensively.  Another engine to go along with Hendo but play beside Lucas and sometimes rotate with him when Gerrard is fit.  Lucas does have very good distribution, but often he finds himself forward on counters (especially with Gerrard out now) and he slows down play because he lacks the creativity to make a crucial pass in those particular situations and also won't look to continue forward.  This player would also be an alternative to Allen depending on the opponent and whether his defensive talents would be preferred.  Think someone like Pogba, Matuidi, Fernandinho, Vidal or Paulinho (when he isn't off his game).  And no, I'm not suggesting those should be our targets, but just the model of player. I do like M'Vila, but he's too similar to Lucas and wouldn't be someone necessary to sign in this window.


I also do think we need someone with size **and** speed up front on the wing.  This is the real reason I was interested in the Yarmolenko rumors because he's 6'3 and quick.  However, strength at this position isn't absolutely necessary just ideal considering how small some of our key attackers are (Sterling, Coutinho, Allen).  An added threat on set pieces besides our CBs and Suarez would be nice in addition to the creativity they could bring out wide.  However, we do need someone with an eye for goal up front besides just Sturridge and Suarez.  Coutinho does not have a finisher's mentality (or technique at this point in his game), Sterling is not reliable and often cannot keep his balance because of the size mismatches when taking on defenders (that will come as we see glimpses of him taking challenges and staying on his feet going to goal, but it affects his final touch), Allen is well... Allen, and Hendo is improving but still not lethal.  Someone in the mold of Aubameyang, Bale, T. Muller, Robben, Hamsik, Costa, or the obvious prototype Cristiano would be ideal.  However, there are very few players that fit this mold that would be available and capable of making an instant impact on the first team, and therefore it's more likely we end up with a smaller winger.  However, as long as they're a goal threat I have no qualms with them not having the height and strength of an ideal target.

As such, the players I'd like Liverpool to consider: Koke, Rakitic, Cabaye, Griezmann, Guarin, Matuidi, Banega, Nainggolan, Muniain (yes I know he's off his game, but I believe Rodgers can bring out the best in him as he has with our January signings from last year, Sterling and Hendo), Javier Pastore, Jeremy Menez and Jay Rodriguez.

Diego Capel would be a cheapie squad option.

Most of the ideal wingers wouldn't be available until the summer and there are a number of other signings I'd like as well, but my list is long enough just looking at those two player types.",0,1388328904,null,0,false,0,cecjx3w,t3_1tx2rd,t1_cecjx3w,t3_1tx2rd,null,1427945335,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,grodecki,null,null,"In response to your question; if the claim has been settled, and the fault placed on the third party, and you still have your no claims in tact, it should have been paid by the third party. If you went through your insurer, they may not have yet recovered the costs from the third party, leaving you with zero no claims until they do.

Insurance uses statistics. Statistics show that people who have been in accidents are more likely to be in accidents again, and as such should pay more. The majority of road accidents are not entirely one party's fault, despite the legal settlement on one person being to blame. As such, relying on the statistics is the only sensible and viable method of calculating car insurance premiums (something that insurance firms do not directly make money on; most lose it, see my post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1pvead/im_21_i_have_two_years_ncd_and_have_had_my/cd6hvra)

My advice? Shop around. Call people. Haggle. You will get a much better price.

-------------------------

People have a lot of misconceptions when it comes to car insurance and claims.

When someone crashes into you, or you have an accident that is clear cut NOT your fault, and the other party accepts this; inform your insurer and instruct them to do nothing. You then have two options depending on a) whether you wish to claim for personal injury and b) how serious the damage to your car is. If the damage is minor and you do not want to claim for personal injury, contact the person who hit you's insurer and deal with them directly in getting your car fixed. If you wish to claim personal injury, and the damage to your car is serious (aka, the car is not drivable), I would personally reccomend using a third party legal firm. There are tonnes of these, HelpHire, Europa Consultants, ThorneyCroft Solicitors... they are all 'no win no fee' legal firms that will take on your case and sort everything out for you. They will deal with the third party insurer and getting your car fixed/replaced/paid out for, they will deal with getting a personal injury claim going, as well as setting up physiotherapy sessions, treatment. Crucially, they will give you a hire car for as long as your car is damaged/off the road/undrivable, which can be weeks. Most insurers will NOT give this directly. 

If the fault is debatable but you have witnesses to back up your case, do the same as above.

If the fault is debatable and you do not have witnesses, try the legal firms anyway, one of them may be willing to take you on. If they think the accident will go 50/50, you will get all the benefits above. If they worry it may be deemed your fault, they won't provide a hire car, but they will be able to facilitate an injury claim if requested. This may vary dependant on the company and accident, but this is my experience.

If the accident is your fault, well, tough luck. Talk to and claim off your own insurance.

The reason you do not instruct your insurer to do anything when you have an accident is because they will firstly require your excess to be paid, and then try and claim it back later, whilst suspending your no claims bonus, making it difficult to renew at a competitive price if the claim drags on (hint, they do), and you out of pocket. Unless you paid for it at the start, you likely won't have a hire car either. There is NO advantage to going through your own insurer in a non fault situation or a 50/50 one. Just do not do it.

Of course, using these third party legal firms will jack up premiums for everyone, as they charge sily fees for hire cars and literally any minor contact you have with another car can be a £2500 whiplash claim with little effort. It's up to you whether you feel okay with 'abusing' the system that way, but it at times is the only way to recover the cost and mitigate the increase in premiums after having an accident where you were not at fault.

The first half of Boxing Day's victory over Swansea City was arguably Chelsea's best 45 minutes since the visit to West Ham in November.There was pressing high up the pitch, defensive anchor Mikel was marauding forward and many chances were created. The problem is that 1-0 was - yet again - only a fair reflection of the opportunities taken, not those on offer, of which there were nearly 20.

This match marks the turning point of the season, the last match of the first round against our Barclays Premier League opponents. At the halfway stage last season Chelsea had accrued 38 points - one more than the total before this game. Anything above that after this weekend from the opening 19 would represent the best return since the 2009/10 Double season.

Although the Blues have won 15 of the last 17 games at the Bridge, we have not beaten Liverpool in the Premier League for more than three-and-a-half years. It would require greater efficiency - especially in front of goal and away from home - to emulate the success of that season, but let us not yet rule it out.

The corresponding fixture in 2012/13 ended in a 1-1 draw. John Terry scored for the Blues from a Juan Mata corner but then left the field injured, Luis Suarez later heading an equaliser in the skipper's absence. Suarez has hit 19 goals in 13 Premier League games this season.


**TACTICAL BRIEF**
Chelsea's man in form is Eden Hazard, the match-winner again on Thursday at the Bridge. He should provide a stern test for Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson and sooner or later an opponent will finally be pulled up for fouling him in the box.

While the second-half goalscoring opportunity Johnson found at the Etihad in midweek restated his attacking threat, the former Blue also showed some of the defensive frailty that has marked his career.

Ramires's fifth yellow card of the season against Swansea means he can play no part in today's game. His energy and raiding behind the opposition's rearguard sets him apart from team-mates and will be missed this weekend.

Jose Mourinho has used the Brazilian as a right midfielder in a 4-3-3 over the last two matches, with John Mikel Obi as the defensive anchor, albeit with instructions to press higher up the field at home to Swansea than was the case at Arsenal.

Fernando Torres looks likely to feature against his former side, having remained on the bench against Swansea three days ago. The Spaniard will be as eager as ever to break his duck against his former club after six reunions without a goal.

In Steven Gerrard's absence through injury, Jordan Henderson (pictured below) has become the Liverpool fulcrum in the final third, spraying the ball around their buzzing frontmen from left midfield. Joe Allen has been less influential.

Cole and Henderson


Let us hope that like the majority of us Luis Suarez had enough to eat over Christmas - he was banned for 10 matches after biting Branislav Ivanovic in April.

Chelsea's Serbia defender will relish the resumption of battle with the devious Uruguayan, of whose 19 goals this season, just three have come against sides from the top half (Everton and Tottenham).

Crucial to Suarez's success is the relationship with Philippe Coutinho, the insightful attacking midfielder with an eye for goal. The two exposed Man City's high line early on with several clever passes or flicks into the space behind it, making the most of winger Raheem Sterling's exceptional pace. 

Liverpool's huge win at White Hart Lane was founded on their dominance of full-backs Naughton and Walker through Jordan Henderson and Sterling, and the inability of Dawson to cope with pace when asked to maintain a high line.

The Reds are very fluid positionally, full of pace and movement, except the centre-backs and two deep-lying midfielders. They sometimes look uneasy defending set-plays and Martin Skrtel will not get away every week with shirt tugging.

Against the better sides Liverpool's success in finding their own shirt at crosses and corners is quite low and those marginal factors can decide big matches. In this game last season they were caught offside six times, a high number at this level.

Chelsea fans themselves criticize his spending at times because the make of the squad changes so frequently.

I'm not speculating about anything.  There is no speculation.  Had those players wanted to come, we would've signed them, thus increasing how much we spent this summer.  It's not that hard to make that connection.  Most clubs didn't spend ""a shitload of money"" outside of Chelsea, City and Spurs (purely due to the Bale signing).  Arsenal, Everton and United hovered in our range of spending and are all in the top 8.

true,Torque_Tonight,null,null,"Ex Brighton College boy here, quite surprised to see my old school referred to in a post, so I feel I owe you a response. The issue, as with many things in the UK, is tangled up with resentment, inverse snobbery, jealousy and a number of other negative traits.

To be blunt, you get a better quality of education at a private school. If that was not the case no parents would pay for it, and because it is paid for the school can afford smaller class sizes and more personal attention.

Private education tends to be deeper and broader, and private school parents invariably have a positive attitude to education. Private schools tend to provide a more rounded education, teaching life skills and learning techniques which better prepare the pupils for life, not simply teaching to pass exams.

There will always be counter examples, but on average privately educated pupils tend to do better than state pupils, which then paves the way to better university courses and ultimately to better careers.

Many parents who use the state system do care, but those parents who do not care much about education will send their children to state schools, never fee paying private schools. Such parents may not participate in or encourage study, may be ambivalent about truancy, poor discipline and probably have low expectations for their children (a self-fulfilling prophecy). State class sizes are generally large, resources are limited, personal attention is non-existant. Discipline is often poor and academic achievement is mediocre. The scope of non-academic education is much more limited.

There is a misconception that private school pupils are 'posh' This is far from the truth. In reality private school pupils simply come from families who care about education - but that in itself is often viewed negatively by some in our society. My parents were not rich: I was dressed in second hand clothes when growing up and my dad was always the last owner of a car before it went to the scrapyard, but paying school fees took priority over fancy cars, clothes and holidays. My school provided scholarships so that deserving children of poor parents could receive a good education, so it enabled social mobility. The existence of private schools also benefits the state sector - parents still pay the taxes to fund state schools but do not take up places at those schools.

My old school mates have mostly gone on to professional careers, earn good money and enjoy a better quality of life. I have many friends who went to a nearby state school, and generally they do not have particularly good jobs or quality of life. One of these guys was recently bantering me for being in his opinion 'posh'. He's a nice guy but he can barely string a correct English sentence together, has a minimum wage job and will not go very far in life. The reverse snobbery is sometimes irritating but frankly pathetic. Being looked down on by a low achiever is not going to cause me sleepless nights.

I want the best for my future children. I would rather they were for example a doctor than a bottle washer in a pub. I am certainly not rich, having used my decent start in life to pursue a career for love not money, but my kids' education will be a priority. It doesn't guarantee anything, but it maximises their chances. By the time you reach adulthood and enter the workplace, nobody really cares what school you went to, but by that stage your education has probably put you on the path either to success or mediocrity.

TLDR: Private schools provide a better education. The parents care enough to pay for it. The payment enables the schools to provide it.

NB: There is often confusion over the term public school, whereas the terms private school and state school are more consistently understood. In the UK a public school is a private school, because traditionally any member of the public could pay to attend whereas state schools only educated certain sectors of society. In the USA public school means state school because it is funded by the public purse ie the state..

true,fatfook,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Agreed, I have a colleague who has purposely been living in a state where he doesn't make his student loan repayments kick in. (About £15k a year I believe) but he really wants to buy a house as the rents are killing him in central London - his SO also pays much mmore than him towards their place as she earns more. So he's faced with either more training to get a better paid job, or working 2 jobs so that he can afford both to pay off his student loan and also save AND live.

When you do the sums, he needs to be on near £50k a year for that to be remotely achievable but he needs to be earning almost double that to qualify on the kind of mortgage he needs to buy in London, let alone get anywhere near a deposit when the year on year gains (5-15%) for the last 30 odd years in that area. In '77 the average house was £16k in London. Now it's £360k. Do the maths on wages too, it's basically unachievable for the mortal man in a lifetime. Across the nation we have seen house prices creep at 3% per annum and wage inflation struggle to meet 2%* and that's not for everyone, just what an inflationary wage increase should be. Both my wife and I received below inflation pay rises this year which is effectively a pay cut.

In fact, if you go through the little EU museum inside the parliament building, one of the last rooms is a big bank of interactive displays with MEPs from all over Europe and their opinions on the future of the EU, and they felt that a noted eurosceptic like Nigel deserved to be heard, so he got a video.

The problem seems to come with the kinds of people that the party attracts. To me, UKIP is just a more traditionalist and nationalist version of the Tories, but their policies certainly aren't outwardly racist or anything like the BNP or EDL. However, because UKIP are gaining legitimacy as a political party, a lot of those former BNP supporters have jumped on the UKIP bandwagon, as well as the kinds of people who agree with their policies but for all the wrong reasons.
