My main concern with him is that he never seems to be very dangerous when he has the ball. Too often he chooses the easy pass, which is good in 90% of the cases, but being a attacking midfielder, I just don't think he contributes enough in terms of creating chances and scoring goals (IIRC he has only scored 1 goal in 30+ matches for Denmark). He plays with the flair of a holding midfielder, yet plays in the position of an attacking. If he was a winger, he would be Stewart Downing - that's probably the best way I can describe my opinion of him. Also, he seems to be physically weak.

All in all, I can't see why he is rated so highly. I'd honestly prefer playing Coutinho in the no. 10 role rather than Eriksen.

However, the simple fact is that the kids were born.

This incident is as much our state's fault as it is that man's.

Arguably, the worst thing about this whole incident is that we now get to spend £1-2 million pounds on housing these 3 individuals for the rest of their lives rather than spending it on cancer treatments, food for the needy, teachers etc.",0,1365013105,null,0,false,0,c97sjqw,t3_1bjlz2,t1_c97sjqw,t1_c97scji,null,1431685650,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

There is a difference between being poor and being in poverty. I have no problem with people being rich, however recently rich people have been getting much richer while poor people are getting poorer (plus the effects of austerity). My point is that your evidence suggests that the richest own a huge portion of the wealth, and this is ignoring the argument of tax havens/loopholes. If 50% comes from the top 5%, how much does the bottom 50% contribute and why?

&gt;My own favoured solution...

My view of government is that we all pay taxes so that the government can provide infrastructure and services to make all our lives better, so giving out taxes would destroy that imo. Also you then have the argument that rich people are giving money directly to the poor and would be considered an even worse form of welfare. When taxes are used to provide services you can make the argument that everyone benefits from them and therefore everyone contributes.

Although I personally like the form of welfare where everyone in the country receives it, regardless of wealth, and it is just recouped through taxes.

So if you do a job where you take shit from a boss but just have to grin and bear it; where someone watches what time you come on shift and what time you leave, and docks your pay if you're late; then that pretty much means you have to -- as some old bearded German bloke once said -- sell your labour to survive. That makes you working class.

So yes, that includes huge numbers of people in the private sector who aren't in unions, and yes it excludes certain unionised professions as well.

66% of current male firefighters and the vast majority of female firefighters were deemed to be unlikely to make it passed 55 in terms of operational capability which means if they continue ploughing passed any sensible options all these firefighters will be effectively sacked on terms of capability at the age of 55 if not before with no opportunity to take their pension until 60 (there's very little chance of getting a desk job). 

On top of this the government only need 10-20% of pension members to opt out before the changes cost far more than they save, they've arbitrarily 'guessed' that around 1% would opt out based on no research meanwhile the union's survey put 27% of current members as very likely to opt out with a further substantial percentage as considering opting out making the whole thing a sham. 

Couple this with continued degradation in conditions of service and the fact MPs pay &amp; pension have either gone untouched or improved putting lie to all being in it together fire fighters are very likely to be at least getting balloted to strike.

Is he tough enough for this league?  We already have players like Sterling and Coutinho who offer very little physically and are 95% offensive who fill that role.  Given our weakness on set pieces and tendency to get bullied by teams like Stoke and West Brom, shouldn't we be investing so much in a play-maker with a more formidable physical presence? Someone who fits the mold of Yaya Toure, who can hold the ball, distribute, win Ariel battles, and be a physical force. 

Maybe im asking too much here.  But scoring and creativity doesn't seem to be our problem.... We need men, not boys, if we want to win UGLY vs teams like Stoke and West Brom and not get raped on set pieces seemingly every damn week.  I think with the amount of money we would have to dish out to get this kid, we could get a player comparable to Yaya Toure.

If I can't find the lie I remain disbelieving and highly sceptical until its proven truthful or fraudulent through self-research.

Manchester is a rich, industrial city famous for its former textile mills, amongst many other things—and it's also the place where Ernest Rutherford split the atom. I recommend a visit to the Museum of Science and Industry.

London is famous for many things, but I think the landmarks you've suggested might be a bit too obvious for where you seem to be taking the project. It's all well and good to discuss Big Ben and the London Eye—they are iconic of London—but they won't have the day-to-day impact on Londoners' lives and culture as something less obvious, like the London Underground, the Victorian sewage system or the famous red double decker bus. The key thing to remember is that despite its history, and the visible signs thereof, London and Manchester are both vast, working modern metropolises, unlike anywhere else in the world.

I'm a firm believer in the maxim, ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do."" Spend a day or so running around the main touristy destinations, but spend the rest of your time just travelling around London (buy an Oyster card for this—it will save you huge amounts of time and money) off the beaten track, learning how the city works by osmosis.

If you like, I can help. I live in London, and I'm free for most of the time you've mentioned (excepting exams and revision) so I'd be very happy to give you a ""Londoner's tour"" of London if you'd like that. Send me a private message if you're interested.

As far as ignorant tourist things go: make *absolutely sure* you move quickly and purposefully through railway stations. Stand on the right on the escalators (or even better, walk down on the left.) Plan your journey before you leave. If you're only going a few stops on the tube, take the bus or walk instead.

Also, look up pronunciations. Nothing will annoy a Londoner more than someone with a camera around their neck asking for directions to ""Lie-sess-ter Square"" or ""Hol-bourne."" :)

I'm not proposing that high earners should go back to paying the same kind of tax rates they were expected to in previous decades. A land tax, for example, would be more difficult to avoid and would be a more fitting acknowledgement of what those people have gained through access to common resources. Better taxation is fairer, not more taxation.

&gt;the top 1% pay 25% of the tax revenue

firstly, this is true only for income tax. Secondly, considering the amount of wealth concentrated in the hands of an increasingly small number through exploitation, isn't a quarter pitiful?

&gt;Your essential problem is that you want rich people to hurt more than they do. It's not going to happen; what's more, it's not even productive if your goal is more reasonable: to get poor people to be less poor.

That's not what I want (although I'd like to see some indication that, say, the wealthiest 1% have been ""hurt"" at all - in fact they've become richer.) So about this reasonable goal - which is what I want. How can the poor be less poor if the rich are getting richer?

And that's related the answer to your final point. No unions are striking to lower VAT because they're unions, not political parties. Yes, they have well paid leaders but at heart they're rigorously democratic.

Your doctor can only provide a fit note (formerly a ""sick note"") once your self-certification period has expired. If your employer demands a fit note before this time, they are yet again intimidating you, and therefore not acting in accordance with the law.

Your doctor *may* be willing to sign a fit note before your 7 days' self-certification period is up, but may well charge for the privilege.

*Custard*  
1 cup milk or cream  
1 egg  
1 egg yolk (set the white aside for the cod wash)  
1/2 tsp ground mustard seed  
1/4 tsp paprika  
1/4 tsp white pepper  
1 tsp dried dill  
1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce  
  
Preheat oven to 300 F. Arrange 2-3 ramekins in a baking dish at least half as tall as the ramekins. Bring the milk to a low simmer and add the dill. Whisk briefly to combine. Whisk the eggs and remaining spices, along with salt and pepper to taste. Slowly whisk the egg mixture into the milk, and continue slowly stirring for one minute. Whisk in the Worcestershire and remove from the heat. Pour the mixture into the ramekins about halfway. Fill the baking dish with hot tap water at or slightly above the level of the egg mixture. Bake 30-40 minutes until set. Remove and let cool in the water bath. Optionally, refrigerate for about 2 hours to fully chill.  
  
*Fish Fingers*  
1 filet of Pacific cod  
1 cup panko bread crumbs  
1/2 cup AP flour  
Scant 1/4 tsp baking powder  
salt &amp; pepper to taste  
1 egg white (see above)  
1/2 cup milk  
Oil for frying  
  
Rinse and pat dry your cod, then cut into 1/2"" thick strips. The cod will plump as it cooks, so cut your strips longer than you want the finished product to be. Whisk the egg and milk, season, and add the cod strips to soak for about 20 minutes. In the meantime, combine the dry ingredients and any seasoning you prefer (I think simple is better), and set in a shallow dish or plate in a uniform layer. Add about a half inch of oil to a fry pan or cast iron skillet, and heat to about 350 F. Once the oil is hot, also prepare a wire rack and paper towels to wick the oil from the finished fish fingers. Remove all the cod from the wash, and working with a wet hand and a dry hand, dredge the cod pieces in the dry mixture, then re-dip in the wet, then back to the dry. After the final dry coat, move immediately to the oil. Fry each side for about 2 minutes, until golden brown. Once each side has been browned, move to the wire rack to cool. Serve warm with savory custard and wait for the Doctor to show up.

Are you kidding me?  Ramires and Lampard's minutes this season have only been at CM with a minor exception or two for Ramires moving to right flank.  Oscar/Luiz, I won't agree with you but I also won't argue, they are obviously cover guys as I said.  

None of the the players you mention are actually better than Ramirez in the box-to-box mold.  We probably could use a deep lying playmaker a tactical alternative but are any of these players that type?  Of the players mentioned, only the Bender brothers and Ilkay Gündogan are really in form but all are defensive oriented which means they compete with Mikel more than Ramirez.  Notably they all played poorly in their European league experiences this season except for Lars who was outstanding in Europa.  Notably Ramirez was approaching world class this year in his Champions league appearances (7.55 over six matches).  Long story short, they all seem like backups to Mikel.

Note:  I can't really get a read on Manuel Fernandes since he is in a Turkish league but he does seem to score goals from defensive mid.

On my first viewing it really didn't sink in for me, the ending seemed rushed and it totally went over my head. I thought the last 20 minutes were really random and had nothing to do with what previously happened in the episode - so I was disappointed...

...But once I realised just what that whole thing was about (with the DVD and those two dodgy ""cops""), I enjoyed it much more. It had everything a usual Creek episode had, and on top of that it had the awesome ""oh shit he's getting his coat, now we're cooking"" moment that I literally grinned at on both viewings.

It really didn't need to be so long though, and hour would have been perfect. Too much filler in my opinion - and we could have done without the school girl bits. I felt they didn't add anything at all other than to fumble together a reason for the daughter to lie to her mother.

The bit with the cops at the end (especially the bit with the screen on the wheelchair) was really daft, a bit TOO daft even for Creek, but I let it slide cause the whole episode seemed like a bit of a caper and some mystery shows take themselves so seriously they end up looking ridiculous anyway.

3. Coping with physical, direct teams such as Stoke and West Brom.

4. Capitalizing on our own set pieces. 

We have some of the most impressive stats in Europe when it comes to possession, shots on target, chances created, passes completed.  That is an identity of this team I am happy about and hope continues.

1. Yep. This seems to always be the case.
2. Sure, a strong back four is good.
3. The key to combating these teams with possession is through good ball retention in midfield.
4. Of course! They're opportunities to score.

What I'm trying to say is shoring up our defense comes in many ways, but it can definitely come from stronger possession play. Look at how teams with smaller players, like Barca, deal when faced against more physical teams--they make sure they can't see any of the ball. Players like Iniesta, Xavi, etc, wouldn't be considered very physical. But they don't need to be in that system.

Obviously we aren't Barcelona, but we can look at other sides that play possession based football and see how they cope with pressure. Sure, a physical presence in midfield helps, but even more so is composure on the ball and better ball retention skills. I would agree that we need to get another strong CB from somewhere, be it our own ranks or transfers. And I would say it's good to have backup for Lucas. But I don't think more emphasis on physical presence is the bets way to increase our midfield quality.

&gt; On the morning of June 21, 2009, during the 2009 Iranian Election Protests, Bahari was arrested at his family's home in Tehran and taken to Evin Prison.[13] In July, while incarcerated, he appeared [14] in a televised confession (broadcast internationally by PressTV[15]) telling his interviewer that Western journalists worked as spies;[16] that he had covered ""illegal demonstrations"" and ""illegal gatherings"", and was helping promote a ""colour revolution"" (i.e. peaceful, democratic regime-change).",0,1365029359,null,0,1365029595,0,c97ytvk,t3_1blzvy,t1_c97ytvk,t1_c97vypz,null,1431682618,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"You say obviously we aren't Barcelona, but your whole argument is based on the example they present.  They also play in La Liga, which is not as direct or as physically demanding as the Premier league.  ""Composure"" and ""Coping with pressure"" is not something I said we need to address.  We are calm in possession and have grown more confident with the ball as the season wore on.  Hopefully the growing pains, such as Skrtel's backpass vs City are over.  


What has been CONSTANT is our inability to deal with set pieces and physical fowards.   It's convenient that you mention Barca, because when Puyol is out, Piqué  is their only true aerial presence at the back and defending set pieces HAS been a weakness and concern for them as well.  They've conceded more goals than Real Madrid but make up for it by scoring in droves. 

 I don't think we can count on scoring 100 goals a season like Barcelona but scoring is clearly our strength at this point in the season.  The only team to have scored more than us is Man United and i'd be surprised if many teams in Europe can match our scoring form since the winter break. 


Furthermore, when I see stats about how we have the most goals from open play, or the most chances created, or the most shots on target, it truly makes me ponder this team's potential.  **It is exciting, and i'm optimistic.**  But if we are so world class from open play, what is the great leveler?  Clearly it is set pieces, converting corner kicks and long free kicks.  These statistics lead me to believe that our problems on each side of the pitch are symptoms of a lack of physicality and aerial presence. 


I AM open to the idea that a physical midfielder isn't the ONLY solution... Maybe a new defensive coach is called for.  Or simply more time spent focusing on our defensive shape during training.

1) No closed shop - as above, by G_Morgan.

2) No sympathetic strikes - e.g. the firefighters can't strike to show support for the coal miners - the firefighters must have a grievance against their employers.

3) Strikes must be validated by a private vote - so you can't pack a meeting hall with pro-strike folk to pressure unaggrieved workers to vote for the strike. If the strike isn't validated the union funds may be seized.

This was what my econ/politics teacher taught anyway, I've not wiki'd it.

Personally, after the farce in 2011, I'd add one more: ""more than 50% of union members must vote in favor of a strike for the strike to be valid.""

Unions could, if they wish, introduce compulsory voting rules to help this. In 2011 I looked at the stats. Only 2 unions (the physiotherapist unions, I think) actually had &gt;50% of members making the positive decision to strike. This was 12,000 workers out of 2.2 million strikers.

With him we were able to get an established name and he was able to sign some stars. However, I think he fell victim to a common trait (especially among mid-table quality managers) in that he brought in players (Santa Cruz) for personal history rather than quality. I realize that some players need to be brought in if only to give the club more appeal to the next level of signings; however, even given City's situation he could have gotten a better bang for our buck. 

On a more personal note, I was against his firing to a certain extent in that I felt like we began to follow more of Madrid style of club policy. I really enjoyed how City felt like the ultimate English club under Hughes, and I liked seeing characters like Bellamy flying down our wings. Mancini changed much of that. However, i now really like Roberto and I don't think we would be where we are today were it not for signing many international superstars.

4-3-3 would require a lot of passing especially from the middle three, we can count Ramires out and possibly Lampard just by his age and his tendencies to bomb forward when it isn't necessary at the time.

Ramires - Mikel / Luiz - KdB

Hazard - Ba - Mata

However, using Mata and Hazard as wingers who need to spread out the play completely make them ineffective in the sense that their attacking talents of going in centrally is gone (albeit this depends how far they're spread)

I'd moved into recruitment with a basic stipend, but it still wasn't enough to live on even with the provided accommodation, and I was travelling the country alone, rarely in one place for more than two weeks.

I exhausted my meager savings and my overdraft over three months before turning to the state. Over the eight months in total I was unemployed, I applied for more than 250 different postings, from shop assistant to middle-management in office settings. I have decent A-levels, but no degree. Even so, of all those applications I received one interview, for a job I was offered working in the NHS as a healthcare assistant. 

During my time unemployed, I had nothing. Following bills, I had just enough to eat a minimally healthy diet, and that was it. My time away from my home city had diluted my circle of friends - educated people with lives and responsibilities of their own. I had no means to engage in a majority of cultural pursuits, and the bizarre rules of the DWP meant I couldn't even fill my time with charity work - an avenue to sanity and further and continuing experience of the sort hiring manager look favorably on. I should know - that's what I did before. 

During my time, I became reliant on visits to my GP every two weeks. I've suffered from depression before, and was worried about the same happening again. It was an awful time before, and I have no desire to live anything like the time I did then. Having someone to talk to, if even for a moment, helped me more than I can say.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;4-3-3 would require a lot of passing especially from the middle three, we can count Ramires out and possibly Lampard just by his age and his tendencies to bomb forward

A 4-2-3-1 doesn't require any less passing, and it actually puts the burden on two players rather than three. It is much more difficult to control the midfield with just two players. It requires very complete holding midfielders, and we don't even have one of those.  

Also doesn't have to be a 4-3-3. You can play 2-3 attacking midfielders and still have a three man midfield. Carlo Ancelotti did it at [Milan](http://www.zonalmarking.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/new-milan.jpg) and put together one of the best teams in the last 15 years.

I don't see how you can count Lampard and Ramires out of a 4-3-3. Those two players who are perfectly suited to a 4-3-3. It's also where both of them have had the most success.

&gt;However, using Mata and Hazard as wingers who need to spread out the play completely make them ineffective in the sense that their attacking talents of going in centrally is gone 

Not necessarily. You can find a handful of Spanish and Italian teams, and PSG as well, who play a three in midfield with the wide players tucked in centrally. Looks similar to a 4321. Here is a [an example](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/02/20/psg-2-2-montpellier-tactics/). [Brazil](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2010/01/28/teams-of-the-decade-12-brazil-2002/) used to play similar to this as well, but with some variation. Granted they had ridiculously good fullbacks.

Lastly, the second lineup you post has plenty issues. First, I'm really not a fan of Cahill and Ivanovic playing together very much but that's beside the point. Second the midfield still looks weak and unbalanced, just as it has all season. Trying to play a double pivot when we only have 1 holding midfielder and very little depth of true central/holding midfielders is is going to lead to issues. I'm also not as confident as you that KDB could just jump right into a double pivot. The only time he has played in a true 2 man midfield was back in Belgium His defensive game isn't yet up to premier league standard.

I suspect the opposition was this stuff:

&gt; June O’Brien is a 50-year-old business development manager for a property company. She has stayed at her home in Drum Brae Avenue, which is next to the proposed site, for seven years.

&gt; She fears a new park will bring a return to the days when the site was a school.

&gt; “We had nothing but vandalism to the point the police were never away from here,” she argues. “People used to use drugs. There were syringes, drugs, condoms. What a mess it was.”

&gt; June says people would leave a nearby pub, which has since closed, or take a carry out of alcohol from the local supermarket into the park.

&gt; Since the area has been fenced up in the past two years while work on the new care home took place, she says the problem has gone away.

&gt; June contends: “It will just get wrecked, there is no respect. We had our cars smashed up and it will be the same again. They will destroy that park, there is no question. It will be trashed, not by the kids, but by thugs.”

&gt; June’s neighbour in Drum Brae Avenue is 91-year-old Constance Foster. A former postal worker, she has lived in her house since 1960.

&gt; “Why does it have to be here?,” she asks. “It won’t do any harm, but surely they don’t need all these other places. There are enough parks, even the flats have got some green space around them.”

Can't imagine why they've dropped part of the farm's name, mind you.. I mean ""Buttercup Poultry Farm Park"" would sound just as nice, wouldn't it .. oh yeah, no, it wouldn't at all. :D",0,1365036481,null,0,false,0,c981alt,t3_1blc6h,t1_c981alt,t1_c97u8dc,null,1431681456,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

Surely the more obvious way solution to the issue is for British teams to compete in (online) international competitions? There are plenty out there or varying prestige and competitive levels with open qualifiers (4PL, The Defense qualifiers, SLTV AM/Semi/Pro/Star Series etc.). Maybe some UK teams have taken part in some of these competitions already but I would presume none have got very far. And yet until someone starts making some international waves there is little to attract foreign teams of any note to participate in any show matches with British teams.

Your employer has a reasonable duty of care for your safety and cannot pressure you to return if you are not fit for work, also they should not be able to pressure or force you to do work that puts you at risk of further injury as there maybe a likelihood they will be open to legal redress. 

Please note that if your GP has signed you as not fit and it is within this period you will need to get him to issue a fit for work certificate otherwise you will not be covered by your employers insurance.

true,LaurenceP95,null,null,"Alright mate, i'm living in west cumbria and i go to carlisle hospital in Cumbria, the basic things you need to understand is that your treatment relates to how ill you are, if you have mild symptoms(same as me) they are going to be much less interested in helping you out, if you were shitting your guts out 10x a day they'd be right on your case, it's just the way it goes.

count yourself lucky it's mild, and you aren't being considered for surgery steroids or immunosuppressants, however i find some doctors are more useful than others, for instance every time i went to see my main consultant they would just sort of tell me 'you're getting better, keep taking you're tablets' which i found frustrating.

But just yesterday when i went to the doctors but my consultant wasn't there but their intern was and they got me into an iron infusion to help with my anemia as iron tablets were not helping me out. and i am not sure if i had had my regular consultant that anything would of happened

Another thing to consider is that the NHS isn't loaded, some treatments will cost more than others, so naturally worse off people will get more expensive treatments, and it is worth researching about what treatments are available and weather you could think they could help you, and talk to your consultant about them.

Chelsea can take a leaf out of Clark’s book and start off by using Lukaku as a game-changing substitute, after starting with Ba in crucial games and occasionally with Torres, whenever the Senegalese striker needs a breather. The Belgian can even be deployed in cup games and lesser league games from the start. Such faith and thereby regular minutes at Chelsea can do wonders for Lukaku’s self-belief and who knows, he may *(and in spudboyblues' personal opinion, probably will, based on this season)* just grab the opportunity by the scruff of its neck and establish himself as a definite starter in the first team by the time the season nears its business end.",0,1365038010,null,0,false,0,c981tei,t3_1blpen,t1_c981tei,t3_1blpen,null,1431681211,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2
true,[deleted],null,null,"Least dispensable: Baines, Mirallas, Distin, Osman

Most dispensable: Neville

Honourable mention: Fellaini

For me Leighton Baines is the most important player in our squad. He is a key part of our attack as well as our defence and as a LB he is matched only by the likes of Jordi Alba and Phillipp Lahm (Mostly a RB, but equally adept LB). He always puts in 110% and is a great team player. Mirallas is one of our best player currently, and I would love to see his impact next season, which will hopefully be injury free for our Belgian Ronaldo. For his age, Distin is one of the best CBs in England. He is a great servant for the club and a rock in defence. Osman is what Neville should be, solid in midfield and a capable leader. I don't deny that he makes the odd mistake but he often makes up for it with the odd great goal and fantastic work rate.

Neville is well past it. I appreciate what he's done for the club but he no longer has the fitness required of the toughest league in the world and makes far too many mistakes. He has become a liability and there are many options I would pick over him. That being said, I do not want him to leave the club. His blood runs blue and I think he would make an excellent addition to the coaching staff, with perhaps a view to go into management later in his career.

As for Fellaini...

No-one can deny that he is an excellent player. If his attitude matched his undoubted skill he would be my favourite. But he is clearly of the opninion that he is too big for little ol' Everton and I honestly think we'll be seeing him in different colours next season. I have only this to say to him: Thanks for the fun times Fellaini, looking forward to seeing what Moyes buys with the cash we get for you.

Speaking of Moyes, I know you said 'players' but I cannot imagine us without him. So many Evertonians call for his dismissal but they too easily forget where we were before he took over. Moyes has taken us as far as anyone can in the league with our budget, he has to stay so he can keep us here.",0,1365038045,null,0,false,0,c981ttx,t3_1bluxs,t1_c981ttx,t3_1bluxs,null,1431681205,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

You both hit the nail on the head: Neville needs to go. His recent form in the past two years really just makes me more and more frustrated with him and less and less aware of the work and dedication he has put into the club. It's quite sad. Neville has said he'd like to go the Edgar Davids route, which I honestly don't even know how effective he'd be in that level of play. Still too physical for him, but slower.

I would love Moyes to stay, although during the Dortmund game today I couldn't help but think what if we took part in the first managerial swap for Klopp?

I agree that Heitinga can and should leave, he's played decent but there are enough clubs who want to enlist his services that we could get a nice bang for our buck for the lad. 

Also when I was talking about people out on loan, I should address that Gueye has no business being even on our reserves. We don't have that many outside players but for me Naismith can and will do better, it depends on where he plays. I know Jelavic can pick it up and hopefully Naisy will help that happen? It's not there right now though and probably not this season.

I think that our lack of options shifting our starting formation could prove beneficial in trying to switch our style of play a little, even though we scraped by Stoke I think it was effective against those goons. 

As for Fellaini, we're going to be able to buy 2-3 solid and viable starting options, assuming we get full discretion of those fees. ",0,1365047682,null,0,false,0,c9857uv,t3_1bluxs,t1_c9857uv,t3_1bluxs,null,1431679608,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

Formations we've used this season:

4-3-3 almost every game in the first part of the season, except for when we went 3-5-2 in the second half at goodison. Also played 4-3-3 at Wigan and Villa more recently. I'd have thought we've used this &gt;60% of the time.

4-4-2 in a few games this year with sturridge and suarez up front. 
4-2-3-1 at arsenal.
4-2-4 against swansea, spurs ... and oldham and southampton.

The three above formations are all variations on the same thing but I think the differences are clear enough to separate them. The 4-4-2 is quite oldstyle, with both forwards high up, Downing staying wide and Henderson tucking in. In the 4-2-3-1 downing, Henderson, Suarez were all deeper than Sturridge with Downing and Suarez staying quite wide. The 4-2-4 the 4 attacking players all played incredibly high up the pitch.

It's also worth noting we've varied our tactics more since January. In some games we've been happy to let the opposition have possession and draw them onto us. Arsenal was the obvious example, but also to an extent against Spurs, Wigan (and southampton? not sure what the plan was there?).

The reason for this is that if you're involved in a side-swipe, you're pretty likely to walk away - side swipes being fairly low speed and all. Even if it misses the main body of the car and just hits the front. However, the steering will take the brunt of the hit and whip the wheel round, thus breaking your thumbs.

true,Draxton,null,null,"&gt;1) Smaller houses are available. The Council will even give you a deposit and pay for private rented. This argument doesn't fly. Furthermore, single people should do what everyone else does and houseshare.

No:
&gt;Research by the NHF says that while there are currently 180,000 households that are ""underoccupying two-bedroom homes"", there are far fewer smaller properties in the social housing sector available to move into. Last year only 85,000 one-bedroom homes became available.

or

&gt;If those people do choose to move there are simply not enough smaller social homes available for all 660,000 households affected by the bedroom tax to move to

etc. There's a lack of smaller social houses. The council does not have a unlimited source of money, private renting is still reliant on there *being* smaller houses to put all these people in, it completely ignores moving all these people into private would inevitably raise rent prices.

I like how on one hand, you advocate moving people out of their homes so other families can live there and on the other you're advocating just shoving a load of single people together. Like if you're single, you deserve to be treated worse.

&gt;2) Disabled people are uninfected. Furthermore very few conditions require a second bedroom.

Nope:

&gt;National Housing Federation figures released earlier this month showed that 230,000 disability living allowance (DLA) claimants would lose an average of £728 per year in housing benefit as a result of the new regulation.

Though there is apparently now a lawsuit over it, so I guess we'll see how that goes.

&gt;3) Weekend parents etc - private sector renters have this problem, why should the state provide you with something others can't afford?

Private sector parents have the problem of suddenly being unable to house their child at the weekend? Well yes, perhaps it affects a few parents on occasion, but not on this scale. This isn't asking the government to allow them to do it, this is taking away something that was already existing.

Housesharing won't kill you btw - I houseshared for years. Most people I know who are not coupled up houseshare. It's just *normal*. Especially in cities. Maybe that's because none of them are supported by the state? Probably.

Also, you are ignoring my point about moving into private rented. Yep there is not enough COUNCIL housing. That's also another story. Moving people into HB sponsored private housing is a good way of picking up the slack. Considering how expensive it is to house large families in B&amp;B's and hotels, the costs equal out and make it fairer for everyone.

You could also, you know, *gasp*, try moving areas - like most people. Can't afford city/town/village x? There's always a cheaper one 20 mins away. Again, this is *normal* and called 'being a responsible adult'.

As government spending increased, politicians started raising taxes not for wars, but for domestic spending, and the notion of the Crown Estate funding expenditure from its own resources became increasingly untennable.

The deal between the crown and the government to hand over the Estate in exchange for a stipend was frankly nothing more that a tidying up of a long existing arrangement -- albeit conveniently timed.

However, having cleared up your slightly simplified understanding of the function of the Estate -- I am still curious as to why you wrote it in the first place.

We do not need a complete overhaul of our nuclear weapons to protect us from tururists, North Korea OR the French. 

What we do need at this stage is more money going to the public in some way that frees their wallets up a little so that we can kick start the economy again.

There is no country that has ever used their nuke arsenal since the US bombed Japan and the only deterrent caused by nukes is the realisation that whoever actually uses them will become a smear left on the ground shortly after by every other country.

There are a couple of problems:
Any semblance of local representation is destroyed by party whips. ""It doesn't matter what you think will be best for your constituents - you are voting with the party.""

(2) North Korea have no nuclear missiles. They have the capacity to make a nuclear bomb, but analysts believe each bomb is probably about the size of a transit van. That makes it way too big to attach to any missile, the only way they could realistically set it off in another country would be to put it on a ship and send it there.

The big risk would be that if the war actually started up again (whether with conventional or nuclear armaments) the global financial markets would take fright, and economically that's the last thing the world or the UK needs right now.

true,Dead_Ghost,null,null,"Definitely not a stupid question. 

**In terms of danger:**  

Nil. The North Koreans don't have the ballistic capabilities to fire a rocket this far, no one truly believes that they could fire one at Washington either. If they did hit the US then there is a chance of radiation reaching the UK, but I would be surprised if the levels would be high enough to cause damage to ones self.

The US navy has also just deployed their second anti ballistic missile capable ship too, coupled with ground forces it drastically reduces the chances of Korean missiles reaching their targets.

However there is still a real risk of danger to South Korea, especially Seoul, which is in the range for conventional artillery. The main issue here would be economic, S.Korea is one of the biggest economies in that region and most of it comes straight out of Seoul, if that were to go up, the effect on the world economy would be pretty devastating. 

**Politically:**

Well, we were involved in the first Korean war, we sent some 100,000 troops to fight and as full members of the UN Security Council, there is an obligation for involvement (but that doesn't necessarily mean troops on the ground). 

The nature of any conflict would be radically different from the previous engagement, China would be very unlikely to be providing military backing for Korea, it's just not in the best interests of the Chinese government and the direction they're looking to take the country, nor does it fit in with the attitude the Chinese have taken towards N.Korea recently (backing sanctions and publicly condemning the Koreans on their missile and nuclear testing).

Such an engagement would mostly likely involve an international effort such as the ISAF (international Security Assistance Force) currently present in Afghanistan, or direct UN military forces, which again backs the idea UK would serve in some capacity.

The issue here is the risk of a protracted war, if the UK government believed that they could be in/out in a Gadaffi/Libya style, then you may expect to see direct involvement, however the more likely option, if the situation escalated, would be a protracted ground war that the UK government couldn't politically afford, there is also question as to whether the UK military would be capable of assisting in the same way that it did in Iraq/Afghanistan. 

**Side issues**:  

Japan. China will, in all probability, be doing everything it can to prevent a Korean conflict and doing what it can to quickly end any that flare up. However Japan, as an ally of S.Korea could be obligated to help (though i'm not sure quite how their consitution would impact on this matter - they have some 'non aggression' clauses post ww2) their involvement however could flare up other issues in the region regarding territorial disputes, especially those with China. However I see this as an unlikely outcome.

Hope that helps.  
ps. im not an expert on the region/conflict, however I did do some research on the region during University (just over 2 years ago) when studying Politics and International Relations.

true,Raeli,cnty-expat,"Once Leeds, but now Amadora, PT","The thing you have to look at is, who would want to launch a Nuclear attack on us, and why? You're going to come to the answer that it's because of us following around America and doing their bidding. I'm pretty sure that's got to have a negative influence.

I don't really think North Korea would focus their efforts on us, America, at least the west of America is a fair bit closer, easier to hit, and then there's always South Korea (though I'm not sure they would want to nuke there?).

So what else, Iran? Well, fuck knows what is really going on there, and even then, if they actually even do have Nuclear weapons, would they launch them specifically at us, against other targets?

Finally terrorists - maybe they can get somehow, although I'm not sure how likely that is, and then there is the task of safely launching it and so forth, I think if we were to see something like that, it would be focused on America as it would make far more of an ""impact"".

In the future, of course, things may change, but to our little Island, I'm not seeing where the threat specifically to us is. I'd far rather see that money, if it had to be spent, on Anti-Ballistic Missiles or whatever to prevent Nuclear launches from actually hitting us.

I mean, I don't know about you, but if I were to get blown up by a Nuclear attack, Launching a Nuclear attack at the aggressors would give me little solace. Not to mention, at this point, it would already be too late - the damage is done. Think about it, Nuclear missiles or not, if someone is going to attack us, they already know in advance that they are going to get attacked back, and you don't need Nuclear Missiles to devastate an area, so they would be launching, well knowing that they were going to start receiving quite a pounding - thus, anyone stupid enough to launch a Nuclear Missile must already be prepared for death, and effectively committing delayed suicide, and thus, not really care. So Nuclear Missiles or not, it isn't going to stop the insanity of whoever decides they want to launch one. The best defense would be to disable incoming warheads so that we wouldn't be fucked when someone does decide to actually do that. And then they would still be fucked because it's still an act of aggression that would be met with harsh force.

The sad reality is - it's a game exclusively for the Murdochs of the world now. 

As for why the individual journalists do it - it depends on the outlook of why they do the job. Some want fame, others see journalism's success in whether or not a story has an impact (good or bad), others still see success in how 'juicy' a story they can get. Don't get me wrong: i'm all for a murder case - from the emotive description of the crime scene to the courtroom action later - but that's because humans are fascinated by murder, and there's a real public interest in seeing a murdered convicted. There are lot of us out there who see it as a way to uncover scandal, stories of genuine public interest and stories which entertain (but not at the expense of someone else) and *loathe* the editorialisation and spin.

Arguably, it isn't. The US is heading back in the right direction. Germany and France too, ignoring the euro wobbles. Iceland and Scandinavia cruise on.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"The point about debt, though, is about predicted growth, not about a fraction of how wealthy you are. The company that takes on debt to invest in infrastructure will grow faster than the company that does not, therefore you can argue that taking on debt is a good thing. Debt is therefore based on two factors; how much you might grow as a result of the loan and how risky it is that you might fail.

So, of two companies that have the same projected growth, one in a hurricane zone and one in a more predictable climate, the one in the hurricane zone is a more risky investment and so the bank will expect a higher rate of return.

Britain is not ""broke"" in the sense that a person, household or even a business can be broke; this analogy makes no sense and serves to a) simplify and b) confuse the electorate. A government's growth should be thought of in tax returns from industries and households; taxes too high and you strangle the ability to spend money, taxes to low and you're unlikely to claw back the investment fast enough as well as being more vulnerable to risky events.

This comment is completely right that debt should be used to improve infrastructure though, this is probably the best way to get back growth. Also, I think we invest a lot of government time, infrastructure, and political effort in the financial services industry; we also give them massive loans.

Currency markets are extremely risky and extremely volatile.

I expect it will drop suddenly and sharply, as all real currency does, but with increased volatility due to the fact that a bunch of *internet libertarians* are the biggest proponents of this ""underground"" currency, I don't have too much faith in their business ethics.

I've tried to listen to the argument on both sides, and I do agree our welfare state is in a total and unsustainable mess, it's propping up more and more people every day, so it's growing, not shrinking.

But at the same time, if we do tax the living crap out of the rich, it's not going to make much of a dent in the debt, because it's at some gigantanormous figure and growing every day (who said the UK can't have growth?!)

So what to do? Not every country in the world has a welfare system, so you could argue it's not *essential* but getting rid of welfare does not get rid of poor people. It does make them a shit-tonne more desperate, and much more likely to get into unpleasant things to get by. Just look at the favelas in Brazil, or the mass-Kibera slum in Nairobi.

If these places were all to suddenly have a welfare/health system analogous to ours, we would see massive improvement, no doubt, but these slums would still exist.

Not everyone can do well in this world, for whatever reasons (I honestly don't know why)

I don't think the point is about whether IDS can live on £53 or not. I'm pretty-sure he could (let's face it the point here is that lots of people do) but when a multimillionaire pooh-poohs what is a difficult existence it's just a teensy bit disingenuous, and just another soundbite in added to the anti poor/disabled slant (by slant I mean all-out enslaught) against people who for the vast, vast majority, do not want to be in that situation.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"The nuclear deterrant is a brilliant thing... but I'm not sure the situation in North Korea is really relevant since it isn't us that's been threatened. If war broke out on the Korean Peninsula, i'm not even sure we would be involved.

Having said that I think Trident is a brilliant thing. I can see why the cost may seem rediculous but the Government have clearly weighed up the options and reached the conclusion Trident offers the best value for money.

* An air-launched option would severely limit the scope of the deterrant. We will only posess at most 107 Typhoons and 48 F35-B Lightning IIs, and at any time half of those will probably be unavailable for maintaince or be deployed elsewhere... air launched deterrants are also significantly constrained by range. And given these new anti-ICBM interceptors (like the THAAD system) it also means you would probably need to do a 'saturation' attack with dozens of warheads to garuntee one will go off. That is where Trident is great since each missile can carry something like 8 warheads.

* A ground based system is even more limited, since the location of any fixed silo will become public knowledge before long. I expect the infrastructure cost of building silos or an effective ground based launcher would be incredibly high - and wouldn't offer anywhere near the ability Trident has.

My bug-bear in the trident discussion is the ultimately left-wing ""nuclear is badddddd"" line that seems to get trotted out without any real consideration. In the 60 odd years since Hiroshima, the world hasn't been at peace - but we haven't seen a major war between two world powers. Nuclear weapons are probably the only reason western Europe isn't speaking Russian right now. Nuclear weapons are, as I see it, the perfect weapon... because they are the weapon you never have to use. Simply posessing one makes the smallest country as powerful as the largest superpower. That is why the N.Koreans and Iranians want them so badly at the end of the day.

The failure of the current tories is that they've implemented some morally questionable money savings tactis - which have worked *however* there is no growth from the economy. Leading to stagnation and a painful era. 

Without economic growth we either need to abandon the capitalist model: close borders, cut down meat consumption, return to a more sustainable economic model (which will never happen).

Or we need economic growth.

true,Arkyl,null,null,"This is fairly misleading for several reasons:

Firstly, the idea that debt as a percentage of GDP is not high. The evidence used to claim that is to compare the debt to historic levels and there's good reason why that's stupid. Firstly, the majority of the 20th century we were in high levels of debt but this is almost entirely due to two world wars, on top of that, those were followed by *rationing*. So sure, we aren't bankrupt but do we want to get to the point of rationing? No. Second we can compare ourselves to the 19th century. As you may notice, we're no longer travelling by horse, adhering to the gold standard or fighting wars with cavalry. Okay, maybe the gold standards the most important of those in this context. Debt has a very different meaning now that the entire monetary system has changed along with the removal of the Gold standard and various other changes in how we treat money. 


Now don't get me wrong, I don't completely disagree with the article. We're not completely broke, but if you look at the [recent figures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UK_GDP.png), you can see that debt has been going up as a percentage of GDP *during growth*. Fine, we aren't in an awful position but the point is the *structural deficit* is a problem. If we don't reduce it we'll go bankrupt no matter what growth we have because even in our boom years our dept was growing faster than GDP. What that essentially means is that even when we were earning alot we were spending more. 


This breaks the problem down into two parts then: 1) We can't afford the structural deficit we have. 2) We can afford to borrow more money right now. 


The answer is large infrastructure building policies that produce growth but don't commit us to further expenditure. This has been happening to some extent, but maybe not enough. The reason it hasn't been happening enough is political, this is a nuanced topic which makes it difficult to sell as policy, try explaining to a child why they can't have that £6.99 weekly subscription to that model car building magazine while you spend £35 000 on a new car.",0,1365072081,null,0,false,0,c989rwo,t3_1bnf3w,t1_c989rwo,t3_1bnf3w,null,1431677390,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Usually people that attack other people do so because they are provoked in some way, either verbally or through actions. That's what happens. And violence isn't the correct thing to do in these cases but it can be seen as a reaction to specific events.

Some people are just horrible cunts and they go around looking for pretexts upon which to be provoked. These people will take against other people for no good reason. For the colour of their skin or their sexuality or their haircut, things that cannot reasonably be considered provocation.

So in a very real sense hate crimes is the category we make up for people that attack other people for the fun of it.

Furthermore the low interest rates are the result of QE, not the fiscal austerity plan. The problem therefore is that low interest rates will only continue as long as QE does. When QE is reversed and the bank of england sells government debt back to the private sector, the price of these bonds will slump, increasing the yield the government must pay on any new debt-financed spending. This means that the deficit will get harder to pay off, as the interest payments will rise. Therefore the current government is committed to reducing the deficit as much as possible before this happens. Any spending now would make this more difficult to achieve.

People forget that the fact that the UK government has a deficit means that the government is already spending more than it receives in taxes. It is already providing a ""boost"" to the economy. It is just that it is decreasing the size on that ""boost"".

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; I don't think the volatility of an industry should equate to high tax - you just need a solid set of laws which stops them from being so risky. The idea of punishing a whole industry when not everyone makes errors is ridiculous. I agree tax breaks for certain industries is a good idea - it's my understanding that has worked, and kept, for example, film production jobs in the UK.

Risk isn't about errors though; risk is about the relative likely hood that something goes wrong. Film is actually a great example of a low risk venture, it is really really difficult to make a loss on a film after cinema, DVD sales, promotions, product placements... For example, even the movie John Carter, which was a huge investment and a huge flop, made back its money at the box office.

High street banks turned investment banks on the other hand, are supposed to be the very experts at managing risk. In the past they didn't have complex models, they just looked someone in the eye before giving them a loan, a mortgage or bothered to understand their business before investing. These days they just plug the numbers into a spreadsheet based on mean and variance of value and plug derivatives into a Black Scholes formula assuming normal distributions of risk. This can make you rich, it can also make you poor, but this is the nature of the game.

This turns out to be an extremely risky business and one in which the tax payer has to suffer if they loose out; therefore, any investment we make into this business should be clawed back through a higher rate of return than the relatively safe creative industries. A financial transaction tax is actually perfect for this as it allows us to track investments, making unregulated bets very hard to choose. So we're open for business, but do we want this business to grow too fast and far away when we are clawing back taxes far slower? The banks sure as hell wouldn't lower their interest for more risky ventures, why should the state?

I do and IDS does. You think people are helped by giving them larger and larger amounts to live off *without* working? How much dignity does a person have without working? worse still - what does that teach their children?

how is the long term health of the millions of benefit-funded alcoholics? what about the prospects of the Philpotts? were they helped by the state handouts? do you think they'd thank you from the inside of their cells for offering them more money for more kids?

Here in the UK, prison is seen as part punishment and part removing a person from society until they are safe.

In theory, any person can be rehabilitated - and indeed, released murderers have a vastly lower rate of re-offending than most criminals.

In that situation, what is the benefit of a ""life for a life"" type sentence, other than vindictive punishment that also affects the innocent family of the jailed person?

In this situation, I highly doubt he will be released simply because his previous behaviour suggests rehabilitation wont be possible - but for the majority of murderers, rehabilitation is not just possible, but indeed is the usual outcome.

Paying bills? Of course he is, the only thing the government pays for is rent, and not all of that. (Depends on the precise circumstances what they pay for of course, I know nothing of his situation to say if they pay all of his or not)

&gt; how many fridges do you buy a week?

Less than 2% of a one, but at the point where you need a replacement you have to either gather up the money all at once or work out some sort of financing deal that ends with you paying much more than the cost of the fridge in total.

Either way you need a fridge freezer or you cannot store food long term, which means you can't make use of the bulk deals for buying many foods at supermarket sales prices, not to mention higher travel costs if you end up making more trips.

&gt; I was wondering how long it would take for this to turn up.

You only have yourself to blame for that one. ""Alive and functioning""? Christ, what an attitude to take to a guy that's clearly working his ass of and is still making peanuts.

&gt;  You think people are helped by giving them larger and larger amounts to live off without working? 

This dude is working.

Even for those that are not, the problem there lies with there being more workers than work. All but a tiny minority would be glad of even a minimum wage job stacking shelves or whatever.

Driving people on benfits deeper into poverty does nothing to help them get work, and actively makes it harder in some small ways. What does that teach Children?

&gt; how is the long term health of the millions of benefit-funded alcoholics? what about the prospects of the Philpotts? were they helped by the state handouts? do you think they'd thank you from the inside of their cells for offering them more money for more kids?

Any criminality from the Philpotts is irrelevant to this topic. Reckless negligence is not caused by the welfare system. Nor is alcoholism, for which medical help is the best bet, not homelessness. You can claim that the state enables it to a degree, in the same sense that you can claim that soup kitchens enable homelessness.

This requires there to be jobs. Increasingly there are not going to be jobs. We need to start accepting as a society that there are other ways to contribute other than making money for someone else. 

The idea of a citizen's income is being floated around the place and I think that could be worth investigation. If you think about the bureaucracy that is involved in assessing benefits then that could be done away with so then the additional public money that goes into MP's finding different ways to arrange benefits could be done away with. People not struggling to get by and jump through hoops for the Benefits system could go back into education or learn a new skill, a new language, volunteer in their local community or provide childcare for family member who do work in paid employment.

If we started thinking of paying our citizens all a basic living wage that covered your survival with enough left over to cover emergencies without struggling then we could talk about harnessing the power of those people not working on a voluntary basis in a way that could economically benefit everyone.

People forget that the bad loans that started all this were originated in the States. It is the fault of rating agencies mis-rating the bundled up mortgages that meant that UK Investment banks bought them. Then, because the investment banks were linked to normal retail banks, we had to bail them out. Basel III increases requirements so that banks can afford to take a bigger hit, and lower liquidity. Ring-fencing means that investment banks can go bust without needing to affect small savers. All in all, a much safer system that doesn't require bailouts. The only thing left to deal with is the rating agencies. Hopefully people will just trust them less and pay them less.

It is a bad state of affairs when the government has to ""pick winners"" and ""pick losers"" by altering tax rates for industries. Inevitably it would result in firms simply seeking legal advice and reclassifying themselves out of the taxes, or moving their HQ overseas.

true,Interceptor,null,null,"I've been thinking about this, and it has some pretty interesting ramifications. Subcultures are for the most part born from teenage unrest and rebellion (before you start, I'm a metalhead, have been for the past 25 years), so this essentially takes away the reason for these subcultures to exist. These subs define themselves as being different to the norm. 

Aside from liking the music, what's the reason to be in a subculture? 

There is none (unless you want to suggest that the 'most metal' person is the one wearing the blackest T-Shirt', in which case you're completely missing the point). 

It's to identify yourself with something other than the mainstream. Subcultures essentially 'perform' to other members of that subculture - extreme metal is too much for most people to handle all day, every day. I probably wouldn't get promoted if I turned up to my review covered in spikes and blood., but should I choose to go to a gig I can wear this and do so in a moderated/safe environment. 

Most people dress that way to provoke some sort of reaction, to nail their colours to a flag, or to express their burgeoning sense of self-identity. This is why hundreds of teeneage goths get in your bloody way every time you emerge from Camden tube station - they're trying to freak you out.They are, for want of a better word - posing.

Now the reaction has been taken away, so why bother? (Incidentally, I don't really bother wearing my 'metal uniform' any more, I'm happy just to like the music on it's own terms). 

Rather than protect people from abuse, this is in many ways proscribing teenage rebellion, which gives it an altogether more sinister effect. Personally I've always thought that abusing someone for their musical taste/cultural interests is akin to laughing at someone with a weird hat on - stupid and pointless. Without wanting to sound all ""Hey man, can't we all just get along"", you shouldn't be abusing people on these grounds because it's inherently wrong, not because it's against the law.

true,Feint1,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Usually people that attack other people do so because they are provoked in some way, either verbally or through actions. That's what happens. And violence isn't the correct thing to do in these cases but it can be seen as a reaction to specific events.

&gt;Some people are just horrible cunts and they go around looking for pretexts upon which to be provoked. These people will take against other people for no good reason. For the colour of their skin or their sexuality or their haircut, things that cannot reasonably be considered provocation.

I don't disagree with any of that. But I don't see why laws should be so specific. Any court would take aggravating factors into account, so you wouldn't have all cases of assault treated in the same way.

Joking aside, if we have approached Brighton over Poyet, it at least shows a level of ambition that we haven't seen from GFH. Poyet has a reported buyout clause of £2.5m which has to be known by GFH, so perhaps there is money potentially available. I had considered that they were unwilling to release funds to Warnock because of the uncertainty regarding his future at the club, and the position we were in after the takeover finally went through, so perhaps we will see some of that in the summer.

The risk of not getting Poyet, and missing out on currently available managers, is in my opinion worthwhile. There are always managers available after the managerial merry-go-round starts up again. Whilst I personally believe that McDermott would be a good choice, I don't believe we will get O'Neill (nor am I sure that we should even try, the talent he showed in his early career seems to have fizzled out somewhat), and I think we all know that the success we had in ""that"" season in League 1 was down to Poyet and not Wise.",0,1365076010,null,0,false,0,c98aaej,t3_1bnjcs,t1_c98aaej,t1_c98a4up,null,1431677147,4,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,4

&gt; Savings assume that you have money left over to save, but they're easily eaten into by such small emergencies and are hardly guaranteed to suffice at any given moment.

nothing is guaranteed to suffice. welcome to the world. the point is that even on a small income you can save for things. 

&gt; Ah, so you're saying don't strive, just accept the first minwage job you find. 

strive at the first minwage job you find. don't waste your time on something that clearly isn't working. 

&gt; Somewhat contradicts the message given by the torys, who have spent a lot of effort trying to get people to do the opposite.

how/what/where? the tories are trying to get people to strive doing work that doesn't pay?

w.t.f. you do realise you can change job without going on the dole? do you realise that employers add staff as business improves? 

&gt; You're claiming that those who are unemployed are, by and large, so by choice and could be working if they wanted to be? That's a pretty ridiculous and bold claim.

yes that's exactly what I'm saying. oh wait, no, I never said anything like that. please check back. 

&gt; Sure. Less money = more in poverty. QED

what's the 'less money'? what particular change in the budget are you referring to? how much less money? who is affected? how do you define poverty? 

&gt; No, that one is a binary. Regardless, the point stands that your definition of ""enabling"" is a stretch.

enabling; ""Give (someone or something) the authority or means to do something.""

&gt; Reducing benefits makes people using benefits in a worse position. Does nothing to create jobs, does a small amount to reduce jobs by reducing consumer demand to a small degree.

Book tickets 12 weeks in advance to get the cheapest tickets.  Buy from East Coast which doesn't charge a booking fee or credit card fee.  Booking 6pm the night before can still be cheaper than buying on the day of travel.

Split ticketing.  E.g. a train from London to Penzance is £250.  If you split your tickets London to Plymouth, Plymouth to Penzance (and the same return), the cost is about £50.

You can buy season tickets for a short period of time.

A carnet of tickets may be useful for people who only commute a few days out of the week.  For example, you can buy 12 tickets for the price of 10.  Check the conditions of the ticket as some can only be used at certain stations or at certain times.

Always buy your season ticket before the price rise, in December.

If your train is late, be sure to apply for refund/discount, but different train companies have different policies (e.g. First Capital Connect, if it's more than 30 min late, you can apply to get 50% back; if more than 1 hour late, you can get a full refund).

Group save tickets, e.g. get 4 adult tickets for the price of 2, if everyone is travelling at the same time, route, etc.

true,redem,null,null,"&gt; the details are here. the working tax credit would add £50 a week. so now we're on £103?

If it's cash in hand, sure.

&gt; nothing is guaranteed to suffice. welcome to the world. the point is that even on a small income you can save for things.

You can try to, sure, but if you only have a small sum to put aside for such savings then you need to pray that you don't have two come along at once.

I'm not quite sure what you're trying to argue here, you seem to be contradicting on points without trying to develop an overall point. Life on such low income is a difficult and miserable existence. Are you trying to dispute this, or merely contradicting with the aim of not conceding?

&gt; strive at the first minwage job you find. don't waste your time on something that clearly isn't working.
how/what/where? the tories are trying to get people to strive doing work that doesn't pay?

Most small businesses don't pay at first, tends to be part and parcel of starting a business that it takes time to develop. With the economy in recession (a triple dip one, at that) many are struggling. The general theme of the Tory's rhetoric is to encourage people to go do for themselves instead of going on the dole. With work in such short supply that means either unemployment or trying to run a business of your own for many.

Most of those are going to struggle mightily for a while before succeeding, if they ever do succeed.

&gt; w.t.f. you do realise you can change job without going on the dole? do you realise that employers add staff as business improves?

Whether or not an employer adds another employee to the roster is completely independent of whether or not wassisface gives up on his market stall and rejoins the labour market. I will not be taking that into consideration at all.

If there are 10 jobs being worked and 10 unemployed people, and another unemployed person enters the labour pool and takes one of the jobs, there are now 10 jobs being worked and 11 unemployed people. It's simple math.

&gt; what's the 'less money'? what particular change in the budget are you referring to? how much less money? who is affected? how do you define poverty?

I believe the specific complaint he had was that ""his housing benefit had been cut from £75 to about £57 a week "", so an £18 a week cut which he will have to make up out of his own pocket. That's a pretty heft chunk of his income

&gt; enabling; ""Give (someone or something) the authority or means to do something.""

An overly broad definition, a concise dictionary definition no doubt. Your church is thus enabling all of the perverts that molest children (which is not a catholic only issue by a long long shot).

&gt; please explain how the government is reducing benefits. also please explain how people who don't take benefits manage to survive on low wage jobs.

Most people on low wage jobs do take benefits (housing benefit being the biggest). Of those that don't, I suspect most will be making use of other support networks, chiefly family and friends.

&gt; With the economy in recession (a triple dip one, at that) many are struggling. The general theme of the Tory's rhetoric is to encourage people to go do for themselves instead of going on the dole.

&gt; If there are 10 jobs being worked and 10 unemployed people, and another unemployed person enters the labour pool and takes one of the jobs, there are now 10 jobs being worked and 11 unemployed people. It's simple math.

why has his housing benefit been cut? was it the bedroom tax thing?

true,BritOli,null,null,"That's fair enough. My use of a question mark was because I was unsure of what you were proposing. I'll do my best to try to explain to you, as a non-economist.

Your confusion about interest rates is understandable. These kinds of things are never well explained by newspapers. Broadly speaking long term interest rates are determined by the market, and short term interest rates are determined by the Bank of England. Short term rates have been low (0.5%) for ages now - they are the ones normally covered in the press. Long term interest rates fell too because of QE, and to a lesser extent, austerity. Long term interest rates determine long term investment by businesses and if the Government borrows money now it will actually push up these interest rates and ""crowd-out"" investment by business. So yes, cheap interest rates are there for businesses.

However you're still right to say that businesses aren't borrowing, as per the article. That's because large businesses have stockpiles of cash, and small businesses find it hard to get money from banks. Why aren't banks lending? The same reason large businesses aren't spending their cash. They are uncertain about how and when the economy will grow. In the UK the uncertainty this stems primarily from the problems in Europe, as Europe accounts for two thirds of our country's exports and is by far our biggest market. The UK government can't fix these problems, but time hopefully can. Furthermore the banks that aren't lending are the ones that took the biggest hits in the recent recession. Lloyds and RBS had to be bailed out, and Santander took a huge hit from losses on Spainish properties. These banks are rebuilding their balance sheets, storing up cash, and re-orienting themselves towards safer lending - which means less of it right now. I think that deals with your first paragraph.

Regarding your second paragraph, actually the government cuts are saving significant amounts of money. You can see that in this document from the Office for Budgetary Responsibility on page 6, which shows the predicted UK budget deficit falling. Some of this is due to predicted recovery, some of it is due to the cuts. (http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/wordpress/docs/March-2013-EFO-executive-summary-5784556.pdf)

My overall point is that the problems besetting the UK economy cannot be cured by the government spending more money in the ""real economy"".

true,Lifes-Little-Things,lfc12,,"While most people have written off Andy already, I think Carrol can actally benifit our team by having a big player to pull defenders away giving Saurez and Coutinho more space. Andy could in theory hold the ball up (havn't watched west ham play to know for sure) while others join the counter but he would have to learn to release the ball quick and well. I don't mean a simple pass back but a good nice through ball and with the likes of BR and Coutinho, I'm sure he won't take long to get slightly better at it. He won't get world class at it but effective enough. Another advantage is that we know Saurez likes to drop deep, so if we have Carrol up infront of him, defenders are going to have to mark him as you won't want to give Andy of all players a free header, but that would also give Saurez more space to drop deep for the ball and also would give Stevie more space to go for a signature long range effort. I'm not saying having Carrol stay on our team would be the best thing as our style of play would mean we wouldn't get the best out of him and to put him in, we would have to drop someone else but it is not impossible to fit him in but at the same time, should BR decide to give him a chance, instead of all waiting to say ""told you so"" we should have a bit of hope with him.",0,1365080111,null,0,false,0,c98b0y6,t3_1bm9ie,t1_c98b0y6,t3_1bm9ie,null,1431676800,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3
true,Elledan1211,null,null,"I have all the original episodes, though of course some are reconstructed, and just finished watching them again. Takes me about a year each time. Here's what I know:

1. Time Lords are the oldest and most powerful race. They look out over the universe but have pledged themselves not to interfere. They are simply too powerful. 
2. The Doctor kinda of... got bored. He stole a T.A.R.D.I.S. from a museum and took off.
3. The Time Lords were able to find him when they needed him, however, so his antics must have been allowed though not endorsed. In his second regeneration, they put him on trial and force a regeneration on him while banishing him to Earth specifically for interfering in the universe. 
4. The Doctor would always help them, however, and they'd call him when they needed him. At one point he was the President of Time Lord society. He saved them multiple times. They also saved him a few times, even going to such lengths as to break their own rules and pull a handful of his regenerations together at the same time. 
5. The Doctor essentially fears and loves his people at the same time. He thinks they are making a mistake by being so removed, but he fears their awesome power. He's conflicted. The Time Lords (my theory here), permitted his antics because the universe needs someone like the Doctor, and they know that. But they also know that if they endorse his choices then too many would follow him, and lots of Time Lords running around rewriting time would be a problem. 
6. The first Doctor is the best. Crotchety old man FTW every time. Four is also really awesome. 

Edit- How they become the bad guys:
At some point between 8 and 9 the last great Time War begins. The Time Lords are losing (debatable). Somehow or another Rassilon comes back into power. He's an ancient, all powerful Time Lord, long ""dead"", though never really dead, who basically made the Time Lords who they are. His genius is the source of most of their power. The Time Lords, during the war, had come to the realization that they were going to lose and die out and refused to accept that. The war changed them. The Doctor and the Master both fought in the war and the Doctor saw what was going to happen. His people had fallen. They lost, not the war, but the battle for themselves. Maybe it came from such a long time not interacting with the universe. They didn't see other life like the Doctor sees it. They only considered themselves. Rassilon and the rest made the decision to end all life in the universe but themselves and thus win the Time War. The Doctor prevented it. I think if the Doctor could bring them back like they were before the Time War, he would. But when we see them it's during the last few moments when they were ready to kill everyone/thing to survive. The disagrees with the Doctor on a fundamental level.

First thing is that the reactors have a shelf life, which is likely why Trident is due to go out of service.

And it's not just the nuclear fuel that you replace, due to the high requirements involved a lot of the systems and plumbing will likely need replacing as well.

On top of that there is wear and tear on the actual engine and various parts. Shot blasting the entire thing, repainting tiling the outside. And since it's in the dock for an extensive amount of time it may as well get some upgrades on the outdated systems it still has from its 1980s design.

the unquiet dead for example wasnt just about a haunted house in victorian times, it was about a disillusioned dickens opening his mind to an extraordinary world that he knows nothing about. vampires of venice its just ""gee whizz were having an adventure in the past, with fish vampires!""  

the dark element of the show is absent too, there hasnt been a hefty body count since RTD's era, the daleks have been ruined forever and every problem the doctor faces can be solved with saying ""go away im the doctor"" im not saying he didnt have authority in the previous episodes, but he always had the means to back up his threats. he threatened the racnoss to leave because he was about to flood their ship, he threatened the sontarans to leave because he was about to burn them to death. in eleventh hour, he doesnt have anything, he just tells him to go away and he does, draining away all tension we might have had.

true,redem,null,null,"&gt; so line up again what you think this guy needs to spend per week to live. bearing in mind he has at least £103 per week.

I don't know his situation well enough to write out a budget for him, too much depends on his specifics. I am making two broad points here. He is far from being comfortably well off, and that he was not being deceitful in describing his situation.

&gt; are you aware that everyone in the world has the same problem?

It is a much bigger problem for some than for others.

&gt; I'm disputing that this guy faces anything others don't. I'm also disputing that £103 a week is impossible to live on.

No one is making either claim. Far from it, he is being held up only as an example of the sorts of people being fucked over by the Tory's budget plans. And I am saying that his standard of living is so low that no one can seriously entertain the idea that he is voluntarily making a ""lifestyle choice"" to be poor because he is lazy.

&gt; how long has he been at this market stall?

Balls if I know.

&gt; evidence? I haven't seen any Tory tell people not to go on the dole if they need to.

They do heavily stigmatise it, however, with the constant implication that those who do are skivers, lazy or are making a ""lifestyle choice"". Ridiculous claims.

&gt; I've got it; you're a troll. you have to be. good work! for a minute I actually thought you were serious that jobs are static things that cannot be created. wow.

I quite clearly prefaced this with another statement which you have ignored. This makes me think you may be the one trolling, here.

Whether an employer chooses to create a new job is utterly independant of what the man in this article does. It is him we are talking about, his actions, your suggestion that he gives up on his business and joins the labour market again. Him doing that does absolutely nothing to create a new job, so he is going to be competing for those that already exist and in the process will be increasing the number of unemployed jobseekers by 1. Do you honestly not grasp this concept?

&gt; why has his housing benefit been cut? was it the bedroom tax thing?

No idea, the article doesn't seem to mention it.

&gt; I'm not sure I've given you the name of my church. How exactly is my church giving people the means to molest children? surely you'll clarify.

You may mean your specific church, here, I am referring to the broad religion you're probably a part of given your name. An irrelevent point, however, we were disputing over the breadth of the term ""enabled"". Let's go with the Anglican church as the largest in England (I think), your definition means that they enabled the abuses of power and position of those they've employed over the years. This is an overly broad definition of the term, I do not think any reasonable person would agree with the Anglican church being described this way.

&gt; the penny is dropping.

I don't think so. That some are willing and able to make use of personal support networks that are not the government does not mean that everyone is able to, nor that they should feel the need to in lieu of the government. The country as a whole cannot rely on this type of support network as it is demonstrable inadequate to the task, and has always been inadequate to the task.",0,1365081455,null,0,false,0,c98bbv3,t3_1bndds,t1_c98bbv3,t1_c98aylo,null,1431676657,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Broadly speaking long term interest rates are determined by the market, and short term interest rates are determined by the Bank of England. 

Long term interest rates ought always be relatively close to expectations of the BOE set interest rates.

This is because if I'm a bank and I reason that the BOE will have me lending to other banks at an average of 3% over the next 10yrs, buying a 10yr bond today returning 5% interest would make me decent profit over the period. This puts an upward pressure on short-term interest rates (as I'm using my excess reserves to purchase 10yr bonds instead of lending on the interbank lending markets), the BOE restores rates to their target by supplying me with more cash (via buying the bonds I've been purchasing off the government) and continues to do so until 10yr bonds are no longer an attractive option to me.

That point won't be til 10yr bonds are trading close to my expectations of BOE set interest rates over the period, meaning that the BOE - in effect - sets even long term bond yields.

&gt; My overall point is that the problems besetting the UK economy cannot be cured by the government spending more money in the ""real economy"".

Of course they can. That the private sector is leaving a heap of labor idle today means that there's a heap of resources the government could employ for a minimal inflationary impact on the economy. The private sector has overlooked those workers - the public sector hiring them is not bidding up the price of anything. Those workers it hires would spend their wages demanding basic goods/services, goods/services the UK economy has huge potiential to produce more of - making their multiplied spending also non-inflationary.

By the government merely hiring more workers, the UK could be out of this mess in no time. Or alternatively, by the government raising the deficit via lowering taxes. It'd have much the same effect - people would have more money to spend demanding goods/services, goods/services the economy has heaps of capacity to produce more of.",0,1365083003,null,0,false,0,c98bprd,t3_1bnf3w,t1_c98bprd,t1_c98b0ec,null,1431676475,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Remember, I am not arguing for no debt, but for a sustainable level of debt - perhaps 35-50% GDP (I haven't research this thoroughly). I am suggesting that the government pays off the deficit. The deficit is the annual INCREASE in the total stock of debt. Besides, are you really suggesting that the world will run out of assets even if UK debt was 0?

Small, effective, keeping some sense of caution (""Emergency Temporal Shift!"" to covering their own eyes while behind other angels and freezing when they ""sense"" the camera).  Considering the fan theory these angels might be from Sally Sparrow's photos, said angels may be doing this with the knowledge that they are alone and have no back up.  They *need* to be careful bordering on paranoia (camera).  I won't deny that these were the ""better"" angels for entertainment value.

* Flesh and Stone's angels come in three stages.  First is starving to death.  Second is gorging on food and delight to the point they are killing people for *fun*.  Then utter panic as they realize their ""dinner"" might very well kill them that they turning to stone when they don't need to around Amy because of their fear causing their defense to go off when it shouldn't (Think Beans in Rango).  Why aren't they covering their eyes for fear of looking at each other?  Phase 1 and 3, too desperate.  They are looking out for their individual survival.  Phase 2, they've won.  They can be sloppy.

* The final episode: I've been considering this as standard behavior for the Angels.  Set up a ""nest"", the hotel, to make sure their prey can't accidentally, or intentionally, do what the victims in ""Blink"" did.  The ones not covering the eyes for fear of seeing themselves in the halls and such are the Angel equivalent mall security, or still in ""training"".  There was still one legit scary Angel, the one that got Rory.  I think/thought of that as sort of the ""manager"" in charge of the ""nest"".  The one with enough experience to survive the poisoning of the food source, sense where the paradox would drop the group, and rushed there to catch them off guard if it could.  

I have no legit excuse for the Angel of Liberty other than a rule of cool.  Especially since it moved, what, twice in said episode?  Thought if you look carefully, the hotel is near the waterfront, and at night.

Your second point ignores the surprisingly positive UK labour market trends. In fact, the labour market has been relatively flexible and employment hasn't fallen by nearly as much as expected. So there isn't as huge a stock of unemployed people as we might expect.

Furthermore government is less productive than business. If the government spends £5 employing a worker to do less than £5 worth of work, this does not benefit the economy. If businesses can't justify employing someone productively at the moment, how can government? Plus, what exactly are they going to employ them to do? It sounds like a planned economy. I prefer the lowering taxes idea that you state at the end, as this encourages businesses to invest in what people want to spend their money on.

Finally estimates of the multiplier in the UK vary dramatically and may well be less than 1. There is no empirical justification for saying that the multiplier effect would be positive. This is essentially what the whole argument comes down to. Couple this with the state of the government finances and I think there is a decent case for cutting back.

The UK government can always pay off its bonds, merely by printing more bonds. Even from your own response this is clearly possible - short term yields are set by the BOE. Therefore the UK government can always sell more short term bonds to pay off existing bonds as they fall due if it desires.

And this isn't just theory - there's never been an instance of a government that has all debt denominated in the free floating currency that it issues of running out of people willing to lend it its own currency. Literally never happened. Japan's testing this theory more than any other nation and despite debt being multiple times higher than when bond markets moved against Greece, they're still getting zero interest lending (and, despite what you say, long-term borrowing is also cheap - both for businesses *and* the government). This is of course because ultimately the BOJ sets bond yields, not the market. 

&gt; Besides, are you really suggesting that the world will run out of assets even if UK debt was 0?

When interest rates are positive, I would expect it to be no more than 1.

When interest rates are positive, the economy's already running near capacity - more spending means the central bank has to increase rates, in a sense ""crowding out"" private sector investment such that output falls to a level the economy can support.

When interest rates are at zero though? No, then the multiplier is very real. That's when the economy has a huge amount of excess capacity, and when the government spends in those circumstances it's giving more people wages to demand with, and the central bank does not need to discourage spending elsewhere in the economy to allow that to occur.

&gt; If the government spends £5 employing a worker to do less than £5 worth of work, this does not benefit the economy.

It actually still does, provided the alternative was that worker sitting at home and producing £0 whilst losing skills and work ethics to unemployment, or perhaps even turning to a life of crime.

If the economy's got excess capacity and the government employs someone for £5 to produce £3 worth of work, that's £3 worth of work you otherwise wouldn't have received. They'll go on to spend that £5 employing demanding essential goods/services, demand the private sector can easily expand to meet (due to excess capacity) - meaning the net result is even more production that otherwise would not have occurred.

You also forget that people may just sell the currency. Finally you say that people are always willing to buy government debt. Perhaps, but the interest rate on that debt would have rise dramatically. Look at Greece. Also your point is somewhat fallacious as Governments would tend to avoid acting in a way such that nobody wanted their debt. So it is not surprising it has never happened. There have however been big IMF bailouts. The government defaults we have seen throughout history are things to consider.

The situation in Japan is unique, and the Government there is facing significant problems of low growth and deflation. The Japanese economy is nothing to aspire to. Long term Japanese interest rates do not have upward pressure because of this - the marginal product of capital is low in Japan. The situation in the UK is somewhat better, which means that there will be upward pressure on long term interest rates - particularly when QE is reversed.

Regarding your second point, GBP wealth can be stored in bank accounts, gold, you name it. Not as reliable on its own, but the main problem of reliable stores of wealth is inflation. A government with zero debt is unlikely to pursue inflationary policy, therefore GBP would be expected to hold its value and other asset classes are safer in the long run.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"Yeah, I'd rather not be dependent on other countries for nuclear retaliation. 

The point of MAD is essentially, if you attack me I guarantee that I will attack you in equal force. Therefore you must not attack me.

You can not guarantee that with a 3rd party involved. 

For example, Russia nukes the UK and we don't have any way to retaliate. 

Now we signed an agreement with France saying that they'd retaliate on out behalf. 

Russia say they have no problems with the French people and will not attack. The threat to them was the UK, not France. 

So now France have an option. They either nuke Russia and get Nuked themselves, or they just leave it be. 

Make a nuclear enemy, or help out a now crippled and poor united kingdom with not diplomatic or economic use. You'd be an idiot to nuke someone on behalf of someone else with your entire country and population on the line. 

That brings up another argument, though. Nuclear weapons only use are as a deterrent. They have no practical use as long as MAD is relevant. 

For example, if the USA was attacked by Russia and it was completely devastating. What would the benefit be of attacking Russia back? The only reason you'd do it is for revenge. 

I propose that even in the event of a first strike, no one would retaliate right away if at all. 

You can either go down in history as the country that took a complete beating then picked themselves up with their head held high, or you could go down at the vengeful fuckers who killed millions of civilians in retaliation. 

You think the population of any country who initiates a first strike and then doesn't receive a strike back will stand by their governments decision? They'd be ousted in no time at all.

You will be able to find conflicting estimates elsewhere but the point is that there is no definitive answer out there. The multiplier question is THE big question in macroeconomics at the moment. There has been a ton of research into it and there really is no clear answer yet. You cannot legitimately claim that a positive multiplier effect will occur. I wish you could, it would make the problem easier to solve!

Regarding your second point, to see your fallacy consider upscaling the problem. The government takes control of the economy and pays £1trn pounds for £700bn of work in the economy. This is clearly not a productive use of money. And how is it going to be financed? This is a negative net present value project. It leads to bankruptcy.

I agree that unemployment is horrible, but the government's role is not to provide jobs. That is the role of businesses, who are better incentivised to judge whether a project is useful, or net present value positive.

Your point about the worker ""going on to spend the £5"" is the same as multiplier point above, and as such I repeat the above point - there is not sufficient evidence to show that the current multiplier is greater than 1.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Perhaps, but the interest rate on that debt would have rise dramatically. 

Assume the government would sooner print than default. In fact, let's make it formal government policy. With that policy in place, the *only* risk of lending to the government is inflation. Inflation is a risk no matter who you lend to, or even if you lend to no one. Every other person or institution you may loan to may default on top of this risk of inflation. Accordingly, the government must always receive the lowest interest loaning attainable over the term of any borrowing it makes in its currency at all times.

Now realise that the central bank is setting the interest rate at which banks charge each other, and you realise it is putting a very real ceiling on the bond yields. No rational bank would loan to another bank for less than it could loan to the government.

As long as it is assumed by the market that the government would sooner print than default, bond yields will always go for expectations of central bank set interest rates over the term of the bond. They cannot ""spike"" short of the central bank losing control over the interbank lending markets.

&gt; There have however been big IMF bailouts.

I don't know of a single government ever being ""bailed out"" for debt is has incurred in its own free-floating currency. Can you name one? Perhaps you're thinking of the many government's that have defaulted under fixed exchange rate regimes, or on borrowings they've made in currencies they do not issue (much the same issue).

If you're borrowing in a currency you do not issue you may find yourself in a position where you cannot pay it back, regardless of if you're a government, business or individual. If you borrow in a currency you do issue you will not find yourself in such a position.

That's why bond markets moved unfavourably against so many Euro using nations whilst yields continue to fall on so many other nations with far higher debt denominated in their own currencies.

&gt; Regarding your second point, GBP wealth can be stored in bank accounts, gold, you name it. 

Regardless though, paying back the national debt would be a massive destruction of wealth. You'd be removing over a trillion pounds worth of financial assets - that's no small sum. Would British people be happy if a trillion pounds worth of financial assets were removed? Would they still be willing to spend sufficiently for high employment, or would they try to replenish these destroyed assets by saving/hoarding?

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; This is clearly not a productive use of money. And how is it going to be financed?

The same way they fund all deficit funding, by printing bonds. What is not productive is having people willing to work unable to, for a shortage of spending. That is real wastage. That is the economy living below its means, producing less than it can - all for a shortage of the money that we ourselves create. It's a resource we have invented - money - leading to real factors of production being underutilised.

We all agree that if demand for credit were higher we wouldn't be in this mess. That then the BOE could just lower rates to a point where spending is sufficient for high employment. We ought all agree that if the BOE could set negative rates, it could find a rate today that would lead to high employment. The thing is - the BOE can't. At that, we need to look at other ways to introduce spending into the system - the *government can do this* if only it chooses to do so. It could close the output gap in no time at all if only it were willing to spend. And, as the currency issuer, it has the ability to do that.

&gt; but the government's role is not to provide jobs.

It ought be the government's role to ensure that the economy is running efficiently, that it's not leaving huge swaths of labour idle. That is real wastage, man-hours of potential labour lost to us forever. That's what I find most sickening - infrastructure crumbling whilst millions are out of work, willing and able to fix it, but they can't, because the UK government is telling us it's run out of pounds. That it can't employ them for a shortage of money. All whilst the market's (/BOE) is telling it that it can borrow for free. It's an absurd scenario.

Increasing debt unsustainably and financing it through printing money is seigniorage. If you look further through history you'll see the complete destruction it has caused. Think Ancient Rome, Germany, Zimbabwe etc. This is not a good policy. You need a new currency!

I agree that long term interest rates follow expectations of central bank rates. But also remember that central bank rates respond to real economy, and therefore cannot stay low forever.

2.
You're correct. Although see above about seigniorage.

3.
Paying off the national debt does not destroy wealth. The bond is a claim on future government revenue, which is a claim on income. Paying off the bond means that government revenue can go down, and income after tax can go up. Wealth is determined by what is produced, not the money side of the economy.

To think of it another way: the only wealth that a bond stores is a claim on the income of the productive assets of the country. Those assets exist whether the bond does or not.

The French as of three years ago brought in their new M51 system. 6 to 10 100kt warheads (TN 75), 16 per sub (160 maximum). No clue of cost but the launch system apparenlty cost 4 billion Euro. If the warheads don't cost 16 billion, that's cheaper than our project. Both will carry the same amount of warheads in active service.

A question then: Did the Tories actually think to ask the French (who they signed a mutual naval co-operation pact with a couple of years ago) if the UK could buy in or did they just decide to start kissing US ass again for table scraps.

Of course people on low incomes are more likely to have that problem; they have to fill up on toast and biscuits.

I wish this would change! People of low incomes, or those generally trying to save money shouldn't have to choose between eating healthy and having less money, or eating unhealthy.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Think Ancient Rome, Germany, Zimbabwe etc

I don't know about Ancient Rome, but I have spent at least a bit of time studying every recent hyperinflationary crisis I know of. All are due to debts denominated in foreign currencies, and many include a collapse of potential output as part of the trigger.

**Weimar** - a problem of debt denominated in a currency it did not issue. It tried to pay back war reparations by printing papiermarks (paper currency) to buy gold. Turns out you can't do that, each unit of gold you buy in this manner bids up the price of the next. Each seller of that gold spends the papiermarks they receive trying to buy goods/services from an economy at capacity. The debt, denominated in a currency the government does not print, leads to a collapse of the currency the government does.

Simultaneously, the government was also paying people not to work, funding a general strike. If you reduce the real output of the economy you need to *withdraw* funds to keep prices steady, Weimar did the opposite.

**Zimbabwe** - same story, except the debt was in USD lent by the IMF. Mugabe printed $20.5tn ZWL to buy USD to pay back IMF arrears - each seller of USD wanted to buy stuff from an economy at capacity. Hyperinflation ensues. This didn't even start the spiral though - like Weimar there was a collapse of output about the same time, namely Mugabe decimating the country's agricultural industry. Once again, if you're going to destroy output you need to *remove* money, not add to it. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/1be882/retirees_and_nearretirees_are_leaving_behind_a/c96cggf?context=3) (my comment in another thread).

&gt; But also remember that central bank rates respond to real economy, and therefore cannot stay low forever.

If spending in the economy exceeds potential capacity it becomes inflationary which will lead to the central bank lifting rates until spending drops to a level the economy can support.

If the government wants to keep rates at zero percent it can do so though - it just needs to make sure that the economy is never at capacity. It can do that through adjusting its overall deficit (or surplus) in boom times such that individuals don't have enough money to spend to fully employ the economy. Although the question has to be asked - if we agree that the government can print bonds to pay off existing bonds, why is there concern over keeping interest rates at 0%? What's wrong with aiming for say 3%? At least then your term deposits beat inflation.

&gt; Paying off the national debt does not destroy wealth. 

Yes it does.

Consider what happens when the government sells a bond. First off, the non-government has $10tn in cash. The government prints $1tn worth of bonds and sells them to fund a $1tn deficit. The non-government spends $1tn to buy these bonds, but the government sold those bonds to *spend*. The non-government, post deficit, has received the $1tn it spent at auction back again as a result of the deficit. So post deficit it has $10tn worth of cash *and* $1tn worth of bonds. That is, selling bonds doesn't deplete cash - it just adds to the net financial assets of the non-government.

If the government decides to increase taxation past expenditure such that it can remove those bonds from circulation, the non-government would be back to just $10tn in cash and bonds. That's a destruction of wealth, on paper at least. They've gone from having $11tn in cash and bonds, to having just $10tn. $1tn worth of bonds have been removed from circulation, and no more cash has been added to replace it.

I do agree though that true wealth is created by employment, by production. That's why I find the unemployment today so disgraceful. We're not allowing the government to print either bonds *or* cash, and as a result there's an insufficient amount of spending in the economy for us all to find employment. It's disgraceful.",0,1365087938,null,0,false,0,c98d5xu,t3_1bnf3w,t1_c98d5xu,t1_c98ctoh,null,1431675721,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I mentioned this earlier, but I think the reason you never see a government default in its own currency is because governments tend to avoid that happening. The only governments that borrow in foreign currency are those that cant do so in domestic currency, that says something about the weakness of the government in collecting revenue. It is not surprising that these should go bust more. 

You could look into rome, I can't remember the whole story but I think they basically kept reducing the amount of gold in their denari (increased the money supply) in order to pay their debts. Eventually people got pissed off enough to bring down the government.

Increasing the money supply by printing money is only inflationary. QE did it to some extent, and I welcome that. But much more of it? I'm unsure whether it would do much, as per the multiplier argument.

Finally, in your example, the net wealth remains $10tn always. No wealth is ever created. You need to include the wealth of the government in your model. It's wealth goes to -$1tn and then back to 0.

&gt;For England, Wales, and Scotland, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 makes hateful behaviour towards a victim based on the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) in a racial group or a religious group an aggravation in sentencing for specified crimes.[34] For Northern Ireland, Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purpose.[35] A “racial group” is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A “religious group” is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the Public Order Act 1986, and offences under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.

&gt;The Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated. The Act requires a court also to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:

&gt;    (a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—

&gt;        (i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
&gt;        (ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or

&gt;    (b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—

&gt;        (i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
&gt;        (ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.[36][37]

The net wealth of the *non-government* increases, and that's what's relevant when it comes to spending. How much you/I are willing to spend (and therefore employ people with) is dependent on how much wealth we have, how much the government is willing to spend ought not be. The constraint on government expenditure is *inflation*, the real output capacity of the economy - not revenue. It can always sell more high valued bonds to raise revenue, irrespective of its current debt.

&gt; I mentioned this earlier, but I think the reason you never see a government default in its own currency is because governments tend to avoid that happening.

What measures is Japan taking to avoid it?

&gt; The only governments that borrow in foreign currency are those that cant do so in domestic currency, that says something about the weakness of the government in collecting revenue. 

Not that at all. Countries that borrow in foreign currencies do so because they need to buy foreign exports, but their currency is too weak. Foreign currencies are effectively just another asset, your economy only has so much potential to produce them via exports.

So they borrow the currency they need directly, hoping that the money they receive will allow their export sector to become more productive, boosting the value of their currency such that they can pay back the loan with interest. Very often this gamble does not pay off.

&gt; You could look into rome

I will.

&gt; QE did it to some extent

QE is nothing compared to the potential inflationary impact of actually spending, regardless of whether you're spending bonds or cash. Swapping £400bn worth of bonds for £400bn worth of cash doesn't do a great deal once interest rates are already at zero, other than perhaps lift inflation expectations (which does lead to actual inflation). To put that much money in perspective, it's enough to employ every single unemployed person in the UK at full minimum wage *for over 10 years*. At that, it's a very muted inflationary effect compared to actual expenditure. If we were to intentionally go out and spend the full amount we have on QE on actually employing people then we'd see *real* inflation - the asset swap achieves very little in that regard.

&gt; Whats your background?

Passion for econs but did not study it at a tertiary level other than a few units. The Euro crisis has fascinated me though, bringing me back. Day job, programmer.

EDIT: Just to be clear I believe that individual *deficits* have the potential to be very inflationary. If the government or the multiplier effect of their spending is leading to more spending than the economy can support, prices *will* rise (or, assuming an inflation-targeting central bank, interest rates).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"The principle problem is the ageing fleet of Vanguard submarines. The W76-0 warheads have had a service upgrade to W76-1 to extend their life to 2040.

**To clarify for everyone:**

* Trident is the name of the entire British strategic nuclear deterrent. However, that system is made up of;

    **4 Vanguard class submarines (SSBNs)**

* These are large submarines with a nuclear reactor for power - and 16 ICBM silos. They are not to be confused with the smaller Trafalgar or Astute class nuclear powered hunter-killer submarines (SSNs) that do not carry nuclear weapons.

    **Each vanguard sub carries in its silos the Trident II D5 ICBM, each of which carries up to 8 x British versions of the US W76-1 nuclear warhead each.**

* Although its called a missile, the Trident ICBM is really more like a spacecraft. Its a multi-stage rocket that achieves a low orbit, then each of the warheads glides back down to earth seperately, hitting multiple targets if needed. This means about 50% of the globe is within range of the submarine. So each sub can theoretically carry 128 warheads... enough to wipe up any would be aggressor twice over. It is totally overkill... on purpose - thats why its a deterrent.

What the government are talking about replacing is the submarine component. The nuclear warheads are good until 2040 - but the vanguard class submarines are nearing the end of their reactors life (and are becoming obseleted) and need replacing. Any new submarine is likely to continue to launch the Trident II D5 missile... and infact the government have said they would like the new sub to fit the SSBN-X launcher, which the US have developed and is backwards compatabile with the Trident II D5.

What the french built were warheads (the TN75) and missiles (the D51) for their own submarines (the Triomphant class). We don't need either of those right now as we have the fairly modern Trident II D5... what we are about to run out of is submarines to launch them.

And to be honest, taking kids into care and keeping them the hell away from their shitty parents would help.

The care system does not work because we focus on the parents, who have messed up, not the kids who need to keep such terrible influences out of their lives.

true,StrikerObi,cyberman,Cyberperson,"My biggest problem with the angels is that their mechanics simply are not consistent. All of the stuff in the OP I agree with, but the thing that really annoys me is the speed at which they move is wildly inconsistent.

It seems like if a person looks away from an angel for even a second, the angel can make its way 20 feet across a room and be right on top of the person when they look back. But there are numerous examples of angels being fairly close to people (within 5 feet), the person will look away for a second, and when they turn back the angel is right next to them. That doesn't make sense, because earlier in the same episode you will see an angel cover 20 feet in the same amount of time it just took it to cover 5 feet. If they can move 20 feet in a second, they should be able to snatch a human from 5 feet away in that same amount of time.

On the flip side, I feel like The Silence are essentially the Weeping Angels v 2.0. They both have a similar mechanic of something happening when you look away (the Angels move, the Silence erase your memory). The idea of an enemy that you can't even remember is much scarier and easier to write around (solves the erratic movement problem the Angels). And overall, the monster design of the Silence creatures is 100x scarier than the Angels due to their humanoid shape, their movements, weird faces and hands, their overall moistness (ewwww), and their insect attributes of hanging in clusters from the ceiling and making weird bug noises.

I agree with you about stimulus, and about the stupid way in which both Labour and the Conservatives have pursued anti Keynesian policy. But ultimately you have to decide to what degree the money goes on public sector wages, or welfare, or infrastructure, housing, or research. I dislike these convenient narratives which suddenly find that taking action in favour of Labour's core electorate is the economic panacea. For instance, public sector wages went up above inflation for years, and even for a while after the financial crisis. They went up on a bubble economy, and for some reason I didn't hear much about Keynesian spending restraint five years ago. Now apparently the best form of stimulus is to carry on increasing public sector wages above inflation, or else there'll be strikes. I would rather cut public sector wages, and spend the money on capital investment, on employing unemployed construction workers to build houses and roads. So not only is money saved on reduced welfare, not only are more people in work (3% wage increases for 30 public sector workers is one full wage for a construction worker), but afterwards you are left with a clear cut improvement to the efficiency of the economy. It's Labour's inability to pursue policy like this which stops me from being part of their party.",0,1365090965,null,0,false,0,c98e6yw,t3_1bndds,t1_c98e6yw,t1_c98dgjb,null,1431675236,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I.e if the ""Goth"" in this case was wearing a clown costume instead, and not goth clothing she would have been still targeted, the same is not true of race crime etc.

Anyone who supports the classification of a subcultures persecution as a hate crime does a massive disservice to those that genuinely are victims of hate crime.

The problem is that this creates a disconnect between the act of having a child and the responsibilities of having one. If we continue to give out child benefit blindly, what is to stop those who can't afford / manage to look after their children from just breeding and cashing child benefit cheques?

Unfortunately the flip side of this is families that get too big but don't get provided benefit cheques you end up with ""child poverty"" and child welfare issues. But, if you aren't able to sustain a reasonable quality of life for yourself would you keep churning out children?

How well do you remember 1998?  Imagine how long it's been since then, with all the freedom in the world.  Think about how the world has changed and what major historical events have occurred.

Now, imagine the same 15 years behind bars.  Time stands still.  Locked in a small room, forced to wear a shitty worn out tracksuit, while eating crap food with a total stranger from the other end of the country.  You go to play some pool of an evening... if the pool table hasn't been wrecked or some chav doesn't lamp you with the cue because he doesn't like the colour of your t-shirt.

You went inside in 1998.  Your 15 years are up - will you be released?  Well,  time to meet more complete strangers, who watch as you scrape and bow while recounting what a nice boy you've been since you went away and how you've changed.  These total strangers decide your fate having never met you and possibly still being at school when you first went inside - imagine having to ask permission from a stranger if you wanted to leave your house to go to the shops?

I'm not trying to excuse what these animals did, but dear Christ their punishment is a bleak prospect.  Most prison officers say on the record that the public don't have a clue what prison is like, what prisoners go through, how time stands still etc. and the public should get a clue or shut up.

Basic rules:

- Don't travel at peak times if you can help it. Journeys starting at 10 O'clock and later are cheaper, 12 O'clock-ish is generally cheapest. 

- Open returns are great, use them wisely

- Advance booking on [Virgin](http://www.virgintrains.co.uk/)/[Crosscountry](http://www.crosscountrytrains.co.uk/)/[FGW](http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/)/[Scotrail](http://www.scotrail.co.uk/)/whatever.com is great, do it as much as possible

- Advance goes from 6 weeks beforehand. Where you are is the main effect on when it ends, normally it's a week before, but sometimes it can be the day before.

- Own a smartphone, download thetrainline app or whatever company you use, most of the companies have one. Virgin is the best on Android, Cross Country is best on WP7/8 and I dunno about iOS or BB. 

- If there's something wrong, like a delay or cancellation, Twitter is *great*. The companies mostly update their twitter account faster and more accurately than their employees. 

More complex rules

- You can use the [best fare finder](http://www.thetrainline.com/farefinder/) function on thetrainline.com to find a good advance ticket, but *don't* use thetrainline.com to actually book your ticket, it charges £1 for 'admin'. Instead, use one of the others, ideally the company you'll be using.

- In theory all the sites you can use have the same prices. In practice, it's better to check with multiple sites.

Pro rules

- Break your journey up into sections. It helps if you know your route

- Try booking singles to the nearest 'hub' your travelling through, and then on to where you want to go

- Use [this ticket splitter](http://splitticket.moneysavingexpert.com/) if you can't book advance. If you can, use it anyway, it might be cheaper.



If anything, *get to know your station and route as well as you can.* Sometimes there's a few totally different alternative routes which are great if a line is blocked or something. 

The employees on the platform are people as well, treat them as well as you'd treat yourself, not shittily. It makes it awkward for the rest of us who feel sorry for them and for you.

Imagine if every Angel episode was them choppily moving about - and if you don't want to see them move at all and considering the choppy moving would get old quickly over many episodes - then they'd have to appear out of ""nowhere"" like in TATM which would just become cheap.

There have also been a massive increase in the number of hurricanes and typhoons over the past decade, which don't really affect us but are still important global events.

The predicted change in temperature at the poles ranges from +2 to +6 degrees. You might say even a 6 degree difference isn't much, we experience much greater between winter and summer (40 degree difference). But the difference of even 2 degrees can be massive when you're talking about water varying between -1 and 1 degree. IE the difference between water and ice.

Lets say for arguments sake that someone comes up with a magical solution to completely eliminate goth hate crimes overnight. Goths will still be beaten up by neds because they are still randomly violent. We have two very different problems leading to the same result.

Each case needs to be taken on it's own merits. It's dangerous to automatically assume something was a hate crime just because there is an identifiable difference between both sides involved.

true,DrunkDylanThomas,cnty-wales,Tidy,"Well generally, it should be clearer which parts are projected and which are actual figures, as you enter 2015. That said:

The figures for Defence, General Government and Transport spending are illegible on Figures 1 &amp; 2. On figure 3 you can only view Pensions on the scale, as the others are too flat to make-out their values. Figure 4 has slopes that make identifying Education and Transport difficult, and Defence and General Government are hidden again.

Figure 5 looks nice, but because the absolute beginning changes, the further along the circle, the harder it is to interpret. The label is too small, and what I think is Defence spending is hard to compare against years because each segment shifts in location. Figure 6 does clear it up a little, but with so many rings it's hard to estimate general proportions between each year: for instance, how much Education has grown from the inside ring to the outer ring.

Figure 7 I actually quite like - easy to see where growth or stagnation occured. Figure 8 struggles however, showing timeline in a spiral is confusing.

Figure 9 is quite nice, but there's no label on the y-axis and the data-points are partly obscured by the lines. 

Figure 10 has no reason to be 3D, as you're only showing 1-line, perhaps combining this with figure 9 would be useful. Figure 11 suffers from 3D, as your y-axis label appears to stop half-way up the graph. Displaying columns adds another dimension to the figures making them bigger than they need to be.

Figure 12 - nice, again the 3D is unneccessary, but bold and simple display.

Figure 13 - if you're including two lines that each have their own scale, give one scale on the left, and one scale on the right, otherwise there's confusion as to what they mean.

You can't price low skilled workers out of jobs that need to be based in the UK, as the minimum wage becomes the new benchmark.

I personally think that some companies are just a little worried about it hitting their profits and the dividends and/or bonuses for the higher paid people. Businesses will try to pass it on to the customer, when in reality the profits should be distributed a little more evenly for larger companies. Small businesses would possibly be hit hard, but hopefully that can be countered by an increase in demand due to more people having disposable income.

When discussing minimum wage, all you hear about is the cost to the employer. Nothing is mentioned about the potential economic benefits of having a more balanced labour market, or the improvement in the lifestyles of those who are on minimum wage.

There are better ways to combat inequality, but increasing the minimum wage to give an actual living wage would be a good start.

I'm not an economist (Though I have studied it at various points through School, College and University), but I understand that the issue is quite complex.

I know, I just don't think it's very polite to go assuming that people who support a eurosceptic party are necessarily racist, so I called you out on it.

&gt;My point was that the UKIP membership like to deny what I consider to be an undeniable racist presence in their organisation (and perhaps with some of them, within themselves), so they would no doubt be very uncomfortable with an endorsement from the more openly racist EDL.

Actually the EDL are ideologically non-racist too, although undoubtedly have an element of racist membership too. Then again, we already covered the idea that every party (from BNP to Tory to Labour to Green to Socialist Party) will have racists in it, so, it kind of seems moot.

&gt;Jesus, you're not even saying anything, you're not adding to the discussion at all.

I was pointing out that what you said wasn't very bright. I'm sure you're annoyed because you feel I'm nit picking, but you called an entire group of people racist for no good reason, and despite my non-membership in that group, it seems like a pretty low down thing to do.

&gt;but your constant repetition of ""justify yourself!"" adds nothing to the discussion.

It actually did - it showed that you couldn't. Which was my point from the beginning, but required demonstration.

You asked for my opinion so you can have it:

I think there are probably racists in the UKIP party membership. As I said I think there will be racists in every parties membership, and every parties voterbase. Voters do not run parties, and members do not all sit in office. National candidates are the only people to actually really ""worry"" about in any sort of issue like immigration since obviously they're the only ones with potential to alter immigration policy or other high level issues - since I think it's fairly obvious that high level candidates have a significant role in shaping the official ideology of the party, perhaps even outright determining it themselves, it would be foolish to assume that the national candidates views are significantly divergent from the official party ideology.",0,1365102138,null,0,false,0,c98ibz4,t3_1bninb,t1_c98ibz4,t1_c98hmyc,null,1431673286,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,executivemonkey,null,null,"&gt;if North Korea is happy to discuss nuking the United States, whose existence is more or less synonymous with the idea of a nuclear deterrent, why does anyone think a few nuclear subs is going to be remotely useful in deterring anyone?

I agree that people should not assume that nukes will always serve as a sufficient deterrent to war.  In this current atmosphere of tension, an accident, like a ship straying across an oceanic boundary between national territories, could blossom into a military confrontation.

However, there is a world of difference between talking about nuclear war and actually engaging in it.  North Korea hasn't actually done anything yet, nor has the US.

North Korea's rhetoric is probably aimed at creating a ""rally around the flag"" effect for Kim Jong Un, who is a young, inexperienced leader who recently suffered an attempted coup.

They don't have many nukes, and the BBC has reported that their petrol reserves are insufficient to properly conduct an invasion.  China cut off their petrol aid to North Korea in February, and it is unknown if it has resumed.  North Korea apparently wouldn't have the backing of China if it started a war, and the increasing number of military desertions from the North raises the issue of whether North Korea's military would remain loyal once the fighting began, or once it saw the relative wealth of South Koreans.",0,1365103542,null,0,1365105837,0,c98ivzx,t3_1bo1nl,t1_c98ivzx,t1_c98f376,null,1431673024,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Quick disclaimer, I am of a leftish persuasion and in no way support UKIP.

UKIP should not be attacked for the views of people that support them, unless they are clearly fostering them through policies - this is clearly not the case.

UKIP are the most right wing serious political party in the UK, which means that many people on the right with extreme views will support them. 

UKIP are not in any way racist as a party, they are not overly tolerant but this does not stem from race or prejudice but practical concerns.

UKIP want to leave the EU for two mains reasons; firstly the economic cost to us [this has been widely disputed and the general academic consensus is that the UK receives more money than it gives in the form of both subsidies and trade]. Secondly they want to leave on grounds of sovereignty, ie the British government has limited control over policy making and we should repatriate powers [again this has limited value, the British government can still override eu law if it wants to, and most laws are regulations of little relevance ot most people].

Lets have a serious debate about UKIP policies, and if we desire refute them with evidence and propose an alternative. But seriously, the cliché attacks on UKIP that are so prevalent on this subreddit and amongst the British left in general are getting very tiresome.",0,1365103627,null,0,false,0,c98ix7n,t3_1bninb,t1_c98ix7n,t3_1bninb,null,1431673008,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Yes, but when you're the only minority then you're the only one at risk so it's not a wider risk or indicitive of a wider problem. It's just that someone personally hates you. And that no one else is at risk.

So that's less bad? I should take comfort in knowing that if only I am beaten then I can be beaten up and that that's not hateful? What if me and a mate are beaten up by people who don't like us? Hate crime? It's indicative that there are people out there who want to beat the two of us up, are we then a minority group descibed by ""the people who those guys want to beat up""?

&gt;So yes. It's completely different. The point is that other people might be at risk.

Yes, which applies in every case, which is why we jail and rehabilitate criminals.

&gt;Because wait for it - in terms of preventing crime knowing if there's a problem in the area to do with race wars or whatever it's fairly important to be aware of this shit.

Ok, so explain to me, why are rappers not a protected group but emo kids are? Why are two people who like colouring in not but 10 people who like music are? Who on earth *isn't* in some sort of minority group? Every action is taken against people for *some* reason. Dividing violent crime into ""hateful"" and not ""hateful"" just arbitrarily elevates some functionally equal crimes above others. A man who goes around beating people up randomly deserves no less time than a man who goes around beating up only people who wear ties.

&gt;It's sad you really need this explained to you dude.

You're not explaining, you're attempting (and failing to, I might add) to justify this legislation.

This is one of my favorite episodes. (I'm sure it's been beaten to death on this sub, but I'm gonna talk about it anyway dammit.) One reason is because I actually liked some of those people at first - like the Poosh girl, and the emo teenager, and poor doomed cranky heartbroken Skye. And even the ones I didn't like were written and acted so well that they immediately became distinct characters, not just blank slate humans to turn into pitchfork-wielding villagers when the plot called for it. So watching them descend into panic and turn on each other was that much more absorbing and tense. 

Then there's the fact that it's pretty much the only episode that's not wrapped up neatly with the Doctor going ""oh yeah, it was a Suchandsuch from planet Thisandso and it was acting like that because of XYZ."" He doesn't win, he doesn't learn anything about it, he just has a really shitty time and is every bit as helpless - even more so for being interested and getting involved - as the freaked out tourists on the bus.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Marin is very good, he could be a late bloomer with Chelsea as well. I know it's going to sound repetitive, but on back on Bremen he was just as good as De Bruyne is right now. He has just slowed down, but I think he can pick that form up and shake off anything holding him back. I don't think age should be the judge of someones skill, I was just using Bale as reference because many fans were saying to just sell him because he wasn't a good player. He went 26 games without a win, and now he's one of the best players in the world.

If you want an example of someone who's career took of around 24 years of age there's many I could list. One (another spuds player, sorry I don't know why lol) is Luka Modric who continuously improved after 24.

Of course, the big point is with Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Piazon, Moses, De Bruyne can Marin fit in there? I think so. I think he can improve enough to put his name on that list. If he doesn't fit with Chelsea I think he will move to another team and establish himself there. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion though, and I'm not going to try and change yours :) just stating mine. And at least we have no shortage of CAM's and wingers! Just need to put a goal scoring machine in there (we have one on loan, and we could even pick up another one soon like Lewandowski).

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are some good and some bad things to take away from this game.

1. Going in, I wouldn't have been very happy seeing this end in a 2-2 draw, but after going down 0-2, I'm glad the team fought back and got a draw. We're still very much in this competition, and the winner of the second leg will advance.

2. I'm very frustrated seeing Gallas play instead of Caulker. Gallas hasn't been good this season, while Caulker has. Caulker also hasn't been played enough lately and for the life of me, I can't figure out why. He's not injured and to my knowledge, he isn't going through a slump in form. He needs the game time, we need him to play. 

3. Left back.
Almost every weekend we cry for the return of BAE, but when he finally starts, he plays like this. I mean, he wasn't awful, but he isn't really on the level we want him to be. Naughton is a good player, but since we're playing with Gylfi on the left for most of  the games, it's quite restraining to have two right-footers on the left.
Danny Rose would be the obvious solution, and I hope that we can really utilise him much next season. This season he would've gotten almost as much playing time at Spurs as he has gotten at Sunderland. 

4. I desperately hope Bale's injury is not too bad. With the lack of depth at our forward positions, it's quite unsettling. Dempsey is back however, which does give us the opportunity to actually field a full 11 man.

UK Child Benefit and the current situation where the state will fund people if they choose to breed. Mick Philpott, who was today convicted of murdering 6 of his children, was churning out 2 kids a year from 2 women, earning child benefit for each one.

In the US you're given a tax credit if you have children as they see the money your spend on your kids shouldn't be taxed to a certain extent per child. Of course, you only benefit if you've earnt that money in the first place. This allows those who can afford to raise a larger family are able to do so, ensuring a certain quality of life for those children.

In the UK we give child benefit for every child until they're 18, this means that we pay towards the raising of every child. This encourages us to have kids as we get paid for every child, which may have made sense in post-war Britain. Economies of scale means those determined to game the system as far as Philpott did will find it very profitable.

If we are to provide for/encourage children, the state should only fund as many children as we really need for a stable future. Imposing a limit on child benefit to 2 children seems sensible, we need 2.1 children per woman to maintain a stable population. We could provide a sliding scale from there for current claimants or possibly provide tax credits for any above 2 bringing us closer in line to the US policy.",0,1365109696,null,0,false,0,c98lde5,t3_1bni03,t1_c98lde5,t1_c98ham7,null,1431671841,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

How would you make it so the kids don't suffer through their parents' actions? Vouchers would only work if every relevant retailer honoured them and they were for a generic product type rather than a specific brand (ie £30 to spend on nappies rather than £30 to spend on Huggies or £30 to spend on nappies at ASDA)

E: I hope I've not come across as critical of you or your post. It's just I see this argument trotted out yet nobody knows how to stop it making the kids lives worse - what the usual justification is that *good* parents wouldn't spend it on themselves and so anyone who does is a bad parent and the children don;t see the money.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"OK, wall of text!

This game was just a continuation of the second half of the Swansea game.  We look really tired.  I don't want that to sound like an excuse because we *shouldn't* be looking so tired, but it's an unavoidable fact and it means that we were wholly unable to apply good defensive pressure like we were able to do so early in the season.  

Gallas should not be seen in a Spurs shirt again.  He's had some good games for us, even a couple this season, but he's not reliable enough anymore and his lack of composure, both on and off the ball, seems to infect those around him (even Vertonghen made more mistakes than is characteristic).  There can be no excuse for playing Gallas now at expense of Dawson or Caulker, who now offer more in all facets of the game.

The injuries suck but I don't want to talk about them until we know more.  All I will say is (a) teams have survived key injuries before, and (b) it's evident that something needs to change in how we are playing and key injuries often have surprising effects on teams as coaches re-jig to compensate for them.  Let's wait and see.

I want to talk about Parker, who I do rate highly but who I think is being badly managed.  I feel he needs to be more Palacios and less Poyet; whilst many of our more successful attacks this season have come from him bombing forward like a cavalier, his lack of defensive discipline means that Dembele is being sacrificed more and more as an attacking threat.  AVB should have told Parker to *stay* and sit in front of the CBs, allowing Dembele more freedom and also allowing the full-backs to move forward without us being as outnumbered on the break.  This is why Sandro/Dembele worked so well.  AVB and Dembele need to speak to Parker about how he should be prioritizing his play.  Heck, at least with Tom Huddlestone you know he's not going to be vacating his position so rashly.

Our full-backs have all been weak this season (except Vertonghen, when he plays there).  A top-class left-back should be a top three priority this Summer as I don't think BAE - who I do love - should be offered a new contract.  Naughton is a useful squad player but not a starter, and I'm not sure Rose is quite there yet either (if he ever does get there)

...and the strikers.  Adebayor needs to stop feeling sorry for himself and work harder: end of.  I don't rate Dempsey, which I know is suicide on Reddit, but he doesn't offer enough for our club - much like Darren Bent didn't.  His movement is just not good enough.  Taking Holtby off was a mistake, IMO, as he was improving and is wonderfully enthusiastic in pressing the ball.  Bale was, tbqh, tired most of the game; there was one telling moment when Dembele had the ball and Holtby, Parker and Gylfi all ran past Bale who was walking forward at an Adebayor-pace.

Basel played very well.  Physical but clean, and with good stamina and pace.     ...but we helped them as much as we could.",0,1365112113,null,0,false,0,c98mbek,t3_1boqnc,t1_c98mbek,t3_1boqnc,null,1431671396,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3
