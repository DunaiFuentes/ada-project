He was rarelly involved high up the pitch and didn't play box to box, like Mikel has to now there is a present need for it. 

Makele simply, made the tackles, broke up the play and passed to the safest option, occasionally making one or two wonder passes.


Mikel doesn't play a Makelele role. With the adaption of a new system where there is little to no cover in front of the back four; he is effectively, sharing with another defensive midfielder, the role of both being the catalyst and the link up between attack and defense and the basically the only cover for the defenders. 

Makelele had the cover of three or two box to box midfielder in a 4-3-3 and wingers who tracked back, where he could anticipate where the play was heading and going and where he could interject and mop up. 

Mikel doesn't have that luxury. he is often seen being stationary and not pressing on the ball, because he knows if he gets beaten by timing a challenge late, there is a plethora of space for the attacker/midfielder to take advantage, it's the only thing he can do, and sadly we get overrun in midfield through a simple numbers game and he gets passed around.

He kept the ball moving but he made bolder and quicker decisions, and while he may not have looked like a game changer to the casual observer, he absolutely was.

true,galinda_san,null,null,"Hmmm, can't say I can really fully answer that question: I'd still say I'm sort of a new Whovian. I started watching with the encouragement of my friends, who led me through 10 and 11's seasons all willy-nilly. Then I went off on my own and watched all the Matt Smith ones in order and am now about half-way through the Tennant ones. I haven't seen any of nine's episodes at all yet, although I do plan on watching in the future. So at the moment, I guess it's a tough choice between ten and eleven. I think I have to eventually pick 11, though. I fell in love with Smith's Doctor after watching ""closing time,"" which is also the episode that got me hooked on the show in general. In this episode, we saw all the best sides of 11 - his quirkiness and whimsy, his love for and belief in the goodness of his friends and the human race on the whole, but also his isolation. I just connected with 11 first, I think. However, I think  all of the things I just said I love about 11 are what make people love 10 as well. Even though the Doctor supposedly changes personality along with his looks when he regenerates, there seem to be some core traits that  are always more or less the same. In terms of the episodes themselves, I really like the story arcs in 11's seasons as opposed to the self-contained ones of 10's. 

And thanks for warning me about ""The Writer's Tale,"" but I don't think I'd mind.

Flash forward to 2013 and Bale is regarded as a top player and now the likes of Real Madrid are allegedly poised to pay big money for the player.

Now, I'm not suggesting that Jonjo will become anything like Gareth Bale. But it's just a bit of perspective: in three years time, anything can happen to Jonjo Shelvey ... he could be a super-star, he could be a flop. But that's why it's so difficult to rate players that are so young (including Sterling, Henderson, etc).

Perhaps players like Jonjo should be given a bit more leeway.

Now, with young players, it's all a gamble, right? Many times you're simply gambling on potential and future returns. So, I'm sure there'll be youngsters that we'll stop gambling on this summer and move them for other players...

With Torres playing horrible, we could play a 'fake' 4-3-3.

Put Mata and Hazard up on the wings with Ba in the Center moving up just a bit ahead of them and Oscar/KDB as CAM or Mikel/Essien/Luiz/Romeu (CDM) while you play Rami/Lamps/Bertrand(In games when we need to bolster our D) and you can probably put in Moses and Marin on the LM/RM positions. Our Defensive play would be pretty solid, the attack would be hard to stop since you'd have Mata and Hazard constantly running around with a free-pass along with Oscar just making the sorts of plays that are nothing short of art and either scoring themselves or giving it to Ba upfront. Having Mikel/Essie/Luiz and in the future Oriol as CDM would put a physical presence in the middle of the pitch so the Left and Right midfielders could start something for the players up front while sometimes helping back on Defense. 

The 4-3-3 worked for Mou, I don't see why it shouldn't work now. Even if the EXACT formation that Mou had doesn't work, you can tweek things around and fix it up. There's no point in going 2-3 or more seasons waiting and hoping that this will work out.

I think for me, it's that Glasgow has lots of great concert venues and there's often bands playing in the city that I like.

For me, a night out is mostly a concert and the afterparty. I used to travel from my home village in rural Sussex to Glasgow as a teenager for concerts there and still do now I live in Edinburgh.

I guess it depends on what you're looking for in a night out - I think if I wanted a fantastic meal somewhere, both cities would do equally. Plus in Glasgow, it's a massive city so there's always the opportunity to get away from busy things. Edinburgh, for example, is a nightmare during the festival and it feels very claustrophobic.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I came into ""Doctor Who"" in a roundabout way. I kept hearing about ""Torchwood"" and lazily decided last year to get into it. Then I heard that it was a spin-off of ""Doctor Who"". Being a geek, I've heard that name all my life, but I never heard enough of it to interest me. But I really wanted to watch ""Torchwood"". So I decided that I was gonna watch ""Doctor Who"" and alternate twixt the two shows once they synced up. Then I saw that 2005 wasn't when the show started. Then I had to make the decision whether or not I wanted to watch almost 1,000 episodes of a TV show just to watch ""Torchwood"". I figured that ""Doctor Who"" was such an important show to geekdom that it wouldn't be a complete waste of time if I watched them all. I'd always have something to talk about with any age group, at least. So I watched every single episode from 1963 onward. The irony? I gave up on ""Torchwood"" after the second season because I hated what happened in the last episode.

But back to Eleven. I thought he was awesome since ""The End of Time: Part Two"". Ten regenerates and the TARDIS is on fire and Eleven is laughing maniacally as they fly through time and space. All the Doctors are the same in that the reasons why you love Eleven are all their basic traits. However, they're all painted with different brushes. No one would ever confuse one Doctor for another. Ten's the more fun one, Eleven's the goofier one.

Of the 2005-onward Companions... I'd have to go with Donna, until Clara has more episodes. My favorite Companions are the ones who're as close to being The Doctor's equal as possible. Not someone who's constantly fawning over him or needing saving. And I liked that Donna was older. I don't count River as a Companion because she never sticks around long enough, otherwise she'd be my favorite one (until Clara gets more episodes). As for the entire show, my favorite Companion is Jo Grant. She was The Third Doctor's Companion and she's one of the few to have a real dramatic arc and evolution. When she first appeared, she was mousy and relatively useless. When she left, she was Woman and roared. She also had my absolute favorite send-off. Genuinely heartbreaking without all the screaming and crying that goes on lately. Romana would be next, The Doctor's Time Lady.

As it stands we have an overly centralised healthcare system that is in need of reform and an ageing population (which will mean a much greater cost in the future). 

I agree with you that comparing the running the country to running a household is complete bollocks (although explaining economic concepts to the population is rather difficult) but that doesn't mean we should shirk away from the need to reform. It's also worth mentioning that cuts not made to the NHS will have to be made up for in other departments. We have some leeway to reduce the pace and scope of deficit reduction due to low borrowing rates but that doesn't mean that we should abandon it all together and that it isn't important.

I apologize that turned into a bit of rant (which wasn't completely entirely directed at you).

EDIT: This site is probably better for giving an over view of the different health care models, their costs and ranking (although it uses the same WHO report) UK Expenditure per capita rank: 26

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"It's not so much an afterthought as just having lost a little importance over the years.  The Charity Shield (as it was known until recently and which I still call it purely out of habit) has roots going back to the late 1890s, when the 'Sheriff of London Charity Shield' took place between a team of professionals and a team of amateurs.

The Football Association Charity Shield replaced the Sheriff of London Charity Shield when amateur clubs had a falling out with the FA.  This new match pitted the First Division winners (predecessor to the Premier League) against the Southern League winners (which now consists of semi-pro and amateur teams on Levels 7-8 of the English football pyramid).

The format varied until about 1930, as they changed the criteria for qualifying for the match quite a few times in the intervening 30 years.  In 1930 though, the match was played between the First Division winners and the FA Cup winners.  This wasn't the first time this format was used, but it was the first year this format was used almost exclusively and for the most part, it's been this way ever since.

Until recently (1993 I believe), the two teams 'shared' the Charity Shield if they drew the game.  From 1993 onwards though, drawn matches have been decided by penalties (no extra-time).

In 2002, the Charity Shield was renamed the Community Shield, although in my experience at least (amongst my friends and peers), anyone who watched football before this still tends to call it the Charity Shield.  Community Shield seems too awkward.

It's not as if it's an afterthought.  As you can see, the game has a LONG history.  It's just lost almost all importance and is now considered a glorified friendly match.

true,ezekielziggy,eng-sussex,Sussex,"It's worth mentioning that even though I have some issues with the NHS, I believe any country that can afford to do so has a moral responsibility to provide universal healthcare at the point of service.

As shown in the sources provided, there are other models which provide better value for money for example France which has a universal health care system that mixes public and private providers (and has the best and one of the most efficient healthcare systems available) or Singapore that regulates the price of healthcare and ensures that its population is covered (through medishield) and pays significantly less (4% of GDP compared to about 9% of GDP) and has one of the best systems in the world. 

The UK shouldn't treat the NHS as a religion. Occasionally those that care about it want to see it reformed and to be sustainable.

So far I'm the only one providing sources or proof, yes given the NHS's size it can use its bargaining power to purchase drugs at a cheaper rate although I'm not sure to what extent this is currently done and how devolved that process currently is. Having a less centralised system (ie a system a tiny bit closer to France's or other similar models) does not mean you have to sacrifice this. 

I am against the renewal of trident as I don't believe it is fit for purpose or cost effective. We should either look into the alternatives (and there are many regarding our nuclear deterrent) or scrap the nuclear deterrent altogether (it is a 20th century solution to 21st century problems). HOWEVER the 25billionish figure you cite is the total cost of trident over the years and its a quarter of the NHS's budget for one year. It's still a ridiculous amount of money but the NHS budget dwarfs the trident budget.

Well, let's be a bit careful here before blaming the equality boogeyman. Do we have some statistics that show Dutch schools are actually better? Are both underperforming and overperforming students dealt with well, and so on? And is this due specifically to the testing and sorting regime, rather than other factors?

That's not to say it isn't, but I think a big problem with the way we approach eduction is there's a lot of gut feeling and relatively little carefully scientific examination. Classic examples are things like how faith schools like to crow about how their learning environment produces excellent results, whereas studies tend to show this is more because they can choose their intake to get good, well supported students in the first place.

I'm happy to advance the opinion that this grade streaming is *not* a good idea and *not* an improvement over the current system.

I knew the post would be inflammatory, and it was a bit more vitriolic than it really needed to be. I apologise for that, but not for my opinion.

I was partly taking issue with the fact that he was trying to crack that he was still a poor starving Togolese, which patently he is not. He may well have experienced some heavy shit in the past, but that is not an excuse for letting down his employer. The fact that he saw three colleagues killed in front of him two years ago is tragic, but it has no bearing on his ability to get his arse back home now.

If it's 'retarded' of me to argue that Adebayor easily had the means to charter a flight, then it was equally 'retarded' of him to force the club to do the exact same thing, at extremely short notice, five days later.

The fact that he plays for the team I support doesn't instantly excuse him of all wrongdoing. I don't go about publicly bitching about our players, but I'm well within my right to take issue with his attitude. There's a difference between booing a player - something I would never dream of - and criticising his character among fellow supporters.

The money we pay him honestly doesn't bother me too much either. If we're paying him too much that's Levy's fault, not his - you couldn't put Obika on 80k and criticise him for underperforming. It's the fact that he is visibly less motivated and committed than the rest of the team that means I'd still be unhappy if he was playing for a pittance.

People try to defend him by saying he is in poor 'form', which I would dispute. If fitness is the issue, he needs to work harder in training - he's been back for months now. If confidence is the issue, he needs to work harder on the pitch to regain it - look at Siggy working his arse off non-stop and finally getting his reward. I don't believe in some mystical force called 'form'. There's fitness and there's confidence, both of which he can fix by working as hard as the rest of the team does.

If you can name me one match other than Arsenal and City (for which he obviously had personal motives) where he has looked fully dedicated and given the match his all, I will reconsider my point, but for now I maintain that his work ethic is unacceptable. He is a fantastically talented footballer, but he does not turn out good performances unless a contract is at stake.

*Edit to add that while his charitable work is laudable, it doesn't stop him from being greedy.

Eccleston never became as loved as 10 or 11 because he only had the one season, a smaller budget, and the US hadn't caught on at the time.

I disagree about Tennant fitting the mould better though. The mould is a pretty vague thing considering we get 11 different versions of the same character. I know that Tennant embodies *the* Doctor for lots of people, but watching all 11 helps to show that it's not really that concrete. I think it's different, not better.

Research RAF Digby

&gt;Radar/Sonar stuff

SONAR is Submarine so you won't touch that, however RADAR is definetly something you'll be looking into. However, as of 2015 a lot of Ground Radio (RADAR) will be getting contracted to civillians, so I'm unsure where our future is with that.

&gt; I do want to be thrown about to country after country

If you go to TCW (Tactical Communications Wing) in RAF Leeming, you will be going on Exercise nearly constantly, and deployed OOA (Out of Area) every year and a half as a minimum. Other than that, you're look at a deployment once every 3 years, and possibly a lot of time spent in the Falkland Islands rather than Afghanistan.

&gt;  I'd love to go to germany 

Rammstein is Army only. You won't be going to Germany, but you may be going to Gibraltar, Cyprus, Falkland Islands, or wherever else we're invested later on.

&gt;  I want to be involved in the fixing of hardware

Do well in your 4000 course in the Radar side then, and coast on the IT side. You'll be qualified to do both, but if I were you, I'd take a serious look at your options in Ground Radio, and other Radio based qualifications. Also, keep in touch with me and I'll put you in contact with a few people around the RAF who will see about taking you on as a new LAC (The first rank you get out of training).

&gt;Id hate to be confined to a particular room every day. I want to be outside, or working on numerous things

Exactly my thoughts. Having done both sides, I'd much rather be getting my hands dirty.

HAH! Mate, they'll bullshit you and make you believe the sun shines out of your arse. My advice? Disregard everything they've told you, because 9/10's of it will be a lie.

The Military has a lot of catching up to do, but it'll be a cold day in hell before we're half as shining as the films make us out to be.

I'm pretty sure that the figures regarding GDP spent on health care take into account the total amount spent on healthcare by government and by citizens. I'm familiar with medicare and the singapore system as a result of living there for 17 years. 

It is very difficult to compare health care models as each country has a different set of circumstances, the point I'm trying to make is that the NHS is not the best model out there and it is certainly not the cheapest.

Ive played on a few courses around the world, all that feature natural wonders (in a sense) around the course. The most stunning was the Devils Gorge (Portugal) where you are driving your tee shot over a 100yrds chasm to the Par 3 some 180yrds away. The course beautifully complimented the surroundings.

If this is a top course they build, it really wont be detracting from anyone except maybe Royal Portrush / County Down. They arent going to build a world class course and resort, and then charge £20 a round. It will more than likely be £75+ if not £100. That sort of pricing doest steal business from the likes of any course around Belfast. They would be treat courses youd play once or twice a year like the other prestige courses here.

Proximity is a good thing too in my mind, I just wouldnt see the point of having a golf course near the Giants Causeway that doesnt in some way tie into the actual causewway in name, or theme.

It's legitimacy as the ruling party is now solely based on its economic performance. It has no moral legitimacy because of the widespread corruption and human rights abuses. It has no ideological legitimacy because it's communist pretensions were largely reformed over the last 30 years towards free market. 

So the reason they can say that everything they do is for the good of the country is based on the fact that China is growing 8-10% annually. This can't last forever and at some point, growth will stagnate or even collapse and at that point, there is no one else to blame but the Party itself. No one is sure what will happen at that point, but we do know that there will be a lot of powerful factions vying for the empty space, not all of them friendly to us, particularly certain elements of the military. At that point I'd feel a lot safer with a deterrant than without one.

Another possibility is if Russia gets tired of its current system and its flaws and instead embraces a anti-west nationalistic government.

They should be able to take you on some of the known test routes for the test centre.

It seems most of the necessary advice has already been said, but I must say: **don't get caught out by one-way streets**. If you're turning right on a one-way street, make sure you're positioned to the right of the road and not just your 'lane'. I've heard a couple of horror stories where this was the only reason someone failed.

As for the independent riding period, I was only told to follow the signs to a specific area, which basically consisted of staying on the main roads and going straight ahead at the lights or roundabouts. Even if for some reason you don't go the correct way, as long as you ride safely and follow your indications, even if you're signalling at the wrong turning, everything should be fine as don't as you don't mislead others.

true,timhm,eng-kent,Kent,"I'm no economist, but I believe we're heading in the same direction as Japan did with their [lost decade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Decade_(Japan)) (well, two really).

From the mid to late nineties until around 2007-08, we had a credit boom facilitating purchases of expensive consumer goods like cars, TVs etc. and massively inflated the cost of land/housing. This would have corrected itself earlier if we had had the right legislation and the banks had been managing risk correctly. Instead, insane policies like lending at 125% loan to value enabled the bubble to grow further.

I think Hitchens is right when he says that we're in for a slow decline: the cuts so far have been fairly mild and not enough to dent our large deficit, quantitative easing has lowered the banks' reliance on savings, and that combined with increased lender forbearance means that there are many zombie companies and zombie households holding us back.

I imagine we will see stagflation for many years to come, so the cost of living will increase, wages will struggle to keep up with inflation, house prices/rents will remain unaffordable as building rates stay low, and we will bounce in and out of recession. Also, people currently in their 20s, 30s and possibly 40s will have awful retirements due to the crap/devalued pensions and poor savings rates.

true,JackRawlinson,null,null,"I am approaching my fifty-fourth birthday and I have been a train driver for almost a year. The TOC I work for were doing a big recruitment drive a couple of years ago and they simply advertised for anyone interested. Full training was provided to successful applicants; no previous experience was necessary. I got this job after 25 miserable years in IT/business and I have never been happier in my work.

Things to note: the application rate for such places is huge. I was told that over a thousand people applied for the intake I was part of and around forty of us succeeded. Succeeded at what? A whole bunch of psychometric tests (concentration, reaction, memory etc) and some pretty in-depth interviews. 

You get half salary for three months while you learn ""The Rules"". If you pass all of those assessments your salary goes up by a couple of grand or so. Then you spend around six months (at least) with a DI (driving instructor) learning to actually drive trains. Somewhere in this period you will do ""traction"" training, which means learning how the various types of train you will drive work, and what to do if they fail. Then you get your driver's final, which is a very nerve-racking week. Succeed at that and they give you the much-coveted key, and something like a six grand pay rise.

It ain't over yet. You now go out and ""learn the roads"". This means learning all the (surprisingly many) features of the routes you will be driving. This can take several months, depending which TOC you are working for. Pass all these assessments and - at last - you're on full salary and on the roster. And driving on your own. And it feels mighty fine.

I recommend giving [this site](http://www.traindriver.org/) a thorough reading before you proceed. After that just enquire to all of the TOCs in the area you could reasonably work for. If you would like to discuss this further with me by all means PM me here.

The change from imperial to metric has not been a smooth one at all the UK, and as a result we are 'stuck' between them. The BBC has a hard choice between using a system that people are familiar with, and using the system they are 'supposed too'.

In reality, the BBC is a news service. Its job is to inform people of whats going on. And if they are using a system half their audience doesn't understand, they are failing at their job. Upholding convention such is a secondary aspect of their job, and presenting news in an understandable way takes priority. And so it should.

And while i share you're opinion that the BBC should support the metric system as much as it can, simply refusing to use the imperial system isn't going to do that, its going to simply ignore the people who don't know the system. This is not a failing of the BBC. There should be a bigger push to educate those peoples of the metric system.

My suggestion, if i could make one, is that the reporters mention everything in metric. But in the corner of the screen, have the translation into Imperial for those who don't know it. Sure it takes a bit of work, but hopefully it will make the transition a bit easier for those familiar with the imperial system while supporting the metric system.

During summer there are often droughts and the water levels in lakes drop so low that we have power blackouts because we can't generate enough electricity. This also causes energy prices to rise.

So yeah power prices are not that great in NZ. And it's set to get worse.",0,1361998778,null,0,false,0,c8msq8w,t3_19bfqk,t1_c8msq8w,t1_c8mjipp,null,1431429929,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Also, yes, I think busy platforms would be a major issue. With full automation I suspect busy stations would have to get walls [like the ones in Paris Metro](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Paris_Metro_St_Lazare.jpg), or something of that nature anyway.

The real problem today is we have an economy that depends upon consumer spending while the consumers are increasingly squeezed due to globalisation. The easy flight of money means the world is becoming a race to the bottom where everyone tries to cut taxes on the wealthy. This has seriously undermined the ability of people to afford the very things necessary to drive the economy. As a result people leaned on debt.

What needs to happen is a serious rethink of how our economy works. This is in two stages:

1. Get rid of this idea that ever increasing house prices are good. This just ties up our income in an ""investment"" that is illiquid. We should not be pouring all our money into mortgage payments and it is incredibly damaging that this continues to grow.

2. Work out how to answer the big question. Restoring the consumers share of the economic pie in an era of globalisation.

There is one final big reform we can take on and that is to end pyramid scheme retirement plans.

The only thing that can knee cap the west is the upcoming energy crisis. While oil might not be ""running out"" it has reached a point where prices are problematic.

In addition, the UK gives £100m+ in aid to several countries, including Ethiopa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Tanzania, the DR of Congo, and Sudan.

Even if only stuff about the middle east reached the news (which isn't the case, see Libya), it doesn't mean the UK doesn't do stuff about famine and war outside of it.  

&gt; Iraq never had WMDs

But we thought they did.  That, as a *casus belli*, after what they did to the Kurds wasn't such a bad one.  War was passed in a democratic process as well, something of a first, and a precedent setter.  

&gt; Who traind the Taliban

The taliban as trained in response to a perceived soviet threat.  Although I haven't studied the period in depth, I am certain it was nt a black and white decision, and certainly not an easy one.  However, in hindsight, it was a bad decision, and one that gives a moral reason to help sort out the mess as much as an oily one.",0,1361999535,null,0,false,0,c8mt0bi,t3_19bhx1,t1_c8mt0bi,t1_c8mr0ni,null,1431430073,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The criticism of Gomez has always been that he needs others to create chances for him, but he's great at finishing and has been banging in the goals for Germany and Bayern. He's also had almost zero competition for his spot in both Germany and Bayern, his only competition was an aging Klose in both squads. Now that Bayern have a more complete forward in their starting lineup, you can really notice the difference that it makes and how much more dangerous they are because of Mandzukic. Gomez would stick out even more in Pep's system, because he wants his CF and midfield to be the creative hub of his team. Someone like Suarez or Falcao, they've been linked with both, would add so much more their attack and the creative capability of the team.

The principle reasons for the current situation have been well-understood for a long time, but because these problems take decades to surface there is little incentive for any particular government to do anything about it until it is too late.

Energy prices will rise considerably in the coming half-decade for a number of reasons:

- The U.K. has moved from a net exporter to a net importer of gas, thanks to North Sea oilfield yields dropping.

- The European Union’s *[Large Combustion Plant Directive](http://www.defra.gov.uk/industrial-emissions/eu-international/lcpd/)* has meant a number of coal-fired power stations are going to be turned off in the next two years. The amount they contribute to the National Grid is, collectively, more than our total renewables output. The LCPD was introduced in 2001 so it’s hardly a surprise.

- Other power stations are reaching their end-of-life.

- Volatile weather conditions mean that electricity suppliers have to price in more risk to account for imbalance costs. (The stock prices paid by companies when they have bought too much or too little energy from the market. These *system buy/sell prices* are highly volatile.)

The last Labour government spent 9 years sitting on their hands when they should have been laying the groundwork for replacing our ageing baseload generators (principally coal-fired) with nuclear and renewables. Renewables are pretty quick to set up, but generate little power consistently, and nuclear takes decades to get into place.

This is a strange statement for you to make given that you said Pep would move Gomez since he didn't fit into the system.  I don't think Pep is known for making sentimental decisions.  You didn't argue that it was, but the Eto-o deal, for instance, is a great example.  Eto'o wanted a bunch more money and Inter was ready to swap Ibra, a superior player, for him plus cash.  I don't see Pep getting rid of Gomez, a younger player and more prolific scorer, to bring in Ibra when he isn't an improvement (in the system) for Bayern.

The whole issue here is that this is all massive conjecture (aside from the good quote you found showing Ibra's desire to play for Bayern), and you, and others, are taking things as a given.  There isn't even a single semi-credible source I can find that is reporting on rumblings of getting rid of Gomez.

Yup, agreed. The highlight tonight.

Abysmal is a bit strong - but he was very poor and continuously made poor touches. He did make a few strong runs though but I still can't help but feel that our formation is affecting him a bit. Ba hasn't scored for what.... 7ish games now? Our formation is undoubtedly to blame for our striker's poor return rate.

&gt; *Rafa made all of his subs before 80'*

Yeah I know! Surprising. I was surprised by how little time Marin got tonight though, considering Hazard/Oscar/Moses will probably be used against West Brom this weekend.

&gt;*Marin is the only one in our squad that can take set pieces*

Bit of an irrational statement there. IIRC he only took 2 set pieces and I know for a fact 1 of them didn't reach anyone. Set pieces are really poor throughout our team at the moment. Rarely reaching our players which is in stark contrast to what was happening at the beginning of the season.

Gomez is a poacher, for sure, but I think he could fit into the system still.  Barca doesn't really play with an out-and-out striker, at least not since before Guardiola had the huge success with them that he did.  So he may be surplus.

More than anything I'm lamenting that such a talented player could be deemed unnecessary and be let go.  I'd gladly take Gomez plus £20million + for Suarez :)",0,1362003095,null,0,false,0,c8muazn,t3_19c5d5,t1_c8muazn,t1_c8mt3sn,null,1431430779,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If anyone wants to throw the old ""ten fingers"" argument into the mix, check this out:  

Each finger has 3 bones, so I can count those sections of my fingers, and on one hand this adds up to twelve, but if I use the left hand like that, and my right hand as a multiplier, I can count to 48 (40 in base 12) on my fingers. 

Eg. 1st finger on right hand points to 2nd bone on third finger on left hand- that's 8. 2nd finger on right hand points to first bone on first finger of left hand, that's 13.

**Edit 2**: WOW. He just went and criticised the board before storming off. Very explosive press conference. 

&gt; ""Why put 'interim' in title? Why did they need to do that? Maybe they (board) thought: 'He was at Liverpool so we put 'interim' in'""

&gt; (on our fans) ""[they] must get behind the team or they will be in the Europa League next season""

Very true.

I just think that is BS.  Ibra didn't fit the team, yet Guardiola went out of his way to swap him for Eto-o who did fit the team and system?  

Further, I don't think you can separate Pep's system from his team.  His system was heavily based on his team.  It will be interesting to see how he plays at Bayern, as you can make a strong argument that Barca's system wasn't really Pep's, it was Barca's.  I think he would've played that way anyway, but it's just speculation.

true,DecreasingCircles,null,null,"It'll be sourced from anywhere local in the uk. Tesco has a central purchasing team who generally purchase stuff like tvs, kitchen utensils etc. Over the past couple of years they have been letting this team buy other stuff, such as beef for promotions as they believe they can get better prices.

Traditionally they had a few approved meat processors they would work with. The meat processors would buy the meat from tesco approved abattoirs, who in turn would buy the cattle from tesco approved farms. This works fairly well as everyone is in charge of their own raw materials and final product in the chain. Most abattoirs and farms have been approved by multiple supermarkets, the only thing that's different is the individual spec.

The problem is, tesco's share price hasn't been sitting too pretty at the moment and their marketshare is being nibbled at, so they've been looking at ways to save money and make the shareholders, who are used to seeing year on year growth, happy again. As protein is one of the things consumers specifically look at the price of when choosing where to shop and the price of protein has been shooting higher thanks to global demand, it's fallen under the spotlight as a section where money can be saved.

Tesco now buy all the beef carcasses direct from the abattoirs and make the meat processors compete on their processing costs to win the business. The theory is that instead of a few processors calling up various abattoirs to fill their orders, essentially competing against each other, the call is coming from one place. Tesco also now have complete transparency on the beef prices (because you can be sure the processors bumped them up when they needed to).

All this horse meat scandal has done is give tesco a reason to roll their central purchasing scheme out across more products, which is exactly how that email read to me.If they control what's bought for their products they should, in theory, know exactly what's going into them. 

Realistically though, unless they are going to start testing more thoroughly (which would only add cost onto the £/kg of beef) this changes nothing for the consumer. The fact is, supermarkets keep most of the meat industry on a knife's edge profit wise, and this will only make it worse. there's always scummy people about trying to make quick cash and tesco aren't changing that.",0,1362005358,null,0,false,0,c8mv3ny,t3_19chvs,t1_c8mv3ny,t3_19chvs,null,1431431131,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

It is tantamount to saying that *no disabled person is worthy of life*, whereas saying that abortion *might* be the right thing in *certain* circumstances is not to commit oneself to the worthiness of human life either way. 

The point of the analogy is to point out that ""put down all the disabled children"" is analogous to saying ""gas the Jews"", it's a judgment about a category of people.

The ideology that degrees are useless unless it's IT (Computing/Computer Science etc), Science, Maths or Engineering pisses me off no end.  

It's tripe and elitism. People who spout that nonsense do so when they have no idea what courses entail. Degrees aren't easy, whether it's Quantum Mechanics or Photography: they're hard in their own way. I knew people studying Fashion and Textiles at University and their work load was like nothing I've ever seen before. They were the hardest working people I knew at University, clocking ridiculous amounts of hours a week outside of lectures and seminars working their arses off. Just because a course isn't Science, Maths, Computing or Engineering orientated, it doesn't mean they're ""Micky Mouse degrees"".  

  


I studied Creative Writing and English Language and it was fucking hard. This September I'm starting a PGCE so by next year, I'll be a qualified English Teacher.

On the one hand, people are saying that loyalty to the club should prevail, and the manager be helped as much as he can be to do well. Benitez should be left to do the job he has been employed to do, not be lampooned and berated by fans who (to some extent fairly) hate him for his Liverpool connections and comments made

On the other hand you have fans also citing loyalty to the club, in that they don't want Benitez for the same reasons mentioned above, and will say that the club IS the fans and their wishes shouldnt be entirely ignored.

But let's be pragmatic: Roman will always do what he wants, so we're going to have to suck it up for now and support the dude whose job it is. Fair play to Benitez: he has kept his cool thus far in the face of some pretty fucking childish behaviour. 

I don't think he's been the best manager either, far less the best decision, but why on EARTH would I be keen to see him made even LESS able to gain his squads respect because of their own fans.

true,jimofwales,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"Ok, wood is not *much* cheaper, the average cost of wood chip with 20% moisture content is around 3.9p/kWh (if you buy it buy the tonnne, which most people don't). Wood pellets are closer to 5p/kWh, again if you buy it by the tonne. Mains gas is around 4.5p/kWh. Wood logs are much the same if you buy from a supplier in bulk, but you need more physical space to store them as they have a high moisture content. 

So on that basis wood is around the same cost as gas. However, an A-rated combi is now about 90% efficient and you can buy one for about 2k. A high efficiency biomass boiler is likely to cost £8k+ for similar efficiency. It would take longer than the lifetime of the system to pay back the difference. Stoves and open fires are around 60% and 20% respectively.

The CO2 issue is also extremely complex, any basic guide to heating will wheel out the old 'CO2 is reabsorbed by the lifetime of the system'...but latest studies tell otherwise. We really should be sequestering the carbon from wood, rather than reburning it. Also wood releases other particulates with a high global warming potential than CO2, so it can actually have a much bigger effect than burning natural gas. 

Also, unless it's done on a fairly small scale, wood burning is fairly selfish, there's nowhere near enough to go around for more than a handful of people in this country, it can be really bad for local air pollution and open fires in your home are extremely bad for your health.

I know he's [Abromovich] is trying to dump some money into the local infrastructure around the club which is nice, but I think he'd lose the fans if they weren't so attached to his *blank check* style of ownership. 

They can have the trophies under him. It's all about the club and the fans. I've only been a Liverpool supporter since mid 2009 so I haven't seen much compared to other supporters of this club, yet I'd still rather have a respectable operation with organic successes in lieu of buying trophies.

I actually just looked up his statistics on WhoScored and they have him at 8.8 **accurate** long balls per game. That's pretty ridiculous.  

Pirlo is at 10.6 accurate long balls per game ^what ^the ^fuck , Yaya Toure is at 6 per game, and Xavi is at 7.9 per game, so it's not like this is uncommon in possession based systems. The players just need to be accurate with their long balls.

I know it's possibly an unfair comparison, as they are both alpha world cities. However, if Northern Ireland wants to improve it's tourism, it's necessary to either excel in, or at least be a prime example of something. Right now, it lacks a strong definition.

I think McIlroy exemplified it well when he mentioned that he felt more strongly British than Irish, only for people to advise him to reconsider that standpoint from a business perspective. From a tourism standpoint, Irishness is a more appealing identity to exert, as opposed to Britishness. ""British"" as a term, to the rest of the world, is largely owned by the English. Northern Ireland's ""Britishness"" is merely a strange appropriation amplified by some locals. An echo.

I honestly think, as a source of appeal to outsiders, the native culture of the island could be adopted more by the area. That's just my opinion, from a slightly cynical, businesslike perspective.

Why? Germany is the worst example ever you could have thought of. Home ownership in Germany is amongst the lowest on the entire planet, most people rent in Germany, even in to old age, it's incredibly rare to actually purchase property.

If you want to get a mortgage in Germany the banks normally make you agree to pass it on to your children and even your grand children to in a legally binding contract, it's really tough. Added to that there's no minimum wage in Germany and things are quite hard for normal people at the moment, Germany isn't some paradise like people think it is.

In regards to him going to United, it is all just rumours, don't believe what you hear unless it is from Chelsea themselves.

2. The main reason people hate Benitez is the fact that he used to be a rival manager (for Liverpool). Also, during his time at Lpool, he made comments insulting Chelsea fans. 

3. Personally I believe that all matter, but lately people seem to be most focused on getting in the Champions League next season (4th place). I don't think a true fan genuinely wouldn't mind at all if we went out of the FA Cup, it is just a matter of priority's, and right now the league is the priority. The main reason for this is that all the top players and managers in the world want to play for a Champions League team, and if we don't make it we will have a harder time getting the top players.

You think his lack of effort is a myth, I think this idea that he is great at holding the ball is a myth. he gives away the ball immediately a great proportion of the time. We all know he is very capable of controlling a difficult ball, yet he is failing to control easy ones. There is no good reason for a 6'3"" technically-proficient striker to have a lower take-on success rate than a 5'7"" poacher, yet Adebayor has managed to be worse than JD Trouble. For more comparison - He has had worse pass completion, had fewer interceptions per match, and has had no assists to Defoe's three. I don't see a player working hard where he is performing worse at tasks he has natural gifts for than someone who does not at all.

A player this good performing this badly under his circumstances has no-one to blame but himself. He has an excellent manager, dedicated and amicable team-mates and a set of fans ready and willing to love him again - myself included. He just needs to put in a few good shifts.

On the ACON issue - in any other profession, it is not up to your employer to charter you a jet when you double-book yourself. Even your parody of me sounds reasonable enough. he should have done whatever he could to get back to London in order to fulfill his commitments, and he didn't. It is not unreasonable to expect your employee to do all they reasonably can to be at work on time, and that includes buying your own bloody plane tickets to get back home, especially when you're on 170 grand a week. I wasn't seriously suggesting that he should have chartered a plane, rather pointing out that if he has the means do that, he can be reasonably expected to sort out his own transport, not rely on his impoverished federation. He then has the gall to say he sees letting down his team's fans as a joke, rather than apologise for being late.

Our disagreement is over whether he did enough to get back from South Africa, and his work ethic. I honestly don't see him working hard. I also think he didn't do enough to get back after the ACON. You take the opposite view, and I fully respect that. I really wasn't trying to start a slagging match. I harbour no real resentment for Ade, I'm more frustrated at how poorly he is playing. I was a little hyperbolic in my first post, for which I apologise, on the back of his performance against West Ham, which I though was very poor.

Can anyone look at any of those games (save for maybe the Swansea game) and think that we should not have gotten more out of them, had we been better prepared tactically or made better tactical adjustments?

We wouldn't even be worried about qualifying for a UCL spot had he gotten it right in these relatively easy league games (City being the obvious outlier). Now that we're slipping down to fourth with a difficult run of games to come in the league, it's suddenly the supporters' fault for protesting a lack of consistency from the team and the tactics deployed by the manager?

IMO, he cannot leave Stamford Bridge quickly enough (slight pun intended). ",0,1362018099,null,0,false,0,c8mzcze,t3_19csbf,t1_c8mzcze,t3_19csbf,null,1431433199,14,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,14

true,YoungFoxyandFree,present,null,"Glad to have you on board and these are some great questions. I'll try and add to what **kais33** has already posted:

1. Frank Lampard is indeed a legend and the highlight of this season for me will be when he scores number 203. However, Lampard and a lot of other core players that led Chelsea to winning the Champions League are getting older and recently management has been pushing a strong youth movement, thus the reluctance to re-sign players over 30 to more than a one-year contract. As for Lampard changing clubs, I haven't heard United rumors since the summer. The most likely situations I've read recently were to the MLS (probably LA Galaxy) or somewhere in Italy (I think Lazio), but I hope he stays.

2. Yeah he was the manager of a hated rival at a time when they were top competition in both domestic and European matches and he insulted the Chelsea fanbase. I would say a majority of Chelsea supporters would have him as the last person they would want managing the club. He also replaced Roberto Di Matteo who is a club legend as both player and manager. Supposedely he was brought in to cure Torres, but I personally think he was brought in as a scapegoat. The club never wanted to keep Di Matteo this season, but had no choice after what he accomplished. The club gets someone who is already disliked to replace a legend, do some dirty work (get rid of old players), and precede the replacement manager next season who will be immediately accepted (times gazillion if its Mourinho), Rafa gets a chance to prove he can manage at the top level and try to build his resume at a club built to win trophies.

3. Pretty much covered it. I agree, I want to win all matches and competitions, but CL qualification is priority which means weaker lineups in cups if top players need rest. There is also more money involved with CL qualification and that money is important with Financial Fair Play coming into effect. With Roman money is not a problem, but under FFP its important to spend what we earn.

4. Torres definitely receives the most abuse due to his lacking performance and high price tag combo. Many supporters are also fed up with Malouda who is unwilling to accept lower wages in order to facilitate a move to a different club. No club will take him so he's been relegated to training with the youth team. There is also a pocket of fans who dislike Mikel for a perceived slowness or lack of productivity in his play. I think he's crucial to our midfield and its terrifying watching other teams counter if he's not on the pitch. The Mourinho era players are the most loved for what they were able to accomplish together. Terry, Lampard (particularly with his contract situation right now), Cole, and Cech are the current players, but Drogba is my favorite. Since his departure though my favorite has to be Mata--he's unreal. I can't claim to be the most veteran fan either so I'll let others speak of older club legends with the respect they deserve.

5. For the bullet points I'm pretty sure you just need a space between the asterisk and your text.",0,1362029160,null,0,1362029365,0,c8n32mi,t3_19d6c2,t1_c8n32mi,t1_c8myx8u,null,1431435092,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

true,Howells122,UA,ukraine,"The FA cup gives you £1,800,000 for winning and the UEFA Europa League gives you €5,000,000 for winning. Do you know how much revenue is generated from qualifying in the champions league alone? JUST for getting to the group stage you get  €8,600,000. Not to mention that broadcasting and merchandising for the champions league is significantly higher in than the FA cup or Europa League. This does not include prize money for winning matches either. If we do not get Champions league football we lose a shit ton of money. With FFP coming up we cannot sacrifice this. ""Some kind"" of money will not sustain us. 

Most importantly for our clubs future and stability, do you honestly think any respectable manager (mourinho imo the only one to fix our club) will come to us if we don't finish top four, but win FA or Europa? Fuck. No.

United, City, Madrid, Barca, Milan, Bayern etc do not give a shit about their respective cup competitions or Europa League. If we want to be regarded as a top club, we should focus on whats important, that is the Champions League. This is modern Football. 

&gt;If we said ""Fuck the FA and Europa, let's just play for Fourth place"", that would be to worst managing I'd ever seen. 

You mean how RDM said fuck the Domestic Title I'm going for Champions League?

If we win both of those trophies and do not finish top four, this season is a failure. If we lose both those trophies and finish top four, this season will be a success. 

I am being realistic.  Tottenham are in the best form in a long time. Arsenal are not in top form, but I would not count them out just yet. We are behind Tottenham and still have to play them, Liverpool, United, Everton, and Swansea. The other two do not have that difficult task. If you are optimistic, Bless you. 

I'm confused how you do not understand this.

true,therealodayaka,tardis,TARDIS,"I'm understand that the concept of marriage has changed over time, however I'm speaking from a modern concept (and one that is heavily reinforced by media).  And speaking from experience, it has been a major hurdle for my husband and I to reconcile our different sexual needs.  My husband is a person who has always found attachment and bonding in sex, while I find those things in other ways (spending time together, talking at length about a thing, cuddling--as examples) and sex is not necessary or even desired on my part to have a relationship with him.

For the longest time, I was convinced there was something wrong with me, that I was broken, because I didn't desire sex.  It felt good, but was not something I always enjoyed or wanted.  While my husband has always been supportive, it is still frustrating for him that our sexual needs are different.  He desires that bond that sex brings for him.

I've been told I was just ""going through a phase,"" and I've had my mother send me to a doctor because she thought there was something wrong with me.  My doctor agreed that there was nothing medically wrong with me and wrote it off as just a phase as well.  It wasn't and isn't.  

So while it's not always a hurdle for other people, it certainly was (and still is) for me and my husband.  It's something we talk about on a regular basis however and it's our good communication that has kept our relationship together.  I can very easily see a couple falling apart over a difference in libido.

Discovering asexuality as a label and as a group helped me realize there was nothing wrong with not wanting sex.  That I wasn't broken, I am perfectly find, I just don't enjoy sex as much as the media says I should.

I'm not saying my journey is the same as everyone's, I'm saying this to give you a different perspective, that's all.

**TL;DR** : I had quite a few hurdles in my relationship with my husband as I discovered my lack of desire for sex.  Asexuality is showing a lot of people like myself who live in a sex-saturated culture that it is okay to not want or like sex.",0,1362033866,null,0,1362034081,0,c8n49r2,t3_19ajbo,t1_c8n49r2,t1_c8ms75v,null,1431435682,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Have you heard the anti-rafa songs lately? There are few and far between. He is supposed to be a professional football manager. it doesn't happen all the time, maybe on the boards it does, but I really doubt he reads those. Shouldn't he be watching the match rather than the fans banners?

Saying that Chelsea made a huge mistake giving him the interim title now is a little late isn't it? Did he know he was going to be given that title? I think so. I actually don't blame the board, I think they would have been aware to some extent of the hatred of Benitez from long term fans.

Benitez also took the job, he knew he had previously made derogatory statements about Chelsea and the clubs fans but refused to apologise. If that was all just PR then why wouldn't he just apologise? 

Benitez is also being paid a lot money by the club to manage our team, he has had an awful run of results, especially against our main rivals, and made some terrible decisions in games. he has also failed to flog the Torres dead horse like so many believed he would be able to.

He's lost the fans, the board and the players and you want to criticise the fans around the ground for this?

My sister is 56. When she bought her first home, in Nottingham around 1980, she took on an £8000 mortgage for a two-up two-down terrace house.

I'm 48. When I bought my first home, in Leeds in 1987, I took on a £29,000 mortgage for a reasonably-large one bedroom flat (with box room).

Deposits in those days were on the order of 5%-10%, so you needed to put down £3000 to get on the ladder.

Then prices went silly. That flat of mine? I sold it a year later for £40,000 at the height of the bubble. (Used the proceeds to go back to uni and re-skill.) Things stagnated until 1994-5ish, then took off like a rocket. I bought in again in 1995; when I moved, in 2006, my flat had more than tripled in ""value"".

Note scare quotes. This isn't real money; it's some kind of weird derivative based on demand for housing. You can't make a profit from it unless you move somewhere cheaper/smaller. I reckon the engine driving the huge inflation in the price of entry-level housing was the privatization of higher education in the 90s, combined with a housing bubble: parents sending their teen-age offspring to uni would remortgage the family house, buy a flat to house the student, then sell the flat when they finished their degree -- turning a profit that would pay off the student loans as well as the second mortgage. Maybe even making a profit. 

This process decoupled the price of an entry level flat or house from its historical anchor, the mortgageable income of a young person buying their first home, and geared it to the mortgageable assets of an established middle-class couple. So prices shot up, and in the housing bubble, who was asking questions?

Now we've got a headache: young folks can't afford to buy a home. But it's a political poisoned chalice -- the only way to tackle it effectively would be to deflate the housing market by about 60-70%, thus destroying a gigantic pool of ""wealth"". It'd also kick the plank out from under what's left of our retail banking industry because mortgages are (or were) their bread and butter. (Note: retail banking is not the same as investment banking, where the 2007-08 crisis hit hardest.) Nobody in politics is talking about this because it's utterly unacceptable to say ""we urgently need to burn £40Tn because that money doesn't really exist and it's fucking up millions of peoples' lives"".

true,itsmoirob,null,null,"&gt;I don't think the subreddit is decided evenly at all. There was much discussion about how horrible of a decision it was when he was appointed and now there is even more discussion about the decisions he has made.

As I mentioned in my reply to /u/Auxiere the reason people agree is because those that dont get downvoted and give up not commenting at all. 

&gt;The players have hinted not liking him either, which is touched on in some of the articles.

Cant comment on this. I rarely read newspapers. Often papers cite their source as ""someone close to the club,"" or anther newspaper. Unless I see/hear an actual player come out and say that I don't take anyone elses word on their views.

&gt;I don't see the fans booing him and having a common feeling of dislike towards him having much impact on the players. 

Obviously thats a matter of opinion. But even we are having this discussion and we arent connected to the club (apart from being fans) so having to hear that each time you go to your home ground could have an affect. Even if it is ""I hope the boss makes a desicion and dumps this guy so the fans start to cheer us."" When was the last time Chelsea walked on to Stamford Bridge and didnt hear ""boo""

&gt;Considering they share the same negative feeling towards him, they don't view the fans as an issue. Benetiz is the problem through and through. The fans are still behind the team 100%, just not Benetiz.

No offence, thats just a lot of opinions and assumptions you have taken and put together. 

All I'm saying is, the heading to this article is ludicrous. When linking to news articles is better form to not editorialise.

Torres is under performing but I think you will find most games we get beat it's probably because we lose the midfield battle.

What I also want to say is truly world class strikers are near impossible to find. Probably only RVP, Suarez and Aguero are the best 3 in the premier league. Arsenal, Tottenham dont have world class strikers. Now even Man City have Dzeko, Tevez and previously Balotelli only really Aguero cemented his side in their squad with their service. Being a striker is the hardest thing in football at the moment. I look at Bayern and I see they persisted with Klose and Gomez and now Mandzukic (spelling may be wrong) and I'm not even sure if they are 100 % happy. I look at Barca and see players like Henry and Zlatan not do that great even with their service. I look at Real Madrid and it seems not even Benzema or Higuain can cement a place in the side.

Even in areas where prices haven't dropped they have not increased inline with inflation.  (Parts of London are unique and go against this but if you can afford those places good luck to you). 
There are costs associated with buying and selling a house and these need to be factored in to your ""investment"". 
If you plan to live in where you buy for 10 years you will ride out the bumps in the economy, less than 5 years and buying is a mistake. This is very relevant if buying your first home, what happens if you change job and have to move? 
Don't even consider interest only, you are effectively renting but carrying all the risk and additional costs. 
The idea of high home ownership isn't unique to the UK but it certainly isn't the norm across Europe.  
I own my own house.  When I sell it I won't be buying again until I know it's going to be my home for around a decade.  
Don't rush into it just because you think it's the done thing.  You are taking on a large risk.  Don't be fooled by people who base their justification for buying over renting based on the old markets.  UK house prices are still overvalued, that's why you can't afford it, they are going through a period a adjustment and that will continue for at least 5 more years.  It's happening here in a gentler way than in somewhere like Spain but in real terms house prices will be significantly lower in 2017 than 2007. It just won't feel like it as wages have also stalled.

------

I think it's a very strange way to deal with the problem. Really, we want to legislate and regulate banks so they aren't taking excessive risks.

If a bank is legitimately earning money at no cost to the state and no risk to the consumer then there's no reason to limit their ability to pay their employees in relation to how much they're bringing in. If employee x consistently brings in £3m/year and his bonus is capped at £200k, you're going to find some way to compensate him or fear him leaving for somebody else who will. Caps would simply be making compensation more complex and harder to track.

Conversely if the bank is still ""too big to fail"" with poor risk management, their employees will still make risky decisions based on that distorted risk/reward situation. Likewise, if they're under taxed relative to other industries their profits will still be too large. Finally, if we decide the wealthy are earning too much, that should be fixed with tax rates that affect everyone.

Capping bonuses would do little to remedy any of this - there's an argument that bankers take risks for personal gain, but it's just as much an actively instilled corporate culture. Further, at present those risks make economic sense for the bank because states will subsidise them if they go horribly wrong.

Stupid bonuses are a symptom, not a cause. It's possibly a temporary solution for state supported banks, but then you just risk losing their top employees.

Liverpool fans need to accept that Benitez is not the manager he was at Liverpool or Valencia. He proved so much at Inter, and now he's making it even more evidently clear. I know you guys have a thing about holding on to the past, but the rest of us try to live in the present, and the present situation is that Rafa has been a joke.

The first few games, the booing Rafa received was mainly down to the fan's hurt at Robbie being sacked. Then we got some good results, and it was mainly the hardcore who dissented. Then when it all started going wrong, the fans grew more and more dissatisfied. Nobody chanted at Rafa for the sake of it - he got flack for cocking up the CWC, for leading us to a 2-2 draw at Brentford, for leading us to losing 1-0 at home to QPR. For his idiotic tactical decisions, for fielding a team who look absolutely lost and clueless about what they're supposed to be doing. And so then it's not just the hardcore.

As for last night, well, there was one or two chants from the away support, but nothing major. You have to consider though that these 2000 travelling fans are the hardcore - the hardcore that follow the team wherever they may be, even to a FA Cup tie in Middlesborough on a Wednesday night in February, a tie that was arranged with only 10 days notice.

Until recently it was famous for it's game design industry, being responsible for the original Grand Theft Auto games, as well as the Crackdown series and the original version of APB, before the company behind it collapsed.  Recently that industry has been more focused on smaller companies making games for mobile devices.

2. Dundee is famous for being the home of the Discovery, the arctic exploration vessel used by Robert F Scott, for it's journalism, being the home of D.C Thompson, the birthplace of popular national childrens comics the Dandy and Beano, as well as the Scottish Classic, Oor Wullie.  Because of this and other production industries, Dundee gained the title of ""The city of jute, jam and journalism"".

3. Dundee really only celebrates national holidays.  If we have our own, I've just completely missed them.

4. A sizable amount of Dundonians leave school at 16 to pursue a delightful life of benefits and minimum wage employment, but some will stay in high school til they are 18 to get Highers, the next level of qualification, which is required to enter University for degree level education.  There are two universities in Dundee, Dundee University and the University of Abertay.  Abertay is famous for it's game design and ethical hacking classes while Dundee has a more prestigious research reputation.

5.  Football, video games, heroin and milling about street corners.

6. The nature aspect of Dundee is, by comparison to most of Scotland,  fairly average.

It's also completely pointless. Pretty much anybody's parents who tell their child to take the IB deserve shooting [unless you're going for a foreign uni!]. It's far more work than A levels for something which is incredibly undervalued by both employers and unis. 

To give you an idea of just how retarded the IB is, a friend of mine was doing one; he would be in college from 9-4 on 3 days, 10-3 on one &amp; 9-3 on another (+/- an hour or two over the week) &amp; would then have to do an insane amount of work at home just to keep up with a decent enough grade. When he got out, he got out with slightly better results than I &amp; the other people I know doing A-Levels did but ended up going to a similar-tier uni to us. I, and most others I knew, went through the two years of A-levels plodding along doing perhaps an hour of work a day outside of college, with about 15-16ish hours in college a week. 

So, he did about 2x+ as much work as we did, got to a near-depressed state because of it &amp; hated his life for two years. For what? The simple fact is, is that if I had put in the same amount of work that he did; I, you and most other people would've walked out with 3 A stars (reddit's formatting) whilst he walked out with the equiv of approx AAB-AAAish (Oxbridge is approx AstarAA-AstarAstarAish, with a bit more on top) ; he would've easily ended up at one of the Oxbridge unis had he not done the IB.

Its a car loan.

Liverpool seem to remember him as a masterful tactician, which is a fair enough claim for his period at Anfield, however, from watching Chelsea this season it is evident he is not, at least not anymore.

It's all about what Clausewitz called the Economy Of Force. Think about it, if I grab some folk off the street and get killed doing so, I'm out of the game for the cost of a few bullets and some (relatively) minor damage. Fairly cheap.

Now, if I, say, steal a lorry, pack it with half a ton of ANFO and detonate it next to a government building, get away before the detonation and kill most of the staff in the building, I'm still in the game while dealing exceptional damage to a target. Very expensive. Hell, even on a suicide attack that's cost-effective.

The idea is to be as expensive as possible. Do as much damage with as little as possible.

The US military came up with an interesting implementation of this called CARVER (Criticality, Accessibility, Recuperability, Vulnerability, Effect and Recognizability). Basically, survey every building, compound and piece of infrastructure around ranking them 1 to 10 in each category (1 is lowest, 10 is highest). Add up the total and find out which one has the highest score. That's the target you hit with the most force.

This is exactly what banks said they'd do. Instead of paying 100,000K + 400,000K in bonuses, they'll just yank the salary up so they can give 500,000K to people combined, by raising salaries.. 

Except they won't be able to scale back pay for underperforming bankers, and they won't be able to 'claw back' bonuses when capital is tight.

Which means that they'll likely be more hesitant to hire people and in addition be much less willing to lend money as more of it is tied into salaries. 

Issues that no non-EU bank will have to deal with, making our financial institutions less competitive **and** less stable.

These blocks will be going in place without a hearing, a full trial, any sort of defence or any cross-examination of the BPI's evidence. This means there is nothing stopping anyone from coming after any other site.

Let's say someone decides to come after Reddit; they file a claim with the High Court, saying that they are a major copyright owner, that Reddit is full of infringing content (which, to be fair, it probably is under English law), that they have all this evidence that it is costing them huge amounts of money and blocking it is a proportionate response.

The judge then looks at this, has nothing else to base his decision on (due to the ISPs - the defendants - not caring and being too scared of costs orders to get involved) and orders the block.

This is not justice. In an adversarial court system it isn't enough for justice that a judge rubber-stamp these orders - justice requires a full trial. But that's expensive, and the people running these sites (or caring about wide-scale web-blocking) can't afford them.

&gt; Blocking orders have a significant impact on usage of illegal websites.
In five European countries where blocks were imposed on The Pirate Bay (Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Italy and UK), usage levels fell 69 per cent during the full year (ComScore/Nielsen). By contrast, in
countries without the block, traffic rose by 45 per cent. There was also a wider correlation with levels of BitTorrent piracy. The five countries with the block saw a 7 per cent increase in BitTorrent use in 2012, compared with an increase of 22 per cent for countries without the block.

Unfortunately they don't provide any more details for that citation so we have no idea how accurate that data is, whether it counts people who have started using proxies, or whether it takes into account pre-block levels and changes in use of these sites.

In particular, if true, I note that they claim use of TPB dropped by 69% after putting in place blocks... which suggests that at least 31% of users are able to completely ignore the block. I imagine they didn't tell that to the judge in this case.

Plus earlier in the report they note that shutting down MegaUpload and blocking TPB in the Netherlands resulted in a massive ... 4% decrease in unlicensed music sharing.

As for legal alternatives, one of the fun things about the IFPI's DMRs is that the first 2/3rds tend to be listing all the lovely new technologies and services that are helping ~~increase their pay-cheques~~artists, with the final third listing all the terrible, evil technologies and services that are killing their industry. I'm pretty certain that you can match these all up.. the good ones this year being the evil ones in previous years.

In particular, this year they go on about how great cloud storage is, while later in the report they explain how great it was that they were able to shut down a load of cloud storage services (the difference being that the ""evil"" ones were paying artists, not them). Plus even the services they ""like"" (such as Google's) they nearly killed and delayed by a few years due to squabbling over control.

well the ad was quite clear that it was proud of being 'post-gay'. I don't see the 'not gay' in isolation; they were not proud of being 'not gay' as though this were an advert from heterosexuals without a same-sex history. 

&gt; Would you support an ad on a public bus declaring pride in ""not being black.""

well the analogy doesn't make sense, as no one would be proud of being 'not' something, unless of course they *used* to be that something. The ad was saying ""we *were* gay, but now we're proud to be post-gay"". 

I think it should be pointed out that people who used to be gay and are now not do exist. and as far as I know there are not people who used to be black, who are now white (Michael Jackson excused). 

&gt;  This ad was confrontational yes, but directly expressing negativity about a minority is not a matching response.

again, I would just say there are two sides to it; it can be interpreted negatively or it could be interpreted positively. the 'not gay' was poor wording yes, but I do not believe your black/white analogy works, and I can understand why someone would *think* this was a legitimate way to word a confrontational message about the post-gay movement.

Ultimately, the fact that the banner is pushed by a religious institution with well-known archaic views on sexuality, together with the inferred assumption that being gay is actually a choice or an option in the first place puts this banner right up there with the creationists in terms of self-delusion - something that I certainly *do* find offensive, and not very....well, *christian* (as I'd define it, anyway). 

Gays have been persecuted for so long that to be proud of being open about it is still an achievement for the time being - putting up a poster suggesting that, somehow, you will be looked down upon for changing highlights how the people who think it's a really good idea a) don't really understand what they're saying and b) are heaping further insults onto the groups *they have been responsible for persecuting* for thousands of years (based on the 'evidence' of someone writing a book insisting that their god says so). Sorry, but with that history, pretending this sort of thing is making a valid point is at once insulting and laughable. Where are the posters insisting that shellfish are an abomination?

And where, exactly, did I label it as a disorder?  You mean when I thought there was something wrong with me? 

I didn't label it as a disorder.  If you've been paying attention, asexuality has actually empowered me and helped me come to terms with not wanting or enjoying sex.  That is not a disorder.  It is simply a label for my complete lack of desire for sexual intimacy.  

I have zero libido.  None.  I don't have any desire for sex.  I *can* have sex, and enjoy it, but I don't WANT it.  I don't need it at all and frankly I could go the rest of my life without it and be perfectly fine.  Just because the physical act feels pleasurable, does not mean that I have a desire to have it more often or at all even.

The problem comes in where my husband is concerned (not my own issues with lack of desire.  I've since gotten over that).  He does enjoy sex and the bonding that comes from it and this causes (or can cause) a conflict.

1.

Most major stockholders are financial houses anyway, so only ones losing out are the minority shareholders, who haven't a hope of getting remuneration policies changed. Hence the need for legislation, in the absence of political will to prosecute for fraud.


2. In the last decade I've seen that bank employees and their apologists are very good at talking about leaving. Not so good at actually leaving.

Due to the price in-elasticity of housing, people are willing to pay the demanded price.

Nobody chanted at Rafa for the sake of it - he got flack for cocking up the CWC, for leading us to a 2-2 draw at Brentford, for leading us to losing 1-0 at home to QPR. For his idiotic tactical decisions, for fielding a team who look absolutely lost and clueless about what they're supposed to be doing. And so then it's not just the hardcore.

That explains it perfectly. And we may not be in 16th place but we've gone from 4 points off 1st place to 19 points. And he lost both the CWC and COC when they should have been easily winnable.

Where I live (the southeast, not London), a house share averages £300 ($500), and studio flats average £500 ($750), but with utilities it's more like £650 ($1,000). If you're in the northern bits, it's cheaper, but I don't have the numbers.

edit: I'm probably paying tax on my flat because I live with a UK citizen and my flat isn't a 'student' flat, so that could be why.

true,quietly_bi_guy,null,null,"I'm really glad that you've found comfort and sexual identity with the rise of asexuality in the public consciousness. I really wish it were more commonly known and considered a viable identity.

Your story reminds me of a man I met last year. He is a minister by profession, and as was expected of him he married, had two children, and remained faithful to his wife. They never had much sex, but both were happy with that situation. Gradually, over time, this man came to the realization that he was gay. He eventually came out to his wife and his community, with the express intention of remaining married and celibate. While he lost his job, his relationship with his wife actually improved. She understood that his lack of desire for her wasn't her responsibility, but the result of a previously hidden aspect of his identity. At the time that I met them he had been out for at least 5 years, and he and his wife remained committed to a lifelong relationship as companions.

In contrast I know a man who was gay, out, and living in NYC in the 1970's. He was happy with his identity, but when he moved to a new city, got a new job, and wanted kids, there weren't men available who had the same goals. So he married a woman (who knew he was gay) and they had a couple kids. Eventually, their lives diverged and they divorced, but now (years later) they're friends again.

Personally, sexual compatibility was always a high priority for me when I was seeking a spouse. However, as my username indicates, I am a bisexual who intended to make a monogamous commitment; my marriage necessarily involved closing off an aspect of my sexual expression and I didn't want to cause any further strain. 

For some people sexual compatibility is trumped by other factors like emotional bonding, religious affiliations, career priorities, hobbies, politics, shared culture, child-rearing decisions, etc. Everybody has to find their own way through life, but it sure helps to have labels and education to give us an idea how other people like us get by.",0,1362062166,null,0,false,0,c8n88z9,t3_19ajbo,t1_c8n88z9,t1_c8n49r2,null,1431437515,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,safaridiscoclub,cnty-england,Reading / Gt. Yarmouth,"&gt; ""value""... Note scare quotes. This isn't real money; it's some kind of weird derivative based on demand for housing.

That is the value, though, that's how supply and demand works. If someone wasn't willing and able to pay it, then they won't have bought it. People taking mortgages they couldn't afford wasn't the banks' fault, it was people's.

The problem in the UK is that everyone wants to buy a home, in Germany, for example, more people prefer to rent. I believe it's around 90% in Berlin.

Buying a home is expensive, not only the cost of the property, but unforeseen expenses, like when your boiler breaks, and having to decorate every now and again, that in a rented property, a landlord would take care of.

Renting also gives you the freedom to up sticks and move somewhere else pretty easily, maybe within a month. Selling a house can take years.

I get that people look at houses as a retirement plan but if you rent throughout your career you can save money, when your kids move out you can downsize straight away and then save money towards your pension in bonds, stocks, ISAs, whatever, instead of stretching yourself to pay your mortgage before you retire.

Forcing people to save 12.5% for a deposit is the right way to go. It protects you against a 12.5% devaluation of your property and being ""sub-prime"" if you can't keep up repayments.

He is a ledge but at the end of the day we bought a lot of midfielders in his position.  He plays attacking midfielder and now that we bought in all these quality attacking midfielders, he is now playing as a defensive midfielder... which isn't really his position.

Some players can do it like Scholes because he is a passer but Frank isn't really that type of player to play DM.  Personally because of what he has done for the club I would want to see him being kept longer if anything for his experience but I can see why the club won't want to pay him a high wage for position we already have too many in the position.

2.  As well as what others have said, I would add Benitez also come across like a total prick.  He is not v likeable person.  If you watch his interviews and things he says.. guy is a dick and mentally seemed to have lost it in his last few year at 'pool.  One of those types that blames everyone but himself.  Just full of shit.

3.  Premiership would be most important, CL, FA, CC.  Most fans care more about winning the Premiership than CL because of local bragging rights really.

4.  Right now probably Mata.  He has a brilliant season for us.  Personally really like Oscar.  Think he can become one of the best players in the world.  Unfortunate thing is both plays the same position.

Torres is shit.  I never liked him even the first day we signed him as never rated him when he was at 'pool.  The guy has no skills and he was a one trick pony where he had pace to go past defenders so look good running past defenders to score goals.  But his first touch, ball control, dribbling is dire.  Once he got injured and lost his pace, never looked like the same player he was before.

But I dunno, maybe 'cos he is good looking or something (no homo) and come across like a nice bloke the fans gave him a lot of time.  It is only really this season he is starting to get stick whereas before he always had plenty of excuses why he was so shit.  I can't think of anyone who had being given as much time as him to do well.

This is debatable. There have been a handful of criminal convictions for file-sharing - although all following guilty please and, in some cases, under the wrong offence, so they are of limited use. Last summer there was a conviction at trial for merely running a linking site, but that may be overturned on appeal, and follows several unsuccessful prosecutions.

&gt; ...torrenting comes with the direct implication you're uploading and sharing files (the actual illegal part)

This case (and the ones like it) found that simply running a site that allowed users to upload links to content count also be illegal, under various circumstances - and under English law, simply copying is enough for infringement (which includes viewing websites without an appropriate licence, or even receiving emails containing infringing content).

&gt; More of us would be morally able to stand up and appeal the decision and be at no risk of incrimination.

Possibly; someone did try to stand up in the Newzbin2 case and was immediately threatened with a massive costs order by the Hollywood studios. Having been on the fringes of one of these types of cases myself, it is usually the massive legal costs, rather than the risk of incrimination, which is deterring people from fighting these cases.

Find a laptop cheaper elsewhere? Unless it's eBuyer, it's probably a scam, refurbished or there are hidden costs like delivery/credit card fees.

As others have said, don't go to places like PC World/Currys/Dixons/whatever DSG is called nowadays. They are universally more expensive and will try to sell you all sorts of totally useless crap like Norton Antivirus.

The best way to choose a laptop is to look for the cheapest ones with the spec you want (probably an i3, DVD drive, 15"" screen). Then look at the reviews for each model and pick based on those.

Most laptops come with a 1366x768 panel (called 720p, 768p or HD), which is really not great. I've been happy with my 15"" 1600x900 display (900p), and 1920x1080 (1080p, Full HD) is even better.

IMHO Samsung are currently on top of the laptop game - the [NP550P5C](http://www.testfreaks.co.uk/laptops/samsung-np550p5c/) and [NP350V5C](http://www.testfreaks.co.uk/laptops/samsung-np350v5c/) seem to be reviewed very well. I own an NP700Z5C and am pretty happy with it - the only problem is the Samsung software, which is kinda crap. It seems like the situation is better in Windows 8 but I haven't made the leap yet.

I am not sure whether I would recommend buying 'off-brand'/customisable laptops like the Zoostorm someone else has recommended. These often have pretty poor build quality, short battery life and issues with heat management. Other peole who sell these include PCSpecialist (who do awesome desktop PCs), Novatech, Clevo etc. 

If you're just going to use it as a desktop replacement then this probably doesn't matter too much and you'll be fine. If you want to travel with it then you might want to opt for a more expensive brand in exchange for reduced weight, better build quality etc.

I  would also tend to stay away from Dell. I find a lot of people buy their machines just because that's what they've always done. They're generally quite overpriced and the batteries die after 18 months (the replacements are normally in excess of £100). However, you may find some decent deals on the [Dell Outlet](http://www.dell.co.uk/outlet).

true,coiley,null,null,"&gt; In the UK we don't have freedom of expression or freedom of speech at all. We used to but not anymore.

That's just not true. Legal protection of freedom of expression in the UK in the last decade or so is probably the strongest it's ever been, since [Article 10 of the ECHR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights), part of UK law thanks to the Human Rights Act, gave us a positive right to free speech for the first time ever. 

It's still a heavily qualified one (compared to e.g. the US 1st amendment), but it's a lot better than what we had before, which was the *very* limited negative protection afforded by common law. 

I'm not sure when you're picturing this golden age of free speech in the UK? Limits on free expression have been around certainly for longer than the UK has (e.g. the [obscene publications act 1857](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscene_Publications_Act_1857), and even before then common law offences of publishing obscene material).",0,1362066475,null,0,false,0,c8n9dsk,t3_19e3h6,t1_c8n9dsk,t1_c8n7v46,null,1431438086,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,iamPause,lfc68,,"I was never a fan myself, and I suppose I am not really one now either, but it's like any sport: hard to appreciate until you learn the nuance.

I stumbled upon some documentary on the sport a few years back and they talked heavily about the physics. How an angle of a wing here can create X more lbs of downforce, how a pound of air pressure in the outside tires means more grip here but less there and the impact it'll have on fuel consumption.  They go on to how the decisions are made as to what to do on pit stops and when to take them; do you take 2 tires or 4, top off the tank or just fill as much as you can, etc.

We see a guy turning left and finishing 3rd (and not winning).  What they see is that the yellow flag on lap 123 allowed the driver to pit and get 4 tires vs 2 and not lose any track position, which let him take the low/inside track vs the high line and it shaved an extra few tenths of seconds off his time so now he was able to finish 3rd not 7th which gives him X more points in the title race.

Those things are football's version of understanding that it was Johnson's run down the wing that opened Suarez up in the middle to pass it to Gerrard on the right so he could shoot on target. The layman sees a goal. We see a run of fantastic play and teamwork (and a goal).

**tl;dr** It's not as dumb of a sport as you'd think.

&gt;I do not see how a message can be made offensive, simply as a result of it's source. It's like an ad hominem.

How do you make this connection, if you don't see how a phrase can be made offensive as a result of the source?

Yes, it does - it can completely change the inferrence, just as 'I love you' from (say) Emma Watson would mean something completely different from if Charles Manson said it.

But say we pissed off Russia one day and they sent a few ICBM's over to London.

The USA would be looking at complete devastation if it decided to strike back at Russia on our behalf. 

So the options are lose the UK as an ally or lose 100M+ people to nuclear weapons. 

It's not even a choice. No country is going to commit suicide like that. 

The **only** use of these treaties are as a deterrent. Once the nuclear weapons are used the treaties become useless. They failed a deterrent and no one's going to do anything. 

I think Japan is a good example to use. If China nuked Japan, the US would just stand by and do fuck all despite the defense treaties in place.

If you own property because your parents had it that seems reasonable enough, at first glance, but then you find their parents got it through profiteering from slavery. So, this property exists in your hands as a direct result of human suffering, no it isn't *your* fault and it would be irrational to want to reduce the *quality* of your own life, but where is the philosophical basis for property. It doesn't come from labour, things you produce or work you do; it comes from a demand for land. So now, the property you own, which is based on an ethically murky basis, is now keeping you wealthy which is *entirely* based on the fact that other people don't have as much land as you, reducing the *quality* of their life.

This isn't about prosecution or persecution over people for the actions of their ancestors, this is about a philosophical justification for *why* wealth should or shouldn't be redistributed.

well, no, the point is we're not just talking about any one particular person. offense is subjective. 

&gt;  at that point, you've lost them and no amount of 'they're just words' will change that

right, I agree, it would be a terrible approach to take. It would damage the group, not help their cause. In fact you would probably do more damage by letting them advertise such a slogan, than if you banned them from it. 

&gt; How do you make this connection, if you don't see how a phrase can be made offensive as a result of the source?

because I think it's less about causing offense and more about causing public embarrassment or appearing stupid. 

I mean I wouldn't personally be offended if a german group did that; I would think it was stupid. If I was Jewish and some of my family died in the holocaust I *may* feel in some sense 'offended', but again it's a case of 'where do you draw the line' at offense. 

I could get offended at Labour posters or whatever; does that mean it should be banned? what about if I can get 20 or 30% of the population to agree with me; should we ban it then?  

&gt; Really? You think a therapist of any repute would phrase the question/ statrment like that, instead of something along the lines of 'concerned about your sexuality?' or something else that isn't quite so negative?

well I'm not arguing that the advert was particularly tactful or even tasteful or appropriate. I was just saying that there are groups who do this kind of thing, and you either have a problem with the message (or the message behind the message) or you don't.

true,Odd-One-Out,null,null,"I underwent something like that last week! It was a data analyst role, but not in IT. However, the concept is pretty similar. 

I believe that you will be given a data set that will be either pulled from their database, or a fabricated dataset that will be relevant to the department. You may be asked to:

- Write a short report on what the data tells you
- Prepare a short presentation on what the data tells you

It will be an opportunity for the interviewer to see how you think and process information in a short span of time. Obviously it's good to cover most aspects of the data, but it's not expected that you will be able to cover every single thing in the data especially as you only have an hour. The important part is how you show your thought process and analytical skills. Don't forget to SUMMARISE at the end of the report/presentation. It's alright if you go through what the information tells you but ultimately the question posed at the beginning has to be answered. For example, if the data gives you the age of child, grades in each subject that they do, location of house from school, number of siblings that they have, then you would be able to guess that the question that they want you to answer is ""What affects a child's grade?"" because that will then lead on to ""How can we improve the child's grade?"" (which is the point of the education department). The point of the exercise is to see how you will perform and fit in the team if they do offer you the job.

As for techniques, you may want to consider:

- Minimum, maximum, mean value of variables (VERY IMPORTANT as it's a quick way to get the overall picture of the data)
- Regression
- Association between variables
- Any other statistical or data related techniques

Good luck!

One example i just looked at is Kelloggs Bran Flakes cereal are 37.5p/100g whereas the ASDA(UK supermarket) branded version is just 11.3p/100g, thats less than a third of the price and they must not make hardly any profit from them at all.

Then i thought about if youre strugging to pay for food you probably do receive some kind of benefits which can cover food if you buy cheap stuff.

Food isnt like electric or gas where all the companies are around the same price and you cant really spend more or less on the quality of electric or gas. In comparison food and be veryyyy cheap or quite expensive and comes in different quality and brand recognition is involved.

The classification of students your job requires you to help, ranges from ""underachiever"" to ""mischievous students"". I myself was the latter, I attended a Pupil Referral Unit(PRU) which was for permanently excluded pupils from high school. 
 
We had difficulty going out into public and well.. we ended acting up. Reasons could range from bad childhoods to attention seekers, I would suggest looking into the qualifications which would impact them in an engaging way, i.e Our school helped us get some qualifications in rock-climbing etc. Though, this did not help me later on in life, but at the time it was an incentive to behave. 
We learnt many life lessons, not just qualifications but also morals.
We as a school got looked down upon and never got the chances other students in main stream school would have. As from what I know, no one in our school sat higher papers for our GCSE's. There was a huge lack in resources for us and I expect them to be for much on the country. The only thing that we wanted was a second chance and find someway to 
better our lives as a result. 
I myself studied computers, IT, programming and the like. And for me it helped greatly, but again lack of resources made this difficult and if it wasn't for the college I attended after that. I don't think I would of ever got a second chance..

Overall most US drama series are too blatent in the way that they are clearly vehicles for advertising, rather than an attempt to tell an interesting story. There's always a cliff hanger, the plots quickly become so preposterous and contrived in their perpetual attempts to create cliff hangers that the rank greed of the whole effort is in yourt face every episode. I'm not sure when this started, I think my first memory of it was 24, though there's probably earlier examples

Compare this to things like [The Shadow Line](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1701920) - watching this makes me feel like the story is the product and I am the consumer, with the us dramas it always makes me feel like I am the product and the advertisers are the consumer.

Here's my miserable old bastard run down of the series you mention:

* The Walking Dead - watched the first couple of episodes, seemed ok, not interesting enough to dedicate myself to watching

* Breaking Bad - Watched half the first series, same issues as walking dead

* Game of Thrones - Managed to catch a couple of episodes of a later series, will watch from the start when I get a chance. I'm hopeful for this one

* Black Mirror - Good, would like to have seen more episodes

* Being Human - Saw the first couple of episodes, not interesting

* Boss - Not heard of it, will check it out

* Spartacus - Historically seems somewhat shaky, can see how it would be good if you like watching oily men

* Dexter - Generic American cop show tosh

* Homeland - Watched series one and two. Now regretting investing that much time in it. Want to watch the Israeli version

* Boardwalk Empire - Watched the first season (housemate was in to it), well acted and whatnot. Not so great that I'd make any attempt to watch in the future

* Parks and Recreation - Not seen any of it, vaguely aware of it, may watch some if I see it on the planner

* Community - Not seen any of it, vaguely aware of it, may watch some if I see it on the planner

* Mad Men - Seems like generic american drama, but in the fifties, not interesting enough to watch

* Justified - Not heard of it, will check it out

* Sherlock - Fantastic!

* Doctor Who - meh

1. Trident is a complex and vast system. If we don't maintain the infrastructure to build and maintain it, we lose it. If this isn't *forever* it's long enough to massively increase the eventual costs (Reference: costs incurred buying back US expertise to replace lost UK skills when the attack sub replacements were delayed)

2. At this point in development, the costs are minimal. The Big Number being thrown around now is there to scare you, since it's an (estimated) total system *lifetime* cost. Regardless of how accurate it is (it isn't, it'll be much bigger) this is spread over the lifetime of the project *and* won't incur major costs until well after ""Austerity"" is over (even given how badly this current financial situation is being managed)

3. Deterrent needs to be a credible continuous threat. Publicising we're taking a break changes the strategic picture already. (see also: Terry Taliban's approach to conflict in Afghanistan since the pre-announced staged withdrawal: Keep (relatively) quiet, wait for the Damn Infidels to leave, prepare for the aftermath)

I'm not sure product placement is not the only form of advertising. As I said:

&gt;&gt; most US drama series are too blatent in the way that they are clearly vehicles for advertising, rather than an attempt to tell an interesting story. There's always a cliff hanger, the plots quickly become so preposterous and contrived in their perpetual attempts to create cliff hangers that the rank greed of the whole effort is in yourt face every episode

The goal of many US dramas seems to be to keep you on the edge of your seats, not to tell a story, but to ensure you watch the next episode. The goal isn't to tell a story it is to create a world to which people are compelled to return week after week, year after year, to ensure that the advertisers keep on paying

The English love to bang on about this but it is bullshit, especially compared to Germany. There are many styles of play in the EPL: free passing (Swansea), counterattacking (Man United), grinders (Stoke), etc. It's irrelevant when speaking of Lukaku anyways.

&gt; Chelsea is not a place for inexperienced youngster, it is the way the club is set up.

No other team ignores their youngsters like we do. Even clubs with more money or pull than us (Barca, Madrid, United, Bayern, Dortmund, PSG, City) aren't afraid to play their young players, and it pays off. Experience at the actual mother club counts for much more than playing at a different club with a different system.

Sturridge is our most recent example of a player that went out on loan for us and came back to do the business. Despite what some would say he was actually great for us and if it wasn't for our 50m pound donkey he probably would have stayed.

If you want to write a novel, do it. I totally agree that pursuing activities that have nothing to do with your future career is important.

But.

If you're going to spend thousands of pounds on something, be sure that it's worth it. You can still pursue your passions and also work on building a rewarding career. I actually produce music myself as a hobby (which is how I got talking to the  guy I referred to before). I'm so glad my parents did not let me get into thousand's of pounds worth of debt because of it. Not only is it not fair to students themselves to be dishonest about the value of a degree in one of these subjects, it's also not fair on those who pay taxes to fund these types of degrees. University education is often held up to be worthy of public money due to the benefits it has to wider society - I don't personally see how it's fair that people who may not even have gone to university have to fund these types of courses. People will often point to the numbers of medical/nursuing/engineering students as a justification for widening university access in *all* areas, when it's clear to the majority of people that those types of skills are far more beneficial to us than other skills taught at a large number of the lower ranked universities.

I know your rant was based on a dismissal of ""the economy"", but when you're spending other people's money on university education, you can't very well tell them it's beneficial to society whilst writing cheques for media production and stand-up comedy degrees.

true,whistleflute,null,null,"It will be a very tough, fast paced match. First goal will be absolutely everything. If we score they will have to come after us, knowing even a draw would be a bad result. This leaves Bale, Lennon, Ade and Dembele all killer on the counter attack (look at their CBs). If they score, then Wilshere/Carzola will look to hit balls over the top for Walcott to do the same.

It depends on who turns up for them; the in-form Wilshere is their obvious danger man. Carzola is 50/50 whether he's anonymous or genuinely amazing. Their defence is still fairly woeful. Gooners always hark on about how good their team is, but their opinions are nearly always based on a player's purple patch months or seasons ago. Vermaelen was good for a season, but is nowhere near the same player now. Koscielny/Szczesny only have 2 or 3 good games in a whole season. Ramsey has been terrible since his injury. The Ox had two or three good games a long time ago, but has done nothing of note this season. Rosicky has already used up his seasonal ""good game after coming back from an injury"". Podolski and Arteta have the potential to influence a game, but I think with high pressure and organised defense they can be nullified. Also, I think Arteta is a strong possibility for a red card.

My biggest concern would be aerial balls into the box. Just look at the West Ham game to see how badly we dealt with knockdowns. Aerial crosses caused us lot of problems at the Emirates earlier this season as well. Need to be disciplined and clear our lines. Cross our fingers Walker/BAE remain switched on for the full 90 minutes.

On paper, playing at home, we definitely edge it. Our current form (in all competitions) is better as well. But it's the NLD and form means fuck all. I just hope it's a game without bullshit (no stupid red cards, disallowed goals etc) so the football does the talking... because then we can't lose! COYS

Spurs 3 - 1 Arsenal Adebayor (4) Bale (5) Walcott (78) Bale (93) Yellow Cards: 12 (Result)

Spurs 3 - 1 Arsenal Bale (4) Bale (5) Walcott (78) Adebayor (93) Yellow Cards: 12 (Prediction 1)

Spurs 3 - 1 Arsenal Bale (4) Bale (5) Adebayor (78) Walcott (93) Yellow Cards: 12 (Prediction 2)

Both ""people"" have the scorers correct.
They both have the times correct as well.
So it moves onto Correct Scorers + Correct times.

Prediction 1 has: Bale (5) Walcott (78) (2 correct scores with correct times)
Prediction 2 has: Bale (5) (1 correct score with correct time).

Or whatever indeed. 

Question:
&gt;UKIP’s sole aim is to have a referendum on the European Union, but what would you do after that?

Answer:
&gt;It’s the only way for Britain. That means that every Eastern European would have to leave, except for the ones who have had kids. 

Did he listen to the question at all? He was asking what they would do AFTER that, and the guy just went back to it.

&gt;What they should do is build not prisons, but holding centres, and lock them up... You’d need one or two in every city. Later in time, they could turn them in to prisons.

How much is this going to cost? What's the cost/benefit of this? 

&gt;We have one or two kids on average and they have ten. So imagine that: every generation there’s a hundred of theirs to four of ours, a thousand to our eight. So, within three or four generations, this country will be a Muslim country. 

Wait... but if they're having that many kids then... holy crap that's exponential growth! It will go on forever until the planet is torn out of it's orbit by all the muslims piling up.

&gt;Unless we do something about it, we'll be the ones on the street begging for change.

Wow. That's such a level-headed, sensible, honest and definitely not scare-mongering thing to say. 

&gt; I go to apply for a job, I don’t get it and foreigners do. Those who do the hiring are told by their bosses, ""You’ve got to employ 30 percent foreigners."" So an English guy doesn’t have a chance.

Every single job he applied for before now he lost to a foreigner. Every single one. Yet 70% of jobs still go to British people. Perhaps the problem isn't the foreigners. Perhaps Phil just wasn't good enough for the job. I suspect it's because he spent the whole interview ignoring questions he was asked and ranting about the foreigners instead.

&gt;Don't misquote what I say. Some of my views are probably a bit stronger than the average UKIP member. As long as you put what I've said and don't add to it, that's fine. If you have, I'll be upset and **I'll come and see you and make you unhappy**. I'm telling you that now.

I don't think it was a threat, I think it was a sad statement of fact. He's saying, ""I'm warning you - I make anyone I come into contact with unhappy - it's just the sort of person I am.

He's a big, strong, quick-thinking player with a good touch who runs his ass off.

I think he's been effective - not so much as in scoring goals, which is kind of 1/2 of your job as a forward - but off the ball.  Watch him pull defenders with him and open space and make short diagonal runs to do the same; cause some chaos in front of the goal on long crosses and corners.  He's had a bunch of playing time with a rotating cast around him, and doesn't seem to be settled and connecting as well with everyone yet - except for his previous history with Dembele, he hasn't had any consistent teammate lineups around him.  He's in a really competitive position, with a lot of really good players vying for a starting 11 spot - and they all have strengths and weaknesses.

Do I think he'll end his career at Spurs?  No.  I think he's a much-needed, talented, hard worker who I hope will be around a few seasons, barring injury.

Went to PC world, the chap discussed my needs, recommended an inexpensive motherboard and CPU and didn't try to sell me anything extra. 

When I bought a laptop, I had a look online then went to the store to see how the keyboard felt and get an idea of build quality. The guy there seemed to know how the AMD and Intel CPUs compared which was something I've really lost track of. There was no pressure to buy.

Amazon was about 3 quid cheaper after delivery, and I'd gave had to be in all day to pick it up or drive to the middle of nowhere to collect it.

His CL victory was ages ago, imo more due to Milan cocking up, and he has done dick all ever since aside from screwing up decent sides. 

Which substitutions this season, aside from Oscar against some shite czech team, actually made an impact? Granted I will say his usage of Luiz in the DM and playing Moses was a good move. However, his rotation system is rubbish and does more harm than good. 

How did he lose against Corinthians, a team 6th in the Brazilian league and vastly lower quality that us? How did he lose to West Ham at home, QPR at home and draw to **BRENTFORD**, Reading and Southampton? Please don't give me the volatile atmosphere. Its silent at the Bridge, not hostile.  He knew what he was getting into and a professional. 

What is his plan b? Why is our back four still horrible despite playing negative football? Why is Oscar, Ba, Ramires, Ivanovic, Torres all worse performance wise when they performed well under Robbie (or Newcastle in the case of Ba)? It was the same deal with Snjider at Inter.  

Its not because he is interim; Hiddink did well. Robbie did well. Hell even Grant did well he wasn't well liked.

Not a great analogy IMHO! A free market is just that. Try and build a house in the UK. You will find in most places you cannot get planning permission. If you do get permission you will have to give the council a massive bung. They are restricting supply to boost demand.

On the lending side the BoE is now lending directly into the housing market via FLS to keep rates low. Because banks were setting the rate via their own SVR that has detached from the base rate. FLS has not had much impact so far. Prices are still falling. BoE don't want prices to fall because the banking system will collapse.

Prices have to stay high so banks don't go under. But high prices are making the cost of living high and this feeds into competitiveness on a global stage. No way to square this circle.

    In the second volume of series' final instalment, Century: 1969, the Second Doctor makes a cameo in the background. The comic strip of Karkus is visible in a bookshop in the same page. A Dalek appears to Mina Murray during a drug induced hallucination sequence at Hyde Park.

    Additionally, in the third volume, Century: 2009, the Eleventh Doctor and the First Doctor both appear in a cameo. Captain Jack appears a few panels above this cameo. Additionally, the James Bond character M makes a reference to United Nations Intelligence Taskforce and ""our Cardiff enterprise"", namely Torchwood Three.

true,benfitzg,null,null,"Ok - we do need to build more houses. But think of the lending.

Property prices are not related to cost to build. This might be a lower bound (and it can drop beneath this), but prices are a function of the ability to pay. Prices are therefore set by the willingness to borrow (ability to make repayments) and the limits set on this borrowing. With that in mind...

1. Mortgage lending multiples have changed. Use to be 3 or 3.5x main income. Even if your wife worked. Upping this to 3 or more times joint income means you are bidding against other people with access to the same amount of leverage. This is what keeps prices high. Prices have been falling outside the SE of late. Much of London are foreign buyers and bank workers whilst banks are on life support from the state, so let's ignore London for a minute. Outside in the rest of the UK lending has slowed - you can't do liar loans or stupid multiples on tiny deposits, despite the BoE best efforts.

2. Low rates with low/no deposits are over. House prices are not about the price but about the *affordability* of the monthly mortgage repayment. Low rates meant that even on a massive multiple people could still afford the monthly repayment. New loans have higher rates. Banks ignored the base rate and SVR went up. BoE has launched FLS to try and intervene to prop up the bubble. It's not working as most still require big deposits, meaning BTL only for boomers. Rates for debt are only going one way. Add in the shock of small movements and it gets real messy real quick. Rates were once 6%. You pay the monthly on that and you can't get a big mortgage. But if rates go up 0.5% it doesn't kill you. It's 1/12th up. Now when you are on 1.5% and rates go up 0.5% then we have a rise of 1/3rd. Ouch. Affordability out the window.

The BoE are getting increasingly desperate. Britain has big public debt, a big deficit and very high private debt. Add in a demographics issue and you have a right mess. Hence the talk of negative interest rates to talk down the pound. A right mess.",0,1362086466,null,0,false,0,c8ng9l7,t3_19d2ux,t1_c8ng9l7,t1_c8n5med,null,1431441381,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

They fixed up my CV, talked me through how to write an application letter better than anyone else I had seen, with both morning one-day courses and with my advisor.

I went for an appointment yesterday and had to wait an hour because they were so busy! I was tasked with a job search on the computer while I was waiting though. My advisor did help me a bit with my application letters, but I'm constantly feeling like they have too little staff to take the time to help everyone, even with courses. They keep promising they will get more staff, and get a bigger room, but so far, nope. I kind of hate the fact they don't have a proper centre for my small town. When I took a course at one of their bigger offices (they refund travel expenses), they had a big notice board with the current jobs going, and had more staff around to answer questions.

They did set me on one course which I thought was a bit shit, lots of handwriting power point answers with a bunch of immature disrupters, all to get a BTEC in level 1 retail, which provided absolutely no experience, and is probably worthless considering some of the people on that course.

However, they did apologise (I have anxiety issues and stopped going), and have now set me up for a day course in confidence next week. My advisor also said he'd look into admin courses for me. Hopefully that goes better!

Look man, I've got limited time, patience, and energy to deal with Internet drama about petty shit like this. But I'll put it thusly: I've supported for Chelsea for years, like many on this sub. Yeah, I'm American, yes I'm relatively young (22), and yes, the random place where I happened to be born has prevented me, physically as well as financially, from attending games at the Bridge week in and week out. But you have no right to criticize us on that basis alone, which is what it seems like you're doing. 

If you're calling me an idiot in reference to the comment made on the other post which is now at the top, let me explain: I have no love lost between myself and Rafa. I, like most of us on here, think that he's a massive dick and that he should've never taken the contract in the first place. He's never been forced into signing with us, and it really feels like he's here for the money/re-launching his managerial career, which is bullshit. So no, I don't want him at the bridge, and yeah, I'm okay with booing him. People boo coaches in the US (NYC more specifically) all the time and it's something I've done myself at American sports games. But that doesn't mean that I take anything that he says as evil. In the situation we're in, there's only so much that we, as fans, can really do, and we've done a large part of it already. I just think that it's wrong to immediatly ridicule a man, no matter what he's done in the past. 

And look, if you want discussion, you can go through much of my post history on here and note that I've been fairly active in discussing things on this sub. I love this club and can certainly claim to have cried for it, like many of you can. But if you feel like you need to start a separate subreddit so that you can have ""sensible discussion"" with ""likeminded"" fans, then you've really lost the plot somewhere, because so far as I can tell a sub founded on that premise is just going to be a circlejerk of RAFAOUTRAFAOUTRAFAOUT. 

TL;DR: You want to discuss? Let's discuss where everybody can see it so that everybody can comment on it. Don't go hide behind some closed door that you've invented for yourself because you can't take a contrary opinion now and again (and the opinions that you and I hold are, I assure you, far less contrary than you might believe).

He has an amazing relationship with JT and with Lamps. A solid relationship between the two most influential players is important. If he has good relations with players with ""significant player power"" he can control and manage the team. Not only that he can bring out the best in JT and Lamps, not to mention Cahill who is seeming to struggle lately. 

Not only that, the guy is available and would definitely take up our offer, unlike a lot of the other options out there. This is a very realistic option we could consider, should we not get Mourinho (imo should be top priority).

Yes they have a big influence in the dressing room but they try do things their own way and then cry when they are not picked for games. This negativity flows through the whole club, this is what they done to AVB and drove him out. These players need to learn that they have a manager who is their BOSS. 

These players are servents to CFC and should be getting behind the manager, they owe it to the fans. Roman is running Chelsea into the ground,  serious stability is needed.",0,1362090849,null,0,false,0,c8nhshq,t3_19eta4,t1_c8nhshq,t1_c8nez7n,null,1431442094,-13,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,-13

A gooner walks into a pub to watch his mediocre team go round. He takes a seat at the bar and places a small dog wearing the home strip on the stool next to him. As the game kicks off the little dog gets up on his back legs, gives three barks and claps his paws together.

The bartender says, ""that's pretty cool, what does he do if they score?"". ""Hopefully you'll see"" says the Gooner.

Twenty minutes into the game, following some form of miracle, the Le Arse score a goal. At this, the little dog jumps up on his back legs again, this time on the bar, and with his front paws in the air he pirouettes around for about a minute barking wildly.

""That's astonishing"" says the bartender, ""what does he do if you win?"" ""Hopefully you'll see"" says the Gooner.

Despite some calamitous defending and a barrage of missed opportunities Arsenal manage to hold on to their slender lead. At the end of the 94th minute, the ref blows time. At this, the little dog jumps up on the bar and proceeds to do a series of 8 backflips along the bar, before again spinning around on his back legs and barking like mad.

The cardinal sin, of course, is questioning the commitment of the fans. You have to understand that for a lot of them, the club is their life. Their biggest hobby and interest. They may spend a substantial our all if their discretionary income following the team. And so, they write rightly regard themselves as part of the club.

No one is questioning whether or not the players are smart enough to understand that the boo's are not for them. The fact remains that no one wants to hear boo's of any kind when playing at their home ground. Bottom line is that it's *negativity*. It doesn't inspire positive play. It can only have a negative effect on their performance. 

I've said all along that if the intent of the fans is to be clear about their disapproval of Rafa as manager, that point has been made loud and clear. So now what point is being made? Because as I mentioned earlier, only negativity can come from the boos and jeers. As a fan, I'm most concerned about winning games/making CL. At this point booing and jeering will not help achieve that. It's not like our players can feed off the booing and turn in a good performance bc of it.

true,AnnieIWillKnow,EN,england,"Seriously? Are you new to football, because a few boos isn't absurdly horrible treatment. And criticising the passion of fans isn't a trivial offence. 

Arsene Wenger gets called a paedo regularly by Man Utd fans, and he hasn't spoken out against them - because he knows it's football and that's football fans.

Steve Kean didn't criticise the Blackburn fans last year, and they were even worse than the Chelsea fans this year. 

""Disgusting treatment"" would be racial abuse, or something similar. Not some boos and 'oh no the Chelsea fans sang a nasty song about me'. Cry me a river.

If he can't hack it he needs to get out of football, because he clearly doesn't have the mentality for it. John Terry puts up with worse abuse day-in, day-out, and he rises to it. Not whinging like a little child.

Grossly inaccurate there. Liverpool are where they are because their former owners Hicks and Gillett dragged the club into absurd levels of debt, which handcuffed Rafa and the board from making any sort of impactful signings without the stipulation of selling players to raise the funds. Most liverpool fans still adore Rafa and will tell you unabashedly that their previous owners share 90% or more of the blame for their current fate. 

&gt; Please elaborate how Rafa is not a tactical moron despite adequately proving it the last 6 years.

For starters, his resume actually argues very strongly against your assertion that he is a ""tactical moron"". I don't know of any morons that have two La Liga titles (both of which he earned beating out Real Madrid and Barcelona), a UEFA cup title, FA Cup title, Champions League title, UEFA Super cup title, Club world cup title and two UEFA manager of the year awards. Please slow your roll on the ""RAFA IS A MORON"" hyperbole. Clearly the man knows how to be a successful football manager, and if you're going to chalk all that up as ""luck"" then you're absolutely ignorant. 

Now, that being said. I would agree that his appointment was a poor decision, mostly due to the fact that his managerial style does not suit the players we currently have. He was a square peg from the beginning. Some have argued that ""a good manager should be able to adapt and get the best out of his players"". For the most part I would agree, but doing this takes time. Something Rafa does not have. He was given the task of fixing this team in less than 6 months, and doing it with unfamiliar tools. And btw, do this with your entire fanbase spewing hate at you at every home match. 

All things considered this was destined to happen. And I'll stand by the fact that this isn't Rafa's fault. And by that I mean, we're in our current state of affairs because of the senseless, irresponsible actions of Roman and the board who work ever so hard to make sure stability and consistency never find their way into Stamford Bridge.

We're all blue, and we're all entitled to have an opinion on Rafa, be it supportive or critical. The entire suggestion that to be a REAL fan you have to bring out your pitchforks against Rafa is just absolutely moronic.
