He looked funny (petty I know) and didn't have the same wit and charm as Tennant, my Doctor. When Tennant left I was heartbroken and after his infamous ""I don't want to go"", who can blame me. But I kept watching the show anyway. At first for Amy and Rory whose bickering kept me thourougly entertained. But as they appeared less and less I finally started to give Matt a chance. Sure he was fundamentally different than Tennant but had the same wit and the story had the same charm. So by the start of Series 7 Mock II, Smith had grown on me like a tumor that I would oddly enough hate to have removed. In his past seasons he has slowly squeezed himself to fit my image of the Doctor and now to be faced with his departure makes me well...sad.

I get what you're trying to say about Lukaku needs to being given the chance based on what he prove at Westbrom, If we're going on that logic than there are numerous of lads who should be given the chance, starting from Paizon, Chalobah, McEachran and Thorgan the fact is Chelsea have never been that team to rely on the youth (not since under the Emperor). Lukaku was great at Westbrom but he young and inexperience to lead a team that will be challenging for 5 major trophies this year. At Westbrom he did his thing but you cannot take that and immediately think he will transfer it at Chelsea. The way in which teams play and Strategize to play Chelsea is way more different from how the do for Westbrom. There are whole lot of factor that Lukaku will have to incorporate into his game and at his age it will wear him out quickly, He  will have to move from playing 25+ games last year to playing 60+ games this. What im trying to say is the kid is waaaaaay too young to lead us if we're trying to rustle any jimmies this year.

I love Matt Smith as an actor. I felt that he has really been able to portray an old man in a young body very well. I'm sad to see him go, but I'm excited to see a new Doctor. Every actor has brought something new to the character and it's always interesting. I feel like most of the complaining has been from the newest generation of viewers that have no idea that the classic series exists. Comments leaning towards ""he's too old to be the Doctor"" is just damn ignorant. Watch the classics people! Plus I think you're right. There was no sexual tension in the classic series. Even when Tom and Lalla were dating and eventually married they weren't really in your face about it on the show. They had fantastic chemistry, but it ended at that.

true,Brosencephalon,CA,canada,"You raise some good points but we don't only just have ""a few new additions"". The entire aura of the club has changed with Jose's return and it will undoubtedly translate onto the pitch. I don't think our system will change drastically but the Jose-factor is something hard to measure quantitatively and at this point I can only see it being extremely beneficial to our club - from top to bottom.

I don't think the club will be throwing the weight of leading the line every single game on Lukaku's shoulders just yet. I agree, it is something we have to ease him into and he has to learn more in order to excel in the role. However, my point was that the time to do that is NOW, and the arrival of Rooney is only going to be detrimental to his growth. If we were slim with forwards then I would be all for Rooney. But with the current situation Rooney's arrival is going to give us more negatives in the long run. Sure we may be able to secure more trophies with Rooney this year and maybe next (again this is only a prediction), but when he's out of his prime what do we do? At that point we may have already damaged Lukaku's development enough that he's not ready to take over.

This raises a whole other issue of stability that we can discuss another time. It's something I think Jose is quietly going to be working on in the background. It's something that we need to establish in order to get on United's level of consistency. And imo, it starts now and involves a few things regarding our current discussion: trusting our youth, giving them opportunities and working towards long term goals not JUST with short term plans. Easier said than, but Rome wasn't built overnight.

true,MadArend,num20,,"Been lurking for a year, finally decided to make an account and join in. First post ever, so apologies if I make any gaffes.

I will proudly admit that I am part of the ""came for Dempsey, stayed for Spurs"" brigade.  I've been a big Dempsey fan since he first came up as a member of the New England Revolution.  That said, his transfer away from Tottenham actually *makes me love Spurs even more*.

We'll probably never know the whole story, but I have the distinct feeling that Levy and AVB wanted to keep Clint.  His versatility, his never-quit attitude, his penchant for scoring BIG goals, and most of all, his popularity in the USA as the ""Premiere League on a major American network"" era dawns, all militated for Spurs to keep him.  He was certainly worth more to Spurs than £5.9M.

But apparently he wanted to move.  Ambitions for ""Champions League football"" notwithstanding, he says he wanted to return to his home country while he was still at the top of his game, and he surely wanted more playing time than he was going to get.  And he has more than *doubled* his annual salary, plus he'll probably land some endorsements that would otherwise never go to an MLS player, further padding his bank account as well as further helping to raise the profile of the MLS in a year when the sport will get a lot more public airtime than it has in the past.  

So this all smells like a player who went to management and said ""I want to move,"" and management who said, ""You're valuable to us, we'd like to keep you for marketing and footballing reasons; but to be fair, you're only going to be a role-player, you ARE the captain of your national team in a World Cup Qualifying year, and frankly, if you help raise the profile of the sport in your own way, it will still be good for us in the long run.""  And they did the deal and allowed him to go.

I'm a little annoyed at Deuce for giving up his Champion's League dream in a year when Tottenham is poised to do something special ... but I have huge respect for Spurs for respecting him and acceding to his wishes.

**TL;DR:** I believe the Dempsey transfer was Clint's desire, not Tottenham's, but good on Spurs for letting him go.

true,Film-Noir-Detective,mcgann,McGann,"You have some good points in your response, so I will do my best to address them and expand on some things I might no have explained as well as I could have the first time. For Amy and Rory's departure, it wasn't their ending that bothers me, as it's quality is subjective and changes from person to person, it was that the foreshadowing didn't fit the ending. The whole point of series 7.1 was the Doctor weaning the Ponds off him, with The Power of Three entire premise being Amy and Rory finding that they have friends and lives outside of their travels with the Doctor. With foreshadowing like that, you expect that they would have one last giant adventure in their final episode and then decide to live their lives in the present, with the Doctor being just a friend who may visit occasionally. Instead, though, they are flung into the past, never able to see the Doctor again or live their lives in the present. Now, that ending COULD have worked and fit with the theme of the series IF the foreshadowing reflected it. If say, there was talk throughout all the episodes that travelling with the Doctor is incredibly dangerous, and perhaps having the couple have some near-death experiences, with the theme being the Doctor playing Chicken with the Ponds safety, then it would have fit. The episodes people prefer is subjective, so that is all that can be addressed for that. Now, on to the points...

1. The reveals being predictable. Now, Moffat dropping a few hints too many is one of the problems, I agree (I was able to figure out Clara's mystery before the opening credits of NotD, not the specifics of it, but the splitting to save the Doctor from GI part, using the trailers and previews). Another thing with the ""safe solution"" kinda deals with the overblown arcs, with the solutions being underwhelming after being blown up. Now, when child!River regenerated, what did we all think? ""We are going to have another time lord. Yay!"" Now, because of all those possibilities, when it turned out that River was simply Amy and Rory's daughter, it felt like a cheap way to explain the mystery and made it seem as though the universe itself revolved around the Ponds. It also, for me, made the universe seem smaller, as things that feel as though they shouldn't interconnect so deeply, do and it tightens and shrinks the universe. I frankly would have preferred the River twist if there wasn't the bit with the possibility of another time lord, with her being Amy and Rory's (perhaps genetically enhanced to explain the abilities) daughter.

2. I agree, if Moffat answer all the questions as he promised (something I sadly doubt), I would look back on his entire arc and think it to be absolutely brilliant.

3. For the Name of the Doctor, I felt it should be a two-parter due to the criminal under use of the Whisper Men and to a lesser extent, the Great Intelligence. I do agree the Doctor and Clara parts felt as though they fit perfectly in the time allotted for the episode. My problem is that they have a potentially scary group of villains that are built up at the start, but end up doing practically nothing. Basically all they do is only look scary and incapacitate a character temporarily. If Jenny's death stuck for longer, perhaps to the end of the episode, they would have felt like they did something when they conveniently (plot-wise) disappeared with the Great Intelligence. For the mastermind himself, he could have used more screentime as he is set up to be the villain of 7.2 from the Snowmen, so maybe my problem is partially with the season itself, but I would have liked to see more of him before his death. The last we see before NotD is him ready to set up another plan after the wi-fi one was stopped by the Doctor, but in NotD, he has apparently given up on life. Another defeat, perhaps in the middle of 7.2 would have shown a transition between BoSJ and NotD, or it could have been fleshed out a lot more in his final episode. So, my problem with NotD, is the lack of time for the villains, and some more Doctor/GI confrontations.

4. When you explain it like that, River's appearance in the episode feels more natural. However, I still have a problem with the details of her appearance. For example, why on Earth is she in 1930s New York City, and why is she a private detective. Her other appearances in the show were explained, in Pandorica she gets the message to tell the Doctor, in IA and GMGTW, she is asked. It felt as though she was there sort of random, and didn't seem to fit in the story as I couldn't see a real reason for her to be in that exact place and time. I would swallow her appearance easier if the details had been better explained, but the no two-parter rule. I also feel as though she didn't belong in NotD, as the Amy/Rory era was finished and so was her arc. I feel as though the interactions and problems invoving her and the Doctor in that episode felt forced in, much  like the divorce in AofD. Also, the Victorian Trio (my nickname for Strax, Vastra, and Jenny) basically occupy River's place of recurring side character from the A/R era in the new Clara era. Her appearance felt a bit out of place, especially with the other side characters now entrenched. Her backstory and actions (and the THINGS she gets away with) make her feel like a Mary Sue to me, and from complaints I've heard, others too.

5. My problem with the companion mysteries is mainly that it is ALL the 11th Doctor uses to choose his companions, or that's what it looks like at least, and that every season of Moffat's era has the ""Companion Mystery (A mystery or strange occurrence that directly involves a companion from the start). For Amy it was the crack in the wall, then the time-baby, while for Clara it was her many deaths. The era feels over saturated with them. Now, I'm not saying the companions shouldn't change due to a character arc, it's just that the arcs shouldn't be motivated by a mystery. Look at Donna, great character arc (sad ending. Why, Davies, Why.). There was a mystery that season, but it didn't directly involve her (from the start, at least), with her role in the bigger picture coming together throughout the season. Most importantly, the Doctor didn't choose to invite because there was something strange involving her, but because she was fun and would make a good travelling partner. The travelling partner thing also applies to when Ace came into the TARDIS. Ace also shows that you don't need to have a mystery to make a companion relatable, engaging and fun. Another companion mystery to compare is Charley from the 8th Doctor's Big Finish run, while there was a mystery involving her that took 2 seasons to solve, it wasn't the odd situation that caused the Doctor to travel with her, it was the fact that she was an adventuress who invited herself aboard the TARDIS while riding a time pterodactyl. For the complaints a season ago, I haven't heard them. In fact, the complaint I was hearing was about how the show was turning into the Ponds and their quirky friend who travels in space-time. The problem I had with last season was due to too much focus on the Ponds. For the travelling the universe bit, my problem is less with them wanting to travel the universe, but with why the Doctor wants to travel the universe with them. Fun Tourists/Travelling Partners (Ace, Charley, Donna), or there is something strange with them (11's companions). I have to say, I prefer the fun tourist to the Doctor only bringing them along to figure out a mystery. Plus, in my mind, the tourist angle gives both the Doctor and companion extra dimensions and fleshes them out more (Why do they want to see the universe? What does it say about the Doctor for his reaction to the above reason, Unlimited Rice Pudding, etc., etc.).

There are fans of Liverpool who do say a lot of stuff without proper facts or research. But, that's the same with every football club out there. Want to help educate and eliminate the ones from LFC? Help post informative articles. Help find good analysis. Politely correct people (with proper articles to back you up) when they same something incorrect. On other sites, like YouTube, there's not much you can do, but if you see a really out of control ""fan,"" it's probably best to just ignore them and take the high road yourself.

I dunno, I just like the idea that the Eleventh Hour started with him trying to stop a child being scared and save her from the monsters, and his eleventh form might end with those same sort of attempts.

I think it's not my absolute favourite way to see him go either, but I actually really do like it. I think something child-related could have the potential to be really good.

1) I, an 18-year-old GIRL, am very excited to see an older Doctor. 2) I'm not the only teenager who thinks this.

&gt;we have quick wingers with exceptional crossing ability

Who? We have three players who I would really call a wingers, and not just an attacking mid playing out wide. Moses, Shurrle, and Hazard (and even Hazard is debatable, but I'm giving OP the benifit of the doubt). Shurrle is unproven in the squad, and Moses had a single digit cross accuracy last year. That basically, leaves us one winger we can count on from the get go, and even then, he prefers to keep the ball at his feet.

OP even get's Lukaku's age wrong, although I'm just being nitpicky.

Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have too much choice than not enough. 30 million for a 27 year old striker, who's proven he can shine in the league. I say sign him up. Especially with Lamps, Terry and Cole all getting close to retirement, I think in a year or two having a home grown player who isn't a bench warmer will be a huge plus.

If our aim for the season is a deep run in the Champion's League and a shot at the title, we need more than one competent striker (and may I remind you, we're not even sure how Lukaku will play at Chelsea). While I think Rooney is a bit of a twat, but he is a very good player, and this is an inflated market, if we want a striker right now, we are going to over pay.

* Clara, who has already seen that the Doctor has huge power, is misled by someone that the Doctor will misuse that power. Perhaps a Hannibal-Lecter style conversation with John Hurt, perhaps a misunderstood conversation with Vastra or River Song, but the seed is planted in Clara's mind.

* Clara gets in a situation where she mistakenly feels she is the only one who can intervene, and believing that she is doing the right thing, does something in an effort to stop the Doctor. Because it's an action from someone the Doctor completely trusts he has no defense or counter-plan.

* Whether an intentional attack or accidental backfire, the result of the unexpected action is that something Clara has done causes the Doctor to regenerate.

The stronger the trust, the greater the sense of betrayal or surprise, and the audience, like the Doctor, has been set up to completely trust Clara.",0,1375768175,null,0,false,0,cbhw305,t3_1jrf32,t1_cbhw305,t1_cbhukui,null,1429929636,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,cech_mate,present,Didier Drogba is a Legend,"&gt;I don't think the club will be throwing the weight of leading the line every single game on Lukaku's shoulders just yet. 

We need a striker that will play week in week out not a rotation player right now we already have 3 of those (Lukaku, Ba, Torres) We need a main striker that we can rely on and not have a single once of doubt. We cannot afford to ease Lukaku into anything right now seen that United always seem to know how to win the league year after year and are currently stacked up on striking option and City have one of the most deadly team in Europe this year we cannot afford to ease Lukaku into anything we need a striker that is ready from the start of August not a 19th year old kid with freakish physical ability, and the time to ease Lukaku into things is definitely not now, not when City, United, Arsenal and even Spurs pose a greater threat now then they ever had. The arrival of Rooney will not harm Lukau growth it will only help him grow more as a srtriker because it will give him a credible opponent and for the starting spot, Right now Torres and Ba look far below par.

&gt;But with the current situation Rooney's arrival is going to give us more negatives in the long run. Sure we may be able to secure more trophies with Rooney this year and maybe next (again this is only a prediction), 

How will the signing of Rooney bring any negatives to us. **TROPHIES** isn't that our goal right now to win trophies, with Rooney as our starter Lukaku will still have time to grow.

&gt;but when he's out of his prime what do we do? At that point we may have already damaged Lukaku's development enough that he's not ready to take over.

That will be 4 or 5 years, I dont think Chelsea will just let a hot prospect like Lukaku rot on the bench, even Lukaku wont let himself rot on the bench we will either loan him out like we did last season or use him as a second fiddle.

Chelsea have never been a team to think about the loan haul we always go after thing steps by step, we jump the hurdle in-front of us not the one 4 or 5 jumps away from us. If we wanted to build for the long run we would have kept on to AVB and his eccentric plans.

true,Brosencephalon,CA,canada,"&gt; We need a striker that will play week in week out not a rotation player right now we already have 3 of those (Lukaku, Ba, Torres) We need a main striker that we can rely on and not have a single once of doubt. 

I don't think Rooney will play week in week out. No striker does. Rooney also won't be reliable week in week out ""without a single ounce of doubt"". He's notorious for being a streaky striker with spurts of bad form. It's what we have to deal with with strikers. Just look at RVP. The man went almost 2 months without scoring last season.

&gt; We cannot afford to ease Lukaku into anything right now seen that United always seem to know how to win the league year after year and are currently stacked up on striking option and City have one of the most deadly team in Europe this year we cannot afford to ease Lukaku into anything we need a striker that is ready from the start of August not a 19th year old kid with freakish physical ability, and the time to ease Lukaku into things is definitely not now, not when City, United, Arsenal and even Spurs pose a greater threat now then they ever had.

So basically you're saying it will never be the right time to let Lukaku (or the rest of our youth for that matter) grow and gain experience within our squad? Our rivals will always strengthening. 

&gt; The arrival of Rooney will not harm Lukau growth it will only help him grow more as a srtriker because it will give him a credible opponent and for the starting spot

That's quite an assumption. That conclusion is up to Romelu and Romelu alone. Sure, we'd all like to see that, but it's a best case scenario and we cannot confidently say that it will be the case.

&gt; How will the signing of Rooney bring any negatives to us. **TROPHIES** isn't that our goal right now to win trophies, with Rooney as our starter Lukaku will still have time to grow.

I said in the *long run*, the signing of Rooney will bring more negatives. He is world class and will definitely benefit the club. Our goal *right now* isn't trophies, our goal is *always* trophies. And the key to making sure we are consistent and always contenders is **stability**; on and off the pitch. We need to break away from this habit of buying too often and establish some sort of balance involving youth prospects, club grown talent AND 3rd party talent through smart transfers (again, United is the prime example).

And that last sentence is all I'm trying to say. Us buying Rooney might just set the stage for another 4-5 year cycle of hasty transfers and potential roster instability. We need to keep making transfers that make sense for us in the long term (as we have been recently) and we need to supplement them with decisions that will facilitate further stability.

Essentially what I'm saying is that right now, with Jose's return and a young, talented squad, Chelsea is in a prime window of opportunity to break out of our habit of instability and set the foundation for a stable and formidable roster/system that will not only further elevate the club but also stick around for some time.

I'm going on holiday soon so I need to find a couple of books, I'm thinking about some Iain M Banks as a memorial.

Not only that but the railway network that we still use today was developed using only private investment. 

The problem isn't that nationalised services are any better than private ones, it's that companies today have such a fixation on maintaining profit levels and stock price that everything else is secondary.

Nationalisation isn't the magical answer that people seem to think it is, all these services need pretty much constant investment to maintain them to the standard needed. You just need to look at the railways to see what nationalisation leads to when it's left to the state to make investments. 

I'm no economist but there must be some method that allows the state to retain a sense of control while allowing private investment to aid in maintaining and developing the service while allowing them to make a profit.

true,Charmer_Cork,null,null,"If we aren't able to get Rooney then we are going to need to sign someone else as a striker, what we have currently is not good enough for a potential 60 game season.

Lukaku is clearly a class player with huge potential and at present must surely be first choice, however, at West Brom he was rotated a lot and it's yet to be seen how he would cope with leading the line week in week out. Therefore, having a top draw striker for him to rotate with is quite possibly a necessity and with our current squad I don't think we can offer that.

The jury is still out on Demba Ba, he scored a couple of crackers last season in big games, but I don't think anyone would disagree that he has been a disappointment since signing in January. It's far too early to write him off though as he had some stellar performances at Newcastle but I can't say he's looked brilliant in preseason.

Our other option is Torres, not much that can be said here that hasn't been said by other people repeatedly. But to sum it up he is no longer and won't ever be again a world class striker, and it is a detriment to the team when he plays over the other strikers in our team. Unfortunately due to the very high wages he is on, I can't see any other teams touching him with a barge pole so we are stuck with him for now.

So in conclusion, without a top draw striker to rotate with Lukaku we are woefully short up front if we are intending to challenge for all honours. This has clearly been identified by Mourinho, which is why he is so keen to sign Rooney.

true,azohrri,tennant,Tennant,"Fuck, I'm actually happy they casted an older man. Honestly since the Matt Smith Era began with Season 5, Doctor Who has really turned me off and this is why...

I felt as maybe the show has gone a bit immature and geared towards a younger audience. I always liked how the Tennant Era could be for kids but was pretty dark and serious and handled a lot of serious issues. Thats what I loved about Dr. Who and thats why I started watching it in 2005. It was spooky and almost a sci-fi drama... I felt that Seasons 5-7 were more for a younger audience and wasn't ""serious enough"", if you will. Matt Smith was very goofy with his fez and broom and Karen Gillan was just no the type of actress that could fit into a sci-fi drama, unfortunately. They also focused on her childhood waaaay too much. In the Tennant Era, we didn't see any of Rose, Martha or Donna's child counterparts! Thats why I was so happy when her and Rory left the show. I absolutely adore Jenna Coleman. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Matt Smith as well. I honestly think he could have done a great job under RTD's writing, I just don't like how the fact that he was so young that they had to gear the whole serious from being drama to.... comedy?

I really hope that Capaldi will take the serious into a more dark and serious direction and we have more serious episodes. I love him in Skins and I also loved his small role in World War Z.  I don't mind the goofiness and jokes but honestly, I liked the old Doctor Who better and really hope Capaldi goes back to that.

Why? Because they have the ability to change a game if just once or twice they turn an opportunity like this into a goal.

Modern teams are so well organised and hard to break down, especially when playing away from home using a  counterattacking setup.

I watched it the other day, and every time I watch it, I spend the next few days thinking of it. Trying to imagine what Claude saw, trying to see the creature outside of the bus, knocking, just basking in the brilliance that is 'Midnight'.

true,mappsy91,null,null,"Well all our youth teams play 4-3-3 nowadays, I believe AVB has said we're switching to 4-3-3. If you look at his porto side when he won Europa league they played this:  

-----------------Helton---------------     
Săpunaru---Maicon---Rolando---Pereira    
----------------Fernando-------------    
---------Moutinho--------------------    
--------------------Gaurin------------    
Hulk----------------------------Varela    
----------------Falcao----------------  

I think with the players we now have we could set up really well exactly like this. The middle 3 you have one more defensive minded player breaking up anything before it gets to your defence with a box-box midfielder linking up between defence and attack and an attacking mid floating around behind the striker.   

On the wings at Porto AVB used Varela on the left, sticking to the touchline and sending in crosses with Hulk on the right cutting inside and shooting. Again we are set up nicely for this (except the other way around) with Lennon sticking out wide and either Bale or Chadli cutting in from the left.

---------------Lloris------------------  
Walker---Kaboul---Vertonghen---Benny  
-------------Sandro------------------  
-------Dembele-----------------------  
-----------------Bale-----------------  
Lennon--------------------------Chadli  
--------------Soldado-----------------  

This also gives us tons of adaptability, we can go more defensive with a 4-2-3-1 easily if we wish. Chadli and Bale can swap around. You can fit Paulinho, Holtby and Siggy all over the place.  

Just how I think we'll roll next year. COYS.

In my opinion, I wish we defaulted to using the phrase ""non-for-profit"" much more and the word ""charity"" less for all the companies in this sector of the private-sector industry. I feel it puts companies on the ""losing""-out foot from the get-go.

Just how the British government / public [do not understand the nature of IT work in the country][3], I'm sure that knowing the same mindset, the ""Mozilla Foundation"" would be classed as a ""charity"" here in the UK.

While it does have bias this [criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems#Criticism) of the report is nontheless valid. The report includes fairness of access as a criteria which instantly puts private health insurance models in a poor position. But nevermind that's not a contention I care for.

That said, what the report does show is that the UK is ranked 18th for efficiency. Not bad out of 191 countries until you note that many of our peers, and Oman for some reason, fare much better than we do. If an athelete comes 18th he doesn't hang his shoes up and say ""job well done"" he would try to improve. I'm not sure why you're trumpeting 18th as being a source of great pride.

Secondly, cost efficiency is not the be all and end all of an overall efficient system. A system could be time-efficient e.g. all patients get seen within 5 hours of feeling mildly unwell. We could argue strongly that this is the most efficient system in the world but it would cost a fortune.

[Take a look at this review](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/cancer-performance-england-lags-behind-other-countries-confirms-new-review) regarding cancer outcomes. It does not paint such a rosy picture compared to our peers. I presume you're ok to not compare the UK to sub-Saharan Africa?

And again, to re-iterate your only comment has been on the ONE opinion piece i linked to. Do you have any comments on the other two links? The first link regarding child care on the NHS is directly countering the view of the WHO. I don't suppose you bothered to read the report though. Maybe I should find a link to the guardian for you...

""They've been trying to build an Asda in Exmouth, down near the railway station and the town have fought bitterly against it saying it will kill the town centre.

The thing is, there's fuck all in the town centre to make people want to shop there. Almost every shop that shuts down gets replaced by either a charity shop or a hair-dressers. The town is slowly dying, unemployment is stupidly high and an Asda a minute away from the town centre would stop people going to the fucking great Tesco that is half an hour outside of town.

The people that campaigned against the Asda are the same arseholes who campaigned against a bowling alley down on the sea front because it would spoils the look of the Jurassic Coast - of course they all live in the most expensive part of town that overlooks the beach so really it's an issue about THEIR sea views.

Asda and Tesco aren't always the devil people make them out to be.""

The first is that they believe the contract clause is specific in that it says only that a bid above £40 million has to be communicated to the player, but there is no obligation on the club to sell. The second is that they believe the rumblings about legal action do not come from the Suarez camp, but rather from the edges by those seeking to become involved in what would be a major money earner for various people.
&gt;
&gt;There is, however, no doubt that Liverpool’s determination not to sell Suarez has been weakened by the constant speculation which Brendan Rodgers believes now has the potential to undermine team moral. However, there has been no weakening in the club’s position that it will take a fee of close to £50 million to prize the striker away.
&gt;
&gt;At the same time the club is also determined that if Suarez wants to leave, he must first submit a transfer request which would cost him a considerable loyalty bonus.",0,1375783673,null,0,false,0,cbhypzd,t3_1jsx44,t1_cbhypzd,t3_1jsx44,null,1429928332,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

We rarely used two strikers last year and if we did, it was usually when we needed a goal in the second half. It would be a mistake to use two strikers like Soldado and Adebayor at the same time, especially since formations like the 4-4-2 are dying for good reason. There's not nearly enough creativity in that.

It's quite known that AVB prefers the 4-3-3, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's what we go with. The 4-2-3-1 has worked well for us, so we'll probably be seeing it used this year.

A lot of the positions you mention involve a degree of seniority or experience that means they're not necessarily commonplace or easily accessible. Perhaps revise your definition of 'run of the mill'? 

A brief search on 'recruiter' average salaries very quickly shows they're [not around the£100k mark](http://www.reed.co.uk/average-salary/recruitment-consultancy). Taking OTE into account it might be possible but again does depend on years of experience, the kind of clients you work with, the kind of rates your company offers, the kind of positions you recruit for (high street or telesales jobs are going to net you a lot less than a senior software architect or specialists in the oil and gas industry).

In other words - for many of your suggested roles it's the select few that can see £100k realistically and the rest dealing with a lot less. 

[See here](http://career-advice.monster.co.uk/salary-benefits/pay-salary-advice/uk-average-salary-graphs/article.aspx) for an accurate insight into average salaries in the UK - or alternatively [here](http://www.reed.co.uk/average-salary) or [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20442666) or even better [here](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2269520/Best-paid-jobs-2012-Official-figures-national-average-UK-salaries-400-occupations.html). 

*All* of the above sources show average salaries well below £100k for jobs across multiple sectors. The last link lists the best paid jobs of 2012 and indicates that *only* CEO and SO roles see over £100,000 with even Sales and Marketing Directors seeing an average nearer £80,000. 

I appreciate you may know people who earn in excess of £100,000 but your perspective may be polarized if you think it's common across the UK. 

&gt; Which bit of this is wrong, exactly?

Currently there is a large skill shortage in the UK for *good* software developers. Recent visa changes mean that many overseas developers need sponsorship to work in the UK (which smaller companies and even a couple of larger ones I could name tend not to provide). 

Good developers tend to go into the contract market and they *do*  command rates equally over £100k a year - however the safety of a permanent position tends to be much less at the aforementioned £30k to £60k a year outside of London. 

A lot of the decent graduates etc. get snapped up by the larger corporations / financials with the attraction of larger salaries etc. which means there's a lot of demand for developers across the board. It's not a role that anyone can walk into from their bedroom - it *is* possible but formal training / being able to display you have the acumen to do it are still valuable in the industry and whilst there are always stories of fantastic bedroom developers securing well paid jobs at Google because of some brilliant idea they had - this is a little like implying that every kid with a football can expect to end up with Manchester FC because they got spotted in a park.

If developers were plumbers, you'd be paying through the nose to find a good one and asking them to come up to Manchester from Essex to do the job.  ",0,1375785475,null,0,false,0,cbhyxpy,t3_1jsrxn,t1_cbhyxpy,t1_cbhysdc,null,1429928232,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That *is* my definition of 'run of the mill' though. Most people I know do these types of jobs, and if they aren't earning £100k now, most of them will sooner or later. In my life, that's run of the mill. 

&gt;A brief search on 'recruiter' average salaries very quickly shows they're not around the£100k mark. 

That depends on the kind of recruitment I guess. She works in a niche, and is generally recruiting people on salaries at least commensurate with hers. It has taken her ten years to get to where she is, but for someone in her early thirties, she's doing pretty well. I think her base is about £70k

&gt;In other words - for many of your suggested roles it's the select few that can see £100k realistically and the rest dealing with a lot less.

It's really not. It's people who are good at what they do and want to achieve a decent standard of living.

&gt;All of the above sources show average salaries well below £100k for jobs across multiple sectors. The last link lists the best paid jobs of 2012 and indicates that only CEO and SO roles see over £100,000 with even Sales and Marketing Directors seeing an average nearer £80,000.

I never once mentioned ""average salary"" though. I said that earning £100k a year is a VERY GOOD SALARY.

&gt;It's not a role that anyone can walk into from their bedroom - it is possible but formal training / being able to display you have the acumen to do it are still valuable in the industry and whilst there are always stories of fantastic bedroom developers securing well paid jobs at Google because of some brilliant idea they had - this is a little like implying that every kid with a football can expect to end up with Manchester FC because they got spotted in a park.

Plumbers can't walk into plumbing jobs ""from their bedrooms"" either though - they have to undergo considerable technical and on-the-job training. 

&gt;If developers were plumbers, you'd be paying through the nose to find a good one and asking them to come up to Manchester from Essex to do the job.

We have done great work in replacing our strike force with 2 young, talented a natural goal scorers. van Wolfswinkle and Hooper are going to be looked at as our big names for this season, along with Fer in the midfield, who I think will be a truly brilliant Premier League player.

As for the plays from last season, Snodgrass will be key, along with Bassong who is currently nursing himself back to health. When all fit, we have a Back line that was solid for most of last season, a strong midfield (Though a little more creativity would be nice) and 2 very encouraging strikers. It all points towards what we hope to be an impressive season, with many Norwich fans predicting top half finish and plenty of pundits naming us the under rated team in the league.

As for formation, it's likely to be a cross between 4-5-1 and 4-4-2 with RvW and Hooper upfront. They can both play as the 9 or 10 position and it is hoped that they will form a strong partnership upfront. The formation I'd go with first game of the season is:

       Whittaker - Turner - Bassong - Olsson

Furthermore, people who suffer from hypertension should be careful with salt as it can have an impact there. Ultimately, eating more potassium is probably more important than reducing salt.

Not that I'm jumping in to white knight a company but...  this sounds like a managed service scenario and the bigger the provider the more skew there tends to be between what the client wants and what the offered packages are. 

You want a website, modern, secure and capable of serving maybe 2000 uniques a day with 5 - 10 concurrent users. 

The smallest package the supplier has is a full e-commerce solution (WebSphere middleware, IIS frontend, DB2/ORA backend) on equipment designed to deal with 200,000+ uniques a day and 2000 concurrent users. 

That's a lot of kit that needs paying for, about the same for the software licenses.  After that you're going to monitor it at the service providers NOC which requires a team of bods (x people to cover y shifts to allow 24/7 coverage), their equipment and the usual interdepartmental charges for hooking everything up.  The website needs developing obviously and content uploaded.  

On top of that you're going to have to pay for all the custom work that's needed to make something so small work on something designed to take the sort of abuse O2's web shop does. One million pounds is actually a steal.

Bollocks. Firstly it's been rarely tried and when it has been tried it's seemingly worked fine. I don't know why they mentioned Santini, Arnesen continued after he left and was replaced by Comolli who was only replaced when we hired Redknapp. We should have stuck to our guns on that

But no, I think that to live an average life is depressing and if you can achieve more for yourself and your family, then you should strive for that.

No snark, just indifferent observation. Understand I don't *care* what kind of life you have - just that you're mistaken to think it reflects the status quo across the country. 

Saying that £100,000 p/a jobs are run of the mill is incorrect. They're run of the mill *to you*. You're perfectly right in saying that being average is not something to strive for - but we're not talking about striving, are we? 

You go on to essentially admit this here: 

&gt; ""Average"" salary is meaningless, because yes, most people don't have the education/opportunity to achieve what I am privileged to have been able to.

Given that, £100k jobs are not as commonplace (for *everyone*) as you made them out to be. That needs no further debate. 

&gt; Great! Sixth form debating club! 100 points!

Now there's some snark? But it's misplaced - you used this phrase that describes an average - then denied talking about averages. No debating is necessary - you picked the wrong phrase my friend! 

&gt; What does?

I'm going to ignore this because - frankly - the whole conversation has gone on far too long. I believe I've made my point - that £100,000 jobs are not run-of-the-mill / average across the UK and that you have a blinkered world perspective to perceive them as such. 

That's how it goes I guess - I'm not about to leap up and down and call you over-privileged or whatever (again, I don't care what your background is) - but in the interests of a factual discussion on the realities of salary across the UK and how legitimate it is to pay the executives of charities large sums of money, it's important to illustrate that your perspective is out of place in the context of the conversation and that £100,000 *is* a large sum of money.

true,gadhaboy,null,null,"Sure, it's a template off another redditor's letter.  Here it is:

Dear Julian Huppert,

I am writing to your concerning the Prime Minister's suggestions to
limit internet freedom.  Currently our laws overstep the mark by
outlawing certain types of pornography on television and banning
ownership of certain types of animated pornography which are perfectly
legal in many countries around the world. The further regulations
suggested will take us to new levels of
censorship never seen before in true liberal democracies.

While the government clearly lacks the moral authority to
implement such a plan, it also clearly lacks the intellectual
rigour to understand that it will fail to achieve any of the
desired goals. All the recent statistics have shown that as
access to pornography has grown, the number of sexual assaults
committed has fallen.

These plans also raise many concerns about enforcement and data
privacy. I would be greatly appreciative if you could try and
find answers from ministers for the following questions I
have:

1. Who decides what pornography counts as rape? Is extreme
BDSM rape? Is animated pornography depicting rape illegal?

2. Will this list of people who have requested pornography be
completely private?

3. How will you be able to tell who is accessing such pornography
without monitoring everybody's internet traffic?

4. How will websites hosted abroad be forced to comply?

5. There are many websites which are not centred on pornography,
but often have pornographic links posted on them. Two notable
examples of such websites include both Reddit and 4Chan, Reddit
being a website where people share links to other websites and
4Chan being an image discussion board.  How will these sites be
treated?

6. Even if the censorship were 100% efficient, why does the
government have the right to monitor my viewing content?

7. I also find myself having to ask who actually wants this? On
every comment section on every website I have visited, including
the Daily Mail, the majority of people have been in opposition to
this plan.

8. Is this measure intended to win the vote of sheltering
suburban parents who will most likely vote Conservative
regardless of this bill? Or is it to try and win the vote of the
young generation who are increasingly libertarian and oppose the
growth in the nanny state and will now never considering voting
Conservative?

9. How does the government expect these plans to be implemented?
There are many measures which can be used to circumvent any
restrictions on a free internet. Anybody who is half computer
literate will be able to start using proxy servers or virtual
private networks in order to beat the system. Will the government
sanction and/or criminalise individuals who choose to subvert the
system?  If not, why not?

In conclusion, I have to ask whether you truly believe the
government is suited to deciding how to use a technology they
know little about?  I greatly look forward to your response.

I feel very strongly about this issue, not due to making it more
difficult for me to access pornography, but due to my belief in
self-determination and a free internet.  I hope you will agree.

Yours sincerely,

That goal against Chelsea (his second EPL goal was it?) in the ending part of the 11-12 season was a nice one too, tucked it into the corner.

But for me, Allen looks like he's more comfortable going forward at the moment while Henderson doesn't seem to have enough nerve to go forward as much, though he should.

You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. 

This myth that there are dangerous breeds is absolutely ridiculous. Any dog can be a potential harm to someone. If you don't socialise a dog with other dogs at an early age, walk it, do typical basic training techniques like interrupting it's food and taking it away from it (so it doesn't become protective over food etc.) then there is that potential.

Saying dangerous dog breeds is absolutely retarded though and shows you don't really know what you're talking about when I know plenty of staffies at my dog training group that are harmless and obedient as any other dog breed. Unfortunately however these dogs get a bad name when a typical ""bad man"" wants to own a ""hard looking"" dog. 

How do you propose to have a license then? A money making £100 a piece of piss test that anyone can zoom through? 

By that arguement our road deaths should be falling not rising (in the year 2009 320 more people died on the roads than have died from dog attacks in 13 years).

Image of naked woman sits on shelf, child can see it. Put a cover on it, child cannot see it.

I am aware that preventing children from looking at this stuff is only part of the argument, but it is a major one because children are so impressionable. 

I think it's also not exactly difficult to see that erotic fiction is not the same as an image, and the historical context of naked women vs. naked men is also different. Not that I disagree with what someone in this thread said (no idea where I saw it) about semi-naked men on magazine covers also being damaging to men, it's just not the same.

How do we know that Staffies were even included in the initial study? They mention '11 breeds' and '33 breeds' but never actually which those were! So that could be anywhere from 33 to 44 different breeds of dogs and there are only 32 breeds of dogs mentioned by name in the article. Staffies could be the 11th most aggressive or not feature in the 33-44 breeds at all. 

A Chihuahua may well be a vicious dog, but it's physically tiny (including it's teeth) and it's muscle-mass to body ratio is even smaller compared to that of a Staffie.

How does any of that give her the insight or knowledge to make effective changes on how the internet functions, and have those changes actually have the desired effect?

I cannot see reason or facts convincing her how ineffectual this will be, as I don't think she will understand any of them. She simply has an agenda she wants to push on everything she can, and this time it's the ISPs that are the target.

Trying to dig up some facts on her lead to this article, which had an paragraph that I found interesting;

&gt; Beyond reminding parents of their own responsibilities, Perry is working on a filter to keep children safe online. The plan is for a filter that checks the age of the child browsing, rather than her original call for all users to opt-in to accessing adult content on their computer, which a government consultation rejected. All public wifi will have an automatic block on adult material. She is also trying to persuade mobile phone companies and internet service providers to pool all the money they currently spend on education about online safety and parental controls into one pot to create a hub for all parents on online safety, and where they can report abuse.

A Rottweiler is potentially more dangerous than a Chihuahua or a Westie.  This is why people choose these sorts of dogs when they want to use a dog as a status symbol or a weapon - they are large, powerful and dangerous in the wrong hands.  

If dog licencing was reintroduced, it could be used to flag up potential people who shouldn't have a pet.  That's not to say that it would work very well or be easy to enforce.  I also think that dog owners should have public liability cover for their dog as a minimum, but that's another matter.

Birmingham looked woeful on Saturday but should have too much for Plymouth.

Swindon have a newish team and were unlucky to lose to peterborough on saturday. Did well in the cup last season, so should put out a strong side. Torquay will probably get battered.

Bournemouth v Portsmouth looks tasty but should be an easy game for Bournemouth.

It's not loyalty to ask someone to honor a contract that they fucking signed a year ago; that's just business.

Now, let me also say that I totally disagree with the LFC fans that think if we just hold on to Suarez through the window he'll put his head down and work hard to retain his place on the national team/keep his value up.  I think Suarez is ABSOLUTELY the type of player who will feign injury and sit on the bench to ""teach"" LFC a lesson.  

And finally, I hope to God that if Suarez does this, FSG has the balls to sit him for the rest of his contract (or at least until we get a reasonable foreign offer).  It's downright detrimental to LFC to sell him to Arsenal.  If this were Chelsea I'd say let him go... if this were City I'd say let him go... but selling to Arsenal can only be matched by selling him to Tottenham in terms of sheer stupidity.

He's a different player than all of our other forward options.  His strengths are different, but he's really good at them.  He's a very intelligent player and his ability to find space for himself or create it for others is exceptional.  He's not going to wow anyone with mazy dribbles through 3-4 players or have a highlight reel of crazy one in a million strikes.  But he will play right off the shoulder of the last defender and nip into any inch of space they give him.  He's a constant threat for slipping past a defender to receive a ball into space and he's really good at it.  His movement is exceptional.  I think he's panicked a bit in front of goal for us as his finishing has looked woeful, especially in comparison to what he did for Roma and has been doing for the Italy U21s.  It's actually really weird to watch the difference between Roma and Italy Borini compared to Liverpool Borini.  I really hope he can figure this out because I really rate him and I think he can be a very successful player for us.

I'm really wondering if the way he plays is a good match for Liverpool's system and preferred tactics.  We may be a little too patient and methodical for him as he's often in good positions and we aren't picking him out.  He's still really good at pulling defenders around and making space for our other attackers but we'll want more out of him than that.

His injury issues have certainly made it hard for him to fit in as well.  He barely played last season due to 2 rare and serious problems.  If he stays fit and gets a run of games I really hope we see the real Borini come out of his shell and knock in a few goals for us.

&gt;Dear kayleighswift

&gt;Thank you for your email. I appreciate that this is a very important issue the profile of which has rightly been raised significantly recently but I am afraid I do not share your scepticism. You do however raise some very important points about not wishing to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater' as regards making sure that genuine advice and support sites are still available to people who need them be it the LGBT community or others. If you can give specific examples of where this has happened and you think could happen I am very happy to make representations. This is however very much still work in progress though.

&gt;As the former Children's Minister where I also co-chaired UKCCIS this is something I spent a lot of time on, much of which is now coming to fruition. It is absolutely wrong to claim that the measures that are being considered are not important for child protection. They do not in any case involve legislation at this stage - they are instead protocols which are being agreed with ISPs and search engines which will only require legislation if they do not all sign up and there has already been a high degree of voluntary agreement.
There is clearly no silver bullet to making children safer on the Internet and it will always be a question of safer. Rather than completely safer given the international and unregulatable nature of the web with now less than 3% of harmful content said to originate in the UK in any case. As part of putting together a 'jigsaw' of safeguards these measures will encourage more parents to have active filters in their homes and hopefully greater awareness of what their children may be accessing on mobile devices. Another important part of the jigsaw is the number of wi-fi providers now automatically blocking access to adult sites.

&gt;I also think that having pop-ups on search engines when searching for clearly abusive subjects will deter a number of people who do not appreciate the severity of what they are searching for and can now be warned about the possibility of committing a criminal offence if they proceed. Others will not be able to progress to a harmful site unless they know a specific web address and that may well be blocked if actions such as that already being taken by the likes of IWF are expanded.
Then there are of course the hardened a users who exchange abusive images and are already committing an offence for whom the expanded activities of CEOPS within SOCA will apply but as you well know they are notorious at using technology to evade detection.

&gt;I do not agree that this amounts to censorship but its merits in helping to combat one of the most pernicious forms of child abuse at its worst and an insidious and creeping influence on impressionable youngsters too readily cajoled into browsing inappropriate sites are too important to ignore any longer!

&gt;I hope this is helpful and sets out my position clearly and if this did involve legislation then I would be enthusiastically voting for it and not against.

Sure he doesn't score 10 goals a season or get as many assists as we would like, but he isn't high maintenance and is always willing to fight for his spot. He was so much better his second season compared to his first.

Another point is, there's always a spot in the XI for someone who works hard and tracks back. Look at Danny Welbeck.

There's plenty of pubs, clubs and a lot of music venues for smaller bands if that's your thing in Brighton.

There's the Downs, too, really pretty for walking and even though you're going to be here in winter-spring there's the occasional nice day. You could try to walk some of the South Downs way if you're into that. At some point make sure you go to the top of the Downs to see across the Weald, though! It's gorgeous. 

Most students try and stick close to Lewes Road when finding a place to live (which has the main bus routes to uni), Moulsecoomb, Coldean, Kemp Town or go the other side of Brighton to Hove to find a place to live (Hove takes a while to get in from on the bus because of traffic). Word of warning, don't live in Woodingdean without checking the bus routes first, you'll either have to cycle up the Downs on a busy road (they're only just making a proper cycle lane) or get the bus into town and back out again. The direct 84 bus only goes twice in the morning and once in the evening(!). Living out of town is an option, too, but you'll be far away from everything.

The campus has a gym with cheaper prices for students, don't know how that compares to town, though. There's a few gyms on the seafront, not sure on pricing. Seafront's fun for running on, was going to mention the beach but you're probably not going to want to go for a swim Jan-May. 

The other notable place nearby is Lewes, quite a quaint little town with a castle (unless it's bonfire night but sadly you're not here for that). Plenty of nice restaurants to burn your money in, too. 

If you're savvy with the train, booking trains in advance, you can get sub £10 return tickets to London for a day out sometimes.

I think nationalising the infrastructure at this stage would be a bad move. It introduces a lot of complications, and it would be very expensive as the government would have to buy them out. In my opinion, it should never have been privatised in the first place.

As others in this thread have mentioned, BT is one of the few instances where privatisation has worked. Huge demand for internet services and large subsidies to support that demand are probably the reasons why. There are still rural areas in the country though with 512Kb connections or lower, and the only way these are going to improve is with massive subsidies. If left to their own devices, private companies wouldn't bother. 

It's the same with postal services, although the only difference being is that when it is privatised the government will lose the company profits, but will still have to subsidise the rural post offices and such otherwise they will simply close. In the long run it will be far more expensive for the government and for the tax payers, considering the price of letters and parcels will likely increase too.

To which bellend1234 responded that we should just bid over the expected buying price so that we look classy enough for you. 

**Clearly** Arsenal have been tipped off that a £40,000,001 bid would be enough to trigger Suarez's clause and that's why they put the bid in. Why on earth should Arsenal bid over that price if they have been told that will be enough to secure Suarez's services? Why does it make Arsenal classless to bid the minimum amount?

The only team looking like classless twats throughout all this are Liverpool. An inane manager gnashing his teeth and speaking out against Arsenal at every opportunity, a joke of an owner that has such little respectability he makes puerile insults about Arsenal's offer over Twitter and to cap it all off Liverpool now looking like they're reneging on an agreement they had in place with Suarez.

Pathetic.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"I think this is the quiet part that is forgotten about a prospective signing of Rooney. He *would* be worth every penny.

Rooney rode the pine last season perhaps unfairly. Let's not forget he scored 34 goals in all competitions in 2011-12. If we're going to compare expensive forwards here, he scored 12 in 27 league apps. last season while Torres scored 8 in 36.

Lomoeffect did a good run through of dnim7's analysis at the top of the thread. Rooney is quite capable in the air, he's capable from range, he's great at harassing centre backs, he's a strong and sturdy player, and he wouldn't occupy a spot behind the striker as the prevailing assumption seems to be the club would be signing him as a 'world class striker'. 

Should Chelsea pay £30M for Rooney? Probably not, but it doesn't matter.

We shouldn't have paid £50M for Fernando Torres but we did, and the vast majority of people here don't question the amount spent but instead sit on either side of the Torres-fence damning him as a shitty player or saying that this match/week/month/season/manager is going to the be one that turns it all around for him.

I suspect the same thing will happen if we the club buys Rooney. There's going to be a faction of people who think it was a waste, and a faction of people who think he's worth it. I'd speculate that he *would* be worth it, and would be successful if he comes to the bridge, and the same people who have been bemoaning this saga will hail Mourinho as a genius for signing this guy.

tl;dr - people need to chill out. If this goes through it goes through, you're all going to live with it one way or another.

Not looking to argue, I just feel a little underwhelmed by the progress of the first team under FSG so far.

What is the plan here? Build a team over 3-4 years to challenge for top 4?
How do we keep Coutinho,  Sturridge etc. If not matching their ambitions over this period.

It's a very cynical view, and I'd suggest not to tar every prospective employer with the same brush.

Also think of it from another angle.  In a few months, things going well we'll be looking to take on another programmer for our new startup.  We will probably be going for a graduate.  The reason is we don't have much cash, but we do have lots of experience.  It costs us less cash, but costs us more time.  Ironically, in another life, if I was providing intensive training of that kind, I'd be charging more than double the salary (as from that perspective, there is the cost of the desk/office, pc, very expensive software licenses etc).

For many employers the cost of hiring the employee isn't the biggest one, it is the cost of the training and the environment (office, insurance, etc) they work in.

Ultimately it comes down to this, what else would you spend your time doing?  You say you live in a town with high un-employment rates, I am guessing that means you don't need to spend much of your time applying for jobs and you don't want to move, so if the volunteer work doesn't cost you a 'paid' job, then what's the harm?",0,1375802617,null,0,false,0,cbi2yja,t3_1jt2zf,t1_cbi2yja,t1_cbi1cy4,null,1429926355,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

true,cacafogo,num5,,"For all the talk of Rose being better going forward than defensively, I'm really not seeing it.  His pass completion % was only 76.8.  In comparison Walker and Naughton were both just above 83% with more passes per game.  Rose also had a lot less accurate crosses, long balls, and through balls than them.  Across the board he is worse than both Kyles going forward.

Defensively, Rose managed 2.3 tackles per game and 2.7 interceptions per game.  That is slightly better than Walker's 2.3 tackles and 2.4 interceptions, and better than Naughton's 2.4 tackles and 1.7 interceptions.  Rose also commits slightly more fouls per game than both of them.

For completeness's sake, BAE had a 73.3% pass success rate, a *lot* more long balls at 5.2 per game (highest on our entire team), 1.3 tackles and 3 interceptions per game.

To me, if BAE can return to his old form he would still be our starting LB.  However, he is getting older and if someone came in with a bid I would not be sad to see him go while he has some value.  Based purely on the stats, Rose looks solid defensively but is a liability going forward while Naughton can handle both very well.  Contrary to what I believe is the popular opinion, I have always been comfortable with Naughton playing on either side.  Apart from a few really bad errors (which happens to other players too;  Walker against Chelsea comes to mind) he really didn't look too bad.  I think both Rose and Naughton have a shot at winning the starting job if BAE can't get it together and we don't bring in someone else.

There is absolutely no suggestion that he did, nor is there any evidence, or statement from Atletico, Costa, or Liverpool suggesting that there even is a clause, or indeed a bid. There is currently just media speculation regarding any sort of release clause. The suggested bid (£21-22m) just seems like a fair valuation of the player.

&gt; Liverpool's behaviour with the Dempsey transfer was far worse, yet I don't see any of you talking about that.

This is entirely unrelated and not even comparable. Liverpool wanted Dempsey, but weren't willing to spend above what they deemed he was worth. Fulham obviously wanted to keep hold of him. An article was posted on the LFC website, in error, stating that Liverpool had signed him. It was quickly removed. Fulham were pissed at this, as they though it unsettled the player. As a result, Fulham wanted to charge Liverpool £2m more than they ended up selling him to Spurs for. So basically you have two clubs disagreeing over a fee, which happens all the time, and a staff member mistakenly publishing a pre-prepared article on a website, before taking it down.

Mancini is temperamental, cantankerous, charismatic, animated.  They are his strengths and his flaws.  You can see that he hates losing, and I'm sure that the players didn't want to deal with an angry Mancini.

Pellegrini strikes me as calm, lucid, methodical, quiet.  Again, strengths and weaknesses, but with Mancini I trusted that he had the tactical knowledge to set out a well-drilled attacking side *and* get them feeling motivated and ready for a scrap.

It does, I'm not going to disagree with you. It does send perhaps the wrong message, regardless of these particular circumstances.

&gt; The main problem though is calling a 13 year old girl a ""sexual predator"" ... presumably he has some disapproval about her being sexually active at all.

I'm confused, is she a ""child"", or is she sexually active? Because I thought the whole issue about child abuse was the issue of consent ? If she's already sexually active, then she's able to give consent and the law is an ass - because setting a hard limit of 16 without any consideration of individual circumstances is just as foolish as setting a fixed term per-crime.

I think this is the point the judge was trying to make. You cannot set a hard-and-fast rule about what constitutes a ""child"" based solely on age, and then take an already sexually active one and say she was ""abused"", based on the age of the perpetrator.

Which is really what this comes down to. We all realize that many teens are sexually active, and have an ""unwritten rule"" that provided the two partners are within a certain age range, it's okay. If that age range is too big, there's the issue of grooming / abuse and is generally considered creepy. We already make our own interpretation of what is acceptable, regardless of the law.

And this is exactly what the judge has done in this case .. he's looked at all the circumstances, including the sexually activity of the girl, and made a judgement based on that ... and so for people to be reacting ""she's still child (but a sexually active one)"" makes a nonsense of the original outrage.

The quality is probably shoddy and the mark-up quite high, so it's possible. Just a question of how many units they moved. I imagine that the club doesn't have any effective way of measuring the state of play with regard to brand status/exposure over there. Park no doubt got QPR on the screens in Korea. I had a work trip to Amsterdam last year, and after ending one evening sedating myself in a coffeeshop I randomly spent an hour and a half watching Korean breakfast TV back in the hotel room. They lead their football news with updates on all the biggest Korean names in Europe and how they fared over the weekend - Park being the biggest. I think the fundamental miscalculation the board made was that they only care about the players and their performances, they couldn't give a toss about the teams they play for. Bolted on to relegation the whole thing seems a bit of a waste of time.

In the example of La Liga, the release clause is something mandatory by law and made public, which means clubs can't really complain about it being triggered. 

In Suarez's case, the first issue is that Arsenal received confidential contract information and acted on it (40 million + 1 pound is too precise to assume otherwise). Secondly, it isn't a release clause, only a negotiation clause (No proof for this, but simple logic: Arsenal and Suarez would have taken legal action if it was in fact a release clause, contracts are seldom vague.) By making their bid trigger this negotiation clause, Arsenal are effectively forcing Liverpool to allow them to officially unsettle their player. While yes, Liverpool willingly included the clause, note that Arsenal are free to bid above the 40 million line since that is not a release sum, unlike in La Liga where you'd have to be daft to bid higher than the release clause.

I worked hard and somehow 10 years later managed to end up doing just one of my dream jobs. It probably helped that I am in an IT field, but I managed to find employers who valued the experience and overlooked the less than stellar degree scoring.

There are two points to address here:

1.The internet is about freedom of speech, everyone with a computer has a voice here which leads to the internet being an ADULT place.
But children need a space to learn in and be educated by the vast resource of wonder that is the internet.

The answer to this problem is educating parents in how to put their (already available with most providers) filters on their internet connection, but Cameron wont do this because it has less impact (he needs to be seen to stand for ""old British values"") and is the harder path.

2 A ban on rape porn indicates something; Cameron believes that because people see a thing, people must then do a thing. 
Basically an extension on the ""video games make kids violent"" argument which I am fairly certain is untrue.
For instance I saw Gru steal the moon in despicable me the other day and I have no urge to steal anything moon related.
Also a large % of the male and female population have rape fantasies, what are they supposed to do huh? Use their imagination?
Hire a homeless guy to choke them?

TL:DR
 Child safety is parent’s responsibility.
Watching rape porn does not make you a rapist and harms no one.

Suarez is usefull in the counterattacking due to his directness and ability to round a last defender or goalkeeper. 

In possesion football, due to a lack of space in which to play in the final third of the pitch, a player of Suarez type becomes almost essential..... he can work in the tightest of spaces and find a way through the opponents defence where most players cannot.

true,Andures,null,null,"Furthering u/Riverboat_Gambler's reply below, release clauses are public information made available upon request in Spain (otherwise they are redundant). 

Secondly, Suarez's clause is, by all accounts, not a release clause. If it were, Liverpool would have opened themselves up for legal action the moment Rodgers publicly rejected the bid. The fact that Suarez has yet to take legal recourse is further proof that the clause in his contract is murky at best. 

Thirdly, there is no legal precedent of footballer release clauses in UK law. While players have moved due to their 'release clauses', these have been mostly down to goodwill and an unwillingness to set precedent in the courts. The closest example would have been when Gabriel Heinze tried to move to Liverpool from Manchester United. A formal oral agreement in front of witnesses would usually be considered binding, but the courts ruled that it was not a binding commitment, and United used the fact that they have not sold a player directly to Liverpool in recent history in their favour. 

What Arsenal is doing right now is taking action on a clause that is supposed to be confidential, with the explicit intent to use the negotiation allowed by the clause to unsettle Suarez and hopefully lower Liverpool's asking price or forcing their hand. Since Liverpool is not obligated to accept the 40 million + 1 pound bid, I think this is why Liverpool and their fans consider it underhanded. 

To add on the release clause thing in Spain (and other countries), clubs seldom actually trigger release clauses and bypass the selling club completely (with the recent exception of Bayern Munich in the purchase of Javi Martinez and Goetze). Even Real Madrid tries not to do it. They rather bid in the vicinity of the release price and negotiate with the selling club, using the idea that they could be assholes about if they wanted to, but they'd much rather it be amicable so as not to affect relations between the clubs. (I'm pretty sure Bayern will always have to trigger release clauses to buy any players from Bilbao in the future, Bilbao is unlikely to do business with them ever again.) 

In conclusion, even in a country that release clauses are mandatory by law, clubs tend to maintain inter-club relations by not triggering the clauses. Arsenal is triggering a **negotiation** clause intentionally in a country where release clauses do not have legal precedent, effectively throwing any semblance of inter-club harmony down the drain.

I knew I'd get what I wanted if I pandered to him. Of course, he's rude as f**k himself sometimes, i.e., earlier in the week: 'well why couldn't you do that this morning?'; I'd come back from Paris to 135 emails and he stupidly promised someone he's afraid of that I'd do something on Monday when my work is split between two people, DUDE, ya don't go prioritising my workload for me here, because I know exactly what I'm doing. I did his thing on Tuesday.

I repeat my previous statement.

Either you're ignorant of a thousand years of history, ignorant of current social conditions or purposely ignorant for the sake of a conversation which is making you look increasingly ridiculous. 

Disliking an actor cast because of their age is perfectly fine.  You might have a characterisation of a certain role in your head which does not square with the perfectly natural aging process.  This doesn't say anything about them personally and just states that the role needs to be younger; this is why 75 year olds aren't cast as Hannah Montana's best friend.  Age is incredibly important in establishing the character because our conceptions about age differ from 6 years olds to 66 year olds.

Somebody's skin colour has nothing to do with the characterisation process.  It's a hatred of a certain race due to their inalienable existence.  It is a personal reflection on themselves as being directly less valuable due to their race.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I think if Suarez wanted to go to Arsenal then he would have been going nuts to make it happen by now.  His relative silence related to Arsenal's interest and bids for him seem to indicate that he's either indifferent or just straight up doesn't want to go there.  I'm sure I'm being quite a bit hopeful in thinking this way but he just doesn't seem like the sort to do things quietly and the hell he caused for Gronigen and to a lesser extent Ajax when he decided to move on doesn't seem beyond him to do to us as well.

I think the problem for him now is that Real's interest has faded and no other huge European club is coming in for him.  I could maybe see him causing problems to force a move to Chelsea or City if one of them came in, but I don't see either of them going for it (City just bought 2 strikers and Chelsea wants Rooney).

I don't know what to think anymore.  I still have a feeling he's going to move this summer but I don't know where.  It probably will not be Arsenal unless they come back with a massively improved bid AND Suarez goes mental trying to force the transfer.  I really hope he stays and gives us one more phenomenal year.

Martha was a doctor in training, and she didn't get any power from the Doctor. Her power came from her story (a big metaphor for the power of words and storytelling, honestly) and it doesn't matter that no one remembers it, because she still saved the planet. She didn't do it for the glory. And at any rate she CHOSE to leave the Doctor because she knew he'd never love her back. That's strength. And this is coming from a person who doesn't particularly like Martha, but I can still admit she was one of the most qualified companions; she was intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. 
Donna was written to be a tragic character. She became much more than just a temp, despite her not having any confidence in herself; the drama comes from the irony of her not being able to remember, and her losing the life that made her that way. But she still did the things she did, just like Martha. That's good and compelling writing, and just because you weren't happy about it doesn't mean it wasn't well written drama.
Now you want to say you like Moffat's female characters better, that's fine, but they most certainly aren't any better or worse than Davies. Davies gave us a doctor, a shop girl, and a temp, all of which save the world. Moffat's first act in office was to give us a sexy call girl who becomes a model (and a writer later, but like it was an afterthought. like, now her adventuring is over, might as well sit down and write).

Regarding Dembele, his pass success percentage was over 90 last season, which only 11 other players managed (if you ignore the ones who only played a few games).  He's also in the top 20 for key passes per game.  He didn't play tons of through balls, but he was also stuck covering for Parker's aimless running.  Your comments on his passing are exactly why I say he is severely underrated in that area.

My point was that we don't need a single player to be that ""killer"" passer, though I would argue that several members of our team are suitable for that role.  Many players in the team are capable of making those passes; we don't need a single player to step up into that role because everyone is chipping in.

Given their promise to protect young people they should have said no to a coalition that sold out young people rather than trying their luck as a minor partner. They gambled and lost but they did not do the selling out. They watched it happen without doing what they had promised. The Tories are vastly more to blame for this and that truth gets lost in the endless hate about the Lib Dems. 

While I hate to use such a clichéd analogy it's like hating on northern French collaborators for the holocaust and ignoring the main instigators, the nazis.

Which is kind of my point about ageism being natural and normal, and something even you do.

Also, yes, I'm an educator, and someone who researches learning and brain development, and I can guarantee any mainstream school is harming kids because the goal is to make them competitive against others while being obedient to ""authority"", rather than learning to work well with diverse people (and not just humans) and to think for themselves so that we can really solve our planet's most pressing problems.

Remember, the reason there are the red lines on the floor is to ensure quarreling MPs stay at least a sword's length away from each other, so you could argue a bit of booing is rather tame! 

Part of the reason for the way things are is that MPs have historically been from public schools, where the ""yah boo"" type of debating and tribal politics is common.  We may see a change as more state-educated MPs get elected, but I think more women in senior positions would have the biggest positive effect.

The other thing to bear in mind is that this rowdy behaviour is usually reserved for the big set-piece occasions... the budget speech, and PMQs.

I agree, while it's not extremely uncommon for us as viewers to not know what's happening (at least for a while), it is for the Doctor. He's very confident and almost always knows - at least to a certain extent - what's going on. Nothing's *really* creepy as long as the Doctor's there, knowing everything about it and making some funny comments.

true,bcash,null,null,"Let's look at this from the opposite angle, what is to keep house prices high, or even accelerate.

What irks me about all media reporting of house prices is that there's subtle mentions of ""momentum"" (in the respectable ones) and ""last chance to buy or your always be a loser"" (from the not-so respectable ones).  The housing market is not an engine with it's own, it's a market driven by people acting upon it.

""Yeah, it's supply and demand innit."" so they say.  But for this saying to have any meaning, we need to look at the supply and the demand.

Whatever the movements of the housing market, some things have always remained true, the most important one being that the bottom of the rung is always within reach of a first time buyer with above-average income.  Even in the most expensive parts of London this is still true today (although, of course, that redefines what 'above average' means...).  Any notion that house prices will get so expensive that no-one can buy them is, of course, nonsense; if demand shrinks to zero, prices will come down.  (Yes, yes, BTL, we know... there's rich Russians willing to bid a one-bed flat up to £1,000,000 and then rent it for a 0.45% yield... and they'll keep doing this in the face of an improving economy and better investment opportunities elsewhere, obviously!)

What we take from this is that house prices are linked to affordability and supply of credit.  Interest rates are currently low, they won't get any lower; they might not go up in the near future, but there's only one direction they might move in.  Then you have Osbournes housing subsidy... this will drive prices higher for the period it's in operation, it can't not, it's free money!  However: 1) there's significant questions as to what happens after the end of the three years, and 2) how many people actually qualify - it reduces the LTV requirements from 80% to 95%, but you still need to have a high-enough income to qualify and be able to afford the repayments; only high-income low-wealth people will really ""benefit"" from this scheme.

TL;DR:  You're fooling yourself if you think we'll ever get to the stage where an average income buys an average house.  You're also fooling yourself if you think each new rise in house prices represents a new minimum; house prices are subject to macro (and micro) economic forces like everything else.

The cliche would be to say to aim low to get experience but really, just shift your aim to the side a bit.

Whilst large corporations with moronic HR may bin applications by people without full degrees, small businesses can be really good options. You'd be surprised at how many CEOs get a kick out of finding 'diamond in the roughs', plus they often can't afford much advertising so can have fewer people applying.

Put your name down at agencies, accept short term contracts that'll boost your experience. Try not to get yourself put forward envelope counting, seasonal royal mail cover and all the cliched temp roles unless you're really not getting anywhere. Focus on skill building.

There are weird hobby things you can do too. I'm a web developer and the number of interviews where they say something like ""ooh have you done a drupal module?""

true,StevenAlonso,lfc68,,"There's optimistic bids and then there's trying to unsettle a club. 

When Juventus bid 8m for RvP last year, I seriously doubt they were trying to unsettle Arsenal. They were most likely trying to get a feel for the market. They eventually got up to 20m before Arsenal decided to sell to United for 24m, basically handing them the title in the process. I think a similar ""feeling out"" may have been going on with Arsenal's initial bid for Suarez. I also genuinely  believe the latest bid of 40m+1 was an attempt to gain clarity on whatever this mysterious clause in Suarez's contract was. 

Of course I have nothing to support this but I just don't believe that football clubs would go to the extent of making multiple bids to unsettle a club, especially one that has been finishing consistently below them over the last few years.

Usually when the term ""unsettle"" gets thrown around, it's not about the clubs, but about the players. ""Tapping up"" happens all the time and if it goes too far, clubs can be punished for it. And tapping up at least makes sense as a strategy. Turn the player's head a little bit, hint at possible wages, maybe convince him to hand in a transfer request. This would have tangible benefits. 

Tabling silly bids would have little benefit other than mildly annoying the other club. Like in our situation. We're basically ""annoyed"" by Arsenal, but it's not stopping us from doing our business and I doubt it will have much effect on us once the window closes.",0,1375822182,null,0,false,0,cbiavtt,t3_1jtxdr,t1_cbiavtt,t1_cbiaexw,null,1429922585,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,TheAftermathPhil,null,null,"I hope your post gets a few responses, I'm recently new here and haven't seen this sub in full swing but I have supported the Hammers since I was 8 so I have experienced some of the ups and downs. Not really there for the golden years.

Honestly I like to think our current situation is quite good, moving into a bigger stadium in the next few years (much to the dismay of a few fans), financial situation is not too bad although the player wage bill bothers me a little and regards the management, it looks like everything is okey-dokey.

Players, I would need to break this down to people we already have and transfers. So the squad we already have is okay, not european competition level so if they qualified, they might struggle. The likes of Mark Noble, Kevin Nolan, Jussi Jaaskelainen, James Collins and Winston Reid are the back bone of our club, without them I feel we would be in a situation I think would be a danger to the club. Where as players like Jarvis, Tomkins, Morrison, Diarra, Diame, Maiga, Cole, Vaz Te and Collison are there to inject a bit of flavour to the football being played.

Transfers, honestly I think we have done some what alright considering the money Big Sam was allowed, a huge chunk of it was invested into Andy Carroll, who I think is great for this club and all but I personally thought Bony or Lukaku (on loan) would of been a better idea. Razvan Rat I think will be a new favourite for me, I have always had love for our defenders but he seems quite confident he can help the team to new heights which is good. Also Adrian and Whitehead were solid investments, hoping they can break through in the next season ahead. The players who have left, I had to agree with most of them, I loved Cole but he really is better suited with a slower pace and Rob Hall was one I disagreed with leaving, I felt he could of been given a few more minutes to impress.

Depending what happens in regards striking options, I feel like we will line up in the most used formation last season which was a 4-2-3-1. I would like to see other formations like 4-5-1, 4-3-3 and 4-4-2 used experimentally in cup fixtures. 

Players to watch out for this season: Ravel Morrison (Impressed well in pre-season), Modibo Maiga (providing he gets minutes), Alou Diarra (getting a second chance) and Razvan Rat (part of stronger defense).

West Ham fans are notoriously proud of their club, winning, losing, they will always be singing, I went to my first away game in Manchester for the FA Cup Replay earlier this year and I was stuck in the Stretford End with my brother and his co-worker (who are Man United fans) and I could hear the Claret and Blue army singing ""Bubbles"" from what seemed like miles away.

Sorry this seems like it's a wall of text (I was never good with formatting) but a TL;DR is basically Everything's good in the hood, Our players are average/good, transfers were alright, lining up in a 4-2-3-1 and we should finish the top side of mid table (8th-10th).

true,lommym,num11,,"If many players were capable of making that killer pass, then why were we so often left frustrated by teams parking the bus? Why were we left passing around the outside of the box? We most certainly can play the counter, and we obviously have players that *can* play through-balls... but when the game is slowed to a crawl, and we're stuck trying to break someone down, we were hard pressed to get anything.  

'good, but not the greatest' at passing is equal to underrating Dembélé? Dembélé's combination of strength, finesse in touch, and above-average passing (among other things) is what makes him such a great center midfielder.  Also, statistics never tell the whole story.  Dembélé's passing, as Cox correctly pointed out, is mostly side-to-side.  People often critiqued Livermore's high passing rating since he often passed backward or side-to-side.  Also, key passes are just passes that lead to a shot, not even a necessarily good shot.  

I don't expect an exact Modders replacement, and you saying that admits that we do not have that same passing ability in the team... Huddlestone is definitely not that same level (and honestly, a different kind of passer all together).  

I think you are reading my comments as derogatory or negative to our midfielders when they are not meant that way.  We have several above-average midfielders and that alone makes them a stronger midfield than most PL teams... but I would still love to have someone with Modders' eye for the incisive pass in our midfield again.  I think Dembélé, Paulinho, Sandro is an excellent midfield 3, but is a bit too defensive for my taste, and they could run into trouble when teams start to shut up shop.

Even Modric would have difficulty when there are 11 shirts in the box, only one of them is ours, and he isn't moving.

&gt;Dembélé's passing, as Cox correctly pointed out, is mostly side-to-side.

That is also due to Dembele's role last season of linking the defense to the attack.  He had to play farther back for much of the season to cover Parker, as I already mentioned.  If he is played forward in a more attacking role you will see his ""vertical"" passing numbers go up.

&gt;Also, key passes are just passes that lead to a shot, not even a necessarily good shot. 

Passes that lead to shots are valuable.  If they aren't good shots, that is on the shooter for either taking a bad shot or making the wrong decision.

&gt;I don't expect an exact Modders replacement, and you saying that admits that we do not have that same passing ability in the team... Huddlestone is definitely not that same level (and honestly, a different kind of passer all together). 

I never said we had a passer of Modric's caliber; you however said Carroll is our closest approximation to him, indicating a desire for a direct replacement.  I simply used Huddlestone as an example that passing ability is not the only trait we need in midfielders.

&gt;I think you are reading my comments as derogatory or negative to our midfielders when they are not meant that way.

I think you are misreading my tone, because I am not agitated and I don't think you are deriding our players.  I just think our players are better at passing than you do.

&gt;but I would still love to have someone with Modders' eye for the incisive pass in our midfield again.

I would kill to have Modric himself back.

Honestly tell me anyone but a black (or possibly Arabic due to the nature of the ""moor"" descriptive) could play Othello, you dolt.

If you cannot see the difference between this you are a complete moron.

And he HAS SHOWN FAR MORE variance in age then he has gender or sex.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;I really wasn't going to reply since you're clearly a moron, 

Amazing ad hominem argument.  Clearly, you are a genius debater and not the immature, easily confused, foaming-at-the-mouth, angsty teen some might think you to be.

&gt;but I read your post again and the link you provided is broken for me. But I googled the stats and read the report that you mention. While it does have bias this criticism of the report is nontheless valid. 

Yes, let's look at these criticisms.

&gt;Journalist John Stossel notes that the use of life expectancy figures is misleading and the life expectancy in the United States is held down by homicides, accidents, poor diet, and lack of exercise. 

Firstly, as I have said before, this isn't just about Britain and America.  Ignore America if you must.  Even though homicides only account for around 10,000 deaths per year, which is small compared to the overall death rate, and ""accidents, poor diet, and lack of exercise"" could easily be applied to the entire British population.  My point still stands.  So, we can drop that one.

&gt;The rankings assume literacy rate is indicative of healthcare, but ignore many factors, such as tobacco use, nutrition, and luck.

How exactly are you supposed to quantify luck?  Is there a luck quotient?  How accurately can luck be measured?  Are British people luckier than Americans?

With regards to tobacco and nutrition, Britain and many of the countries ahead of America don't seem to smoke significantly less than Americans do.  Australia and Italy seem to smoke more.  Britain is hardly known for healthy eating or low obesity.

And to reiterate, none of this explains the high efficiency of the nhs compared to the other wealthy countries.

&gt;The report includes fairness of access as a criteria which instantly puts private health insurance models in a poor position. But nevermind that's not a contention I care for.

And again, that only really impacts the USA.  Why are you so obsessed with only the USA?  Is this another one of your crazy obsessions?

&gt;That said, what the report does show is that the UK is ranked 18th for efficiency. Not bad out of 191 countries until you note that many of our peers, 

It's actually extremely good and a lot of our peers fall short by a significant margin.  

&gt;and Oman for some reason, fare much better than we do. 

Learn to read.  Oman spends **more than twice** what we do on healthcare!  Think, what does efficiency mean?  What have we been discussing?  Pay attention.

&gt;If an athelete comes 18th he doesn't hang his shoes up and say ""job well done"" he would try to improve. I'm not sure why you're trumpeting 18th as being a source of great pride.

Is English your third language?  Go and learn basic English comprehension.  We come 18th in ranking by per capita.  That's a good thing.  It means we're near the top in efficiency, like coming in 3rd, or thereabouts.

&gt;Secondly, cost efficiency is not the be all and end all of an overall efficient system. 

So, you finally admit you were wrong.  

Cost efficiency is what most people care about most and refer to when they say efficiency.  Importantly, it's what we here mean by efficiency and have been discussing.

&gt;Take a look at this review regarding cancer outcomes. It does not paint such a rosy picture compared to our peers. 

According to a recent [bbc article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21242871):

&gt;Researchers, who surveyed nearly 20,000 adults in six high-income countries, said they found embarrassment often stopped Britons visiting the doctor.

&gt;Respondents in the UK were as aware of cancer symptoms as those in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but more reluctant to seek help, they said.

What does this have to do with efficiency?

&gt;I presume you're ok to not compare the UK to sub-Saharan Africa?

Make sure to take your meds on time.

&gt;I don't suppose you bothered to read the report though. Maybe I should find a link to the guardian for you...

At least I can actually read **and** comprehend.

6-8 of those goals were superfluous; netted after victory was already assured. 2-3-4 goal leads etc.

He's suspended for 5 league games, same as last year. However, Sturridge and Coutinho are available for twice as long as the previous season so there should be more balance in general.

Point being; only looking to 'replace' about 10 goals which is not at all unreasonable considering the new squad, players returning to full fitness, and youth coming of age.

I doubt it is cost neutral, for several reasons. First, over the years I have seen a number of local, ad supported magazines try to use the same model, all have failed. Second, none of the people who advertise in the council magazine seem to advertise anywhere else, so I am guessing they aren't paying much. Not only that, the bottom has fallen out of print advertising due to the recession and the internet.

The only people who seem able to do this are the local free paper, and they are struggling. They use far cheaper printing technology (the council one is quite glossy), and deliver maybe a hundred pages of ads of houses and cars for sale, fast food shops, recruitment, local trades, as well as full page ads for major stores and supermarkets. Very different from the dozen pages of little home businesses in the council mag.

I get the ""why not?"" theory in why not do it but it's just a really lazy way of writing and despite all it's differences, you can track an over-all character growth in New Who. If a different casting would de-rail that approach in some form(I feel as if it happened now, a bit would get thrown out the window compared to the actual choice who I can see being a natural extension and a reaction to 11) but in a regeneration or two, they have a way for his character to grow naturally and a explanation for it, as long as it tells a good story, then it's great.

I can't believe after Suarez's history of engineering transfers away from clubs that some of you are backing him. It's not in the contract. If it was, he'd be gone by now. It's not black and white. If he takes it to a tribunal, he'll lose. 

Don't panic. I definitely think he's off, but it won't be to Arsenal. I think we've made that perfectly clear. In a way, I'm relieved it's all come to a head. There's not really any way back from this. He's burned that bridge. I think the best option is to wait until January to sell him. He can't play until the end of September anyway.

If anything this shows he's starting to sweat. We are entirely in the driving seat here. It's not like last summer where we had zero strikers and creators. Look at us now. Coutinho, Sterling, Aspas, Ibe, Sturridge, Alberto, Borini. We'll be OK. A front four of Sturridge, Aspas, Coutinho and Sterling isn't too shabby. And if we add Costa to that it'll be even better. 

Yes, he's one of the best in the world. Yes, we're weaker without him. Yes, he's a horrible cunt. Yes, we'll find someone else. Yes, the club deserves better. Yes, we'll challenge without him. Yes, we'll bounce back...

And no, he's not going to fucking Arsenal. 

(Btw the level of venom they spit toward ""filthy, delusional, dirty scousers"" over at r/gunners is way beyond anything I've ever read. I've stirred shit with the best of them, but some of the stuff they say towards us is revolting. It skirts the boundaries of hate speech.

As others have said. For the hazard perception click twice with a second in between when you spot the hazard. Although my instructor told me to click once when you spot it, once if you're closer and it hasn't gone away and again if it develops into a reason to slow down/stop.

For the practical:

I stalled 3 times in the first 5 minutes and assumed I'd failed. Fortunately I didn't disrupt the flow of traffic and I didn't panic so he let me off (as it was early on he put it down to nerves). But that did let me drive more freely.

My mum gave me this advice: Adjust the mirrors so you have to physically move your head to see them. Then they can see you're checking them. Also always remember the over-the-shoulder check when pulling off/reversing etc.

Finally, don't drive too slowly. My friend failed for distorting the flow of traffic going 20 in a 30 zone. If it's safe to do 30, do 30. If you want to be cautious do a tad under, but don't go too under because it can be a cause for failure.

We owe him nothing, he owes us a hell of a lot for the way he's treated the club after the way we've stood by him throughout everything from racism to assaulting Ivanovic in the most vile way. We never threw in the towel, the fans have stood by him no matter what, probably not because he's a nice person, but because he's a fantastic footballer.

&gt; Suarez’s time at Groningen, however, was always likely to be short-lived. A player scoring goals for a provincial Dutch time will always invite interest from the traditional powerhouses and sure enough, in the summer of 2007, Ajax, their coffers boosted by the sale of Ryan Babel to Liverpool, came knocking.

&gt; A bid of 3.5m was turned down flat, but with Suarez eager to move to Amsterdam, an impasse was reached. The player went to the KNVB, the Dutch Football Association, to try to force through a deal, at one point threatening to go on strike.

&gt;An arbitration committee ruled against him, but Ajax were determined to get their man. Eventually, a deal worth 7.5m was agreed, and Suarez was on his way once more.

Well, that was never going to end well.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"I was at the game too, by the sounds of it not too far from you actually! I made these comments elsewhere, but they're relevant to this:

-We started 4-2-3-1, but it was Howson and Johnson the DM's, with Fer the CAM. The only logic I can see behind this is that it makes Fer the target man, in a similar way to Fellaini operates for Everton. He was the target for an awful lot of goal kicks, even if Bunn played it out from the back a little more than I expected. It really seemed an odd way of playing to me, it didn't feel like Fer's natural game to be that advanced, and neither is it Howson's to be a DM. Fer adapted somewhat, but Howson is still absolutely wasted as a DM. It felt to me like Hughton still wants the long-ball option, and because Ricky isn't a target man, he's compromised the central midfield to wangle one in. I don't think we're good enough in the middle of the park to consistently play out from the back (and clearly Hughton agrees), so it feels like he's compromised an attacking position to compensate for deficiencies in the DM positions. I felt it stifled a lot of creativity in the middle, and we were very poor in possession, although that's probably exacerbated by how comfortable Sociedad are on the ball.

-As I said above, why on earth are we still playing Howson as a DM????? It's not his game at all, and he's not comfortable enough in possession to be the midfield 'recycler', and he put us in trouble several times. If Hughton wants Fer as a target, either tell him to go further forward for goal kicks and drop back (Howson then as CAM), or play Tettey alongside Johnson instead.

As to individual performances, Turner had a night to forget, he was very poor in possession, and nearly sold Bunn short a la Sunderland away. After 20 minutes I wanted Ryan Bennett on instead, and I thought he played reasonably when he came on, assuming Bassong isn't fit, my starting defence would be Whittaker-Martin-Bennett-Olsson, as Olsson seemed to offer more than Garrido when the spaniard came on late. Olsson is much less afraid to push on, Garrido got into promising areas but then rather than pushing on to the by-line, stopped and cut back. Johnson was off the pace a bit, but that's to be expected in what I think was his first pre-season appearance. 

Positives: 

-Redmond looks an absolute steal. Really exciting player to watch, and he's almost got that Hucks-like ability to make you expect something when he picks the ball up in promising areas. Having said that, he's still a work in progress, particularly when it comes to decision-making. Several times he ran down blind alleys when he should have off-loaded, and sometimes he didn't make enough of the space available. Positionally he was good though, and he made several good runs, even if our midfield rarely tried to pick him out. Watching him, he seemed like a player who prefers to hug the touchline rather than come inside when going forwards, and I wonder if that left the lone front-man a bit more isolated than when Pilks plays. If we went 4-4-2 I'd prefer Redmond, but an on-form Pilks seems a better option in a 4-2-3-1 to me at the moment. Definitely an exciting signing though, MOTM by a mile for me.

-Snodgrass seems to have carried on where he left off last season. I felt he was already up to speed: first touch excellent, his free-kicks were good, dangerous in possession, and as passionate as ever. Seemed most likely to make something happen. Martin seemed good at CB, and Whittaker dangerous going forwards at RB, even if he did create a couple of problems at the back. Didn't have a lot of time to judge Hooper, but he looked comfortable on the ball at least.

-Ricky's goal was nothing to write home about (tap-in after a Fer(?) header from a corner), but his positioning was very good, and his technique is very impressive. Felt very sorry for him though that we were so poor on the ball in the middle of the park, and created little. Nearly got onto the end of a Redmond flick which would have almost definitely gone in, and also a low cross from Redmond late on was just flicked past him by Hoolahan late on. Did fluff a 1v1 gifted to him by a Real defender, although it was on the left hand side of the box with the keeper closing very quickly.

Where do we go from here? The quickest fix for me would be Toivonen (or similar). I don't think CAM is Fer's natural role, and Toivonen would offer that longer out-ball which Hughton feels we need (and based on the way we moved the ball from defence, we probably do need it), plus creativity and a greater goal threat than Hoolahan or Fer. The harder way of going about things would be to give Howson the CAM role, accept we don't have a target man, and actually learn to play out from the back. That's most likely too big a project to start this late in pre-season, although a signing like Alderweireld would undoubtedly help. I'd really like to see both Toivonen (or someone Fellaini-esque) and Alderweireld (or another ball-playing CB) sign, and against the right opposition play a single DM (probably Johnson/Fer), and give Howson the chance to play how he wants, with Toivonen and RvW in there too.",0,1375829965,null,0,false,0,cbidt31,t3_1juci2,t1_cbidt31,t3_1juci2,null,1429921150,7,false,NorwichCity,t5_2sv0y,7

My family only buys fruit and veg in the supermarket when we are pressed for time and if the supermarket offers a better deal, which is rare.

Fish: there's plenty of responsibly farmed fish on sale, but you would need to do some research into places that stock it. It'll cost a little bit more though, so bear that in mind.

Donna, meanwhile, was awesome, and I agree about her fate. Ten has a few lines in ""School Reunion"" about how he doesn't age, and traveling with him can't be anything but tragic, but damn, Donna's story hammers that home so much harder than the juvenile crush and possessiveness of Rose.

We can take a lot from the way we played though. First half was pretty even and we had some nice periods of possession. Last season was all very panicky on the ball, but now we have defenders who can pass their way out of trouble, rather than just poke it in the general direction of the keeper. We do need to do more in the final third. The full backs were getting up with the ball but no-one ever made a run beyond them and there was acres of space. Jack Midson coming on was the spark (yet again) and I still worry we don't look like scoring without him.

Worner was at fault for the first goal. Diving to try and stop the ball going for a corner, he ran out of penalty box and couldn't hold it, leaving the net empty for the chasing forward to slide it in. A shame because he was otherwise a pretty safe pair of hands, making a few smart saves.

We didn't really start pushing forward until we were 2-0 down and nicked one back when the Millwall defence seemed to switch off. After that they started defending a bit deeper and we created more chances in the last 5 minutes or so than the rest of the match.

I for one hope that they don't have a female Doctor. It wouldn't be progressive, it would ultimately become a joke. I want them to bring in a female character who isn't badly written and doesn't fall down into the tropes of having a women character. That's progressive. Writing the character of an established male to be a female; when the character has shown absolutely no inclination that he would feel better as a female e.g  Unlike what we got told that the Corsair actually did have those inclinations. would be detrimental to the character of the Doctor.

I would like to add that ultimately I would not really have a problem with a female Doctor and if thats what happened would happily welcome it.

**What to know about West Ham.**


West Ham formed in East London in 1895 under the name of “Thames Ironworks FC” we originally played in Navy Blue, but got our current kit after winning a wager with then league champions Aston Villa (Hence why our kits are similar)

We have been nicknamed “The Academy of Football” due to the high number of players that have advanced through our youth system and gone onto bigger teams. 

Some Big name Ex-Hammers include; Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole (since returned) Michael Carrick and more recent ones including, Javier Mascherano, Carlos Tevez and Demba Ba.

Our Main Rivalry is with Championship side “Millwall” in the east London derby, although recently due to players leaving, we have a rather one sided rivalry with Tottenham Hotspur. As well as small rivalries with the other London teams, Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham and Crystal Palace

**Team legends:** 

* Bobby Moore: probably the most iconic Hammer ever to play for the club. Captained England during the 1966 world cup win, and the permanent holder of the now retired number 6 shirt.

* Trevor Brooking: Club Legend that played in midfield during the 60's, 70's and 80's, scored 88 goals in 528 apps for the club, also played for England. Has a stand named after him.

* Paolo Di Canio: Played from 1999 to 2003 and is somewhat of a fan favourite due to his unpredictability and character. Has since gone on to manager Sunderland AFC 

**Team Today:**

After an appalling season under arguably West Ham's Worst manager, Avram Grant, We were demoted to championship, where Sam Allardyce took over and reshaped the team, buying in now Captain, Kevin Nolan. Nolan Took the team to 3rd in the 2011-2012 season, winning the play-offs against Blackpool, thanks to a last minute Ricardo Vaz Te goal. In order to strengthen for the Premier League, Allardyce bought in a further 11 players, including, Mohammed Diame, Jussi Jääskeläinen, former Club Record signing Matt Jarvis, and Striker Andy Carroll on a loan deal. West Ham performed better than expected, Finishing 10th, beating both other promoted teams (Southampton and Reading)  

In the coming season, Allardyce has secured a 6 year deal for Carroll, again breaking the club transfer record, as well as signing Former Shakhtar Donetsk full-back Razvan Rat on a free.

Fans and players alike are optimistic about this season, aiming for a European place, which could be possible if Andy Carroll finds form. This will help us expand as a team, especially as we look to move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.

********
**Players to watch out for;**

* Andy Carroll; Spearhead of the West Ham attack. Plagued by injuries last season, hopes to make a bigger impact in his first season as an official West Ham Player

* Mohammed Diame; Big Strong powerhouse in central midfield capable of running at players and making key moves that often lead to chances.

* Winston Reid; Voted Hammer of the year last year, Reid has found himself bossing the west ham defence. A strong player in the air and his smart movement make him a challenge for almost any striker.  

Most Fans are feeling optimistic and are not fearing a relegation battle this season. Realistically we would like to finish higher than Tenth and go on at least one good cup run.",0,1375833950,null,0,false,0,cbif6hd,t3_1jtner,t1_cbif6hd,t3_1jtner,null,1429920510,6,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,6

Pick her I couldn't care less and I can't wait to see what she does for the role.

The thing that really riles me though is all this hate going to Peter because they cast a white male in the role. The fact of the matter is; this is the first time I have ever been excited for a new Doctor. I'm not trying to find the things wrong with him, and i'll be upset to see Matt go, but i'm not worried about his replacement. Because he is the right actor for the right role. His brilliant and we are lucky to have him!

The fact of the matter is, the doctor can be anyone in the world. The greater fact is acting is the one profession which is allowed to discriminate on a part in order to suit the role they are looking for. So whilst the BBC is within their rights to cast whoever they want, Peter's age and acting tenure just makes sense for the next part of the doctors life.

Hahaha I know this went completely out of the way of your comment, and I agree with it completely, I guess I just needed to vent all the hate his been getting on my facebook feed. If I said this to my friends I would be mistakenly be called a sexist. I just Absolutely cannot stand people to not realise this is a fantastic choice.

true,cramen,troughton,Troughton,"Season 6 of the new series was terrible. The pacing of those opening two episodes was ghastly. Every one of the main plot episodes was rushed and over the top, and every one was written by Moffat. A good man goes to war? Let's kill hitler? Genuinely awful. This culminates in the hands down worst finale of the new show, The Wedding of River Song. Given how dire RTD's season ending episodes were, that the Wedding of River Song easily beats them out is a stunning achievement.

Almost every time Moffat goes for big spectacle, the execution falls short. I do think it's mostly a pacing problem, I mean - take Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, after the cramped exposition of the first part, the second part opens with a time jump and even more cramped exposition. Why was the Doctor in that box again? Cos as soon as it was done he was out. It's poor writing.

I often wonder if the writers, being fans of old Who, are writing stories to fit the 4x20 min format rather than the 1x40 min format the show is made in now. But that's a broader point.

Also he's managed to run great concepts of his own creation into the ground. River Song was amazing in Silence in the Library, and she's become less interesting and more of a caricature in every episode since. The Angels? Blink is one of the best Who stories ever made. Time of the Angels/Flesh and Stone? Pointless.

This last season was okay, and of course the final episode was the best the new show has ever done, so maybe he's working out the scope of what he's able to do inside the format.",0,1375834773,null,0,false,0,cbifghs,t3_1jqja3,t1_cbifghs,t3_1jqja3,null,1429920380,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

  I understand his grievences, but the whole Arsenal angle is absurd. Why move to a rival team? If he wants to play in the Champion's league, why go to Arsenal, a team who have almost no chance of winning it?

 If he doesn't want to play for Liverpool then I don't want to force him to. He's a top player who wants to play at the highest level. I get that. Forget about loyalty to the club or the fans... what bothers me is the complete lack of respect he's shown to his team-mates. He's making it quite clear that he feels he's too good for them, and that is a huge insult to a group who have helped him achieve such good form at the club and have had to deal with the fallout from his infantile indiscretions.

true,OpticalData,tennant,Tennant,"I loved Davies.

Not because his finales or plots were fantastic, but because he could write characters I cared about. We saw Rose develop from an innocent shop girl to an inter-dimensional time jumping... Lunatic, willing to do anything for the one she loved. But the key is, we saw her develop into this, we saw Martha develop from a shy medical student into a confident military leader (for better or for worse) and we saw Donna evolve from an outspoken temp to a woman who loved and appreciated the universe.

On the flip side with Moffat we got Amy, the outspoken, one track minded companion, who leaves as an outspoken, one track minded companion. The only difference being her affections had changed from The Doctor to Rory. I mean for god sake, we're supposed to believe that she chased a man for 20 years, decided she didn't love him, got engaged to somebody else, who got erased from time, then brought back, then killed again.etc .etc. Then had a child with him, who for all intents and purposes, she lost. Then discovered she couldn't have children, almost had a divorce.etc.etc

I am not a woman, but any woman with life experience that I have spoken to about Amy states that she is one of the most unrealistic characters Doctor Who has ever had. One of the above things would break a normal person.

Then there's Clara, who I'm actually beginning to like because, despite the 'Impossible girl' crap she's actually developing a relationship with The Doctor and I look forward to seeing how it evolves after the regeneration. 

But onto story arcs, Davies were subtle, they were in the background and we knew they were there which caused endless debate in my friendship circles about what was the story arc this season, it was a much more fun show to watch than Moffat's:

'HEY GUYS, LOOK HERE THERE'S A CRACK, HEY LOOK, SILENCE, THE DOCTORS GOING TO DIE, HEY LOOK. IMPOSSIBLE GIRL RIGHT?'.

true,OpticalData,tennant,Tennant,"I think you're forgetting with Rose, a little episode called Boom Town.

She saw the power of the time vortex, she knew that the heart of the TARDIS could change a grown woman into an egg without a second thought. 

SHe knew this, but she knew what she had to do to save those she cared about. It wasn't as you assume some sort of 'Time vortex rape' where it was without her consent or knowing. She knew as much about the consequences of opening the TARDIS as Clara knew about jumping into the time stream. 

You're assuming that Martha wanted worldwide praise for her actions? You completely misunderstood her character. Martha went and saw the wonderful things with THe Doctor, a man she fell in love with, but at the end of the day he didn't love her and that's what mattered to her. So she went home, to live a normal life as she wanted (with a little career boost from The Doctor). 

Donna was a tragic story, there is no getting around it. The tragedy of the story is that she looses who she is to stay alive. She may not have wanted it but whether through death or a memory block the end result would have been the same. That Donna Noble would be gone. The Doctor did what he had to do and he felt tremendous guilt at the fact that he had led his best friend to this path. To the point that he completely went off the rails in the next year culminating in the 'Timelord Victorious' in The Waters Of Mars. 

Plus, Clara and the time stream is no better. By your logic The Doctor and his accomplices just flat out let Clara commit suicide to save him. 

The Leaf is completely bullshit, I get the vibe Moffat is going for with the infinite variables thing, but the whole idea of infinite diversity in infinite combinations is that it IS infinite, you can't just take one thing and say 'THIS IS WHY' because it's every single decision leading to every decision after. 

Moffat's treatment of Women is far worse, over his run we've seen superhero Amy who can see those she loves get murdered repeatedly, go through two universe reboots and lose a child without any ill effects, River Song who has been reduced to a series of catchphrases and Clara who is discovered and then stalked by The Doctor to get her to go along with him.

Notice that the UK and Argentina's Antarctic land claims almost exactly overlap.

This is why Kerchner is also making a fuss about the UK ""nuclearising"" the South Atlantic, because we are protecting our claims with our nuclear submarines, since we have no functioning aircraft carriers anymore. This is why giving up Trident would be totally insane.

The minerals below the Antarctic are particularly useful because there are a lot of rare earth minerals which will be useful in advanced high tech manufacturing in the future. Currently only China, Japan and the US have access to these minerals (Japan being so desperate they are actually dredging them off the sea bed), and are inflating the price to prevent other countries manufacturing high tech stuff.

Suarez was first in the league in being dispossessed and had the 2nd most turnovers per game in the league.  He was also 2nd in all of Europe in shots, yet only scored 30.  How many goals do you think Van Persie would have had if he had taken the 2nd most shots in all of Europe?  I'd guess more than 30.  Suarez non-penalty conversion rate in 11-12 was an absolutely diabolical 8.6% and, while better in 2012-2013, is still not very good at 12.3%.  He took almost more shots per game in 12-13 than Carzola and Giroud combined.  

But he scored 30 you say?  Find me a half decent striker that can take 200+ shots and not manage to score 30.  Frankly, if I were you lot I'd take the £40,000,001 and try to get Lewandowski from BVB- a much, much better striker.  

Also, Suarez's pass completion rate is a pretty poor 76.6% (Mata and Hazard were both over 85% as an example) and he was 3rd in the league offsides per game.  In summary, he's good, but you lot could do far better with a striker who actually fits your system and that isn't Suarez but as far as I'm concerned you're welcome to him.  Let me know how it feels watching him sit on the bench while you're losing to Spurs and when he gets his next ban for something idiotic (which will be even longer than 10 games).",0,1375838577,null,0,false,0,cbigru5,t3_1juaim,t1_cbigru5,t1_cbidg3p,null,1429919767,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Intrinsically1,lfc50,,"I don't think he will be at Liverpool.  His position is now irreconcilable. 

IMO Liverpool should just publicly say he is for sale to any team outside of England and accept the highest bidder and immediately start signing replacements as if we have 30m from the sale.  It's time to cut our losses.  It will be a blow but he is not bigger than this club and letting this drag out will hurt our reputation making other transfer dealings harder to deal with.

The Anfield Wrap pod (or maybe Beyond the Pitch - can't remember which) made the point that even if we keep him there is every chance there will be another major behaviour incident involving him which being his 3rd strike in as many years could result in a monumental ban destroying his value completely.  

Sure he was arguably the best player in the country last season, but he is a deeply flawed character and one who does not want to play for us.  Fuck him.  

Would you hold your shared lease over your girlfriend's head if she cheated on you and wanted to break up, or would you figure out a way to get out of the lease, cut your losses and move on with your life?

As much as I want to stick it to him somehow it will not do the club any good whatsoever to have him depreciating in value and sulking in the reserves until the January window.  The 180s on quotes from both parties (especially Brendan recently) are going to look bad.  Whatever.  Bite the bullet, sell to whoever we can outside of England.

I'm a bit more questioning of your assertion that it's easy to eat healthily cheaply, as most of the cheapest foods per calorie are the unhealthiest ones - i.e. highly processed, low fibre, carbohydrate heavy options.  Fresh fruit is pretty much the most expensive basic food to buy per calorie, and really we should be eating multiple portions of it very single day (fresh vegetables are obviously also good, but not at the same level in terms of nutritional value). Refined carbs are fairly cheap, but very unhealthy - white rice, bread, pasta, etc.  The wholemeal stuff is more expensive.

There is a charm to the show that I appreciate, and there has already been one or two memorable one-liners. My biggest gripe so far is with some seriously weak dialogue and the use of the deus-ex-machina. Since the last two episodes are freshest in my mind:

""Oh, that's right, NOW I know why I remember your name--you are the future prime minister of England and architect of her golden age""

Add to that the fact that Rose's mother was just about to get killed but because the Doctor electrocuted one Slitheen, it inexplicably electrocuted all of them and saved her at the last second.

true,wafflesforlife,lfc68,,"I have a number of Liverpool-related ruminations that I considered making a new thread for, but it probably makes sense just to throw them in here:

-The news today is like that moment in a relationship where you've been glossing over red flags, but then your SO comes out with ""I think we should take a break."" It's over. There aren't (in my world at least) legally binding contracts in interpersonal relationships. That's what comes to mind, though.

-I am hoping that [Ewing Theory](http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1193711) applies/applied to Suarez. In matches where we were frustrated by a team ""parking the bus"" or if we were just off that day, Suarez would try to force things and would miss a clear cut back in favor of taking a shot from an impossible angle. That sort of thing. Obviously when he leaves, it's a massive hit in terms of losing a world class player. However, I am trying to see it as an opportunity for the team to learn to play better, more efficient football. 

-I am nervous about rebuilding. From the Mhktaryan saga, it's clear we can't necessarily attract CL caliber footballers anymore. I really do think we need to do what ever it takes to bring in Diego Costa, now. From the footage of him that I've seen, he's an unselfish player who will make that one touch lay off to set up a chance for a teammate, but he's also got goals and guile in him.

-There has been plenty of ""banter"" between our and arsenal's subreddit, which, for the most part, has been utterly stupid (both ways). If Suarez does go to arsenal, are they on the shit list? I'm not saying that there aren't reasonable arsenal fans out there, but on the hive mind/group think level. Arsenal fans that are likely perusing this, is ManU on your shit list after taking RVP?

&gt;In his book about the early days of the Doctor Who fan club, Miller describes Capaldi thusly: ""dear old Peter Capaldi, star of The Thick of It, Local Hero, Torchwood and, of course, Doctor Who – and all-time pain in the butt. He haunted my time running the fan club. He was quite indignant he wasn’t considered for the post and [Bary Letts' secretary] Sarah [Newman] couldn’t stand him.""

&gt;Even though the fan club already had Miller running it — and the production office hoped that Miller would run interference between the pushy fans and the production team — Capaldi kept pushing to be allowed to take over from Miller.

&gt;Capaldi wouldn't give up his ambition of running the Doctor Who club, and in a letter, Newman tells Miller that she wishes the Daleks would exterminate Capaldi:

&gt;""... No, no, no you are not by any means worse than Peter C. I had a very sad letter back from him today I think I had better write and apologise! I think he's the end and I wish the daleks or someone would exterminate him or something to that effect. ...""

true,greg19735,null,null,"So I think people look at West Ham and kind of see the team as a weird mix. No one's really sure what we're doing. Overall, I believe our team's overarching goal is to remain an established team in the premier league when we move into the Olympic Stadium. That means we're building towards being safe, if boring for the meantime. 

**Olympic Stadium**

While a controversial topic, i think that the move to the OS will be able to move the team forward. Upton Park is too small and having a 55,000 seater stadium for such a fantastic price is something that the owners couldn't really not pursuit. I believe we're paying 3 mil a year for 100 years. Assuming the lease goes that long, that's still only 300 million paid in the kindest loan ever conceived. 

It'll definitely be a shame to get rid of the Bolelyn Ground though. I haven't been to see a game there in almost 7 years and I'm planning to get over there within the next 2 seasons before we move out. Even if the trip is exclusively for that purpose. Once we do move though, we'll be in a fantastic position to be able to push the club forward. Also, I think we'll be able to bring in some new investors to help out the Davids OR just buy it outright. Right now i



**Tactics**

Yes, we do play a bit of long ball. There's no doubt about that. But our strategy is not based on long ball, but based on being efficient. Big Sam's teams are always big, strong and efficient and honestly it's a nice change. It's so different to see City, Chelsea and United come into Upton Park and be physically intimidated. We got 5 points out of those games and had a goal disallowed vs City and RVP was offside for his equalizer too. That's a huge difference from the days under Zola and Grant where we'd pass the ball around and just fuck up and lose. 

We'll probably play a 4-2-3-1 with Nolan behind Carroll and Noble with Diame in the middle. I'm not sure who will play right wing though. 


**Key Players**

Andy Carroll - he has to be in here. He's our main striker and I think he'll do well with us this year. I'd really like us to get a proper right winger though.

Diame - He's our best driving force in the midfield. He also tries to do too much and has ended up getting us into trouble more than once last season. 

Winston Reid - Our Kiwi defender and Hammer of the Year I believe. If he's with us for the next 4 years i'd be very happy.

Ravel Morrison - Scored twice against Sporting the other day so it's possible he'll be integrated into the first team a bit this season. Hopefully he stops acting like a proper twat though.

**New Players**

Ravzan Rat - We needed a left back and on the first day we could got ourselves a pretty good and experienced one. I'm very happy with this signing.

Adrián San Miguel del Castillo - goalkeeper we got on a free. Should be good back up for Jussi who's getting on a bit. 


**Needs**

We need another striker and some pace. 

**future**

This is all linked with the Olympic Stadium. We're trying to consolidate more than anything. We haven't made too many exciting or risky buys but that's okay. The extra money for just being in the PL and such should have us in good standing in a few years. Hopefully we'll pick up some more exciting players then.

Ten is the most popular doctor of all time for good reason, he has something for everyone and does a great job of getting the whole excitement of the show to you the viewer. Enjoy watching!

There is no doubt that he is a good player but not one that can play in big clubs like Chelsea (hmm, sounds like some other forward we have right now). In Chelsea, you just have to accept that you are not the only capable player in the team and when you are not getting into position and tries to take the ball away from the likes of Lampard or Mata, they are just not going to pass you the ball.

1. Nobody in the City That Never Sleeps noticed the statue of liberty get up and walk around.
2. How the hell did angels take over the Statue of Liberty? Not to mention all the other statues in the city.
3. Why are Amy and Rory stuck in 1930? If the angel sent them back to 1930 wouldn't they just be able to wait five years or so until the weird ass time storm thing dissipated at which point the doctor could just go back and get them? If not, that means they had to be sent back earlier so they could be old by the time young Amy, Rory and the Doctor get there. Wouldn't that mean at some point they're outside the ""storm zone"" and once again the doctor could go get them?
4. All of the above points aside River seemed to get into that time no problem with the wristband, (sorry I forgot the name) why isn't that an option?
5. How are the angels getting stuffed from sending someone back and then keeping them in the same building forever? The angels feed off of sending someone back to the past, so do they do it multiple times? Then why aren't there multiple Rory's and Amy's running around? 
6. If Amy and Rory are stuck in a building how did Amy manage to become a publisher? 

and finally....

Seriously... a survivor waited in a cemetery just waiting for the doctor and co to show up? How the hell did it know or are we just supposed to put that down to chance?

Yes, he looks as good, if not better than Caulker

He and Vert would switch off (they both prefer LCB). Plus there's no way we could put him and Vert on at the same time and still play ""defense"". At least one CB has to be Lloris' buddy.

&gt; Do you think he will end up a Tottenham player by 1 September?

No idea. I hope so, he looks like he could cover LB pretty well as well.

&gt; Do you think he can fill the void left by Steven Caulker?

Absolutely. Mind you, they're different types of players, but he's much faster than Caulker, and better with his feet. High lines need that style of player; someone who can release the ball quickly (though his video highlights seem to suggest he holds on too long sometimes) and can track back well when the opponent gets behind us.

Yet he'd rather sell us out and sign for one of our rivals. I've defended this guy to the hilt even looked stupid at time whilst defending him. Well at least I can stop doing that now. The man (if I can call him that) has truly shown his true colours and it seems it was blind faith I had in him prior to this outburst. I/we were defending the indefensible.

This is a man who is not only willing to sell the club and its fans out, but his so called friends at the club the Lucas' the Coates.' I could understand him leaving to play for Madrid, but for a direct rival for where we want to be. He'd rather help them than us - that's treachery right there. He's basically spitting in our faces. The disrespect he has shown is an utter disgrace. Not only has he shown his disloyalty and disrespect, he has also shown his greed. Why sign the big extension to his contract given he had a 'gentle mans' agreement in place. Obviously because we bumped his wages up massively. Disgusting. I hope John H and Brendan stand firm like they have done and refuse to sell him to Arsenal. It will be difficult but we can cope without this snake.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Oh, please, preferring a fictional character *the way it was created or the popular interpretation* is nothing like oppressing someone. For the record, I would definitely be okay with a female Doctor, if the story around was well written and the actor/actress was good(that's my criteria with every modern doctor), so I would thank you for not assuming otherwise or comparing me to old racists, sexists just because I favor some characters in traditional that have resonated with me and/or other people. I would not like James Bond american, that doesn't mean I hate Americans.  I stuck up for the poor guy or gal you were so anxious to call sexist as he very well might not be. I think, perhaps, you are the one *who lacks imagination* if you can't understand the difference or maybe *stuck in your ways* and don't want to see it.

And now you're just writing off comics as a valid example when you don't seem to know much about them. It's not different at all and they *don't* maintain consistency in the way you are speaking of. Green Lantern is now gay in Earth-2. Peter Parker is no longer Spider-Man. It's either Miles Morales or Dock Ock depending on which main line you prefer. There's been literally *millions* of retcons in DC Comics alone so how exactly is it different? Please point me out to this ""consistency"" you speak of in comics because I see quite the opposite. Some of these stories and changes are truly great and beneficial to comics while some set them back *and the success or lack of has nothing to do with whether or not people are homophobic and racist or not*.  Some people love Dock Ock as Spider-Man because it tells an truly interesting story and some don't because it doesn't resonate with them the same way Peter Parker did. Same goes for Miles Morales who's a bit more relevant to the discussion, but I used Ock to make my point separated from the race/gender issue. 

Yeah, it's great you don't care what color the Martian Manhunter is but for me it's odd seeing him white in Injustice and I don't like it. Now, seeing as *I am white* I would like to know why this would make me racist? Because I like the character I grew up with, the way I grew up with him? I certainly don't have any animosity towards my own race or love one race more than other. And you know what? *I am for changes of these characters when done right*.  The previously mentioned Earth-2 line is fantastic. I loved Morrison exploring Super Man as a black president(even if the president bit felt a bit gimmicky, it told a great story, and he understands Super Man and the race had nothing to do with hindering or enhancing my enjoyment) and look forward to Multiversity, his book filled with different interpretations of said characters that has the strong possibility to play with race and/or gender among many other things as it's centered around that. That said I am still traditionalist with Peter Parker as nothing resonates with me the way he does, just like an American James Bond wouldn't(despite me being American) or *any change* to Batman's character *not limited to gender and/or sex, personality changes are included as well as change to the dark tone of his stories, it is just that his current form resonates with me in a way that no other will*.

Woking isn't so nice but it's an OK place to live. I would recommend living outside of the town though.

Some of the most expensive areas in the UK outside of London are in the Weybridge/Walton area, prime commuting territory into London.  Surrey is just wonderful, and with a bit of searching in the right places you'll find something good within budget.

You can go a bit further away and end up in Hampshire (still a quick commute into Woking) and find just as nice areas with a slighter lower premium.

I would avoid the Bracknell, Staines, Camberley, Aldershot areas and look more towards Guildford, Farnham, Godalming, Cobham (not Chobham) and the villages surrounding them - they are all charming, quintessentially English places to live. 

If you are stuck to a train, then you'll need to stay in one of the larger towns. If you are feeling particularly brave with commuting you could try Winchester (43min by train to Woking).

Use http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ to check times.

Good luck. I live a bit further up from Woking into the countryside and I'm very keen on it, but then again I spent a lot of time in the home counties as a kid and it's where I feel the most at home.
