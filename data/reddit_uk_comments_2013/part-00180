true,pikeybastard,null,null,"It's the second time that I've felt the need to argue this point on reddit in a week, but saying it was a world recession, and capitalising 'world', does not absolve the UK of its huge culpability. London was the largest financial centre in the world, riding a boom facilitated and indeed caused by poorly considered and imbalanced financial regulation brought in by Brown, with the government handing the regulatory keys of the car to the FSA whilst omitting to grant it fundamental powers of oversight.

The causes of the global economic crisis were many, and identifying one prime mover is almost impossible as the causes of a crash are not the same thing as the moment of the crash. It is often attributed though to a poisonous cocktail of loose US and UK monetary policy, US and UK liquidity rises and increase in the money supply running unfettered whilst being largely generated by large current account deficits, Clinton's repeal of Glass Steagall and the encouragement of US and UK banks to lend and/or to grant mortgages to those that could not afford them, based upon the notion that rising housing equity would do the repaying for people. Secondary antagonists that came into play were the EU debt crises, the credit crunch and seizure of inter-bank lending, US deficits and threats of hitting the debt ceiling fueled by Bush's tax cuts for the rich, etc.

The Adam Smith Institute puts the blame for the UK's particularly harsh whooping at the hand of the crisis down to the 'tripartite' regime created by the treasury during this period. It is important to note too that a combination of high government spending during the upswing of a cycle, followed by the failure of running a higher deficit to fund 'consumption' tax cuts like 15% VAT to increase disposable income and generate spending and liquidity, left the government with only monetary responses left as solutions to the crisis. This is one reason why both Labour and the Tories went into the last election guaranteeing at least an element of austerity. 

Aforementioned, and other, factors in the UK's particularly poor reaction to the financial crisis during the periods 1997-2007 cannot be ignored. Household debt nearly doubled due to loose monetary policy and regulation making borrowing easier. Production industries fell in output by 3% and manufacturing shrank within the economy more than four times the amount it did during Thatcher's tenure, to only 12.4% of the economy. Meanwhile financial services and real estate grew by over 40% and 33%, the engine of all growth between 1997-2008 and sure signs of a bubble, and an economy poorly prepared for a financial crisis, be it either domestic in origin or from across the seas.

Before too we congratulate ourselves on at least not fueling perhaps the biggest cause of the crisis, the sub-prime market, we should remember that Brown once boasted merely a year before the July 2007 crash that the UK controlled more than 40% of the global derivatives trade. This was the market in which the US sub-prime mortgages were repackaged and traded, making UK government policy and the City complicit in the failure of that market.

So although Labour did not run the world they oversaw poor regulation and monetary policy, and badly planned spending that was absolutely a factor in causing the global crisis. There was a reason, other than deflection of criticism, that Merkel referred to it as the ""Anglo-Saxon crisis"". Irwin Stelzer sarcastically said ""It seems Britain is the victim of a disease that originated in America, and magically crossed the ocean to infect perfectly healthy British banks — the very institutions that were writing mortgages valued at 125 per cent of the value of homes, issuing millions of credit cards and not checking financial statements of borrowers, all under the eyes of regulators attempting to implement the trifurcated regime created by then chancellor Gordon Brown."" And in case you think he's a US Tory shill, google what he has to say about dear Gideon, because it ain't nice.

Sorry for this long post responding to just one line in your counter to u/ohreilly, but I think it's important that we don't use reductivism to evade responsibility for our role in fucking the world economy. Also I've noticed that, with the exception of yourself and one or two others, people just downvote into oblivion posts arguing that Labour were complicit in this clusterfuck rather than innocent bystanders. Although yourself and the_honey_monster may not have picked sides by what 'team' (not quoting btw) you like, and chose to engage with ohreilly and others, most people seem to want to shut down what is an important debate to have. So basically I'm responding as much to them as you, and I hope others argue with ohreilly and myself rather than just try to silence their views, because then we don't get anywhere.

true,The_Sponge_Of_Wrath,null,null,"It depends what department they work in.

Departments whose staff are most likely to know where *everything* is:

* Dotcom (the people who push those big trolleys around to collect home shoppers' stuff)

* Grocery (they do the majority of shelf-stacking and can get posted anywhere in the store except Wines &amp; Spirits, Frozen, and Chilled)

* FMC (the people whose job it is to check and replace shelf edge labels, special offers, etc)

These three departments have most cause to visit the majority of the shop every hour of their working life, and to pay close attention to which items are stashed where. They are also the most likely to notice and remember oddities like the Lightbulbs being with the Pet Food this week, or the Ice Cream Cones being with the Jam.

Next up are the departments whose staff are more localised:

* Produce (i.e. Fruit 'n' Veg)

* Wines and Spirits

* Frozen

* Chilled

* Clothing

These people don't usually know quite so much about the run of the entire store unless they get pulled to go do Grocery for a while, but some still have the knowledge because they shop there themselves, or have to walk the entire length of the store every time they go on break / lunch (Wines &amp; Spirits are notoriously as far away from the staff entrances / exits in the majority of Tesco stores).

The departments whose staff is *least* likely to know, because they don't do any shop floor work:

* Checkouts

* Garage (duh)

* Pharmacy

Note that Checkout staff, due to ""multiskilling"", are often actually staff from other departments who are co-opted into sitting on a checkout when the store is too busy for the amount of checkout staff currently working. This pisses the non-checkout staff off for several reasons:

1. Their own job isn't getting done while they're on a till

2. They are paid less than checkout staff, and do not get upscaled pay for the hours they spend on a till

3. Generally other departments of all kinds have pretty specialised knowledge (FMC, for example, are fully aware of the legal ramifications of their job not getting done; Wines &amp; Spirits have a reasonably in-depth knowledge of the plonk they have; Just about everyone else is intimate with the layout of the warehouse and can find stock fast, etc) which can't be used while they're on a till.

4. The majority of Tesco First Aiders aren't checkout staff. You put a First Aider on a till, their ability to respond to an emergency all but vanishes.

I was having lunch at a Beefeater a few weeks ago, and the table next to us were aggressive, rude, abusive, and horrible to our waitress. They swore at her, called her names, and ultimately demanded a manager to make a complaint about her ""attitude"" and tell him that the ""food was shit, too"".

They ate everything, and left without paying, *laughing*.

They left a young lady in tears, just for a free fucking meal.

I called the manager aside and told them what this family had done, outlined that the waitress' behaviour had been nothing but exemplary, and that in spite of claiming the food was lousy all three of them had cleaned their plates. The waitress came out to thank us for standing up for her, and we sat her down and had a chat, helped her calm down and see that assholes aren't worth getting upset over. Then we gave her a super duper tip on top of our own, because she really was lovely.

So, in short: This bitch was looking for any excuse to blame someone else for her child's shitty behaviour and you happened to be there. Your employers know this, so you haven't got any form of official warning, and they've given her £100 in SHUT UP AND DON'T CALL THE PAPERS money.

It was done on purpose to test the West and force our hand into a legally dubious conflict. 

Syria won't sue alone. Russia and China would follow suit because without a UN resolution there is no legal mandate to attack Syria. 

This isn't Iraq. The international community has learned from the past. If the West attacks without a UN resolution it is game over. Hence all the waiting now despite the warships being ready to go. The US/UK are waiting on the resolution which will **not** come. Russia and/or China will veto. If the West goes ahead despite the veto then legal challenges **will** be made.

Russia has economic interests in Syria (i.e - access to the Med, oil). You step on Russian money and things are going to get seriously fucked up.

Ramires didn't use his engine to his full advantage against United or Villa. It's hardly terrible attacking but an inability to win the ball back without becoming compressed which leads to us starting attacks from deep which makes it harder to play 3AM's close together for good passing moves.

So you have a point. But not all of it is terribly consistent.

I have no doubt that Mourinho will be annoyed that he can't get better football out of his midfield duo but it is an awkward dichotomy given that Mikel has the physical size but needs to fall back into a compressed shape to regularly win the ball and Ramires is one of the most consistent tacklers but quite risky on the ball and it doesn't necessarily use his engine to the best of his ability unless it's a really open game.

* You never need to tell a receptionist *why* you are making an appointment.

I strongly suggest that you never tell a receptionist what you require appointments for, because 90% of GP receptionists in the UK think they bloody well know everything, and will prioritise you as they see fit. They do not need to know, and if they ask tell them you do not wish to discuss it with non-medical staff. They may get pissy, but who cares; they are neither nurses nor doctors, and it is none of their business.

* Ask to speak to the Surgery Manager.

Every GP Surgery has an office manager these days. If the receptionist gives you zero joy, ask to speak with the Surgery Manager. If they refuse to get the Manager for you, ask them for the phone number for the Primary Care Trust. If they refuse to give you that number, Google it and call them yourself, and log a complaint about the obstructive staff.

* Tell the receptionist to stop wasting your time.

Obviously there's no need to actually be rude about it, but state clearly that you need an appointment with a GP, and that a nurse is insufficient. If you get fobbed off yet again, resort to asking to speak to the Manager.",0,1377796767,null,0,false,0,cbxsj4n,t3_1l9a82,t1_cbxsj4n,t3_1l9a82,null,1429657845,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

If suppressing a certain type of image causes the people depicted in that image to become demonised (as you seem to be claiming) then suppressing images of child pornography should cause childhood victims of paedophilia to become demonised. Fortunately, this isn't the case.

If you claim suppressing a certain type of image causes the people who create the image to become demonised, I don't think many women would care even if that were true; men who own smutty magazines, photographers who create unrealistic body standards for women and women who take their clothes off for money are hardly the most sympathetic of characters at the best of times (I grant you that - if you were correct - many women would not want to see the models demonised, but I maintain they really wouldn't care about the magazine owners or photographers. In any case, female sexuality itself wouldn't be demonised; you can hardly jump from this to 'slut shaming', that's an unsound step)

Wilde said ""Autrefois, j’etais poete et tyran. Maintenant je suis artiste et anarchiste"" and refers to the anarchist Kropotkin as his political mentor.  He also writes quite a bit about anarchism in his canon, both explicitly and metaphorically, and if you follow the threads you can see his thoughts on it progress.  He also said in an interview ""We are all of us more or less Socialists now-a-days. . . Our system of government is largely socialistic. . . What is the House of Commons but a socialistic assembly? . . I think I am rather more than a Socialist. . . I am something of an anarchist, I believe. . .""

&gt;His 'Soul of Man Under Socialism' makes me think: Christian/utopian socialist.

In a sense, that's how most anarchists were dismissed by State socialists back then.  Soul of Man is clearly a libertarian vision of socialism, the stress on individualism and socialism being one and the same thing is a big clue, and don't forget that this was written after he discovered Kropotkin.

The UN is pretty big on stopping chemical weapons from becoming a goto weapon for war because there's very little you can do against them tactically and they cause untold damage to anything and everything. It's just not cricket so to speak. Intervention against them is about ensuring that nobody in the world starts using them with regularity or in common warfare. If it were to occur we'd probably be well on our way to destroying ourselves.

To put it in perspective, if it were to become common usage locking down an area of a city would no longer be feasible, it only takes 20 or so with the right training to lock down a huge portion of a city. However, if someone doesn't care for civilian casualties and is willing to use indiscriminate weaponry then they'd just use a chemical weapon to get them out.

I can be expected to cite evidence for the widely held personal opinions of the British right wing... they belive what they believe because they believe it. Whether they are correct or not is redundant... a right wing government got elected partly on a ticket of labour being typecast as a promoter of the welfare state, and the convservatives pitching themselves as a solution to that. They passed a contract to ATOS to start to clamp down on the old system - where all you had to do was rock up at your GP and collect a note to get you out of work for the rest of your life.

- Were in a lot of trouble during the 90s, almost got erased from history in 1994 but Fergus McCann saved the club and built a new stadium.

I agree with this. 

I think it is the difference between ""top 4""-type teams and the rest. The top teams have that little bit more quality that allows them to put the ball in the net when chances are limited by a defense-first opponent or strong keeper.

I think this is why Everton does well against ""better"" teams playing for the win, but are frequently unable to break down poorer squads who pack it in. Its a thin (but expensive) line, and Everton are on the wrong side.

Currently only Barkley and Deu appear to have that killer edge in scoring quality. Naismith, Osman, Kone, etc. not so much. ",0,1377803709,null,0,false,0,cbxvaom,t3_1lb0ui,t1_cbxvaom,t1_cbxkwlk,null,1429656555,4,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,4

The point of the attacks would just be to scare/weaken Assad and send a bit of a message. I feel like all this sabre rattling has probably scared him enough already. He must realise at this point that any kind of chemical attack from his regime would guarantee intervention.

tl;dr I don't think we need to actually drop bombs on Assad to achieve our aims. I think the intense sabre rattling we did is enough.

This is gonna sound like justification after the fact, but I often felt bales constant demand for the ball last season (or at least the second half when we lost Sandro to injury and Defoe to lack of form) made some of our players look worse than they are.

**Sandro** has had some absolutely crunching tackles. If those gooners think they have injury problems now, then they might want to sit Sunday out

**Holtby** has actually looked very creative in this first half. I understand the signing of Eriksen, but Holtby has looked really good thus far, albeit against an average side.

**Defoe** Don't think he will end up being sold. Will make a good second striker to have, will help us get to the last stages of Europa where I think Soldado will finish.

**Defense** Look indestructible. Can't believe how huge Kaboul looks in our kits. 

Overall: looking for 2-3 more goals in the second half now that we have found our stride, hopefully some first teamers come on to get a run in before the NLD at the weekend.

He's clever, got great vision and a beautiful pass. And that touch before his shot was pure sex.

* Sandro is a beast!

* Siggy, I'm sorry, but he's not good enough. He doesn't do anything special when he's on the ball (not bad, but not special) and his positioning off the ball is woeful.

* Townsend is quality. All the wing play has been going through him, whether he's been on the left or right. I really want to see him start on Sunday.

* I like Holtby - he's got energy and passion, and that switch pass for the first goal was excellent. I don't see him in our first 11, but he's a great squad player and is only going to get better.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Exactly right. People think holding midfield is all about tackling, and that's mostly wrong. It's really about shielding the back four, interceptions, ball retention, linkup play, and- in some cases- long distribution.

Ramires does 1, 2, and 3 quit well. He has struggled with 4 so far and is fairly poor at 5, and I think that's the source of the problems that people have spotted with our deep midfield so far. He is improving at these things though.

People want to use Ramires as a box-to-box player because of his stamina and eye for goal, and I see that, but I honestly think he just lacks the necessary quality on the ball. If he plays deep and makes the occasional bursting run forward, that's great, but when he consistently gets the ball at his feet higher up the pitch (like Lampard often does/did when he played a true box-to-box role) he looks lost and often gives it away, leading to dangerous transitions.

My guess is that Jose's long term plan is to have Van Ginkel play there, but doesn't feel confident enough to start him there at the moment. It's a bit of a cliche to talk about a balance of youth and experience, but it is important, and I don't think he feels confident having 4/5 midfielders under the age of 23 with no more than a year of premiership experience.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That's not necessarily true. The ""most traditional"" way to play a 4-3-3 is the 6/8/10 system, meaning one holding player, one box-to-box, and one #10.

Implementations of the 4-2-3-1 tend to fall into two categories. The first people call the ""double pivot."" I find this name a bit confusing, but basically it's two players splitting the role of the 6 and the 8. A good example is Bayern with Schweinsteiger/Martinez. There isn't a good reason you can't do this in a 4-3-3, and some teams do.

The other kind is the same 6/8 system as the ""traditional"" 4-3-3. A great example of this is Dortmund with Bender/Gundogan.

Of course there are countless variations. A good example is the Old Mourinho Chelsea 4-3-3, which did not have a true 10, favoring two box-to-box midfielders in Essien and Lampard.

Whitlock Heaps - great, easy to deal with, no fuss. Not at all pushy, but will get you everything you need.

Sawyer and Co - again, efficient, easy to deal with. The staff I dealt with were good dudes too. This was the company I was working with during the aforementioned aborted sale, but all round I had no complaints about them as a company and thought they were great.

Cubitt &amp; West - only get involved if you like to receive texts and voicemails for the rest of your fucking life

Coastal Management - went for a couple of viewings where these guys didn't even turn up, only to find the properties had already been let.

Hove Lets - nice guys, seemed to bend over backwards to squeeze me into some viewings.

Kudos - what the fuck even is this company. I talked to four different people and not a single one could tell me if they even did weekend viewings.

&gt;""Most of the psychological damage, if any, stems not from the abuse but the interpretation of the abuse and the handling of the situation by parents, medical personnel, law enforcement and school officials, and social workers."" An English study (Howard League Working Party, 1985), found: ""The degree of lasting harm suffered by victims… seems to flow predominantly not from the sexual nature of the experience, but rather from other sources of shock associated with it, notably the use of violence or intimidation or the abuse of parental powers. The subsequent intervention of parents, or other authorities, in order to bring the offender to justice often seems to aggravate the damage caused by the offence itself.""

&gt;Nelson's relationship marked ""the happiest period of [her] life."" ""When I was a child I experienced an ongoing incestuous relationship that seemed to me to be caring and beneficial in nature. There were love and healthy self-actualization in what I perceived to be a safe environment. Suddenly one day I discerned from playground talk at school that what I was doing might be ""bad"". Fearing that I might, indeed, be a ""bad"" person, I went to my mother for reassurance. The ensuing traumatic incidents of that day inaugurated a 30-year period of psychological and emotional dysfunction that reduced family communication to mere utilitarian process and established severe limits on my subsequent developmental journey.""

~~Paraphrasing~~ Quoting the PM as he responded to Ed Milliband's question ""There having been no motion passed by this house tonight, can the Prime Minister confirm to the House that he will not use the Royal Prerogative to order the UK to be part of military action - given the will of the house that has been expressed tonight - before there's been another vote in this House of Commons?: 

Cameron: ""I can give that assurance. Let me say the House has not voted for either motion tonight. I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons. It is very clear tonight that while the house has not passed a motion, it is clear to me that the British Parliament - reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that, and the Government will act accordingly.

I'm not sure if it was just me, but he seemed really angry as he sat back down. Great result in my books. 

They will go to another vote after the UN reports back. Probably the same time next week. If that's rejected as well... then... well I'm not even going to chance an opinion on that one.

Thousands of people have a dream of jacking in their job of running a nice little pub. And that's precisely what companies like Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns sell - the dream. You can buy a pub as a ready-to-go business from companies like this from as little as £5-10,000.

What they don't tell the prospective pub landlord - the stereotype is a relatively naive 40- or 50-something who's never run their own business, just been made redundant and got a nice little windfall; maybe £20 or 30,000 for the sake of argument - is that there is no such thing as a viable business that can replace a regular salary on sale for £5-10,000. Hell, there's no such thing as a viable business that can easily replace a regular salary for £20,000.

Anyhow, our prospective publican finds a place he likes and writes out a cheque that represents about 80% of his redundancy money. It's not until some time after he moves in he realises that the ""nice, helpful"" girl from Enterprise who explained that they'd even sell him the booze so he didn't need to find wholesalers wasn't that helpful - Enterprise want 20-30% more per barrel than any wholesaler, and the contract explicitly forbids you from buying booze from anyone else.

But that's only scratching the surface. The full list of problems our new publican faces is huge - far too large to discuss here - and fixing enough of them to make the business profitable will cost five times what the pub sold for. But our landlord doesn't have five times what he bought the pub for - and his bank manager has seen all this a hundred times before and isn't prepared to help.

The end is inevitable. Sooner or later the landlord can't maintain his obligations to the pub company, declares himself bankrupt, exit stage left. The pub goes back on the market for the next poor sod.",0,1377812686,null,0,false,0,cbxyui3,t3_1lc5w6,t1_cbxyui3,t1_cbxwb5f,null,1429654869,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons.

I got up to get my self a drink. As I went over to the bar, some old bloke (talking late 60s at least.) called me a faggot. 

I was in a good mood and he seemed pretty drunk so it didn't bother me at all, so I ignored him and ordered my self and my girlfriend a drink. I got my self a pint of Boddingtons and a bottle of kopparberg for my girlfriend. 

This guy then raised his voice, put his hand on my shoulder and said 'obviously you'd get a bottle of that you fucking queer'. He then put an empty crisp packet in my pint. 

At this point I was a bit upset to be honest, the older gentleman wasn't messing about with me, he was being pretty aggressive towards me. So I decided to move around to the other end of the bar and let the barman know. The barman got me another pint and told the man to stop being a dick, he apologies to me and said that he's often here getting drunk and causing problems.

I started walking back to where I was sitting but the old man walked infront of me and said he wanted to fight me because I was a 'dirty faggot'. 

At this point I was pissed off, so I told him I was here with my girlfriend of 5 years having a quiet pint with her friend. I went on to say that even if I was gay, it would be nothing to be ashamed of, but being an OAP drinking your sorrows away.

At this point he tried to grab me, but some guy he was with stepped in and told him to leave me alone (He also told him that he wasn't going to win a fight against a 6'4'' kid anyway - that really tickled me!)

The old man pushed me again, so I decided enough was enough.

I gently but forcefully moved him out of my way. I didn't want a fight obviously, but this was taking the piss.
I then took it upon my self to pat him on the arse and whisper 'I am actually gay, are you interested?' and I went back to my girlfriend and her friends.

His face was a picture! He didn't give me any more problems after that!

**TL;DR: Drunk old man decided I was gay, decided gays are bad, decided he wants to fight the gay. So I slapped his arse. He wasn't pleased but he sat back down!**

We do have to abide by arms conventions and we have a legal obligation to intervene in instances of genocide (which disgracefully the west debated the definition of genocide during the Rwanda conflict). There is no knowing whether Assad will use further chemical weapons but if the West does not hold him to account there is no knowing what he will do. (the rebels lack the capacity to disperse the chemical agents in the recent attack, which basically leaves the government). 


https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chemical-weapon-use-by-syrian-regime-uk-government-legal-position/chemical-weapon-use-by-syrian-regime-uk-government-legal-position-html-version


This note sets out the UK government’s position regarding the legality of military action in Syria following the chemical weapons attack in Eastern Damascus on 21 August 2013.

The use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime is a serious crime of international concern, as a breach of the customary international law prohibition on use of chemical weapons, and amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity. However, the legal basis for military action would be humanitarian intervention; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons.

The UK is seeking a resolution of the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations which would condemn the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian authorities; demand that the Syrian authorities strictly observe their obligations under international law and previous Security Council resolutions, including ceasing all use of chemical weapons; and authorise member states, among other things, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians in Syria from the use of chemical weapons and prevent any future use of Syria’s stockpile of chemical weapons; and refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.

If action in the Security Council is blocked, the UK would still be permitted under international law to take exceptional measures in order to alleviate the scale of the overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe in Syria by deterring and disrupting the further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. Such a legal basis is available, under the doctrine of humanitarian intervention, provided three conditions are met:

(i) there is convincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief;

(ii) it must be objectively clear that there is no practicable alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved; and

(iii) the proposed use of force must be necessary and proportionate to the aim of relief of humanitarian need and must be strictly limited in time and scope to this aim (i.e. the minimum necessary to achieve that end and for no other purpose).

All three conditions would clearly be met in this case:
(i) The Syrian regime has been killing its people for two years, with reported deaths now over 100,000 and refugees at nearly 2 million. The large-scale use of chemical weapons by the regime in a heavily populated area on 21 August 2013 is a war crime and perhaps the most egregious single incident of the conflict. Given the Syrian regime’s pattern of use of chemical weapons over several months, it is likely that the regime will seek to use such weapons again. It is also likely to continue frustrating the efforts of the United Nations to establish exactly what has happened. Renewed attacks using chemical weapons by the Syrian regime would cause further suffering and loss of civilian lives, and would lead to displacement of the civilian population on a large scale and in hostile conditions.

(ii) Previous attempts by the UK and its international partners to secure a resolution of this conflict, end its associated humanitarian suffering and prevent the use of chemical weapons through meaningful action by the Security Council have been blocked over the last two years. If action in the Security Council is blocked again, no practicable alternative would remain to the use of force to deter and degrade the capacity for the further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.

(iii) In these circumstances, and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable. Such an intervention would be directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe, and the minimum judged necessary for that purpose.",0,1377815608,null,0,false,0,cbxzxgj,t3_1lcx19,t1_cbxzxgj,t1_cbxzn2y,null,1429654317,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

But that idea got changed after the character a) became quite popular and b) the actor playing him died tragically young.

We'd also not have The Valeyard, another figure from the Classic series.  In Season 23 (Trial of a Time Lord) the Valeyard shows up to prosecute The Doctor.  Later, it turns out he's the distillation of all The Doctor's bitterness and anger, given a body and promised that if he can get the Doctor found guilty he can have The Doctor's remaining regenerations.

And we also see the Dream Lord, where the Doctor's own mind creates a figure who taunts The Doctor and his friends, and it turns out that The Doctor really doesn't like himself very much.

Primarily, I feel that we should keep out of a civil war. It takes internal conflict and resolution to form a proper and stable society. We ""were allowed"" to have our own civil wars, go back and forth between various systems and, whilst horrendous and bloody, we are a nation are better for having resolved it ourselves. 

If France were to have come over, helped defeat the Republicans, do you really think we'd have established a stable political settlement? No, that intervention would be the fundamental source of ongoing bitterness. ""Oh, we were invaded by the French!"", ""It was their plan all along"", ""We should reclaim the country for those that believe it's British"". This would go on, ad-nauseum, back and forth, with no clear way to get away from the fact that it wasn't settled by us. 

Look at the ongoing stability we've brought the middle east through intervening, we make a great figurehead to get people to file against ideologically, rather than focusing on the actual problems in their countries. They can blame anything on ""interference from the West"". What if we do enable the setting up of fundamentalist regime, one friendly with Al-Queda, one that could use WMD stockpiles themselves? Do we then have to take them out? How do we maintain/regain legitimacy in the middle east if all we end up doing is overthrowing every regime every 50 or so years?

But, particularly watching some of the footage on the news tonight of ""Napalm attacks"" on a school playground, and the probable use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime, it makes it really difficult to maintain such a stance without feeling some kind of guilt over the smiting of innocents. In not acting we have given some legitimacy to their use, particularly with all the rhetoric beforehand. But I do see a case for the fact that this could be a false flag operation by one of the many militant groups. We need to be certain before we do take any action. Imagine if we were getting played?

Edit:there is clearly asbestos in one of the pics, and knowing the age of the school the drop ceilings will contain it too. Plus it can be insulating the pipes. With the ceilings half on the floor and dust everywhere I would advice not to step into places like this at all.   

I would also advise 'urban explorers' to research asbestos so you know what to look for, wear at the minimum a dust mask(not the cheapest ones,  they are for wood dust only) just incase, there is also the danger of the building being structurally unsound, and floors/ceilings/stairs falling on you. Do your research on this too, so you know when to say ""fuck that"" .

This 'urban exploring' is not a new thing. We did similar things as kids,  there was this one warehouse, where you could easily get onto the roof, and had great views. It had an asbestos roof on steel girders. This was about 18 years ago. We went up there all the time until we moved to the next town over.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"My position is a strange one. I oppose intervention for my own specific reasons which I consider valid (very specifically, I want the situation in Syria to implode and create a case study in the future for why we should intervene to help liberal, competent oppositions rather than wasting time and letting strongmen and war heroes out of religious extremists and mercinaries who would then become entrenched. Basically, I want to yell at people 'I told you so' when everyone ignored me and people like me when we called for intervention and a no fly zone earlier on so that next time we don't lose the only possible alternative to the regime)

So, irrespective that I think we shouldn't intervene:

One: you cannot just fire chemical weapons in that quantity and scope without infrastructure, training and expertise. Considering the regime was targeting that area, they had cause and motive (demoralising retaliation for assassination attempts) and the fact there is no credible Middle East analyst who believes the opposition have the basic competence to pull off a false flag, it is clear to me that the regime is responsible. Other than racist conspiracy theories, there are no credible alternatives given.

Two; we know it was chemical weapons attacks. We are not morons. Our government, analysts and the like know what they are doing. If they were going to fake information, they would have found a better way to do so.

This means that Assad almost certainly used the weapons in question. No one serious should question this, but lots of people aren't serious. They mistake complete cynicism and distrust for skeptisim and legitimate enquiry.

Considering this, some form of response is necessary. We don't let people use chemical weapons because they are indiscriminate, easy to use, destructive and if everyone could use them war zones would become even worse for innocent bystanders. While war inherently sucks, it will become far worse with chemical weapons being used.

Now, obviously a nice diplomatic UN response would be nice, but Syria is Russia's proxy. Russia is currently fighting a prolonged war against civilian populations which involve massive amounts of civilians dying, they don't care about international pressure, they don't care about reaching a deal. They want to keep Syria as an ally and will block any move. It is entirely pointless to try, even our ex-ambassador to the UN knows that.

There is also the prospect of a trial, but Assad does not give two shits about that. He is fighting a war where he could be assassinated any day and if he loses will result in his death or exile to Russia or Iran. He does not fear The Hague.

We are therefore left with but one option, a significant military strike against non-essential military targets which will not alter the balance of power in the region but will provide enough of a disincentive so that chemical weapons will not be used again but which does not endanger the ethnic groups that Assad represents, at worst achieving little more than relating a counterbalance to the incentive to attack again, at best encouraging all the ethnic groups to lean towards a coalition for peace which excludes the crazies.

This is clearly the only and least bad option to doing nothing, which will just break down the taboos associated with chemical weapons use.

There are so many good reasons not to do this, but other people have said them, so I will give the real reason why we did not act. Because the British public are ignorant, uncaring, selfish bastards who do not give two shits about Syrian opposition civilians being killed. After Iraq we would rather Assad kill hundreds of thousands of people than we kill a small number to incentivise peace.

I'm sure there are good, knowledgable people who oppose the conflict. I am one of them. But the vast majority of people are supposed to care about this shir. But they don't. We have become another irrelevant, morally bankrupt European state who free-rides off the Americans while bitching about the security and benefits they provide while patting our own backs for justifying our cowardice.

I am an evil heartless bastard, but usually I get shouted down by people with basic humanity and decency. Today they remained silent out of self interest and political ambition.

In the short term, there is a benefit to not intervening, it makes the Syria situation slightly less bad, and allows us to wash our hands of it, probably for the next couple of years.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt; I would like to see something done about Syria, but first I'd like to see confirmation of who used chemical weapons, because ""let's import some sarin and get NATO to blow up our enemy"" is a rather obvious tactic.

I'm aware of this hole in what I'm saying, and here I can only defer to the government (which I would really rather not do) when they say that it is most likely the Assad regime that are guilty of this.

But if they did believe it was the rebels, they're less likely to admit that, but yes, this is the major hole in the cause for intervention.

Nevertheless, Assad is still no saint, and I don't think it would be a huge tragedy if we brought military action against him. What's important is to send the message, 'we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons'. Even if it was the rebels who did it... we can't be seen to tolerate their use, that's even more important than punishing the actual perpetrator, in my view.

And you don't need to tell me that that's horrible, but that's the nature of international affairs when they reach this level. I can't stand violence in any of its forms, but the one thing I am sure of is that we must take every step possible to ""degrade and discourage"" the use of chemical warfare.

Incidentally, I didn't know the Us has used its veto more often than any other member put together since '86. That's interesting. I'm under no illusion that the West are the guys in white hats here, but I do know that we have our own interests to protect, and within those interests (which happen to be the interests of the world, in this particular case) is the continuation of the prohibition on chemical weapons.",0,1377819824,null,0,false,0,cby1g2n,t3_1lcx19,t1_cby1g2n,t1_cby1bis,null,1429653608,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Well, yes and no, in my opinion. I made the point of stating that feeding the disabled/going to war is *not* an either/or decision.

That being said, war is expensive. A large-sclae military intervention in another continent undoubtedly *would* take money away from services that we all use, and that many of us rely on.

It's not a black and white decision. Particularly as an individual with no involvement in politics, the armed forces or with inside knowledge of the Syrian situation, I think it's ludicrous to think that any of us 'know' what the correct course of action is. We have a responsibility as humans to try to help, but at the same time we do have to protect our own people first and foremost (as nobody else will), and we can't even say for certain if our involvement there would ultimately be a positive thing for the region.

I sort of took /u/RaymonBartar's point as a simplification of a wider one, rather than taking it literally (although I don't know if that was his intention). We know that other countries, some with closer ties to the country, are prepared to act, and we also have UN Peacekeeper forces that can intervene in the right circumstances. Our country isn't in it's best state right now (better than so many, but still not at its own best), so we really need to consider what option would do the overall most good.

The Free Syrian Army sort of represents this more moderate wing, but the FSA has been badly battered, and there are no doubt many radical members in its lower ranks. And now we have much more radical groups, such as the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front and the Al-Nusra Front (an al-Queda associate) forming a huge chunk of the opposition.

I'm not sure what the current situation is - the English teaching industry has seen a bit of a decline since then, but you should still be able to find a job reasonably easily.  Immigration are, I would argue, more relaxed than the UK in many regards.  Japan has this reputation for having strict immigration, but I've certainly never had any problems with it.  After about 5 years I switched to a spouse visa (I met my wife here, which is why I never came back) and then after 6, I got permanent residence.  Both were pretty easy to apply for.

The only thing you absolutely must have (if you plan to go down the teaching route) is a university degree - subject doesn't matter - otherwise the Japanese government won't grant you a visa.",0,1377820504,null,0,1377820696,0,cby1ost,t3_1la9ww,t1_cby1ost,t1_cbxoppd,null,1429653495,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your hall will arrange something (maybe pregaming, depending on how far ""responsible drinking"" has been pushed for this year) for Welcome to the Bubble and almost certainly Clan Warfare. The latter is a great event to get to know people from your hall. I think you've made good choices.

For everything else, I'd suggest just buying in freshers' week depending on how you feel, or who you want to go with - unless there's an act (S Club 2?) that you're very keen on.. There will probably be a brisk trade in private ticket re-sales as people get ill or decide they want to do different stuff.

That being said, you might want to look at Starfields and see how the lineup for that strikes you. If you're interested in it I would probably suggest pre-booking.

In my freshers' week (ages ago...), mostly we drank in hall and went around pubs rather than hitting the union events. I think I only did Clan Warfare... Depends what you want to do - whatever, there will be plenty of people with the same idea.

Halls will probably also arrange film nights for those who aren't feeling like another night out, or to offer a non-alcohol option.

You will also find that some societies and other groups organise free/cheap events. This is perhaps more common in the daytime - a good opportunity to get free food and occasional free booze (if you drink). These should be listed in ""The Book"" (or a supplement to it) which you get on arrival in hall.

I was at the Palace game and, while I wouldn't go as far as to say Palace could've won...Tottenham certainly were not convincing. They could potentially gel in the next few weeks and then beast it, but it doesn't look like that at the moment.

Everton &amp; Arsenal honestly look very weak now. Everton still have Fellaini &amp; Baines (for now) who if they lost, they'd be gone. But I don't see them as very strong. Arsenal have lost a few good players to injuries and haven't brought anyone decent (unless you can argue Flamini is top 4 standard) in.

 Major structural differences-

    There is A little step up about 1ft before the tub. 

    The arch around the tub (The Shining) stops a foot away 
    from the actual corner of room.

    Both archways over the toilet and the sinks seem to be a indented 
    a few inches more than, the Pic with Nathan. 


  Cosmetic Differances-

    The original is a tub/shower combo. Grand Hotel just a tub.

    The Tile on the floor. 

    The bidet and toilet have switched places
 
    Grand Hotel There is no more little shelf's for stuff, cut into the wall.

There are many more problems with these two scenes. I just wanted to point out a few.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"Under the resolution 377A(V), ""Uniting for peace"", adopted by the General Assembly on 3 November 1950, an ""emergency special session"" can be convened within 24 hours:

""Resolves that if the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in any case where there appears to be a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, the General Assembly shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security. If not in session at the time, the General Assembly may meet in emergency special session within twenty-four hours of the request therefor. Such emergency special session shall be called if requested by the Security Council on the vote of any seven members, or by a majority of the Members of the United Nations"".

By adopting A/RES/377 A, on 3 November 1950, over two-thirds of UN Member states declared that, according to the UN Charter, the permanent members of the UNSC cannot and should not prevent the UNGA from taking any and all action necessary to restore international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC has failed to exercise its 'primary responsibility' for maintaining peace. Such an interpretation sees the UNGA as being awarded 'final responsibility'—rather than 'secondary responsibility'—for matters of international peace and security, by the UN Charter. Various official and semi-official UN reports make explicit reference to the Uniting for Peace resolution as providing a mechanism for the UNGA to overrule any UNSC vetoes; thus rendering them little more than delays in UN action, should two-thirds of the Assembly subsequently agree that action is necessary.

What this means is, the Veto is not the be all and end all of the UNSC, the UNGA has a way to bypass the UNSC and the permanent members veto if they so wish by getting a 2/3 majority vote together.

Not saying it is likely to happen, but just pointing out that the rules and customs of the UN and International law in turn show that the veto can be overturned. ",0,1377831434,null,0,false,0,cby5i1h,t3_1lcx47,t1_cby5i1h,t1_cby0f0e,null,1429651717,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,lw_lock,null,null,"Here is a short guide that'll help you fit in: 

Your favourite player is Henrik Larsson.

You are excited by the champion's league draw. Despite the tough fixtures you know that Celtic Park will be rocking, and it'll give you a chance to travel, get astonishingly drunk, and make lots of noise in at least 3 of Europe's most esteemed cultural centres. 

You often claim that the league is just as good or even better without Rangers, while secretly hoping to draw them in a cup-tie. 

You expect to win the league by a huge margin, despite an inevitable loss to Ross County somewhere down the line. 

Players who grew up locally are mostly 'neds', you like to feel superior to them and not think about their enormous wages. 

You know that Samaras is a donkey and you'll moan about it to other Celtic fans. In front of outsiders, however, you will defend him passionately. 

Scott 'Broonie' Brown is a madman, but you love him. 

Neil Lennon is a former madman, turned club legend, turned world-class manager. You are disappointed and saddened by his treatment from the press, SFA, and bullet-posting extremist idiots. 

Kris Commons, despite his accent and birthplace, is a Scottish man. You will learn to live with this lie as you hope he will return to the national team. 

You can't understand why a player would ever want to leave the club when they could stay and become a legend. 

It is your dream to one day play for Celtic. You will maintain this dream well into your old age. 

You still really like Paddy McCourt. 

You think Stokes is a greedy player, but he's the best option. 

The best goal you've ever seen was scored by Nakamura. 

You know every word to every song. Even the naughty ones. 

You know the names of all the Lisbon Lions. 

Your second team is whichever one is being managed by Martin O'neill at that particular moment. 

Despite the stadium being built on a cemetery, you will not entertain the idea that it is haunted.

If we are really concerned about the welfare of Syrian civilians, then it's fairly clear that what they need most of all is an end to the war. Assad was winning the war, and by all accounts still is. Every time we arm the rebels, or aid them in any way, the end of the war gets pushed further into the future.

Therefore the rational thing to do is to help Assad win the war and crush the rebellion. After that, send in UN peacekeepers and threaten Assad with strikes to prevent him from committing any revenge killings.

I'm not sold on either side sweeping anything away this week. If we're reliant on crosses we may have a roughy time with huth and shawcross, but if it's anything like the Cardiff goals with a couple of one time shots from the top of the 18 I think we stand a much stronger chance.

I think downing has a meaner cross that may come in handy this week but that's all dependent on who's there to receive the ball. I'm sort of hoping he gets the start over Joe cole but I would also love to see more of an impact substitution by Ravel Morrison opposed to what seems to be a 1 for 1 swap with the wingers.

He is creative enough to see passes from deeper in the midfield, challenges people while they're on the ball, is good with the ball on his foot and can shoot pretty well with both feet as we've seen.

Sigurdsson is more suited to play in an advanced role, where his defensive responsibilities aren't as high and he can focus more on attacking. He is also a creative passer and has great curve on his right foot. 

I see Sigurdsson being played higher up the field this season, as he should be, while Holtby will fill in wherever he can get games since we have so many midfielders.

3. Watch the matches. Whether its with a club, on Celtic.tv, or on a stream, you will have to get creative to do so.

Did the usual and got pretty drunk, though not legless. Then I drank what I now assume was a spiked drink, possibly intended for one of the girls in our group. Hit me pretty hard - my friends tried to look after me, but the place was too busy for babysitting. I got separated and was on my way to the toilet when the bouncers threw me out the backdoor. They didn't speak to me or try to find out if anyone was with me or to see if I had a coat in the cloakroom or anything. 

So there I am, out the back of the club (in the docks), out of my face and scared. Which turned into paranoia. I can remember it clear as day - I decided that I was being hunted and took off into the docklands. I ran up roads, hid from cars and climbed walls. Eventually, I must've been seen on CCTV because a security guy picked me up in a car and brought me to the entrance of his patch, where the police stuck me in a car and drove me back to the front of the club and tossed me out on the street. 

I must have sobered up because I apparently phoned my dad and must've sounded freaked out enough that he drove down from our house to come pick me up.  The next morning I woke up to find that my hands were cut to absolute ribbons - when I climbed the wall, I reckon there must've been barbed wire or glass shards that I pulled myself up on. Every surface of my palms and fingers were covered in open cuts. 

What's weird about the experience is that I could remember quite a bit in the club - I got thrown out by stumbling by the bouncers and just got scooped out - I wasn't being loud or obnoxious.

It was only last week that I was talking about AVB's age with a few of my old flatmates from my Uni days and that it's pretty amazing what he's managed to achieve at his age. As a comparison, we're all 24-26 and work in London but I highly doubt any of us will be as successful as he's been by the age of 33 (when he won the treble with Porto and Chelsea paid his release clause at £13.3m). One of my mates has already started getting his grey hair and we quipped that if AVB shaved he would look younger than said mate (he's a bit of an asshole so it's OK) and we all realised that we've never seen him clean shaven. All a bit of friendly banter. 

I agree that this sub can at times feel like living ""in a little sterilised bubble"" (I got downvoted quite heavily when I went into a Scum hate rant a few weeks back http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1kjttj/anyone_watching_villawoolwich/cbpousc) On the other hand, this club forms a major part of most of our lives here - not just what happens on the pitch. I love the fact that when I'm bored at work I can sit here and continue some of the discussions that I would normally have after work only a few times per week with my mates. I think things would be quite boring if we couldn't take a lighter look at things like what our manager looks like without a beard, that Sandro has coloured his beard so he looks like some heathen mixture of a Viking, Sebastien Chabal, and a South American drug lord, et cetera. In the end we are a community here where we all respect and admire (some idolise) our manager, we are proud of our players, we love what our chairman has done for the club even if some of his decisions can be questionable at times and most (if not all of us like /u/tottenhamhotsauce said) are quite excited for the season ahead because we love this club and that carries over into threads like this.

Basically, war has a cost on those who fight it. Principled men become unprincipled out of necessity. Good people do bad things. Just people do just things. Revolutions usually result in thousands of deaths, lots of assassinations and, if eventually successful, almost always result in a purge to ensure there is a stable and secure government.

By intervening early on for the 'good' opposition, we stop the worst of that from happening. We ensure that extremists, who tend to be charismatic and competent war leaders, don't end up taking control over the movement and making it worse than the alternative.

**EDIT - just remembered another one**

Was visiting a friend who was doing his masters at the Imperial College campus in Silwood, near Ascot. Over the weekend we met up with another friend who was doing his PhD at Oxford, so we decided on Reading as a decent compromise on where to meet. Get off the train, onto the main shopping street, and spy a wee old man pub called The Bugle. We enter and immediately everyone stops drinking and stares at us, probably because we were about 20 years younger than anyone else there.

 Head up to the bar and order some pints. Barman eyes us suspiciously: ""You lads from Scotland then?"" ""Aye, just here visiting."" ""Don't get many Jocks in here..."" Awkward silence ensued; he hadn't started pouring the pints yet, and didn't seem to be in any hurry to break eye contact, or even blink. Notice that one of the regulars has got up and is now standing right behind us. Turn round apprehensively. He stares at us for a minute, then goes ""I like your beards. You cunts are alright."" After that, everyone was friendly enough to us, but we left out the side door pretty sharpish when two of the regulars started leathering the absolute shite out of each other and knocking over everyone's drinks.",0,1377856161,null,0,1377873587,0,cbyaxmi,t3_1lcuhz,t1_cbyaxmi,t3_1lcuhz,null,1429649123,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He changes tack and says 'ok, let me play pool with you to win it back'. Now, I'm a pretty crap pool player and I decline and go to walk back to the bar. He punches me in the stomach. 

Now I'm a fairly big lad - about 6'4"", and he's quite a little bloke, and it doesn't hurt. I just sort of looked down at him and said 'what do you think you're doing??' in surprise, I actually laughed a bit because I still thought he was mucking about, albeit in a thoroughly weird way. 

Anyway, I push him off me and turn to go back to the bar, and he swings his glass at my face. 

Luckily for me, the landlord was walking past and pushes me out of the way, so it smashes against the side of my head. I'm cut, but he was planning to ram the thing right into my face, it could have been very messy indeed. 

At this point I'm standing a bit bemused really, not quite sure what the hell has just happened. However, as the glass shattered, it rained down a few pieces on the landlord's head, he's a bald guy and has a few small cuts from this. His wife leaps from behind the bar, grabs the little guy screaming 'don't you touch my effing husband you little wanker!', punches him, and then literally kicks him out of the front door of the pub, screaming and blinding the whole time. 

Anyway me and the landlord get cleaned up and become good friends afterwards. I still have a little bump in the side of my head where a grain of glass has become permanently embedded though.

The opening sequence at the moment is (as far as I know) widely regarded as one of the best openings for Doctor Who ever, if not the best and it is for a reason. I think we all agree now that the Pond era opening was a misstep and the new one is an improvement and it is because it's the first Doctor Who opening that actually looks realistic. We know that they have the ability to let the TARDIS fly through absolutely everything - we saw that in the recent seasons, but for the opening sequence they chose not to overblow it with CGI graphics and instead used real pictures, a real explosion and let the whole thing feel a lot more physical. By doing this, they grounded it in reality and also made clear that Doctor Who isn't a big CGI romp, because it isn't. 

What the NeonVisual guy does is absolutely amazing and I'm a huge fan of his work, but I'm getting a little tired of people saying it was better than the original opening. It isn't. For me this thinking is a little reminiscent of modern blockbuster culture which often seems to think that drowning the whole screen in visual effects would somehow improve the movie. Doing another only-CGI opening would be a step back from the realism they achieved with the new Matt Smith intro and in a few years (when CGI graphics will be even better) the NeonVisual stuff (even if he gets a higher budget) will be just as unwatchable as the beast in The Satan Pit is now.

The Drill in Gidea Park... Or the day I nearly died.
So passing by with a friend we decided that we both felt the need to take a leak, it had been a long walk and hey, when better than now? The pub itself wasnt anything out of the ordinary from the outside, a typical shabby old man pub, you know, writing in gold and red, faded signs up about local events and football.
I made my way for the door and on going in I realised that my friend had opted to take a leak in the car park. He was classy like that and I really dont think I appreciated what it had meant. You see, he lived in the area and knew the pub very, very well. So when I suggested that we take a leak in the pub he must have assumed that we were going to piss on/around the pub. Warning number one.
I grinned at him for being the classy, hobo chic, public car park pissing alcoholic that we all know and love and went in. Inside of the pub was like any other, a smattering of people left and right and a more or less empty bar. A haze of cigarette smoke (long after the ban) followed me all the way to the gents; I was all business, eyes on the prize, get in and get back out.
Entering the gents I was met a guy in his 50's snorting coke off of the sink. Warning sign number 2. But hey, im liberal, whatever man, you have fun with that, im here to piss and then im out of your hair. Eyes on the prize. He just stood bent over the sink sucking up lines through a rolled up five pound note without even a glance in my direction. Regardless, I relieve myself, wash up in the sink furthest away from him (you dont fuck with the coke monster) before taking out my phone to avoid the barmans attention as I escape without having to buy a drink (we have all done it). Escaping however was harder than I thought as I had made it no further than 10 feet before the barman called out to me:

Barman: Oit, you going to buy a drink?

... Shit, oh well. I kept my attention securely on my phone and walked to the bar.

Mr Red: Yeah, sure, ill have a shot of tequila

I point to a bottle of tequla behind the bar.

Barman: We dont sell tequila...

I raised an eyebrow, he didnt look, he didnt even move, he had just kept staring at me without checking. Warning number 3. I kept my eyes averted to my my phone

Mr Red: Oh... Okay, ill have a shot of baileys then?

He looks me up and down for a long moment, gets a pint glass and pours a shot of baileys into it. As he pushed it in front of me:

Barman: Here mate, you're not a terrorist are you? (Im not white, in fact I am very not white)  

I kind of nervously chuckled whist keeping my eyes on my phone.

Mr Red: No mate, not today

Barman: Good... Because we dont like terrorists...

He let that statement hang for a long moment... Warning number fuck... I took a my eyes off of my phone and for the first time made eye contact with him. He wasnt fucking around. I took a look around the room and everyone else in the room was doing the same thing. People were stook up, sat down, on their own, with their mates... all staring at me with that same kill-the-darkie look on their faces. Shit, there was even a guy on the kareoke machine with a microphone in his hand, the words and music scrolling off behind him, staring at me.

...Fuck me. im going to die

I took out a five pound note, put it on the bar and backed very slowly out of the door. My buddy met me outside with a grin on his face. He was very very surprised that they didnt collectively have a boot party on my face.

TLDR: Nearly killed in a skinhead pub, should have pissed in the carpark

&gt;Your career is effectively over and any relationship with family and friends will be seriously strained.

Maybe - I wouldn't necessary think that though. I used to know a guy who killed someone when driving. While things where difficult for him he worked it out eventually.

Im lucky enough to work for myself ;) Glad I don't have to put up with that.

Its interesting - I have over the years noticed that when someone is anti cyclist its almost as if we are thought of as a different sub species of humans -  We are not regarded as normal people who just choose to use a bike and not a car.

What action do you think resulted in the most deaths in the second world war? The bombing of hiroshima or nagasaki? Nope, the firebombing of Tokyo killed more. What about the RAF's firebombing of Dresden?

The reason that the powers that be are up in arms about chemical weapons is nothing to do with an idea of laws of war. It's about the fact that all modern war is asymmetric. You have extremely technologically advanced drones, planes and misisles taking on guys in Toyota hiluxes with RPGs or soviet era tanks and planes. Chemical weapons change that asymmetry not because they kill people locally but because once you permit chemical weapons to become part of standard issue weaponry for the weaker side they can take these weapons to civilian areas in their enemy's territory and use them. Chemical weapons can be produced by Syrians for deployment in Israel, the UK, the US, France and used against people there, and that's what scares the politicians.

Going into Syria will make the Iraq insurgency look like a polite tea party. There are *no* good guys in this conflict.

You admit that regardless of how precise these weapons are, the chances are that civilians WILL die, and that most definitely a number of military personell will be killed or are you wilfully blind to the fact that we're about to launch missile strikes on sites across an entire country when actually chemical weapons have only been used in one area.

Surely the appropriate response as ""punishment"" if that is what this is, would be to just attack the area that was being fought over. At least then youd be getting the people who likely had a hand in the attack. (Not that we know for definite who they are at all) Instead we're about to come down decisively on the side of the Rebels, who have support from Al Qaeda. 

I personally do care about the people of Syria, really I do. I dont do the entire ""oh its far away its not our country who cares thing"" but is a series of missile strikes the correct response to a chemical weapons attack. in my opinion no. Youre going to end up killing people who had nothing to do with the attack, military or otherwise. Essentially youre ""Punishing Assad by killing his men"" which sounds alright on paper, but if youre a random Syrian Infantryman, who is in no way affiliated with the chemical attacks, youve just been condemned to death at the hands of a foreign force wholly irrelevant to your countries decision, for a decision made by Assad, or even some other commander who just found some chemical weapons and used them.

The government has a working majority of 77 which means that even with the 30 Conservative MP's and the 14 Lib Dem MP's who voted against, they still should have won the vote by 33 votes. 

There were 31 Conservative MP's who either abstained (walked through both lobbys) or who didn't show up, so poor whipping by the PCP. That could also be that some of them had indicated in advance that they would vote against and so were told to stay away.

The fact is votes in Parliament are a numbers game. Labour had only 220 our of their 257 MP's who voted against the government.

Cameron's defeat was only made possible by the fact that he couldn't get 60 of his own MP's out, maybe because he hadn't convinced them enough.

true,dangercart,lfc68,,"Everyone probably knows that American's love sports statistics but, even though football isn't particularly conducive to advanced stats, the concepts used in sports like baseball are still valuable. One of my favorite things is the attempt to derive a dollar value for players based on a baseline statistic. This is interesting because it opens up the following argument: How much more valuable is a ""4 win"" player than a ""2 win"" player if you have a finite number of players and a fixed budget? There are a lot of people who believe that they're twice as valuable and a team should spend twice as much to get them. However, there are a lot of other people who say, no, you can only play so many people at once so a ""4 win"" player is much more than twice as valuable because you can still fill the remaining spot on the field with another good player. The ""4 win"" player has opportunity value. There are actually very good studies supporting both ideas.

I'm in the second camp and that's why I'm happy we kept Suarez (actually I'm not really happy because I don't really like rooting for him but from a purely on-field perspective I am). Let's say we sold Luis to Madrid for £60M and re-invested all of it. We buy a £15M CB, a £10M LB a £25M AMF/LW and a £10 young CM. We can't use 14 players at once so we can't bring all that talent to bear by just removing Suarez. In any given game you have to also push Kolo and Enrique (and maybe Alberto off the bench) out and, while you may not think those are world beaters, they are Premier League players with value. You then cascade all the players behind them down a spot and get a certain amount of value in all those upgrades that's less than the ""in a vacuum"" value of the players you bought.

I don't think that those upgrades are going to make up for the downgrade of Suarez to, say, Erik Lamela. I like what I know of Lamela but he's not a sure thing. Highly rated players switch leagues and struggle all the time, especially when they're young. If he turns into a new Bale for Spurs then obviously they make out great but Bale is already Bale and Suarez is already Suarez. Aside from injury and suspension there's no risk in the price of their performance. I think the biggest jump between players is from ""very good"" to ""great."" There are lots of ""very good"" midfielders but their impact on the sport pales in comparison to Gerrard's. There's one ball and 90 minutes and a great player like Suarez does more with that than two very good players on most days.

The ability to organise a defence, knowing when to come for a cross and when to stay, how to position yourself so that you don't need to make the eye-catching save... These are far more important. If your all-round play can stop the danger before it happens then the ball has no chance of going in... A poor keeper can't do this and has to rely on fast reactions or something - a much higher chance of conceding.

Look at Hull's Alan McGregor, if reflexes were the no. 1 trait he'd be playing for a top 4 club. Except there are some gaping holes in his game, so he'll stay where he is.

Think of it like Paolo Maldini's approach to defending, he rarely needed to sprint because he was always so well positioned. A truly great goalkeeper can stop all the danger through flawless positioning and decision-making, and has the reflexes to back him up when all else fails.

Looking at it like this, Van Der Sar was Paolo Maldini or Sami Hyypia, while keepers like Given are the equivalent of Jose Enrique - absolute shite in terms of positioning or reading the game, but fast as anything and amazingly strong to compensate for when his positioning lets him down.

It's no coincidence that keepers like VDS who use their heads have a much better shelf life than those who rely on fast reactions.",0,1377862706,null,0,1377870311,0,cbybsix,t3_1lcxmm,t1_cbybsix,t1_cby2gtq,null,1429648724,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

The rebels aren't exactly the epitome of humanitarian practices at the moment, and even if we retalliate against Assad and help in toppling him, there's no guarantee that a Muslim extremist government won't just take power (e.g. Al-Nusra).

I guess what people are worried about is spending millions if not billions of pounds in public funds and potentially putting our service men and women in danger when we don't actually know if it will make anything better.

Look how overrun our midfield, with the exception of Gerrard, was against Villa.

When the tide is going against us Lucas, Allen even Henderson seem to go missing.  Henderson is improving all the time in fairness. 

These players are great when we are in control of a game or even when its 50-50. They can't handle the pressure when the tempo raises against us.....losing possession repeatedly, putting the defence under pressure again and again.

I know Lucas is a fan favourite and on his day looks really good but he does go missing, like against Villa, too often for my liking.

I hope this isn't an area BR is blind to, like Arsene and his defensive blindspot, as I think people miss how much an improvement in big games would be had from buying a better deep lying midfielder.

If you went to a Japanese restaurant, and you ordered Japanese food and it turns out to be done in a Chinese style, you'd be a bit disappointed right?

It's happened to me plenty of times. The preparation and the taste of the food gets lost in translation.

So I don't see anything wrong with advertising the fact that the food is cooked by someone local who was born and bred locally and who understand exactly how the local food should taste.

It's like having a Japanese restaurant advertise that they have a Japanese chef, from Japan, cooking the food. It's not racist against all other non-Japanese people to advertise that.

Bale is a professional footballer who makes more in a week than most people make in a year to show up for practice and play a game.  He signed a contract last year and he is currently not fulfilling his end of the agreement. 

The author is correct, Suarez would be getting ripped by fans and media alike if he were behaving this way but Bale is getting a pass for behavior that would get most workers fired.  The worst is that we all panned Modric last year when he went on strike but Bale is doing the same thing and nobody is taking notice.

The problem with this old wives tale of bipedal laundry organisation is that if it holds true, there would be a cache of odd dirty socks on the bedroom floor waiting to be found at some point.  If found these could then be added to the collection of previously un-paired socks - thus solving the problem.  

The issue I take with this theory is that I never find odd socks lying around outside the laundry basket leading me to the conclusion that whatever happens to them, it happens between the laundry basket and going into the draw.

The washing machine, dryer and the sock draw are closed systems so this only leaves the washing basket as the culprit.

I believe that what happens here operates at a quantum level - Once in a washing basket, a sock can exist in at least two places at once.  Our perceivable reality and *somewhere* else.  By observing a pair of socks in a washing basket, one of them instantly changes state and disappears to the *other* reality.  I guess if we were to wait for an infinite amount of time, at some point both socks would coexist in the same reality at the same time again.

1) The Mesmerist. I really dislike this place, the music's unnecessarily loud, even in the early evening, and the door staff operate a policy of no large groups of guys (fucked a mate's work do there) and the doormen go out of their way to make sure that women get in but not men, creating a really weird atmosphere of it being a meat market. Really wouldn't recommend the place.

2) The Fishbowl, with it being one of the only places still open at like 4am, attracts a pretty shitty crowd. Last time a friend was there, about a week ago, he was asked if he was gay and then told he shouldn't have ever been born.


And to add a couple of my own recommendations.

Craft Beer Co. on Upper North Street has one of the best (if not the best) beer selections in Brighton. The prices range from normal for Brighton (£3 or so a pint), up to ridiculous (one of my favourites there is £6.50 a half pint, but so very worth it). Good place to go if you like beer. Also usually a good crowd there. Same goes for The Evening Star. Great beer selection, but the clientele tend to be beardy ale drinkers.

Seconding the recommendation for the Hobgoblin specifically for Troll's Pantry. I don't like the pub all that much, too student-y for me, but the burgers are amongst the best you will ever eat, certainly among the top 5 in the UK. Expect to pay a pretty high price for one, but believe me, they're so very worth it.

And finally. Really, really, really, really seriously stay the fuck away from West St. Don't even walk past the place, same with most of the places on the seafront.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"Where I worked in Sydney, I used to choose between three different fish and chip shops. One was run by Greeks, one by Chinese, the other by Japanese/Korean.

Each one had a *very* different cooking style and quality. The Chinese was the cheapest (price and quality), the Greek was the most authentic Australian-style burgers, chips and chicken. (*source: I'm a 40yr old natural-born Australian*)  but that could be because the Greeks have been running these shops for a LONG time and Australia has a large Greek population.

The Japanese/Korean place would create the burgers in an immaculate style, very carefully putting the pieces together and serving you with the utmost respect and honour. They even offered [bulgogi beef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgogi) burgers alongside plain beef burgers. They cost the most, but the experience was worth it. The food was never quite authentic though. I wouldn't tell anyone that it was ""traditional Australian fish and chips"".

EDIT: have to mention the Chinese run place again. They gave amazing service. They were a husband/wife team, aged in late 40s.

Its not like the act of driving or killing someone is a freak accident every time.

* 11/12 - 10.050
* 12/13 - 19.285
* **total: 69.592**

All previous 5 years performances are weighted equally. Looks like we'll be hanging onto the 3.585 for another year yet.

Juventus were the lowest ranked club in Pot 2 for the Champion's League, with an overall score of 70.829. For argument's sake, say this is our goal if we want to be in Pot 2. We're currently 1.237 from that, with 12.000 to drop from our score by the start of the 14/15 season.

We require 13.237 to reach our goal. The UEFA Europa League points system gives 2 points for a win within the group stage, and 1 for a draw. There is also a guarantee of 2 points for reaching the group stage. An additional point is awarded for reaching the advanced stages of the competition.

I would argue, for simplicity, 5 wins in the Europa League competition for us, in total, would give us an overall score over 70.829 --- *as there's also a ""20% of the association coefficient over the last 5 year period"" to be added, which, coming from the FA, is pretty sweet*

Masons, when they start upon a building,
Are careful to test out the scaffolding;

Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points,
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.

And yet all this comes down when the job’s done
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.

So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be
Old bridges breaking between you and me

Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall
Confident that we have built our wall.

    You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet

    Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger
    Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots
    Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.

    We trekked and picked until the cans were full
    Until the tinkling bottom had been covered
    With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned
    Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered
    With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.
    We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.
    But when the bath was filled we found a fur,
    A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.
    The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush
    The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.

true,pandanomic,num23,,"If you had placed a bet at the start of the summer on whose conduct would be the most reprehensible during this transfer window, it is unlikely that you would have staked heavily on Gareth Bale. As annoying as his trademarked heart-finger celebration can be, as dubious as his unassisted plummets to the earth sometimes were, he never seemed the sort to invoke the grisly image of the surly modern footballer. But there he was this week, sauntering into his agent's office, clad in a skin-tight pink T-shirt with a matching pink hat, looking for all the world like a sausage, when he should have been at work. 

- Report: Spurs consider Gareth Bale fine 
- Report: Calderon critical of Bale pursuit 

Let's not beat around the bush: Bale has gone on strike. Andre Villas-Boas said on Sunday that the Welshman was expected in for training on Tuesday, but he never arrived. There have been suggestions that Bale will be fined two weeks' wages for his unauthorised absence. Can you even begin to imagine the intensity of the media storm if this was Luis Suarez or Wayne Rooney? 

Even Suarez, the toerag's toerag, has continued to turn up for training sessions. Doubtless his machinations continue in the background, but he is at least fulfilling the terms of the contract that his agent apparently failed to read properly last summer. Rooney, unrestrained by suspensions incurred for mid-game snacking, has gone one stage further and has actually played for the team that he is -- or perhaps was -- so desperate to leave. Not only that, but he played with such dogged intensity that he dropped an elbow on John Terry, his potential future captain. That could have been awkward. 

This isn't to absolve Suarez and Rooney of any blame, or to pretend that they have acted honourably. They both signed lucrative long-term deals and then assumed that a hissy fit would be enough to break them. They have both unsettled their own teams; Rooney choosing to make his selfish break for freedom when Manchester United were as vulnerable and unsettled as they have been in over 20 years. But at least they're still turning up for work. 

Bale will doubtless release a statement in due course praising Tottenham and their supporters, telling them that they will always have a special place in his heart-fingers, simpering and fawning, maybe even hinting at a return to White Hart Lane one day. If the Spurs fans have any sense, they'll just roll their eyes. 

As Starship Troopers' Ace Levy (presumably no relation to Daniel) so sagely noted, ""Ain't it great how they always want to be your friend right after they rip your guts out?"" 

Bale has turned over his club for his own gain, throwing his toys out of the pram until he got his own way. That doesn't make him any different from the majority of modern footballers, but it does mean that he relinquishes the right to leave the room smelling of roses. 

The irony is that Tottenham, who could easily have capsized without their star player, now look, if anything, slightly stronger than last year. Indeed, they may enjoy a more successful future than their soon-to-be former employee. Having learned important lessons from January's failure to land a new striker and the drawn-out Dimitar Berbatov saga of 2008, Daniel Levy has played a blinder. Players like Erik Lamela and, perhaps, Christian Eriksen offer game-changing stardust; Paulinho and Etienne Capoue own the midfield; Roberto Soldado is so cool in front of goal that he must have veins filled with liquid nitrogen. No one can replace Bale, but the team, on the whole, is better for his price tag than it was for his presence. 

By contrast, Bale doesn't seem like a solid bet for success in Spain. He's an excellent player, of course. We didn't just imagine his astonishing performances last season. But does he really have the kind of personality capable of embracing life in a new country? 

The British are notoriously poor settlers abroad. Steve McManaman was a rare exception, assimilating himself into Spanish culture soon after joining Real Madrid, learning the language, socialising with team-mates and making a life for himself in the city. Michael Owen skulked in his hotel, driving to the airport for English newspapers every day because he didn't realise they sold them on a newsstand on the other side of the road. 

Bale is, it seems, a homebody. He divides his time between London and Wales, rushing back at every opportunity to see his girlfriend and his family. He's shy, once asking if his awards-dinner speech could be converted to a far easier question-and-answer session. He is about to join the biggest club in the world, a dressing room full of powerful egos. 

Let's hope that he's absolutely ready for this next challenge. Otherwise, he may soon have cause to regret the way he has treated Tottenham and their supporters. ",0,1377872291,null,0,false,0,cbye0x6,t3_1ldrqv,t1_cbye0x6,t1_cbydjzz,null,1429647681,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I've had help from my parents at various stages - as a student, when I was unemployed, when work screwed up and didn't pay me the month when I went from a temporary contract to a permanent one, and when all the service, MOT, tax and insurance payments on my car came in all at once over last month and this month (I currently owe Dad £1,000+ for all that, but it'll be paid off by Christmas). But I'd never just *expect* a whole load of money like that kid in the article.

That 18 year old is a disgrace.

Though his mum was partly at fault for paying for everything he wanted and giving him an allowance on top of that without requiring chores. I didn't get my pocket money until I'd done my chores by the time I was in secondary school. Chores meant:

* Launder bedding  
* Vacuum bedroom and bathroom  
* Clean loo and sink in toilet room next to my bedroom (brother got the downstairs loo, sister got the bathroom)  
* Do homework  
* Tidy bedroom  

No chores, no pocket money.

Parents paid for clothes, food, the occasional book (if we couldn't get it at the library) and occasional gifts, and the Dandy every week (later I started reading one of those teenage girl magazines instead and they paid for that).

So, I say no, you did (which is true), and instead of admitting your mistake, you move the goalposts to this:

&gt;You first mentioned the Geneva Protocol.

Yes, I did.  I just pointed that out, moron.  In response to you saying that that international law doesn't apply because they hadn't ratified anything, I pointed out that they HAD ratified the Geneva PROTOCOL (see that word again) in the 1960s.

I then stated that the problem wasn't one of whether they had ratified international agreements, but whether it applied to civil war, as opposed to international war.

Bizarrely, you then repeated exactly the same point back at me, as if you'd just thought of it.  You seemed to think you were correcting what I'd just said, by saying THE SAME FUCKING THING.  How can I be wrong if you're agreeing with me?

Round my way (less than 10 miles from this guy actually), a lot of the local chippies are part of a Chinese takeaway. The chips do sometimes have a hint of chinese spice/seasoning to them. Personally, I like it - but theres definitely a distinction. But a full on ""traditional chippy"" that doesn't sell chinese food, or isn't a ""general"" takeaway (pizza, kebabs, using frozen chips etc) is actually pretty rare here.

&gt;Phone, nope

I had access to a BT landline for up to five minutes a day, just about enough time to call my mates and arrange to meet somewhere.

&gt;Clothes, yeah but basics

Yup, trainers and jeans from the market, school coat (Parka) from the Army/Navy surplus and hand knitted school jumpers.

&gt;Computer games, maybe atari stuff from decades ago. Eventually playstaion from car boot.

I was given a Commodore 64 for my 13th birthday, games had to be paid for out of paper round money.

&gt;Private sports club, fuck no never a chance in hell.

This was called 'bugger off down the 'rec if you want to play football'. 

&gt;Taxis, nope.

'We didn't buy you a bike so you could get lifts and taxis everywhere.'

&gt;Meals, very very very rarely

Apart from Fish and Chips at the beach, I didn't have a takeaway until I was 19. 

I was given 50p pocket money a week (not bad for the 70's when you could still by penny and ha'penny sweets) until I hit 13.  Then I was expected to go and get a paper round if I wanted money for spending. My parent's would double whatever I earned.  Getting up at 5am to earn £2.00 a week really makes you appreciate the value of things.  Even more so when it's hailing or snowing.  If I wanted extra there were always dogs that needed walking, or washing up the needed doing, or cars that needed cleaning or the oil changing on.  By the time I was 16/17 I was working in the local Co-Op stacking shelves to pay for half my driving lessons and by the time I started college I was earning enough part time to by my own 125cc motorbike.

For my 18th I was given £100 combined from all my relatives, was expected to call or write to them and say 'thank you' rather than 'where's the rest you thieving cunts?'.

I studied computer science for a couple of years and dropped out, mainly because there wasn't any particular incentive to carry on, there just wasn't enough practical work. It was basically 90% theory and 10% actual coding. Universities should have partnerships with businesses so that students can gain work experience from day one of their degree. The NHS as far as I know is the only business that has worked with a few universities to get students working, through the Practitioner Training Program. You spend 3 years working in a real lab along side your degree scheme.

Although University isn't all that bad, life experience is just as valuable when gaining a job. At least with uni I was given financial support to move out of home, and start being responsible with money, paying bills, maintaining relationships with people you meat on a daily basis. With an apprenticeship you're not paid enough to move out and start a new life, so you're practically stuck living out of mum and dad's pocket for the same amount of time. Which brings on another problem, you tend to get people who can't afford make drastic changes to their life. Some people who are in their late 30s being stuck working a minimum wage job, just can't get the financial security to pay their bills to learn a new skill, or go to a technical college. I think government should be investing more into adult education and make it easier for people to transition.

Completely agree. Even if Kolo makes a quick return from injury, the risk is still always there (he has a history with that same area IIRC).  I love Kolo, but i really think we are asking for trouble to rely on him for an entire season (even avoiding major injuries, getting over the day-to-day knocks and tweaks is tough at that age).  I do not think Skrtel is up to the task in our current system (even taking the glass-half-full perspective on him i still would never risk it with the performances he put in last season) and our other options all have too many additional question marks associated with them (Kelly - fitness, injuries as well, and if he is ready for the position; Wisdom - not ready at all).

I am not sure if this is slightly overpriced, but i really think we need this move regardless (or a move for any solid, first-team capable defender, but this seems the best/only option for that at this time).

true,tremens,flair3,,"Expectations? Well, that's difficult to say. 

We've essentially torn our team down and rebuilt it from the ground up with younger, fresher, more talented people. My morale from this is *huge*. I'm looking at this squad, and I'm thinking ""This is a CL team. This is a top 4, *minimum*, team."" We've got depth for days to cover injuries or necessary injections depending on the game.

*However*, all these guys we're bringing in have very little experience in the PL. And many of them are only just blossoming or are expected to blow up very shortly. They're under pressure. Working with a team they don't know, a manager they don't know, in a league they don't know. That's asking a lot, regardless of how good they are.

At the same time, we're investing hugely in our youth, a new stadium, new training grounds. It appears as though we're not just shaking things up on the current league, we're preparing to cultivate from within and really expose the gems we may have sitting under our noses.

So, all in all, what are my expectations of this season? Well, our defense is *monstrous* right now. Watching the Palace and Swansea games you could see that we were already dominating the pitch. Better, in the Swansea game you could see that we were actually opening things up rather well, creating opportunity (though we didn't exactly finish it.) What was also visible was a lack of cohesion; you could see players hesitating, looking around, stalling, to make sure people were where they expected them to be, that things were opening up the way we wanted, etc, and I think that's where we were lacking performance - that fast, instinctual play. That comes with time, and the good news is I see us as having the defensive capability to actually give us that time. As long as we concede nothing, the front guys have time to ""get it together"" and learn each other. Then the goals will start to come.

The question, in my mind, is how long that will take. I'd be surprised if it happens very quickly, which will cost us precious points early on in the season. I'd say we will almost certainly finish top 5. I *think* we will make top 4 (and a lot of this investment will be banking on that, for the CL prestige.) And since we've chosen to take it seriously, I think our chances are very, very, very good at a Europa League trophy, which is certainly nice to have.

*If* we make CL, then I'd say the real victory will not be this season. It will be *next* season. When all of this has come together, when we can have pick of the litter for whatever we need. That's going to be the real indicator of whether this massive transfer gamble has payed off.

Keep in mind you're *not* the only person facing this situation. You're really not.

Times really are tough and whilst you might be tempted to think there's something wrong with *you*, it's not that. You're trying.

So don't do that. Keep trying. Pace yourself, mix it up a little (don't just sit on Jobsite sending out application) but think about other avenues of finding work. If you're currently in need of *any* work and not something specific then make sure you cover all the bases. Go door-to-door in retail places and supermarkets - it might be unpleasant *but* it's better than nothing and will keep you floating where others have nothing.

I think we can go far in the different Cups (baring any unforeseen major upsets) and at least top 4 in the league.  I don't think we'll win because it's going to take some time for the team to gel (which makes me nervous about Sunday -- Away to Arsenal is a tough tough match and if the worst should happen, Arsenal fans will be all over us saying how we spent and failed).  With that said, if we can continue to pull off scrappy wins until our team gels, then maybe something miraculous will happen.  

It does feel weird to be doing what we are doing.  I hate Chelsea's (no offense -- wait, full offense!  I hate you and your kind!  Lol.) and City's methods of transfer cause they just toss as much money around as possible (Willian is a great example -- and no, I'm not bitter, I didn't want him.  I'm much more excited about someone like Eriksen).  But now, Spurs are doing it (albeit from different monetary sources).  A Liverpool fan in /r/soccer said something buying ourselves a CL spot and it actually made me feel a little bad.  But, we needed this.  We now have depth.  We have quality players that need to fight for their starting spots by contributing game winning performances and if should someone fail at that or get injured, we have their backup ready to go with no loss in quality.  That's a championship winning mentality and its really really exciting to be apart of.

This season could be a massive flop.  We could fail worse than QPR.  But I really don't feel it happening.  We didn't bring in mercenaries looking for a paycheck.  We brought people in who seem like they want to be here and do great things.

Finally, as for Sunday, I hope we destroy them, if only to at least make all the Arsenal people in /r/soccer STFU.

EDIT:
I want to add that I am also sick and tired of hearing about how players only want CL and to play for big teams.  Spurs have managed to get top players (esp w/ Eriksen being a possibility) without the lure of CL/Big Team.  This is a huge win for football in general.  If all players went only to Chelsea/City/United/Arsenal/RM/Barca/Bayern, etc then the CL would have the same teams which then creates an even bigger positive feedback loop because of the CL money teams get.

You didn't manage to find any 'colossal holes' or to 'discredit the whole thing', you've just downplayed the extent to which, in your opinion, the bedroom tax was a factor in his actions.

His own statement was ""I got a letter from the council last week and I have stayed inside for 10 days worrying about it. It told me I owed a lot of money and that my rent was going up £28 a fortnight because I had an empty room in my flat. I didn’t know what to do""

**The Early Purges**

I was six when I first saw kittens drown.

Dan Taggart pitched them, 'the scraggy wee shits',

Into a bucket; a frail metal sound,

Soft paws scraping like mad. But their tiny din

Was soon soused. They were slung on the snout 

Of the pump and the water pumped in.

'Sure, isn't it better for them now?' Dan said.

Like wet gloves they bobbed and shone till he sluiced

Them out on the dunghill, glossy and dead.

Suddenly frightened, for days I sadly hung

Round the yard, watching the three sogged remains

Turn mealy and crisp as old summer dung

Until I forgot them. But the fear came back

When Dan trapped big rats, snared rabbits, shot crows

Or, with a sickening tug, pulled old hens' necks.

Still, living displaces false sentiments

And now, when shrill pups are prodded to drown

I just shrug, 'Bloody pups'. It makes sense:

'Prevention of cruelty' talk cuts ice in town

Where they consider death unnatural

But on well-run farms pests have to be kept down.

true,himit,null,null,"Ahahaha.  Last time I went to Brisbane, all of the Japanese places popular with white people were run by Koreans and the food was...umm...not Japanese.  But they went to great lengths to disguise the fact that they weren't Japanese - they had calligraphy on the walls (albeit calligraphy printed out from Microsoft Word), they wore all the clothes and had generally correct Japanese on their menus.  I didn't realise the ruse until I asked a question in Japanese and got blank stares and an embarrassed 'Uh, not Japanese.'

Actually, at one place the food was pretty tasty, and the noodles tasted right (though they're not the hardest noodles to make in the world).  The other places were gross - even the more Korean offerings were grotty.

There's a whole host of non-authentic restaurants though - wagamama's a huge one - and a lot of it's a bit bizarre.  I never understand why you can only get good teriyaki and yakisoba in Japanese-run places - teriyaki is ridiculously easy (soy:mirin:sugar 2:2:1) and the yakisoba sauce is literally just worcester sauce.  Whatever everyone else tries to make with shitloads of soy is just wrong.

If Syria can use chemical weapons and all they need is a rumour it was the rebels to stop action then I think they'd use them.

I'm not sure if you think I support military action, because I don't. I do agree with your latest post that it's a little more of a reason. It also doesn't matter if rebels are using sarin gas too, that wouldn't be reason not to call strikes on Syria. The strikes would be done to ensure Syria had good reason not to risk using chemical weapons again.

Ultimately we will never be able to be sure of anything. At a certain point we can be sure beyond all doubt.

My considered opinion is that the vote should have been a yes last night as it did not give the go ahead for military action, a further vote would have been needed. 

&gt;The UK government's motion was in support of military action in Syria if it was backed up by evidence from United Nations weapons inspectors, who are investigating the attack.

Many of the MPs who voted no seemed to agree with the motion but didn't want to get any closer to military action. I can kind of understand that though. However if it does turn out Assad has used chemical weapons and there is another vote then I'd expect it to be in favour.

The Syrian rebels broadly speaking comprise of two groups. The FSA and the Foreign fighters who are in it for religio-ideological reasons.

Dealing with the claim of the rebels having the scale and capability to engage in chemical weapons attack of over 4000 injuries, the suggestion that Saudis are primarily funding and supporting the foreign fighters? Well I've seen claims on all sides about who or what is supporting them and it's a huge grey area. I would hate to say. But for the sake of the article and the allegations lets say they are. 

Do you really think the Saudis would give the foreign fighters access to chemical weapons considering the likelihood of the same fighters then trying to siphon off some of the weapons for their own use, say, maybe sticking it to Israel per chance? That is a genie no one wants to let out of the bottle. We can all imagine what the response would be like. This is dangerous conjecture to say the least.

true,cybokinetic,null,null,"GG: God[?] Mr Speaker for the erudition and historical memory of the last three speeches, almost entirely absent in the Prime Minister's initial address. He was clearly making a speech which was not the one he intended to make here this afternoon, otherwise he would not have persuaded you at vast public expense to recall the House of Commons to decide that we're actually going to decide on this matter next week or the week after when we're back here in any case. It's absolutely evident that if it were not for the democratic revolt that has been underway in this House of Commons and outside in the wider public against this war, that the engines in Cyprus would now be revving and the cruise missiles ready to fly this very weekend and any attempt by the Prime Minister to pretend that he had always, all along, intended on this course of action is just [bunkum]. And the reason for the unease here on both sides of the house, two exceptional speeches from the last speaker and the member from New Forest East encompass the feelings of the people in the country. Only 11% of the public according to The Daily Telegraph, this morning, support Britain becoming involved in a war in Syria. Can ever a British government have imagined sending its men and women to war with the support of just 11% in public opinion? First, that there is no compelling evidence, to use the leader of the opposition's words, that 'the Assad regime is responsible for this crime', Yet.. Not that they're not bad enough to do it Mr Speaker, everybody knows they're bad enough to do it, the question is are they mad enough to do it? To launch a chemical weapons attack in Damascus on the very day that a United Nations chemical weapons inspection team arrives in Damascus must be a new definition of madness. And of course, if he is that mad, how mad's he going to be once we launch a blizzard of tomahawk cruise missiles upon his country? Now, as I heard the front benches describe how bad he was, I wondered just why the former Prime Minister forced her majesty to billet him in her guest room at Buckingham Palace just a few years ago, and how a former Prime Minister recommended him for an honour and how he was hailed in all corners as a moderniser. But of course, the narrative has changed because the government is intent on regime change in Damascus. Which brings me to the only other point I'm going to be able to make in the time available. The reason for the unease is that people can see the character of the Syrian opposition. They have seen the videos, we've heard about horrific videos. Take a look at the video of one of the commanders of the Syrian revolution cutting open the chest of a human being and eating his heart &amp; liver and video taping himself and putting it up on YouTube because he thought it might be considered attractive. Take a look at the videos of christian priests having their heads sawn off, not chopped off, sawn off with bread knives. Even a bishop in the christian church was murdered by these people. Every religious minority in Syria, and there are 23 of those, is petrified at the victory of the Syrian rebels that the British Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have been doing their upmost to supply with weapons and money these last two years and they cannot deny it. They say it's now about this crime, whoever committed it but it's been the government's policy for two years to bring about the defeat of the regime in Damascus and the victory of the kind of people responsible for these crimes. I have 20 seconds left..

Well then give way[?]

Willingly.

If only for another 60 seconds, remember the Honourable Member made reference, but let's remember where those arms have come from over decades, from this country's supply to Syria.

Indeed. Indeed, I have now 60 seconds at my disposal so let me make this point more clearly. When did Russia &amp; China, 2.5 billion people, cease to be members of the international community? Who are you on the other side to decide what the international community thinks/should do? If you are unable to persuade the security counsel to go along with your point of view, who are you to decide you will launch a war in any case? The.. You see I keep hearing about the unreasonable use of the veto, i've heard that many times over the last few years in this House. The Unites States has vetoed every attempt to obtain justice for the Palestinian people and to punish and issue retribution for international lawbreaking for the part of Israel and nobody in this House has said one word about it. Yes i'll give way.

Very grateful for the Honourable Member for giving way to me. Mr Speaker, I think you will be very interested to know that I have had several constituents email me about comments made by the Honourable Member for Bradford West on the Iranian Press TV. In which, my constituent claims that the Honourable Member said that Israel supplied the chemicals for the attacks in Syria. I would find that very hard to believe that the Honourable Member said that so would he like to take this opportunity to refute that or provide the evidence to satisfy my constituent? 

Well, it just shows the unreliability of relying upon green ink, letters, whether they come in the post or emails, for I said no such thing. But the Syrian rebels definitely had sarin gas, because they were caught with it by the Turkish government, as was referred to by the former government minister opposite, if you forgive me I forget his constituency. The truth is this, I know mine, it's where I gave you such a bloody good hiding just over a year ago. The Syrian rebels have plenty of access to sarin. It's not rocket science, Mr Speaker, a group of Shinto obscurantists in Japan living on Mount Fuji poisoned the Tokyo underground with sarin gas less than 20 years ago. You don't have to be Einstein to have your hands on sarin gas or the means to distribute it. Russia and China say no to war, so do I and most people in this country.

Without that mandate then it's a careful question... have we done all we can, and should we say that we cannot act against the will of the British people and the international community? That's one option. The other is limited air strikes. I'm not sure where I'd sit with either.

Recent cycling deaths that have been something of an eye opener have been this one http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-22397918 - currently under review due to appeal I believe.

these are fairly typical - and its become such an issue for cyclists particularly that there are various campaigns regarding it..

So do I believe we should throw away the key...No, but I firmly believe there is something apathy regarding deaths on the road, and by design or ignorance cyclists seem to be the ones at the crap end of the stick.

Also in some cases such as Myanmar, trade sanctions can do much to encourage the country to open up and enact reform.

One of the State Vets' issues with the RBCT (though they've several more big issues listed in the memo) was this assumption of equal weight to the 3 routes of infection, which seems a massive stretch from an outside point-of-view. 

(+)

They claim that several previous pieces of research have shown that in the absence of a wildlife reservoir, current technonolgy makes it reasonably easy to detect and remove infected cattle from a herd quickly enough that the outbreak dwindles away (the [basic reproduction number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) &lt; 1). Having a wildlife reservoir available to re-infect the herd makes this an impossible task to complete; even if transmission were rare, you'd still see an eventual breakdown. 

Further, they also put forwards several pieces of evidence to suggest that under the current testing regime, much of new bovine infection is directly badger-cattle - the peak in new cases (as cattle go out to grass), the clustering of different splogiotypes, the fact that the RBCT found no reactor cattle to be actively shedding bacteria at the time they were marked for culling, and the high rate that badgers have been measured to shed bacteria in their urine once their kidneys are involved in the disease (and more).

I'm sure we'll switch between the two formations at time, and both will perform well and receive plenty of playing time, but I do hope we can effectively nurture both of these talents to the best of their ability.

Don't take rejections personally. I was quite employable while I was looking for work and I still got too many rejections than I could count. Employers don't always understand or know what they're looking for, so just because you didn't get selected does not invalidate your capabilities as a person or an able bodied work force person. Employers and hiring managers can be dumb sometimes. 

Update your CV weekly. Check that everything still sounds like you, honest, and is still connected to you so that if you do land an interview, you'll know what they know. Keep it fresh and interesting. 

Try to look at unemployment not totally in the negative. I know being poor and having no income sucks. Like, really sucks. But you know what you have a lot of? Time. You have so much time, even though a lot of it is used for Job hunting and applications. Do things you enjoy. Play video games, write some short stories, pick up a new hobby, hang out in your local town at the free tourist things, be interested in the things that you read, have a lie in every now and then, go for walks... Having a job is obviously your goal, but man, working is a full time thing and it sucks being drained all the time and not having time for things you enjoy. 

If you can, with the above, use your spare time for something productive. Reddit has a university with dozens of free courses - go learn one!

He judges it as being 5th (including 5th!) down to 12th, meaning that even clubs who qualify for the Europa League through their league performance are midtable in his book. He also seems very offended about the suggestion that Liverpool are therefore also a midtable team. 

By his logic, the Chelsea of the late 90s/early 00s, by finishing consistently in the top 6 and winning several domestic and European cups, were a midtable team.

edit: he thinks that the Cup Winners' Cup was the European version of the Community Shield, this is tragic

The question is if he is worth 18M not if he is on his last year or whatever. Secondly this will make everything easy for us as there are many clubs who want him but won't pay this much to buy his contract of one year. I'm glad we are paying this as it would be comparable to what happened when United decided RvP was needed and had quality rather than think what Arsenal might gain from such a 'sweet' deal.

Sarin gas on the other hand is solely used to asphyxiate people; it's banned because of it's lethality which is orders of magnitude greater than the radioactivity of depleted uranium. 

Besides, there are two reasons why we are able to criticise and stop Syria. 

One, Syria is not breaking our national laws they are breaking international laws like the Geneva convention which they are subject to irrespective of us or what we do. Even if we were OK with Syria using banned weapons it would not matter because they are objectively unlawful. 

And two, your objection makes no logical sense - it is [a logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque).

The key part as I see it is: 
""Deplores the use of chemical weapons in Syria on 21 August 2013 by the Assad regime, which caused hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries of Syrian civilians;

Recalls the importance of upholding the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons under international law;

Agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action that is legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria’s chemical weapons.""

Which does effectively read as a very clever waying of covering both everything and nothing at the same time... effectively a free rein. It suggests that military action might take place, but isn't limited to just that. Having lost the war vote it's no longer a war vote, never was a war vote, etc.

&gt; an ex girlfriend and now close friend was sexually abused as a child. Not only that but she was raped in adulthood as well. 
 
Was she? *Really*? Raped twice? Come on that seems a bit much. How many people are raped twice in their lifetime? Sounds a bit fishy to me. Maybe she had sex with someone and then woke up and felt bad about it, and decided to drop someone in it.

When she was a kid though - How do you know she didn't go looking for it? Maybe it was someone she put on a pedestal, a bit of hero worship? Come on, just because she regretted it later that's no excuse to go crying wolf after she was told that it was a bit icky by some do-gooder looking to put someone away?

Obviously the above is sarcasm, but *do* let me know if you want me to make it any fucking clearer that this is a direct analogy to all the bullshit you put in your first comment.

I'm a prick apparently, but I'm not the one who feels the need to excuse a potential child rapist before the trial has even begun. You don't *have* to take a side, and really when it comes to your opinions do everyone a favour and shut the fuck up.

If you think that I should keep my opinion's to myself concerning your ex's personal story, hardship &amp; abuse, then perhaps consider that you've decided all about what allegedly happened around a growing number of celebs from decades past.

""SPEECH PREPARED BUT NOT DELIVERED ON THE SYRIA CONFLICT

I totally share the Prime Minister’s and Foreign Secretary’s disgust, shock and revulsion at the pictures of dead children and families. This is a truly criminal act by a ruthless dictator – illegal, immoral and intolerable.

For me, this brings back very vivid memories of when I was working for the Iraqi opposition groups in the mid 90s. We had all the material, photos, film, and survivor accounts from Halabja when at least 5,000 people died as an immediate result of the chemical attack and it is estimated that a further 7,000 people were injured or suffered long term illness.

The chemical attack is seared on the Kurdish peoples collective memory and similarly every citizen of Damascus will be haunted by the effects of this chemical attack on their friends and neighbours. I very much hope that at some point soon there will be a day of reckoning for Assad and his henchmen for these terrible crimes.

So having met survivors of Halabja I am pleased that we are debating the unacceptable use of chemical weapons. I believe that there is a lot more that we should be doing to address the proliferation and stockpiling of chemical weapons. This is an opportunity to be assertive.

If we are serious about chemical weapons we should use this global outrage to secure real action against chemical weapons. Let’s make it intolerable – by not tolerating it. We should exclude the 7 countries that have not signed up to the Chemical Weapons Convention from all international organizations – it must become a pre-cursor to UN membership; - and to all other intentional bodies from the WTO through to international football. Being a member of the human race must require compliance with this convention and if you do not comply then you should be excluded from all other international organisations. Let’s call the Chemical Weapons Convention the Damascus Convention – it would be a tribute to those who have died.

We can also, as reflected in this motion, step up our humanitarian ambitions. The UK is very well placed to broker the introduction of assertive humanitarianism to Syria and the region. Adopting a similar model to Operational Lifeline in Sudan - which created safe corridors across Southern Sudan during the conflict - we should be supporting NGOs through the Red Cross Movement to carve out larger ‘safe’ corridors across the conflict areas in Syria. We should challenge Russia, whose humanitarian sector is growing, to participate and to start using these safe havens, thereby building a common purpose around life saving and humanitarianism.
What I don’t believe we can do is achieve success through military means either as a deterrent or as a punishment by bombing Syria – for what purpose, with what outcome?

On the one hand if we are to teach Assad a lesson then it has to be a truly significant raid bombing a huge array of military, economic and political targets: airports, ports, major infrastructure. It has to be a game changer – “shock and awe”. But this would result in a lot of collateral damage – let’s be clear what this means: many innocent civilians will be killed! Shock and awe is about us getting involved in this war!

On the other hand if all we target is merely his command and control centres and a small number of selected locations, then I doubt it will make a difference to his thinking – for Assad this will be expected and already discounted. And because this isn’t a sophisticated war, taking out command and control sites is not going to be a game changer for a guerrilla, mainly urban based civil war.

So either we go in properly and comprehensively, something I would totally oppose or we dip in superficially – in my mind a pointless exercise.

Rather than a gung-ho “Call to Arms”, we need a call to ALMS - a fight for assertive humanitarian action in Syria. We must also ensure that there are clear deterrents to anyone not complying with the Convention. We can, and should, take a moral stand and it will be a tribute to those who lost their lives in Damascus if we campaign across the international community for a ban on membership of any international body for countries who do not comply with the convention. The Damascus Convention!""


I'm sure you're naturally wary of statements which weren't delivered during a debate being passed off as such, I know I am.


Also this exchange after the vote is relevent: 
Ed Miliband said: ""Can the prime minister confirm to the House that he will not use the Royal Prerogative to order the UK to be part of military action, given the will of the House that has been expressed tonight, before there has been another vote in this House of Commons?""

David Cameron replied: ""I can give that assurance. Let me say the House has not voted for either motion tonight. I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons.""

He added: ""It is clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action. I get that and the government will act accordingly.""",0,1377885379,null,0,1377885762,0,cbyip2v,t3_1lerbh,t1_cbyip2v,t1_cbyicpe,null,1429645431,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

So the easiest would be a sim which works on a monthly basis, basically you pay a certain amount, and get a certain amount of data/text/calls for that month. This would mean you don't have to pay for when you're back home. You will need to unlock your phone and i'm sure you already know where to do this in Oslo. If not, someone in a phone shop will charge £10-15 to do this for you.

[GiffGaff](http://giffgaff.com/) is very popular and gives you a varied choice, the £10 a month one looks good. You basically order a sim (you can do this right now) it comes to your door delivered, you create an account online and add your bank details in, and after that you have a working sim.

I loved growing up in NI, it was absolutely amazing. Always swore I'd go back until I moved to Scotland and fell in love with it. Scotland and NI are pretty similar, both in terms of people and landscape.

I spent a lot of time when I was younger visiting family in England. I can always tell when I'm in England. It just doesn't really feel the same. The landscape is different.

Warning: Rant Ahead.

I blame the entirety of this fiasco directly on Cameron. He has proved himself to be dangerously incompetent. He promised his allies military action. He vocally, publicy demanded that Assad face retribution. He pledged to his allies that Britain would be utilitize its military alongside its allies to punish Assad for an undoubted war crime.

He forgot to mention one thing. There would be a teeny, tiny obstacle. He would let Parliament have its say first. He was shot down. There can only be two reasons for this, none of these very becoming for the Prime Minister of Britain:

1) He is so hopelessly out of touch with his own citizens, and the members of Parliment that he failed to anticipate the results.

2) This was blatant political posturing aimed at humiliating Cameron at an international level.

Eitherway, Cameron made a promise to his allies he couldn't follow through with. But that moron had pledged his support already. The ships have already set sail. They are moving into position as we speak, and at the moment of truth, one of the most important wheels falls completely off. But the war machine has been started. It will be difficult to stop now without the US and France facing total humiliation. This is a disaster. It destroys all credibility any military action will have. It removes any pretext of cohesion behind military action. It makes the West look completely incoherent. What's worse, is now Britain is *still* advocating military intervention, *after* it has decided to remove itself from such action. Absolutely pathetic.

If Britain is against such action, they should now be vocally against it. But that is not the case. Cameron was still running his stupid mouth about the necessity of using force against Assad after his decisive defeat in Parliment. The message to the rest of the world is clear:

Cameron is not to be trusted. Cameron cannot deliver on his promises. Furthermore, he will leave you high and dry at the darkest hour, the moment where Britain's presence, even if just for legitimacy purposes, is needed most.

I actually applaud his decision to let Parliment have its say. They clearly are against action, as are the citizens of of Britain. But Cameron *should not* have banged the war drums so confidently if he couldn't deliver. He has now been nuetered by his own people. All faith in the British PM is now gone. How any head of state could trust anything that man says when he is so clearly out of touch is beyond me. Cameron cannot be depended on. That is the message that will be broadcast to the rest of the world. What an absolutee fucking fiasco.

my thought are this....and it doesn't make him look good.  when he bit Ivanovich it was the 2nd time he'd done it in a professional match.   which means either 2 things happened before he bit him:

1....he thought about it, and thought it was not a good idea and went ahead with the bite anyway.
or 2.....he thought about it and thought is was a good idea.  
i guess 3 is he didn't think about it at all...and just instinctively bit him.  lol

* Great quickness, amazing balance
* Has that ""touch of separation"" from a defender that provides space for a pass or shot (one of the most important skills or traits, in my opinion, for an attacking player)
* Killer left foot that can score from anyone (sound familiar)
* In an attacking role with Roma, a lot of his goals he scored last year were of the poacher's variety.  

I think it's safe to remember that this kid is young, and he might not be found in poacher positions so close to the goal like he was last year.

**2-1 to Leeds** is my prediction.

As for the team, here's how I think we'll line up:

--------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Warnock

--------------Green

Austin----------------------Murphy

-----------McCormack

-----Hunt--------------Varney

There is a chance that Wootton will start ahead of Lees, because I think that he did well at Doncaster and appears to be a talented player, while Lees has been poor by his own standards (as opposed to last season when Lees was outstanding and Pearce was a liability). However, I think that McDermott will stick with Lees for now, because he seems loyal to certain players, such as Green, who I was sure would be dropped for Tonge. Although that might be because he wanted to give him another go in the holding role, with Austin in front of Peltier, and I expect it to be the same seeing as it worked well enough against Ipswich (after the formation change, mind, which he might do again).

I expect Hunt to stay in, too, because he will be favouring work rate against a team as strong as QPR. They have some great players at Championship level and will move the ball around well, so this will be our biggest test so far this season.

I'm still annoyed that terms and functionality differ between countries, even though it apparently wasn't relevant to your comment.

Speaking about the roaming charges, from the other thread:

&gt; I've had 3 (Sweden) since 2004 and I've heard about this deal for a few years, but terms have varied between countries. They *cancelled* it in Sweden and the U.K a while ago... but at least the networks of Sweden and Denmark count as one single network, so there's no roaming in Denmark for me.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchison_3G#3_Like_Home

&gt; &gt; In February 2007 3 introduced '3 Like Home': a service that in theory allows subscribers to use any 3-branded network with the exception of 3 Indonesia without having to pay additional roaming charges, instead paying the same amount for voice, data, and messaging services as they would do on their home network. This also allows users to use their free or inclusive bundles and allowances while abroad. However, pre-pay customers do not benefit fully, as they can not yet use each 3 branded network for '3 Like Home'.

&gt; &gt; 3 Australia confirm that calls made using '3 Like Home' are not included in any ""cap"" plan or inclusive bundles.

&gt; &gt; This arrangement is possible because of the roaming agreements between the networks. Each of the networks provides service to other partners networks free of internal roaming charges. This means that the marginal cost of a roaming call is much the same as a call on the home network.

&gt; &gt; At the end of April 2009, 3 UK announced that '3 Like Home' would no longer be available to customers of the 3 UK network from 30 June 2009. On 7 April 2010, 3 Sweden announced that '3 Like Home' would be discontinued on 23 May 2010. No cancellation announcements have yet been made for customers of other 3 networks.

&gt; &gt; On 19 August 2013, 3 Austria announced at a press conference that '3 Like Home' would no longer be available for new customers, following their acquisition of Orange Austria. Existing plans are unaffected.

&gt;On Iraq, I believe that the prevailing mood of the British people is sound. They do not doubt that Saddam is a brutal dictator, but they are not persuaded that he is a clear and present danger to Britain.

&gt;They want inspections to be given a chance, and they suspect that they are being pushed too quickly into conflict by a US Administration with an agenda of its own.

&gt; Notes that the use of chemical weapons is a war crime under customary law and a crime against humanity, and that the principle of humanitarian intervention provides a sound legal basis for taking action;

&gt; Notes the wide international support for such a response, including the statement from the Arab League on 27 August which calls on ... the United Nations Security Council, to “overcome internal disagreements and take action against those who committed this crime, for which the Syrian regime is responsible”

&gt; Notes that this Resolution relates solely to efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering by deterring use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any action in Syria with wider objectives

&gt; “There is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of chemical weapons by the opposition.”

&gt; The Joint Intelligence Committee therefore concludes: “It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a CW attack on this scale.” 

&gt; It says this: “The regime has used CW on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible.”

&gt; Crucially, the JIC Chairman, in his letter to me, makes this point absolutely clear. He says “there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility.”

&gt; ...But I would put it to hon. Members that all the evidence we have—the fact that the opposition do not have chemical weapons and the regime does, the fact that it has used them and was attacking the area at the time, and the intelligence that I have reported—is enough to conclude that the regime is responsible and should be held accountable.",0,1377888549,null,0,false,0,cbyjwcz,t3_1lerbh,t1_cbyjwcz,t1_cbyijby,null,1429644871,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Rival Championship club comes in with a bid for your best player, the sole provider of flair in the team, and his sale would undoubtedly make that club (and potentially others) have a stronger team than you, so you turn down the bid and subsequent improved offers before signing him to a new contract.

That's how football clubs run by owners with ambition and direction work. If, say, Hull City came in with a bid in excess of five million, with most of it up front, then I could understand potentially letting him go if it would get us at least one tricky winger and proven goalscorer, but you'd struggle to get even one of those for the money Boro were offering.

Compare that with Bates, who would have snapped their arm off after the first bid, told McDermott to get on with a lad Gwyn Williams found in the Ecuadorian 3rd division - Seb Nunez da Costa - who can play Ross's position for a quarter of the price, then called the fans morons for questioning how he is running the club.

This highlights the fact that this is not the case.

My rant may have gone off on a tangent slightly unrelated to this post, but I have had a blinding rage building up inside of me for the last few hours because of this and I used this opportunity to vent. Journalists sniping from the sidelines does not help, and they amount to kicking someone when they are down at this point.

However, critics *should* be pointing out that Cameron should have addressed Parliment first, and then tell his allies if Britain would give support or not. But Cameron did it bass-ackwards, and have left France and the US in a terrible position, one day before the military action was supposed to take place. My fury is directed at him for that reason alone.

true,rydleo,null,null,"Exactly.  Carroll for  £15.5M, for example, nets us 5% less than that as Carroll gets his loyalty bonus.  For incomings, there are agents fees (of which we've paid nearly £30M worth in the last 3 years or so as I recall), VAT, signing bonuses (Toure likely got one worth several million £'s as an example), etc.

Plus, as I said, it isn't really that simple either.  Take Carroll as an example- we paid £35M for him on a 5.5 year contract (think that's what it was, going from memory so contract length may be wrong).  Technically, the purchase of a player is a capital expenditure (i.e. they are an asset, not an expense), so his cost is amortized over the length of his contract (e.g. ~ £6.36M annually).  So let's just say 2.5 years go by and we sell him for  £14.725M (actual value minus loyalty bonus).  Then his actual remaining book value is £35 - (2.5 x  £6.36M) =  £19.1M.  So we take the amount we receive  £14.725M - £19.1M book value and we end up taking a net loss on the player of  £4.375M (which would probably show up as a one time exceptional expense on the accounts).  That said, comparing year over year expenses, we also remove the  £6.36M from the player amortization expense and his wages of ~ £4.1M from the books, so a net positive (compared to the year prior) of  (£6.36M +  £4.1M) -  £4.375M =  + £6.085M to the books.  

That all said, I'm not an accountant so may well have screwed something up in the above.

true,Jaqacake,null,null,"On Tuesday I was asked to advertise a job, a crappy packing job in the factory, minimum wage, temporary until Christmas.

I advertised on the government universal jobmatch thing and the local connexions site, as the lack of requirements for any experience makes it quite suited to a school leaver, the adverts were published on Wednesday morning.

I cancelled the universal jobmatch one about 7.30 this morning, connexions at 9 as I had to wait for their office to open.  In the less than 24 hours I was advertising I had over 140 applications.

Some were obviously just applying because they have to apply to x many for their benefits, I assumed anyone who wasn't local was in that box but that was only 10, it's likely that some of the local ones were in that box too but I've no idea how to estimate how many.

In total I went through about 2/3rds of the CV's I had, initially reading them through fully to later just scanning it in a few seconds, it's how I spent all day Wednesday.  The ones on the jobsite don't really leave a way to give feedback - there's a drop down menu I can select, but it gives 3 options along the lines of you don't have the relevant experience/qualifications/actually I don't need anyone after all.  The only way to properly reply would be to go through every CV and get their contact details.

I replied to most the young people that emailed me directly from the connexions advert, about 20, sometimes with some feedback and advice, which I received a thank you for every time, or in one case a completely rewritten CV.

For the most part it's because I felt quite sorry for them, especially the young people as most clearly had no idea how to apply for a job or write a CV, but if I'd had that many through emails there's no way I could have replied so personally to them, I'd have struggled to send more than a template rejection.

This is the first time I've had to do this and it was hard, especially at the start, I was taking time to read the CV's properly, but when they just started flooding in I just didn't have time, I also wanted to give everyone a job.  I'm going to find it very hard on Monday when I have to interview 5 people and can only give a job to 1.  I'm kinda hoping my boyfriend is right that half probably won't even show up.

For me it seems like a good experience to be on this side because I get so disheartened every time I don't get a response from an application.  I had a job interview last week, I cried and was upset for a few days when I got rejected.  Now I can see that it's not that whoever is recruiting hates me, it's probably not even something I've done wrong, they may not even have got a chance to look at my CV and it's probably hard for them to have to turn me and others away after interview because they can't give everyone a job.

I'm sorry, it sucks, I'd like to be someone who can reply, hence why I did when I got applications by email, although not always as sometimes it was too hard because there is no good excuse why I can't offer them an interview other than there's simply too many people and as it's an unskilled, inexperienced position I'm picking people who are unskilled and inexperienced - despite how much I HATED being told in the past I wasn't suitable for x job because I had a degree.",0,1377889932,null,0,false,0,cbykf9q,t3_1lehmz,t1_cbykf9q,t3_1lehmz,null,1429644627,6,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,6

true,chocolate_bread,null,null,"One thing a lot of non-entrepreneurs believe is that an idea is magic and should be protected.  You seem to be falling into this trap by giving few zero details, which makes it impossible to take you seriously.

If your business idea is so secret that it cannot be revealed then the moment you launch, when everybody can see it, it will be instantly copied.  Is that likely?  No.  Most ideas are not revolutionary, instead they rely upon matching the people with the skillsets, and the execution.

Launching a business is trivial, if you have a plan:

* Write business plan.
* Pitch idea to appropriate audience.
* Get customers.
* Repeat.

Sure some things differ, depending on the product, or business.  e.g. buying items, advertising, coding, whatever.  But the first thing you must do is validate the idea - will people pay for your product, or service?  To do that you need to indentify your future-customers, and approach them direct.  (Or just launch and hope for the best.)

I ran a company once.  Profitable from day one.  I'd do it again in the right circumstances, but if you're pitching for investors you need to actually pitch.  That means details.  Projections.  Planning.  None of which is evident here, in this off-topic post.

I definitely felt more in tune with the Irish than with the English, probably the Celtic roots.  That said I often found the Irish to be *too* friendly at times, it's nice to be left alone rather than a stranger asking you chapter and verse in the pub one night.

Belfast is an interesting one.  It reminded me a bit of Glasgow, a bit of Edinburgh, a bit of a large non-London English city I can't quite place right now.  Definitely nicer than Dublin which just felt like a cheap, grubby copy of London gone wrong.
