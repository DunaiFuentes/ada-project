&gt; We approached the security guard on the main gate [...] I explained the situation.

&gt; The guard was entirely unsympathetic. He said it was private property and there was no public right of way.  I said this was fair enough...

Sounds polite so far. Obviously I wasn't there so I don't know for sure -- but I can't see why you're calling me out as a liar of no integrity simply for repeating what the article said. Anyway... it goes on:

&gt; But the guard stuck to his guns, and staring me straight in the face said that it was out of the question: There were under 18-year-olds at the college.

&gt; I began to **remonstrate**, saying I was with my own child, and moreover I also teach at a university. But when I saw another guard coming over to back up his beleaguered colleague I thought: life’s too short to argue with **jobsworths**...

Definition of remonstrate: *""To make a forcefully reproachful protest""*. i.e. they had it out over the issue, a colleague came over and Will Self decided to drop it and just carry on with his hike... but apparently the security guard(s) didn't. 

Definition of jobsworth: *""A person who uses his or her job description in a deliberately uncooperative way""*

i.e. the implication is the security guard deliberately set the police on Will Self either to 'teach him a lesson' for the *remonstration* they had, or out of genuine concern he was a paedophile. If the latter was true, my question is why did the security guard let Will Self walk off into the countryside with a 12 year old boy if he genuinely thought he was a paedophile. Why not try to distract them there while they called the police.

1) A clever guy tried to get smart with a security guard who was ultimately in the right to decline him access to private property.

Yes, you're right, Self himself (heh) says the guard gave reasons for not allowing access but, while not likely to admit to getting heated, claims he gave it up as a lost cause after *beginning* to remonstrate and having a second guard come back up the first. A stupid thing to argue, on Self's part, as he knew the guard had the authority to deny him access or he wouldn't have bothered asking in the first place. Again, I don't think Self is one to resort to aggression to get his point across and I expect that his ""remonstration"" would have been entirely verbal, controlled, and based on the logic he portrays in the article... But we will never know for sure.

The rest of the DM article descends, sadly, into a bitch fest about the College's response and the guard's further claims, rather than focus on why we now have to deal with a culture where people are quick to jump at such accusations, founded or unfounded. I think that's what most people are getting as what went wrong 

I'm still more likely to believe that the guard would make a call to the police out of concern rather than a petty argument... Security guards do, after all, get into arguments on a fairly regular basis and, as others have pointed out, it's illegal to knowingly waste the time of the police. A college security guard, in particular, *should* have training and a working knowledge of the law and some basic psychological maneuvers.

That said, I have know a few security guards that made me wonder whether their responsibilities would be safer if they hadn't got the job. Perhaps this guy was cut from that cloth?

You should go read the DM article then, as it is written by Will Self himself, it's actually the primary source for the whole story. Yes the DM is a rag but refusing to read it at all on principle even when the article in it is the basis for the Guardian and all the other stories is just ridiculous.

As to whether it has extra details, yes it does, from Will Self's point of view naturally but yes Kesuke has just completely invented his take on it there. We only have Self's word to go on but frankly I can't see **any** legitimate reason for the guard to call the cops even if Self did get into a heated argument with him.

The college claimed later that the guard called the cops because he saw Self and son still walking five miles up the road as evening was closing in two hours later and he was concerned for their safety, that they might be lost or not find accommodation before dark... Which sounds like complete crap frankly to me, particularly given that they specifically sent a female officer from a different area in case they might have to take the child into custody, etc.

Our weakness tends to be allowing for teams to break on the counter and Villa has all the parts to do that. I don't think we need to worry so much about them having a spell of possession and Benteke pulling out a wonder goal. He's just a very solid striker. 

We need to be better prepared on OUR set pieces with enough defensive cover to stop their counter attacking pace.

To our benefit they've got a midweek game and that may mean they'll only have that pace in the first half. So the first 45 will be huge if we can have them running around chasing our possession.


As for Van Persie, pretty similar story but just better player and better team. I don't think there's a way to shut down Utd. They're too confident. Swansea were controlling possession the first 30 minutes, dominating, and then Utd just pull 2 goals out of the air.

You can stop Benteke, but stopping Van Persie is near impossible.

No, I don't think you understand the law. The police had a phonecall from a security guard (Which Mr Self. argues was in a professional capacity) about concerns he was a paedophile... the ""reasonable suspicion"" was not that he had a child... but that a man with a child tried repeatedly to gain access to a protected facility full of children... not only were the police justified in stopping him... **they had a legal obligation to do so**. If there is one party in all of this that is clearly not at fault, it is the police (which must be refreshing for them).

I agree with you that a lot of police/security types know less about the law than they think... and the finer points of photography and copyright aren't exactly high up their radar. But a security guard whos job is essentially to keep people off private property... might just happen to know a thing or two about the law when it comes to keeping people off private property. But that isn't my point. My point is that school lesson: Dont piss off the lunch lady, or you might not get lunch.

i.e. Don't upset someone in security, because they might just make your day that little bit more difficult.

If you have sugar, put it in after the teabag is removed. This is because sugar gets absorbed into the teabag, thus rendering your tea slightly less than satisfactory to your tastes.

Pouring water on top of your tea bag brings out the tea quicker than if you were to pour it to the side of the bag, and requires less brewing time.

Often you hit a plataeu where the tea doesn't get darker in colour, and you may be a strong tea liker like myself. Squeeze the teabag between two spoons, or your fingers if you are a real man, and rub the tea inside around a bit.

This isn't really the polices fault. They have to investigate that sort of allegation seriously.

The police in this country are far from perfect, but on this occasion I really can't begrudge them doing what they did. For once they did everything by the book.

Remember the police have protocols that guide what they do and don't investigate. Those protocols mean that if your car gets vandalized without witness, they might make an over-the-phone decision about whether they will persue it any further (since its very unlikely to prevent a crime or result in a prosecution).

true,bcash,null,null,"For all the talk of house prices having momentum, that they somehow move on their own and people have to cling on or miss out, people ignore the strong (inverse) correlation between house prices and interest rates.

It's quite obvious really, the lower the rates, the more money can be borrowed for the same monthly cost, the more money goes into the continual house price auction.

Interest rates have been in a downward line (when smoothed out over a couple of years moving average) since the early 1990s.  

What's interesting, but never talked about, is the extent to which high house prices cause low interest rates.  My theory: when house prices exceed their long-term affordability averages, there's a drag on the economy as a whole as there's less discretionary spending; this in turn forces the policy makers to lower interest rates and so the cycle continues.

He mainly shows concern for Amy and frustration at the Doctor's irresponsibility and his effect on others.

Why? **At that point in the narrative he's been alive _twice as long_ as the Doctor.** He's experienced what it's like to be a copy of yourself and then find out the original you is dead - and then become the original you again via some reboot button action, and then REGAIN the memories of being a plastic copy of yourself. That's also why he was so willing to help the Gangers - he's been where they are.

Quite simply put, nothing scares him that much any more. He's been to pretty much the darkest place you could go for a normal human being (dying, death of the universe, being responsible for killing your girlfriend, being not-you but still feeling like you) so everything else is a cakewalk in comparison.

Tennant on the other hand had much more time to prove how good he is and he did a fantastic job.

If only that were true. Average house prices in virtually the entire south of England (like literally, draw a horizontal line through Hemel Hempsted) are closer to £250K... you might say thats a problem for the south, but in fairness that area accounts for about 1/3rd to a half of all the people in England. 

Saving £400 a month is great, and indeed you end up with a few thousand pound - well on your way to having that deposit sorted. Then BAM. Your car breaks. You end up unemployed for 2 months. You have a child etc. And suddenly 2-3 years of savings are vapourised overnight and its back to square one.

Then there is another problem - at £24K you probably wouldn't find many banks *willing* to lend you enough to get a mortgage on a £150K property. Most would probably want closer to 20% for that sort of size mortgage. Now that shouldn't be such an issue for a couple (and indeed expecting to buy property as a singleton is somewhat ambitious - even in the past)

Its a combination of factors - squeezed disposable income/stagnating salaries due to austerity hurts your ability to save. The rental trap forces you to hand over arbitrarily large sums of money for opaque ""referencing checks"" and ""damage deposits"" further hurting your savings.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Basically tenants have much greater rights to hold landlords to account (i.e. witholding rent, seeking legal action to force repairs etc) - and landlords have greater legal rights to reclaim damages caused by tenants beyond deposit money. There are also provisions for tenure and rent control (i.e. where landlords cannot jack-up prices over short periods of time or evict tenants... such as we saw in London during the Olympics). Contracts tend to be less prescriptive - so you can pick up flexible 5-10 year contracts rather than the rigid 6-12 month - 4wk notice contracts that are widespread here. It provides tenants with the stability they need to raise a family without the risk of being thrown onto the street every 6 months such as is the case here. 

It is also in no small part a big cultural difference. German aspirations of property ownership are very different to those in the UK. Remember, Germany has gone through a lot of upheaval over the past 60 years. Part of that unique process has meant a culture of renting has developed where it is more socially acceptable to rent in the middle and even upper-middle classes. In the UK on the other hand rental laws are archaic and largely hark back to a time where tenants were poor peasents that worked the land and landlords were the wealthy aristocratic and industrialist landowners that mattered in the eyes of the legal system. Hence why a British landlord can secure a rapid section-17 eviction order for a tenant not paying rent... but a tenant cannot withold rent or cancel their contract early even if their life is in danger due to the state of the property... all they can do is appeal to the local councils health and safety dept. to try and have them take legal action on their behalf (which is usually so slow the contract would have expired before it even got near a court).

Rental properties in Germany also tend to be owned by larger companies/conglomerates of landlords working together with a more buisness orientated model (rather than the amateur-BTL model that dominates the UK sector).",0,1376860142,null,0,false,0,cbqfn18,t3_1klo9q,t1_cbqfn18,t1_cbqe97i,null,1429783719,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I don't agree that page 3 is harmless though.

Just like racists, homophobic's, sexists (and those who engage in sexual harassment) aren't born that way, they get taught that behaviour.

Those are the ones I've seen so far. I'm pretty unsure about this though, I might be missing some important things and it's really hard because every season has some very good moments.

5 is my favourite so far for various reasons. Everything looks, feels and sounds better than the previous reasons. This might just be because I watched it on Blu-Ray, but I really noticed things like good soundtrack and beautiful images, especially the lighting, which I haven't really noticed in previous seasons. Then there are a lot of episodes I really liked, actually pretty much all of them. Except maybe Victory of the Daleks. What makes this season special for me is the story arc over the whole, everything fits pretty well together in the end.

4 is second, because Tennant was incredible in it. And even though Donna sometimes was a little bit too annoying for my taste. It also has some great episodes, especially the rather unusual Midnight, but also Turn Left, Planet of the Ood or the Doctor's Daughter. Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead was also interesting, at least to a certain extent.

1 on third place, despite some rather bad episodes. Eccleston's performance is what really does it for me. Dalek, The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances are incredible, Father's Day is pretty cool too, mainly because of all the weird and paradox time travel stuff. I also quite liked Bad Wolf and The Parting of the Ways.

Then there's 3, which I didn't like that much overall, but it surely has some great moments. Blink is just awesome, Smith and Jones as well as The Shakespeare code were fun and Human Nature/The Family of Blood deserves to be mentioned because of Tennant's performance, the rest was rather mediocre.

2 is last, because there aren't any very special episodes there. Might also have to do with the fact that this is the one I haven't watched least recently.

Now you can tell me why I'm completely wrong. As I said, I'm sure I've forgotten some important things, so please don't hate me.",0,1376862591,null,0,false,0,cbqgf9z,t3_1kl5r5,t1_cbqgf9z,t3_1kl5r5,null,1429783340,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

It's only about 20-25 miles (depending which side of the city they are sent to) but at peak time, that commute currently takes 40-60 minutes (I work near the airport at present &amp; it is roughly my commute - although I get to dodge the city centre &amp; the government employees being moved won't be able to).

On top of that, one of the other 'big three' employers locally have just announced that they are ditching about 1,000 jobs - not that they are massively well paid jobs, but still, at least they were jobs (and that employer put on a free work bus from the big bus stops), so the government decision couldn't have come at a worse time...

But housing is pretty cheap here, provided you don't want a big fancy house? Commuting to Manchester/Liverpool is do-able &amp; it's only about 2 to 2.5hours to London (by train, but you have to earn mega-bucks to make it worth the train fair - but I do have a neighbour who used to do it).

Either way I'd definitely actually feel the increase (and resist the temptation to use it all up in one day... probably gonna limit my FTP use to either overnight or speed-capped anyway regardless of the quota).

Pure curiosity, is the under reporting possibly related to the bug in the linux kernel that's caused feralhosting to disable their quotas?

Also, are the new wireless networks wireless-g or wireless-n?  Again pure curiosity as I've found the university wireless-g networks easily fast enough (testament to how well-planned they are, no doubt), I was just talking to someone the other day who seemed to think wireless-g was obsolete.

We expect women to be attractive like it's everything they are, and we treat women like objects like that's all they're meant to be.

I agree that sexism has always been around but I do think page 3 reinforces the view that women are there to be pretty and sweet. And page 3 definitely isn't positive about women's bodies. It is saying ""hey look at this attractive woman"" but that doesn't make it okay, even if you do compare it to women's appearance being criticised in other media outlets. 
If page 3 really was positive about women then it would show all types of beauty from all types of women.

true,W_LothianAnswer,eng-somerset,Somerset,"* Firstly, god would not necessary be the ""magical sky wizard"" portrayed by religious organisations. It could be a non-physical entity entirely made up of energy and completely incapable of thought etc etc. If you believe in a magic fairly in the sky, then you are indeed likely to be an idiot. I am not disputing that at all, I was merely stating that a belief in a deity and belief in religion are entirely separate for many people and should not be lumped together under the crude phrase of ""magic sky fairy"".

* Yep, there are an awful lot of reasons to be an atheist, hence why I am one. But at the same time it is naive to say that there are absolutely no logical arguments whatsoever for the existence of a deity. If you study philosophy, you will notice that there is never a definitive 'yes' or 'no' answer, and that there is always another option or argument to be explored. Personally, I feel that the arguments in favour of a god (ie Cosmo, Teleology and Ontological) are outweighed by the arguments against, however, like most people who have studied the issue in depth, I am prepared to admit that there are reasons why people would believe in the existence of god (the theories I previously are hard to disprove beyond complete doubt). The fact is, that we can never prove anything either way so we must work with what we've got.

* &gt;Its you that is probably badly educated and of ""average"" intelligence. All while I'm the one with AS, LLI and IQ 150-ish, and the one who can pretty much only think logically about something all while processing thousands of bits of information at once, so yes, I do know what I'm talking about because I see all the details at once and link things together in a way you never can and I understand the result of these things.

This is an incredibly arrogant statement to make. You have no idea who I am. You have no idea what my education was like. You have no knowledge of my level of intelligence. To assume that because someone disagrees with you they must be less intelligent or poorly educated shows how narrow minded and blinkered you are. A true scientist will always be prepared to admit they were wrong, or at least be prepared to show why they are right. Also, you failed to actually make an argument in that statement, you basically said, ""Its right because I just know it is"".

* Like I said, a belief in god is not necessarily connected to organised religion, bringing the contradictory, poorly written novel that is the bible into the argument does not prove anything. You are confusing deism with theism.

&gt; there is no way anyone would think otherwise if they had the intelligence to see all of those details at once.

Well, apparently there is. Unless you are claiming to be the most intelligent person ever to have thought about this issue.

&gt;these people wouldn't of even thought about it much

So the Greeks never had philosophy then? Or the early Islamic empire? The Renaissance didn't have philosophy?
Aristotle, Plato, Hume, Kant, Aquinas, Kierkegaard etc never existed then?

&gt;today however it would be hard to find a particle physicist that believes in a god, or any physicist, or just any real scientist in general.

Yes, it is hard*er*, But the do exist. I know a few and have been taught by several in the past. Atheism is more common among scientists and the like, but is not totally dominant.

I completely agree with you that atheism (or agnosticism) is the most logical path. However I also feel that it is possible to be intelligent and believe in god at the same time as no argument in philosophy is completely watertight. And to use someone's personal conclusions on the matter as a measure of their intelligence is crude and offensive.",0,1376864261,null,0,false,0,cbqgxym,t3_1kh2x2,t1_cbqgxym,t1_cbpv59k,null,1429783098,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The server in question has two optical inputs, which can receive 1gbps at once. Each input gets a mirror of one of the two links into the uni.

Two years ago we averaged under 1gbps, last year when we replaced to boarder routers this sky rocketed. Lowest during term is about 1.5gbs, average about 2gbps, peaked at 9.2gbps.

2gbps can't fit down a 1gbps pipe, so it gets sampled and the accounting system only sees half of it. Figures above have been simplified and are guesstimates as I'm in bed. 

The new system takes information from the boarder devices which are actually firewalls, and as such track this info as part of their job.

So not the same issue as feralhosting. 

Wireless, I think we turned off b last year, g is standard everywhere. We are trialing n in some spaces, so far only on 5.8Ghz too. 2.4Ghz is too full of crap. 

Wireless to us is not a replacement for wired, it's an addition for some devices. As such we don't directly see the need for speed. There is talk about adjusting the priorities of certain kinds of traffic on wireless to ensure everyone gets a reasonable experience.

G may become obsolete, and it is in as far as a new faster protocol has been created... but I bet the next version of the iPhone or whatever still does 802.11b. 

It will only become truly obsolete when there are either no clients to use it or it becomes so fundamentally broken. In the case of b for us, slowed down g too much.

Women do get cat called, but in day-to-day conversation even in professional environments, it is much more acceptable to insult male appearance than female.

I think it's important to also explain to adults (including parents) the negative consequences of page 3, so they can explain to their child the impacts of sexualisation and the issues with sexual harassment. If everyone thinks it's normal, they'll explain to their child that it's normal and nothing will ever change. 

If your parents told you your entire life that racism was okay, how would we get that child to change their mind? I'd argue one way was to avoid using racism in the media, and to always provide discussion on the issues racism in the media has. I think this is what page 3 is trying to do.

""We’d like both women and men to be treated with respect, so “getting our own back” by ogling photos of men is not a great idea. Two wrongs don’t make a right! Besides, the two situations are not equivalent. There is evidence that sexually charged photos of women are likely to lead men towards thinking of women as permanently sexually available, and to more harassment of women. Unwanted sexual attention directed at a woman always has overtones of physical threat. It’s difficult to think of pictures of half-naked men taking on that threatening aspect.""

I understand that criticism of ones appearance can be upsetting and in no certain terms is this okay, but sexual harassment in my opinion is a far more important issue. As the campaign says, ""we are living in a country where the government’s official statistics show that there were 60,000 rapes in England and Wales in 2011 and 300,000 sexual assaults"", this isn't okay. 
Also I'd argue, it may be more acceptable to criticise men's appearance because men's appearance isn't seen as being that important to his overall character. Why is saying ""Sue you ugly fucker"" not acceptable? Because a lot of people believe that being attractive is the most important thing a woman could possibly be, intelligence or skills are seen as a bonus, but above all, a woman just be ascetically pleasing. If she is not, then she will not nearly be half as successful. Why do we see below average looking men with attractive women, and below average looking women with below average looking men? Why is it in dating advertisements in the newspapers do men talk of money or a successful job ""MALE, 32, police officer looking for..."", whereas women use descriptions of their looks ""BLONDE bombshell looking for..."", ect? Females are more likely to offer information on their weight than men are, and are more likely to seek men with financial security ect. This is research you should be able to access discussing that, as a society, we judge women more harshly on their appearance, and consider their appearance more important than we do for men, https://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/publications/nzej-backissues/2000-jacqueline-tither.pdf

To your last paragraph, I would argue that publishing soft porn in a daily newspaper, along with the football scores and the whatever else, makes it ‘normal’ to see porn in everyday life, and as the page 3 campaign says, this is ""where young boys get their ideas that women’s bodies should be instantly available as a resource for men‘s sexual gratification, because, be honest, that’s what these pictures are used for."" You could argue that the sexualisation of women in the newspaper is a large part of why men aren't adjusting to the equality of women. It's a huge contradiction, ""women are independent/not for your eyes, here's a picture of a naked women though, and it's completely normal!""",0,1376867883,null,0,false,0,cbqi21m,t3_1km34f,t1_cbqi21m,t1_cbqhj2s,null,1429782578,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I would have like a bit of mention of Coutinho as well in the article as while Coutinho is mainly known for his godly passes, he can also make opposition teams commit players like Suarez does providing more space for others to capitalise on for one. 


Also I feel when talking about our team without Suarez the team chemistry should be mentioned too. I feel we become a more unpredictable team to defend against without Suarez as there is a less reliance on him and everyone is given more chances to show what they can do which is a lot. Hendo's shots yesterday for example. (how did begovic save them I have no idea.)  If Suarez was in the team, I don't think we would have seen this as Hendo most likely wouldn't have played.

That is a concept the campaign is projecting on the viewers based on their own morals. It is insulting to men and women.

Some people like to know others think they are attractive. Why is this wrong in any way? And if it is not wrong, why would it be wrong or disrespectful for someone to look at a picture of them.

Then to read this just shows the campaign is run by people with no clue whatsoever and therefore makes me sceptical of all their other statements:
&gt; this is ""where young boys get their ideas that women’s bodies should be instantly available as a resource for men‘s sexual gratification, because, be honest, that’s what these pictures are used for.""

If they think men are sexually gratifying themselves to page 3 photos in the internet age, they have lost the plot completely.

As for your general point about how men and women are treated differently, I'm sorry to say this will happen for the forseeable future. When it comes to reproduction, not all things are equal and therefore there are different roles. Men and Women are equal, but they are not the same. We can not ignore and suppress our nature. Men advertise status and women looks due to human nature, not societal problems. This was as true in ancient Egypt as it is today.

Finally, there is no evidence whatsoever that Page 3 in any way contributes to rape or sexual assault. Rape and sexual assault had a much higher incidence centuries ago before newspapers even existed. It is nonsensical to think the attitudes that allow men to think this sort of treatment of women is OK has come from page 3 or any of its ilk. Sexism is an ingrained part of human society which we are gradually eroding - I just do not find page 3 to be sexist as the model is there absolutely by choice.

Another option would be to put a lump sum in your pension - if you put in 5k now, by the time you are 75 (retirement age) , it would be worth £220,000 (if we account for inflation it would still be worth 10 to 15 times what it is now - around £60-80k) - though the real value in pensions starts to build when you put a regular monthly amount in. Once you start work i'd put in at least £250 a month , ideally more, and increase it yearly by £25-50.

there's a good pension calc at https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/pension-calculator which calculates inflation and lets you see what sort of income you could get from lump sumps and regular contributions etc.

And Self had ABSOLUTELY no idea if that was the case or not until the questioning had ended.

He had to make his decision to attempt to clear up the matter or to march boldly on in a split second, at the end of a long day, with his son present, and no idea how the police would react.

I would like to add, I believe you are placing a far higher standard on the police than they do themselves.

I have been stopped and searched 4 times. On three of those occasions, the justifying reason for the search was one word, literally: ""drugs"". That is all. No more basis or suspicion was given. Two of these times were since the ECHR rights decisions limiting S and S.

I can tell you, with four police officer family members, all thoroughly unpleasant people, ALL of them would consider intelligence of a possible child abduction, plus a refusal to answer questions, a tired looking child, and an ""unfriendly"" manner grounds to arrest. They have been emphatic on similar issues, especially when it comes to possible child safety issues.

Lola's is probably my second favourite club. That has 2 floors of music. Pretty popular but smallish rooms. Music wise again popular music. 

Then there is Fez which I would say is my favourite club. This club is quite small. The smallest of all the clubs. Just the one floor. Music is generally the popular stuff. But on Friday they have propaganda night. This is my favourite night as the music is all rock/indie and a little bit of more hardcore stuff which is really awesome.

At least once an episode I would groan and think, ""God damn it Rose, not again!"" I mean, dangling from that blimp and almost getting herself blown up? That was downright moronic. But she was the first companion I saw, and I assumed that was always the dynamic of the show--smart doctor, cute but dumb companion. Then Martha came along and she was a breath of fresh air--she was smart, competent and an all-around badass. The whole unrequited love thing didn't even bother me, because it just made her character more believable. And instead of crying about it and letting it control her life, she pulls herself together and moves on. Which is especially impressive since I think she went through some far more intense stuff with the doctor than Rose ever did.

true,Nnnkingston,davison,Davison,"1. Series 5 - Felt the most consistent, had an interesting overall arc, and was a fantastic first season for the 11th Doctor.

2. Series 4 - Donna is my absolute favorite companion and is a big reason why I have this up so high. I'm also including the specials in here, of which I absolutely adore Water of Mars and think The End of Time is greatly entertaining.

3. Series 1 - Eccelston as the 9th Doctor was a fantastic choice. The season is also a great distribution of past, present, and future episodes, along with a great introduction of multiple companions, as well as answering questions that fans have had for a long time.

4. Series 7 - While both halves are pretty weak I would say that if you include The Snowmen, it is a pretty decent season. 
5. Series 6 - The storyline of the Doctor's death is fantastic, and the Silence arc is one of the greatest in NuWho.

6. Series 2 - The increased focus on the romance between the Doctor and Rose made this a low point of the series for me. I like Rose but I felt the romance was too shoehorned in. This series also has a lot of episodes that I have a hard time watching.

7. Series 3 - Martha is my least favorite companion of NuWho. Three seasons in a row of romance was just too much for me.

true,alcalde,null,null,"&gt;David Miranda, who lives with Glenn Greenwald, was returning from a trip to Berlin 
&gt;when he was stopped by officers at 8.05am and informed that he was to be 
&gt;questioned under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The controversial law, 
&gt;which applies only at airports, ports and border areas, allows officers to stop, 
&gt;search, question and detain individuals.

So everything was completely legal, and the police politely informed him of the reasons why. The problem here is...? If you get pulled over for terrorism, is that a sign of rising fascism too?

&gt;The 28-year-old was held for nine hours, the maximum the law allows before 
&gt;officers must release or formally arrest the individual. 

So, again, everything went exactly as it should. The law said more than 9 hours it was, so the police obeyed the law. You should be cheering this and shouting ""God Save the Queen!"". Instead, people are upset.

&gt;According to official figures, most examinations under schedule 7 – over 97% – 
&gt;last less than an hour, and only one in 2,000 people detained are kept for more 
&gt;than six hours.

But they're not all this fellow, with more of a reason to be questioned than most.

&gt;Miranda was released, but officials confiscated electronics equipment including 
&gt;his mobile phone, laptop, camera, memory sticks, DVDs and games consoles.

Again, perfectly legal.

The guy comports with a known stealer or disseminator of state secrets and met with someone who has dealings with a known rapist who's avoiding his extradition by hiding out in a foreign embassy. I should hope his stuff was confiscated. I should hope they turned him upside down and shook him by the ankles until every last pence fell out of his pockets just to be sure he wasn't hiding nuclear launch code or a blueprint of the Queen's chambers on him. This is exactly what the law's designed to deal with, and the letter of the law was followed, and not a step further (such as sending him repeatedly through the luggage X-Ray machine just to be sure he hasn't swallowed a flash drive filled with Afghanistan war plans).

Talk to someone who lived in a real surveillance state. I've known people who escaped East Germany in a false trunk bottom of a car. There everything was bugged, STASI has a network of secret informants and saying the wrong thing in the wrong place or in earshot of the wrong person could get you snatched off the streets and tortured... at a minimum. Pinochet in Argentina had thousands snatched off the streets and killed, bodies dumped in mass graves. 

Another immigrant I know keeps telling me that if I hear anyone complaining about living in the United States to send them to her and she'll tell them what it's like to really live in a country with no rights or protections (including her stories of what it's like to live in a country without functioning sexual harassment laws). A young man I met lost both his parents in a rebel attack on civilians in a South American village. 

*I* get annoyed when people who live in wonderfully peaceful first world democracies start complaining about 1984, Brave New World and V For Vendetta just because they get a speeding ticket, a cop didn't smile at them, or the law that was passed by a democratically elected legislature and upheld by a constitutional court is one they just don't happen to like. 

There is increased scrutiny at border crossings. That includes coming back in to your home country. That's a fact of life, it's been so forever, and it's universal. Live with a known disseminater of stolen material and start taking trips to talk with people who are in communication with a bail-jumper avoiding extradition for rape and also involved in stealing state secrets, OF COURSE you're going to be questioned and have your stuff pawed through. There's no way this man could not have known that. If he didn't want that, he shouldn't have left in the first place. Greenwald and his compatriots routinely break the law, but the police did not should be the takeaway of this story. They were bigger, better people than Greenwald and his ilk. This fellow deserved a few trips through the luggage X-Ray system, but he got every right to which he was entitled. Greenwald, Assange, Manning, et. al wouldn't have thought twice about breaking the rules, betraying their country, putting other people's lives in danger, actually using a condom, etc.  Seems like the system is working better than fine to me.

It is really expensive, and far more expensive to have a good time than anywhere else in the UK, and indeed you'd have to go to Sweden or Norway to have a more expensive night out in Europe. You will also have less bang for your buck in terms of where you live- expect to pay upwards of $180 a week for a room that is pretty crappy in a flatshare. 

On the flipside, what you'll gain. London has 3 of the best universities in the world, UCL, LSE and Imperial, so frankly you can't miss out by attending those, they're world renowned- you wouldn't be sacrificing success to be there in any respect. London is one of the most fun cities in the world, and is a better mix than any other city on earth. You've got the grandiosity of a New York, the culture and history of Paris, the nightlife of Berlin and a population from all over the world.

Maybe think about visiting if you can with a parent before applying- I know that's really expensive and almost certainly not an option, I know I couldn't have done it, but if it's something you couldn't afford then its likely you couldn't afford to move here for study.

The only other thing I'd suggest is know what subject you want to do- the UK doesn't have a system of majoring/minoring- you just do 3 years of one subject.

That is literally all they have, a book of some kind.

* Arrogant? Not really, it is the truth however, and I know I'm not the most intelligent person around, there is plenty of people like me or smarter than me, but the fact remains that I think in a way that is far beyond the average person. And I've yet to hear of anyone of such intelligence being religious. And I didn't bother arguing it because I've come to realize that if people can't see all the information I do, that explaining it to them will go just over their heads anyway, not to mention how long it would take for me to explain the hundreds, even thousands of arguments against religion and a deity.

* If it's not connected to religion then you have no reason what so ever to believe, at that point you just have an imaginary friend.

* Using ancient or even like 80yr old philosophy is irrelevant today, those people had almost no understanding of the universe and even 80 years ago they didn't know much of what we know today. They can't possibly think about something they don't understand fully. I'm talking about people today, that can easily access everything we know about the universe, from how we think the universe was created with quantum fluctuations, to the start of life, etc, and still they sit their ignoring them all because they are too stupid or to delusional to understand them.

I haven't been to Fez in a year or two; music is average (although they have different nights), drink prices are nothing special. 

My choice would absolutely be Lola Lo. Drinks are pretty cheap, and it's split over 2 quite small floors so there's a choice of music, and if there's few people there they close one floor so it feels full. Good music selection.

true,W_LothianAnswer,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;There is no logical argument for religion, none.

You looked very hard then, have you. Off the top of my head, the Cosmological argument (argument from the existence of the universe) comes to mind as one of the more famous ones. Along with the Ontological and the (admittedly dodgy) Teleological arguments, I think we can safely say that there are some very well publicized arguments for the existence of god. This is not to say they are correct, but they have also never been entirely disproved simply due to the fact that this is not possible. As such, there is always room for disagreement, meaning it is possible (if unlikely) to study the arguments and come to the conclusion of god. The book written by middle eastern herders does not constitute an argument and is irrelevant to this debate. But no, it is most defiantly not ""all they have"" unfortunately.

We could argue over who is the most intelligent over and over for eternity but this will not solve anything. You could quite possibly be a genius, but that does not make you right. Nor does it give you the ability to 'see' any more information. Like I said, we work with what we've got. And in Philosophy, what we've got is a series of quantifiable and unverifiable discussions and ideas. Not something that can just be analysed and sifted though by a computer program. It would take you a long time to list all the arguments for atheism, and it would also take me just as long to list why they could be wrong. No side can win in this debate.

&gt;If it's not connected to religion then you have no reason what so ever to believe, at that point you just have an imaginary friend.

&gt;you have no reason what so ever to believe

On the contrary, if god is not connected to religion then it makes its existence far more plausible, as we do not know the characteristics of said god. You are also avoiding associating your deity with the bible etc, which seems to act as evidence against god. Stating that you ""have no reason to believe"" shows that you are still associating god with religion. People can believe in god just like I believe in evolution. It makes sense (to them) but does not actually benefit me and does not serve as my imaginary friend.

I was simply pointing out that there have been philosophers throughout human history, something which you appeared to deny in you previous post. Many arguments swing on things such as ""Why does the universe exist?"" ""What is consciousness? ""and other deep, ambiguous questions which have yet to actually be answered by science. We do know more now, but most philosophical arguments are still relevant today as we don't know everything.

Atheism is indeed dominant. But not totally (especially in philosophy, a science actively devoted to discussing topics such as this). More complex subjects? If you look deep enough into Biology you can find the same complexity as particle physics, however the two are so radically different that neither scientist is going to understand the other.

Feel free to consider religion a mental illness if you want to (aside from it being rude), but don't think any less of someone's arguments or opinions because of it.",0,1376896809,null,0,false,0,cbqqus7,t3_1kh2x2,t1_cbqqus7,t1_cbqqc8u,null,1429778462,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Aquarion,null,null,"Interviews are four things. First three are the company, last is you:

1) On balance, is it likely the candidate can perform the role we want with the amount of training we are going to be able to give. (This training might be quite a lot for a low level position with specific requirements, or for filling in an existing role might amount to ""We sit them at the right desk and give them the desktop password"")

2) Do I think the Candidate will survive and thrive in our company culture, or are they going to quit though overstress/horrible commute/not the role they were looking for before they've earnt out the time we spent looking for a candiate?

3) Can I see myself working for eight hours a day in a medium sized room with this candidate?

A) (And this is you) Can I see myself working here and not hating the job or people.

3 appears to be the one you fell over with. It's not a judgement on your personality, or if it is it's not a negative one necessarily, there are people whose opinion I respect, whose friendship I value and who I love very dearly that I would not like to have as a coworker, either because they don't fit in with the humour or thick-skinned nature of whatever office I'm working in, or because I think they'd have a personality clash with someone else on the team they'd need to work with. (And I've been on the other side of this. I interviewed with a guy and my impression was ""The job's not bad, but you're kind of a dick. Fortunately I won't have to interact with you often"". Lasted three months before I went in to finally resign and didn't get as far as doing so before he fired me. Not a happy experience).

Anyway, the biggest problem is that an interview situation, especially one where you're worried about it so much, is a stressful situation and is unlikely to be applying your most calm and reasonable social poise, an unhelpful loop for which the only available advice - ""try to relax"" - is kind of patronising and entirely unhelpful.

Nevertheless, try to relax, aim for friendly and outgoing. You'll get there. Your degree allows people to have an absolute measure of your experience right now, and compare you directly with other candidates. This sucks, and it gets easier later on when they have to make a judgement call on your experience instead of being able to directly compare.

All of which means it'll get better, later. So good luck for now, and the fact the final ""culture"" test was the bit where they dropped you means that they did believe you are competent and capable of doing the job, so you should be able to do it somewhere else.

It's the mentality of the team that is important, and that is something that I think Liverpool has been lacking in recent years. When faced with an impassable goalkeeper, many many teams end up throwing caution to the wind and just smack shot after shot, resulting in a sucker goal that turns a win into a draw, or a draw into a loss. 

Liverpool had that same situation, and almost paid the price. Giving away that penalty when there was no one behind him was incredibly poor of Agger. You can almost see how in that moment, the fear of conceding flashed past his eyes and he just threw himself, hands and all, into the cross. 

Mignolet's save will help to give Liverpool the one thing that they need. Not another attacker, but a winning mentality. Last season, not a single Liverpool player had the winning mentality. Liverpool basically won when they were playing well, and lost when they were playing poorly. Compare that to the likes of United, who have won numerous league titles because they win when playing poorly. 

It isn't about which players to add, because any team in the world will still face such a situation. What Liverpool need is a winning mentality, to be specific a winning mentality in the face of adversity, and sadly, you only gain this mentality by winning in the particular situation. 

It's really a big step up for the club, and by keeping Suarez, I think they have made huge progress towards making a Champion's League challenge next season (still think the club is unlikely to get 4th this year). If Liverpool continues to play well and instill a sense of confidence in the players, losing Suarez next year would hardly hurt them at all.

Subjects of the Kingdom you will find prefer to be understated. The best example I heard was the Carlsberg adverts. In the US companies tend to boast about their product being #1 in whatever - but someone at Carlsberg realized that if that kind of advertising was used in the UK people would quickly shoot it down. However, if they used the word ""probably"", it's more likely that Brits might echo the sentiment ""Yeah, probably...""

For all it's 'freedom' I find the US not really freedom loving at all - I mean, you have to have a social security number to take a shit in that country - you can't even pay a gas bill or something - it's basically a form of asking for your papers. Your government is completely out of control - in theocracy and citizen rights, mirrors the very Middle-Eastern regimes they seek to dismantle.

Then there's the lack of competition in certain markets - telecoms in particular - they're outright monopolies that get to have their own way. For example, you can't just buy a sim card and put it in any phone - and if you live in an apartment building you've got no choice over who supplies your TV + Internet.

Maybe people have a similar experience here in the UK, but my OH is Canadian - we definitely don't experience as much hassle as we did in the US for the mundanest things. Certainly when I compare it to my experiences living in Europe - Europe is definitely more ""free"" than the UK or the US, economically and socially.

I'd go back to live in the US in a heartbeat though.

He became director of football at Roma in 1999, where he remained until his resignation in March 2005.[1] He joined Fabio Capello at Real Madrid in 2006.[1] When Capello took over as the England manager in December 2007, Baldini became assistant manager.[3] His role at the national team of England involved scouting, managing the supporting staff (e.g. the doctors, physiotherapists, masseurs and kit managers) and making the job as easy as possible for his Italian counterpart. He left England after their successful EURO 2012 qualification and joined Roma before the start of 2012, but was assisting the team well before then. Since then, current Roma manager Luis Enrique, director Walter Sabatini and himself have undergone a huge revolution at the club with new owner Thomas R. DiBenedetto to try and instill a system of running a football club similar to that of Barcelona.

Remember that the scenario here is one of a goalkeeper having a great day. Having a goalkeeper block 6 of Messi's shots is not going to help his defence or midfield. Unless you buy 11 players who all have a winning mentality, it just isn't going to happen. 

Instilling a sense of confidence is a different matter, and Liverpool seems to have done that this summer. The save of Mignolet definitely mattered, but I would say that their hardline stance on Suarez and willingness to ditch Reina et al. also helped. Getting rid of the 'deadwood' like Shelvey, Spearing, Downing and Carroll marked an unwillingness to be tied to mediocrity. Putting Reina off on loan was strong retribution for a keeper who had a blunderful season and was making silly eyes at Barcelona. Keeping Suarez, exiling him to solo-training and the eventual return, showed that the club had all the power. 

Using the Agger example, one can also argue that he was desperate because he 'thought' that Liverpool would concede, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Now that he **knows** Mignolet is a steady force behind him, he will play in a more secure manner, thus eliminating such silly mistakes. 

While I still think that Liverpool will not reach 4th place this year, I truly believe that Mignolet's penalty save on Saturday will have more influence on the coming season than any other transfer to come.

true,Verochio,null,null,"My overall impression of Americans below. I don't doubt it's only a generalisation and there are many many exceptions.

The American dream is very real and in a very individualist sense. You really do believe that anyone can be anything they want to be and that it’s your own responsibility to achieve your own way in the world, equally that it’s your own failure if you don’t. You massively romanticise the idea of financial success, self-improvement and hard work. You strongly believe in meritocracy and social mobility, but think it is all down to the individual. 

You’re gourmands not gourmets; to improve a grilled cheese sandwich you add more cheese, not change for better quality cheese. Talking of which, your cheese is terrible. Absolutely terrible. Your BBQ is fantastic, however. And you do sushi far better than we do. 

You’re enthusiastic. Customer service is just better in the USA. People are constantly reinforcing each other. “That’s totally awesome” etc. I’m not sure how sincere it is. In the UK you must never be too enthusiastic or earnest. In the USA you must always be enthusiastic and earnest.

For such an individualist culture your group memberships mean a lot to you. I’ve seen lots of t-shirts with your university team, or your church group’s name on. You’re not afraid to brag on a t-shirt either. In fact you’re not afraid to talk about yourselves in a positive light at all. 

On the whole you’re very religious, unafraid to show it, and you expect everyone else to be the same.

You’re generally very kind. I’ve experienced kindness from Americans that seemed very normal for them, but in the UK would be jaw-dropping. Though it may just be that I’ve been living in the South too long.

I always liked a bit more physical presence in that area of the pitch. Lucas is neat and tidy in his work but is not imposing enough.

Mascherano would be a good example of the type of player. In the big games you need that extra personality, Lucas can fade or look off the pace when the chips are really down.

When the game is going our way Lucas is excellent. 

When the game is going against us, and the opposition midfield is powerful, he is often found out.

Again, he is a good player, I would just like to see a more dominating presence in that area.

true,Yurilovescats,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"You're very eloquent and persuasive, but ultimately I think there's a bit of chicken-and-egg in your argument. Does Page 3 represent a cause of male sexuality (as you seem to be arguing) or a symptom? 

Personally I think it's a symptom, and I believe men are hard-wired to *(sometimes)* view women's bodies as sexual objects.. in other words if men rate your tits it's got more to do with biology than socialisation. 

However, commenting on your body to your face is clearly rude and unacceptable behaviour.. (behaviour I think the vast majority of men wouldn't engage in... they may make a comment to their friends once you're out of ear shot, but that's entirely different) maybe page 3 encourages this kind of public comment? Personally I don't think so, as like I've said I don't think most men would consider doing this. Also, in my life I've experienced on more than a few occasions women very publicy comment on my appearance (including one odious creature who physically assaulted me by grabbing my beard, giving a hard and painful tug and proclaiming 'men should be clean shaven!'). I don't really see anything in the media which would encourage this, but again the vast majority of women would never consider doing this. In short, some people are arseholes, and that's not the media's fault.

One issue I have with the anti-page 3/lads mags campaign is the underlying tone of disapproval. It's quite heavily implied that men and boys who look at pictures of semi-naked ladies are doing something that's wrong and shameful. As I said, I think men (especially teenage men whose hormones are at their peak) are pretty much hardwired into this behaviour, and by trying to shame them for thoughts and feelings they have no control over, you're encouraging feelings of self-loathing and eroding their sense of self-worth. In teenagers, this can be especially damaging. 

I would much rather we have a society where young men are comfortable with their sexuality, and without a vocal group of protestors who try to shame them out of perfectly natural behaviour. I think there is a danger of men, when entering their teen years and confronting their intense sexual urges, and being confronted with strong social disapproval of those urges, will abandon the social etiquette which has evolved to govern those urges... after all why seek the approval of a society which has already condemned you? furthermore, people who become arseholes like those you described are people who have forsaken social etiquette.

In short, in these very public discussions of male sexuality, I see a danger of feminism being the lead, and often sole voice. I respect your opinion, and clearly women need to be heard here too... but we need to find a balance, and in the current discussions which primarily involve shaming tactics and attempts to push male sexual desire completely out of public view, I see no balance... and I not only think that's wrong, but also counterproductive and dangerous.

There's often a couple of dozen, defining, for example, anti-bullying, how the teaching and learning is operated, homework, special needs, behaviour, that sort of thing.  The Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) policy will be one of these.  It's a difficult one as often it's a contentious issue with some parents and some teachers will feel uncomfortable teaching SRE.  That's fine, it comes with the territory.

Speaking as a former Mr Mimsy in Pastoral, if there's not a specialist in SRE in the school, the school may well look at policies from other schools, the local education authority or buy one in.  In the old days they could have adopted one from the LEA, but as *all* the schools mentioned are academies, it probably wasn't possible as the ties to the LEA were cut when they became an academy.  So that local expertise is lost, and the school is almost forced to buy one in if they don't have the ability to write a *good* policy themselves.  It's not good practice, but if Ofsted are looming and want to look at every policy in advance, there's little option.

I reckon that this is what happened in these schools.  It seems that they've sourced the SRE policy from ~~Peace~~ Place Group, which is apparently an external provider of policies.  What Place Group seem to have done is either neglect to notice that Section 28 was repealed nearly a decade ago (which seems unlikely) or re-introduced this clause without due oversight.

Again, how this got through the School Leadership Teams and the governors defeats me, but to me all this points to a gigantic fuck-up rather than a deliberate reintroduction of section 28.

It's really not very interesting - and the bits that are interesting you're not allowed into unless you work there. 

Check out the university museums, because they are genuinely interesting if you like that sort of thing - although I think History Of Science is currently closed for refurbishment - but other than those all the uni really does is take up space and fill the place with goddamned tourists. 

The problem with this town is that it's only just barely a town. It's a university campus that got out of control :)

The older nations generally have some element of the name, plus guo meaning  'land'.
the UK is known as 英國 - yingguo
Germany is known as 德國 - deguo
France is known as 法國 - faguo

Whereas smaller nations or nations that did not exist at the time these names were given have been transliterated phonetically.

For example Italy becomes 意大利 － yidali, which literally means 'meaning big profit', yi, meaning 'meaning' as in 'what is the meaning of this word?'

The commonness of the orchid is because the word for orchid, 蘭 is used to transliterate 'land' or 'lan', being pronounced 'lan'.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"1. I would agree that we need some creativity in attack.  The attempt to come down the wings and then lob a cross into the box just isn't going to be terribly effective with players like Soldado and Siggy who base their game on positioning and movement.  This rumor for Willian may address that if we put him in Siggy's slot (though i like Siggy in that role).

2. Absolutely agree. Hugo is massive for us and makes up for having issues with defensive depth at the moment.

3. I really liked the way Chadli played yesterday, i think he can be a very good player for us.  That said he did show a Dempsey-ish habit of drifting far, far inside and narrowing the attack.  Struck me as a bad habit from Holland, where Twente was one of the big boys and had the ability to outmatch the lower table teams which allows for liberties to be taken in attack.  We need to break him of this habit as it will really slow our attack in the PL.

4. Paulinho i was very impressed with...Good on the ball, physical and worked his ass off and had really good insticncts.  Had something like 5 incomplete passes for the entire game.  Looks like he can be massive asset for us in my opinion.

5. Agreed, lots of standing around.  I think this is how we ended up lobbing cross after cross into the box.  Lennon and Walker were moving a great deal between the two of them but no one else seemed to be following their lead.  Paulinho and Demebele seemed to be sitting a shade too deep on attack and Siggy seemed to not be moving enough near the box....All you need to do is watch how Chelsea was moving with Oscar, Hazard and De Bruyne to see how it opened up their attack.

6. Agree, JD has his faults (his infuriating habit of completely mis-timing runs being the one that drives me crazy) but i think he serves a purpose for us.  With the fact that we don't have to rely on him week in and week out as the #1 striker i think will benefit both the team and his game.

Yes, but it is an absolutely rubbish law which acts to remove our rights under the guise of protecting us from terrorism.

&gt; sketchy person

What was so sketchy about him? The fact he was non-white, or the fact he was the partner of a prominent journalist involved in the NSA/GCHQ? I'm leaning towards thinking the latter, especially seeing that all his tech goods were confiscated after an interview in Berlin with someone about these revelations, where he'd have a lot of information on his laptop about it.

&gt;Talk to someone who lived in a real surveillance state

So just because it isn't as bad as East Germany during the Cold War we should let it slide? This is the sort of attitude that allows us to slide towards less rights and totalitarianism. We shouldn't ignore it just because other places in the world have been worse.

&gt;I get annoyed when people who live in wonderfully peaceful first world democracies start complaining about 1984, Brave New World and V For Vendetta just because they get a speeding ticket, a cop didn't smile at them, or the law that was passed by a democratically elected legislature and upheld by a constitutional court is one they just don't happen to like. 

Is the detainment of the partner of a journalist involved in uncovering government secrets the same as a police officer not smiling at someone. No. Again, this is the sort of attitude that allows us to slide towards less rights. 

&gt;Live with a known disseminater of stolen material and start taking trips to talk with people who are in communication with a bail-jumper avoiding extradition for rape and also involved in stealing state secrets, OF COURSE you're going to be questioned and have your stuff pawed through.

And what does that have to do with terrorism? There is no law against speaking to people trying to avoid extradition for rape. That is not illegal. The government have no right to question people about that. It also has nothing to do with terrorism, so why should David Miranda be detained under the Terrorism Act? It is obvious that the government were just using it as an excuse to try and scare journalists who try to question what they are doing, or uncover government secrets. Detaining relatives of journalists who speak out against the government and confiscating their good is exactly what you would expect Eastern Germany, or any other police state to do.

&gt;If he didn't want that, he shouldn't have left in the first place.

'If you don't want to get in trouble with the government, believe all their spiel and don't ask questions'? I'd like to stress again that neither David Miranda or Glenn Greenwald have done anything illegal, just given challenged to the government and legally revealed secrets about it. This is not justification to be questioned by the police and have goods confiscated. This is not what you expect in a country with free press. 

&gt;Greenwald and his compatriots routinely break the law

Source? I couldn't care less is Snowdon broke a draconian law within the US, all I care about is whether Greenwald or Miranda broke any laws which would suggest they should be detained under the Terrorism Act. I can't find any. 

&gt;betraying their country

So revealing that the government routinely spy on their own and other countries is 'betraying their country'? Betraying the country to who? What a load of jingoistic rubbish. For the third time, this is the sort of rhetoric that leads towards totalitarianism. 'Don't question what the government are doing, that's betraying the country and being unpatriotic!'.

&gt;putting other people's lives in danger

Who's lives in danger? Who's lives did Greenwald and Miranda put in danger? As I've said, when was it illegal to talk to someone who has (been perceived to) break the law?

* The system treats benefit claimants like fraudsters

* Benefit claimants must play the system to get enough

* People who don't play the system will get nothing

The reason so many ATOS judgments are overturned on appeal isn't just because they wrongly say people are fit for work. It's also because a network of advisors who know the tricks of the trade tell people how to get ATOS' judgement overturned on appeal.

The problem is it's creating an arms race of reassessing and appeals which ultimately benefits literally nobody. If I am sick and do not play the game I will be *fucked*. Whereas Joe Bloggs who knows the system inside out will walk in and walk out knowing the right things to say.

Honestly I think some people probably do take advantage, but then again maybe they do that because there is so much hostility towards non-disabled benefit claimants. I think a Universal Benefit definitely is the way forward and I think we should start to phase out assessing this benefit as much as we do. If someone doesn't want to work, *they will find a way not to work*.

I was sick with depression and anxiety in 2010, and whilst I'm not complaining about it, all I had to do was complete a 20 question survey and my doctor wrote me up. I didn't claim DLA or anything but I could have. I saw with my own eyes then how easy it is to take advantage of the system.

We have to take the stigma away from benefits. People shouldn't have to compete for 'who is the neediest'. If you don't have enough income to live, whether that's because you can't find a job, or because you simply are not well enough to work, then I am okay with government spending being put towards helping you.

What I'm *not* okay with is legitimate claims being blackballed whilst the quasi-professional benefit claimants know how to play the system to get the biggest *portfolio* of benefits possible. The system needs to be **simple so everyone understands it**, it needs to be **easy to administer** so the cost of running it is low, and it needs to be **universal so the reason you need help doesn't matter** - what matters is that you need help.

&gt;More than 40 per cent of the reports carried out on disability benefit claimants by the back-to-work assessor Atos are flawed and unacceptable, **according to an audit commissioned by the Government.**

&gt;The lowest grade does not necessarily mean the decision was wrong, **but that a serious error or omission occurred, such as no evidence to justify the recommendations, or inconsistencies in the evidence provided.**

&gt;...

Truth is we have no idea what Comolli did or what Baldini has done, I think people actually believe that without Baldini we wouldn't have bought the 4 players we have. What's to say that AVB didn't ask for Capoue or that Levy didn't pinpoint Soldado? We can't just assume that certain players joined us for whatever reason we chose to believe.

Comolli was at the club when we signed a number of great players. From the telegraph 
&gt;During his time at Spurs Comolli had some clear successes: Dimitar Berbatov, Darren Bent, Didier Zokora and Jonathan Woodgate. He also brought in Luka Modric and Vedran Corluka in the summer before he left, players of evident quality.
&gt;
&gt;Then, though, there were the flops (flop is the word: check the links): Heurelho Gomes, Younes Kaboul, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Kevin-Prince Boateng. Benoit Assou-Ekotto was just not good enough. Another signing, Gareth Bale, was lightweight and went 24 games without being on a winning Spurs team. These players have something in common: they've turned out to be really rather good.

I don't know how much of that was down to Comolli, how much to the scouts and how much to Levy or Ramos or Jol but neither does anyone else. I think it's safe to say that having someone taking care of transfers takes a lot of the workload off of the backs of others. AVB can spend more time preparing the team rather than watching 20 players for every 1 that we sign.

Let's turn that question round to the Daily Mail.

The Guardian has been suffering from falling circulation at a faster rate than the other papers [1] the Daily Mail makes a profit and has a larger share of English news browsing.

Imagine praising the Daily Mail here, you would be burned at the stake.  Yes, those pro-net-censorship pedo hating, sidebar underage bikini loving types actually do have scoops every now and again, last week they were the ones who managed to get a copy of the will which showed that the old lady didn't intend for a political party to get her cash.

If we are to praise someone for doing well, it sure as shit isn't going to be the Guardian, it would have to be the Daily Mail [2].  Ergh.

You're using an single example to suggest this isn't the case?

&gt;We've no right to complain since, you know, North Korea exists.

He's using other countries as extreme examples to demonstrate how non-extreme the UK is by comparison. You're then using the same tactic to assert that a single example makes the UK no different from them. Not quite the same thing, very obviously so...are school-level ripostes the best we can do?

&gt;Even of that is simply expressing a discontent.

But that hasn't happened here. Both the Journo and the partner helping him are still quite free to publish whatever they like, within reason. No charges have been brought, and I haven't seen anything stating that they were detained specifically for publishing X. I could just as easily complain that being stopped and searched for an hour is the evil-government-taking-my-rights-away-and-not-being-allowed-to-make-phone-calls etc, but not many are going to listen because that sort of thing would have to be happening in huge numbers for it to be relevant. It's not as if these guys have been charged, sentenced and are off to a gulag. And again, you're using a single example to suggest that our Police State has arrived. It hasn't.

&gt;If you think detaining journalists is ok, you're either misinformed or deliberately being contrary.

You mean apart from when they're bribing policemen and judges? Journalists don't get a free pass just by virtue of their job - this was the case even before the News of the World demonstrated just how long ago we gave up defining them overall as honourable truth-seekers. You've now gone from inferring the end of freedom as we know it in the UK (without any evidence other than 'it's coming'....sure, and next year will be the year of the linux desktop), to extending his statements for him (as above - instead of, y'know, *asking him*) so that you can carry on presenting your argument. The Daily Mail (quite rightly) doesn't get away with doing this, so it would be nice if some commentators on reddit played by their own 'rules'; however, considering they so often don't it's way past time they realised how such statements are routinely ignored as 'hand-wringing' of exactly the sort he's describing - because the end result is the same. The general pattern seems to be; over-react, then after a few weeks complain about the overreaction (as if it was everyone else) and how doing so muddies the waters and stops progress....tabloid-tastic. In short, you can't complain that the slightest issue means the most extreme, exaggerated result and then complain when someone points out that things aren't actually quite so...well, *extreme* simply because not following your level of exaggeration means they're not considering the issue properly. Sure, we can concentrate on our own national concerns, but not to the extent that the slightest digression is the same as a civil war - it just highlights how first-world our problems really are, and blowing them out of proportion 'because it's such an important subject' is no different to grabbing the pitchforks and burning down a pediatricians because The Sun said so. The fact that so many redditors would completely reject this parallel and insist that it couldn't possibly apply to them speaks volumes when it's so prevalent.

You start your post with 'Your mindset concerns me', but you then don't ask a single question outside of the rhetorical, and really fail to address the points he's making, under the apparent assumption that if you try hard enough, the points he was making will allow the replies you want to concentrate on.

Nobody is saying this event isn't significant or important. What some are saying is that pretending this is the beginning of the end, etc. etc. is not only silly but insulting when compared to a *real* police state.

The Economist has a big advantage in not being a daily, not being in a rush to let you know *this just happened!*

I have seldom read any article on the Guardian that has made me take note of the journalists name.  Even the new statesmen (which is really struggling) has one author I generally follow (Jack of Kent).

The DM article is, I would say also with hindsight, not that bad.

The difference is the DM main page was littered with stuff about Diana (ok, two stories) and has a distinctly non-global news source feel.

They tend to take an issue that they don't agree with, distil it down so that it only contains the extreme view, and infer that anyone who doesn't agree with them is of that.

The Daily Mail does the same, but in a different way, they demonise individual stories to project out that everyone who is in that situation, is the same.  I think many of their staff just loved Abu because of his hook hand.

Stevie... inconsistent?  We're watching different players.  He has the occasional poor performance, but so does every other player in the world.  He's miles ahead of Ben Arfa when it comes to churning out performances though and on a bad day he'll still put in a shift.

When Ben Arfa isn't on his game he's invisible.  Anyone above, when they're having a bad day, still makes an impact.  You can list any player in the world other than Ronaldo and Messi as ""has a bad game sometimes"" because it happens.  The thing is, it happens with Ben Arfa more often than most top players and when things aren't going his way he just checks right out of the match.

He's also pretty injury prone and we have enough of that with Sturridge (and maybe Coutinho... we'll see how he holds up for a full season but he had his share of niggles at Inter).

Willian's also generally a better player when they're both on their game in my opinion.  He's worth the cash and we need the best players we can get our hands on if we're going to make a really strong challenge for 4th place.  Ben Arfa is just a worse version of Willian, and if the money is there to use for him then we shouldn't worry about spending it (and it seems pretty clear that we're not going to spend money we don't have).",0,1376917418,null,0,false,0,cbqtv8k,t3_1knnep,t1_cbqtv8k,t1_cbqs1fv,null,1429777056,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

That may be true that the mafia didn't target innocent family members. However it has since emerged that Miranda wasn't just an innocent family member. He was involved in Greenwalds work. He was in Berlin staying with Laura Poitras with the trip being paid for by the Guardian. He was also in possession of encrypted hard drives being moved from Poitras back to Greenwald.

The sheer fact that Greewald had the audacity to claim that they were targeting family when he had heavily involved his family in his business is astounding. It is incendiary and outright dishonesty.

Does carrying stolen documents containing national secrets suffice for a terrorism investigation? I don't think so and don't think the UK government acted properly in detaining Miranda, but it is possible that that argument would be accepted.

But it is a complete farce the picture that Greenwald has been attempting to paint of his innocent partner suddenly being set upon by the big bad UK government because they wanted to try and intimidate Greenwald.

Also, the fact that they used a law that was implemented to thwart terrorism, to hold him. Where there was no threat/implication/evidence for this. They used a law to strong arm him into a situation that he should never have been in. Don't you think there is an issue here? Abusing laws for purposes other than what they were intended for. 

Lastly, the ultimate issue I have here, is the precedence this sets. What are we going to do when people are getting arrested for pro snowden tweets or journalists being arrested and indefinitely detained under these laws, because they wrote an article that didn't go down to well somewhere.   

I know that is an extreme view, but that kinda thing happens in N.Korea and other places in the world. I wouldn't put it passed the US/UK government to be doing this kind of thing in the near future.

*The Aye-voters rejected the change proposed by the House of Lords to the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, as detailed under Amendment No. 40, which deleted a set of lines across pages 17 and 18 on a version of the Bill I can't find, and replaced them with the paragraph:*

&gt;**The rules of court must comply with the United Kingdom’s obligations under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.**

*This article guarentees right of free trial, right to hear charges brought against you, presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and other fundamental precepts of our Western judicial system.""*

And...

*""Ms Yvette Cooper MP, Pontefract and Castleford voted with the majority (Aye).*

*The Aye-voters rejected the change that the House of Lords had made to clause 3 of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill.*

*The rejected replacement for Clause 3 is filed under Amendment No. 8 in the list of Lord's amendments and would have inserted a subsection at the beginning of the clause that read:*

&gt;**3(1) The court may make a control order against an individual if it (a) is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the individual is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity; (b) considers that it is necessary, for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism, to make a control order imposing obligations on that individual; and (c) has been informed by the Director of Public Prosecutions that there is no reasonable prospect of a successful prosecution of the individual for the terrorism-related activity.**

&gt; Also, the fact that they used a law that was implemented to thwart terrorism, to hold him. Where there was no threat/implication/evidence for this

Again this is likely due to the US putting his name on a list. We already know that they've abused procedure in several cases.

&gt; Don't you think there is an issue here? Abusing laws for purposes other than what they were intended for. 

Sure, but there's no real evidence the UK or border agencies were involved in this abuse.

Look at Aubameyang. He came for a chat, we could afford him, but his ambition exceeded us. Bony is as high profile as we can manage, and even then that's difficult to achieve.

Yes - **the fact** that he was detained under [schedule 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7).

Specifically, this schedule stipulates that:

&gt; 2 (1) An examining officer may question a person to whom this paragraph applies for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b).

40(1)(b), in turn, relates to:

&gt; **40 Terrorist: interpretation.**

&gt; (1) In this Part “terrorist” means a person who... (b) is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

The only way you can be detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (which Miranda was) is if you are suspected of ""instigating, preparing or committing terrorist acts"".

The point of the Terrorist Act is to detain people *seriously suspected of being terrorists*.

&gt; The only way you can be detained under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (which Miranda was) is if you are suspected of ""instigating, preparing or committing terrorist acts"".


As you can see, you are talking total shit. In fact the reason for detention is to **determine** if they fall under that definition. If they already met that definition they would be arrested and detained under the self same act.

Honestly, if you could actually bother to *read* what you posted you'd be much more accurate.

He has his good crosses, sure, but so many of them get blocked or go to the wrong person.  I counted at least three times Gylfi found space in the box and Lennon couldn't get him the ball (and once more but Walker had it, but that is beside the point), either aiming at Soldado who was heavily marked or getting his cross blocked.  Lennon relies on quantity, not quality, because his final ball is *poor*.  It makes him very frustrating and predictable to watch, but he is so good at beating his man and does so much on defense that he has justified his starting position every season.

I haven't seen nearly as much of Townsend, but from what I have seen he looks selfish.  That isn't quite the right word, maybe over confident is better, but he tries to make something spectacular happen.  He will try to dribble through the whole team and get a shot off instead of beating someone and passing it elsewhere.  That is great when it comes off, but more often than not it will fail and we will be a weaker team because of it.

I don't want either of them starting, and I don't think they will.  Chadli will be on the left and Bale/his replacement on the right.  If I absolutely had to choose one, I would pick Townsend.

You keep coming back to this, but you're still completely missing the point - **why** was he considered a suspicious person, likely to instigate, prepare or commit terrorist acts?

&gt;  if he was actually suspected of terrorism

Again, no - you have to be *suspected* of terrorism in order to be detained under schedule 7 at all, and then you are detained for the purposes of discovering whether you *are* a terrorist according to [the definition in Section 40(1)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/40).

&gt; They probably had no clue about him before his name came up.

Right - nobody' cares about the poor schmuck who hactually had to drag him out of the lin and detain him in an office or cell for hours - they care that *he was on the list in the first place*.

&gt; there's no real evidence the UK or border agencies were involved in this abuse

The system failed.  We can't affect US law or procedure, but we can sure as hell kick up a fuss and hurt the government and border agency's reputation over it.

Whether it was their fault for intentionally choosing to put him on the list, or merely their fault for naively and uncritically trusting the judgement of US intelligence services who have already violated national sovereignty and/or broken international treaties in order to get Snowden, the point is that they fucked up.

And by kicking seven shades of shit out of them for it (whether it was an intentional abuse of power, or merely allowing themselves to be a conduit for US abuse of power), we can try to ensure it's that much harder for it to happen again.

In fact, when you think about it, it's *even worse* if we just blithely trusted the USA that he was a suspected terrorist, because it means that our entire surveillance and civil-liberties-infringing anti-terrorism mechanism  can be turned on an individual *without* even any oversight or explicit approval from anyone in this country.

Comedians are known for what they are doing now or what they have done recently, not what they did in the distant past. Doing something big at some point before they started watching comedy means nothing to a current generation of 20 somethings. Unless it was something monumentally timelessly popular (eg Monty Python)

To people younger than me Charlie Higson and Mark Gatiss are authors. 
Emma Thompson is always going to be an actress and screenwriter to most people. To anyone born mid 90s or later Hugh Laurie will be, first and foremost, be Dr Gregory House. Lenny Henrie is a wierd guy from Red Nose Day.

People who don't stay in the public eye, or even those who do stay, but don't update their act, eg Victoria Wood, mean nothing, regardless of how big they were.

In the UK you don't have a single 'score' as such, you have a report with companies like Equifax and Equinox. They know more about you than your mother. 

When you apply for a credit agreement with a company, they will do a credit check and look at this report. It shows what credit you have available, what you've used and if you've been making your payments. So if you have a mobile phone contract it will be on there, and so will any (missed) payments. I believe utilities wind up on there too but I may be mis-remembering that. Your address(es) and names of people you've lived with will probably show up, as will previous credit checks.

Each company looking at the report makes its own decision on what it thinks you can afford/what they are willing to risk, and thus whether to give you credit. So one company offering one product might rate you differently to another company with another type of financial product. 

With less credit history you may get less good deals for financial products. When you apply for credit, the company is taking a financial risk by giving you the loan/whatever and with less credit history it's harder for them to predict how you will do.

Interest rates usually reflect that level of risk, and obviously if you have a solid history of paying for things like a good little worker bee that should reflect well on you, for certain things. On the other hand, credit card companies don't make money from people who never pay them any interest, so getting a card and paying it in full each month may actually make you less desirable as a customer. It probably looks good for getting a mortgage though, I guess. 

So you might think it's worth having some credit just to build up some history, but on the other hand, do you really want to saddle yourself with that? And what for? Some imaginary need to borrow money, maybe, some time in the future?

For what it's worth my parents have never had a credit card, they just use their overdraft when necessary. They still got a mortgage and finance for their vehicles when needed. I don't believe stories about people unable to get loans, it sounds like scaremongering or bad information. There will always be someone willing to loan you money, the key is how much interest they want from you.

My own experience and what I've seen of others leads me to want to lead a life free of any forms of borrowing money. It is a trap.

I already said, he was likely added to a shared intelligence list by the US. That is by *far* the most plausible mechanism.

&gt; Right - nobody' cares about the poor schmuck who hactually had to drag him out of the lin and detain him in an office or cell for hours - they care that he was on the list in the first place.

The vast vast majority of all discussion around this is condemning the UK for being a fascist state, for categorising journalism with terrorism. Now you say that isn't the point? Why are you taking issue with me over this then? That is my whole point, that without knowing the cause behind his detention and the procedures in place, jumping to conclusions is illogical.

&gt; The system failed. We can't affect US law or procedure, but we can sure as hell kick up a fuss and hurt the government and border agency's reputation over it.

Sure, nowt wrong with that. I look forward to seeing the government pressed to explain it. I just don't like the people who believe that this stage is unwarranted and they can just start shouting about their preexisting beliefs as if they're now vindicated.

&gt; In fact, when you think about it, it's even worse if we just blithely trusted the USA that he was a suspected terrorist, because it means that our entire surveillance and civil-liberties-infringing anti-terrorism mechanism can be turned on an individual without even any oversight or explicit approval from anyone in this country.

No, I read these arguments on here and HN and posted them as an example of the levels of hyperbole.

That is jumping to conclusions, that's practically the textbook definition. ""hasn't been contradicted"" is the worst type of statement you can make as it indicates you believe these allegations without backing and require evidence to disprove them, rather than evaluating things on the balance of evidence.

&gt; But nevermind, anyone who tries to say their made up idea with no evidence is just a ""moderate theory"" and ""speculation"" but someone who believes a credible journalist reporting on the story is ""jumping to conclusions"" obviously just has an axe to grind and hopes to rely on semantics and their intelligence to try and ""win"" the argument.

It's been well documented where the Met used terrorism legislation to threaten to arrest people photographing them handling suspects. It was also prove then were confiscating cameras and wiping all the data off them.

These two things are wrong and illegal, you're entitled to film or photograph anywhere publicly, and unless your photographing or filming is literally putting people in danger or *would aid a terrorist* they can't stop you. Likewise if they DO take something off you, they can only delete the specific items which could aid terrorism.

He's talking about political attacks, not violence, the two are simply not comparable. Trust me, if you try to ""take down a government"" with firearms you will lose.

Hi, that’s me. 

I had severe mental (and physical) health problems all my life but a few years ago discovered that by helping others I could deal with my existential depression by giving meaning to my life. Thus by supporting others with long term illnesses (particularly those with long term mental health problems) helped me to manage my own problems. 

I never lost an appeal against an ATOS decision, I had benefits restored and supported people through fraud investigations and criminal proceedings. 

Would you know what “tricks of the trade” I use? The rules. All I do is actually get the relevant arm of the Government to implement its own laws, rules and regulations. I’m not talking about the little known loophole buried deep within legislation I talking about the big principles that can be found on the relevant departments website. 

As this question always comes up in five years of doing this (supporting thousands of cases) I can count the number of cases of benefits fraud I encountered on the fingers of a single foot. 

Myself, and other people who have gone through this, could actually help build a benefits system that would be cheaper and really help people but in the UK the~~y~~ system is built on the premise that the big issues are fraud and malingering not a dysfunctional system.

It's irrelevant whether he was held for an hour or a month - the point is that the UK and/or US governments are using anti-terrorism powers to harrass the loved-ones of journalists, and that by doing so they have to classify them as suspected terrorists merely because they're associated with a journalist legally doing his job.

No, it was an *analogy* - that's where you compare two things that *aren't the same* to illustrate a point of argument.

The point here is that you're downplaying and minimising a significant and indefensible abuse of government powers, describing the facts of the matter but cheerfully (intentionally?) ignoring the legal and policy implications.

To show you how disingenuous this was, I offered another case where everyone agrees the actions of the intelligence services were reprehensible and indefensible, and treated *it* the same way as your line of argument here is treating the Miranda incident.

And so your agenda is revealed.

&gt; and that by doing so they have to classify them as suspected terrorists merely because they're associated with a journalist legally doing his job

Everyone can be classified as a 'suspected terrorist' under the logic you're using here. Therefore it means nothing.

&gt; No, it was an analogy - that's where you compare two things that aren't the same to illustrate a point of argument.

If you think comparing shooting a person to death vs detaining them is a good analogy then you've run out of them.

&gt; The point here is that you're downplaying and minimising a significant and indefensible abuse of government powers

Neither significant nor indefensible. You've failed to provide a reason for either.

&gt; To show you how disingenuous this was, I offered another case where everyone agrees the actions of the intelligence services were reprehensible and indefensible, and treated it the same way as your line of argument here is treating the Miranda incident.

&gt; It's what we on the grown-up world call a qualitative analogy, not a quantitative one.

It's what we in the educated and patient world call bullshit, conflating two issues so that emotions based on one are applied to the other. The sad thing is that I've debated many many people who use this tactic and few are as arrogant and blatent as you.

&gt; Actually, as I carefully laid out for you in this comment, you have to be suspected of terroristm to be detained under schedule 7, and then the detaining officers use that time to determine whether you are considered a terrorist or not.

Once again as you feel you have no obligation to actually read the full law instead of just quoting sentences you find:

&gt; 2

&gt; (1)An examining officer may question a person to whom this paragraph applies for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b).

&gt; (2)This paragraph applies to a person if—(a)he is at a port or in the border area, and(b)the examining officer believes that the person’s presence at the port or in the area is connected with his entering or leaving Great Britain or Northern Ireland [F1or his travelling by air within Great Britain or within Northern Ireland].

Taxes? Obviously not. The Americans are taxed much less than us.

Higher average cost of living? Have you been to America and seen the prices they pay for everything? Much cheaper than here... almost literally anything, we often pay as much as twice the price (it's not called 'Rip Off Britain' for nothing). Obviously like in the UK there are cheaper and more expensive places, but if you compare our cheapest places to their cheapest places, they will win most likely in both prices and the taxes they pay on the items, and the same goes for the most expensive places. But hey, at least we get a lot for our high taxes. I mean, we get free university education! Oops, sorry - £3,000 a year. That's a lot, but... oops! Sorry, £9,000 a year now. Ridiculous; the Americans actually have a better system than us in this regard now, with the huge amount of scholarships they have and the state schools that charge less, etc. Well, at least we get healthcare right?

So you can only be referring to wages. [Here's a link to a wiki article on countries by average wage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage). Unsurprisingly, the US thrashes the UK in diposable income.

As for b), you'll note that I never said that living in the UK is objectively worse. In my opinion it is though.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;What are the strengths/weaknesses of Lennon's game?

Lennon adds width and maturity. Coming up against someone like Utd you want a guy that will stick to the system and that can be trusted. To win big games the team needs to work like clockwork and I think after 8 years in the EPL Lennon knows how to play his role. To criticize him, he doesn't offer nearly enough end product. Other right wingers stats beat him easy:

Scum: Walcott: 14 goals and 12 assists

Everton: Mirallas: 6 goals and 6 assists

And those well below spurs:

Norwich: Snodgrass: 6 goals 8 assists

Liverpool: Sturridge: 11 goals 5 assists

That isn't even comparing him to the likes of Oscar/Tevez who sit higher up the ladder. The point I am making is that in a 4-3-3 where the goals need to come from the front 3 one of our men shouldn't be offering less than the likes of Robert Snodgrass. After 8 years I am not convinced he is able to rectify this issue either. 

&gt;What are the strengths/weaknesses of Townsend's game?

Townsend, at the very least offers a direct threat to the opponent at all times. He is always looking to pick up the ball and drive goal wards, often with success. At his best he has the ability to overwhelm opposition FB's providing a game long line of attack, his game against arsenal for QPR sticks out as one where he obliterated the LB (Nacho) and constantly pinged balls in behind the defence or on target (forcing some good saves). Therein lies the difference between the two players, Townsend will beat his man and translate the advantage into a goal scoring opportunity whereas Lennon simply does not. Townsend unfortunately comes with a few issues. He is young, raw and not even played a full season worth of EPL games. He has off field issues after being stupidly caught for gambling and publicly stating he will leave if he doesn't get what he wants.

&gt;Who do you believe to be the better player? Explain.

I think Townsend. He essentially was QPR during that loan and his spells for spurs last season were great too (he earned the foul which led to Vertonghen's goal in the 1-0 win over Swansea). Granted spurs are performing on multiple fronts I would ease him in via the EL to ensure he has his mojo and then drop Lennon for him (assuming Chadli doesn't prove to be a God).

&gt;Would either player make it into a fully fit 11 at this point? Who/Why?

Probably neither. I would run a 4-3-3 fully fit with Chadli - Soldado - Bale locking down the front spots. That isn't a poor reflection on either player, just that Bale is the big fish and I would put him on the right so that he can constantly shoot. Neither Townsend or Lennon have impressed me on the left so I would opt for Chadli as he seems a more natural fit. 

&gt;If you had to sell one player, who/why?

A replacement would have to be coming in and I would sell Lennon. He fetches more coin and has probably peaked skill wise. Whilst some may argue that Lennon is a better player than Townsend I would note that it isn't by much (if any) and granted his young age I would rather develop that potential (and he is a spurs youth player to boot!). Of course, if Townsend's attitude towards game time looks to be an issue, I would shift him without hesitation.

I really wish you would. As I said I think the whole concept of 'checking up' on people is ridiculously expensive and difficult. If someone doesn't have enough to live, *they need help* not a 'prove you are worthy enough' test that inevitably leads to a circle of anxiety and/or depression.

The entire system like you said is engineered on the premise that people are trying to screw the system. Imagine if the NHS was like that. Imagine for a minute, people walking into the hospital and being asked to prove they're ill before they get treatment.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; Everyone can be classified as a 'suspected terrorist' under the logic you're using here.

No... you're confusing cause and effect.

People have to be suspected of terrorism to be detained under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

That doesn't mean anyone can be legitimately suspected of terrorism - it means that the government has to officially suspect someone in order to use the Act's powers to detain them.

And that's the whole problem - the government (US or UK) is *abusing* the Act by classifying innocent individuals that nobody has any reason to suspect as ""suspected terrorists"" so that they can harrass and inconvenience them.

&gt; If you think comparing shooting a person to death vs detaining them is a good analogy then you've run out of them.

Jesus Christ - [read a fucking book](http://www.regentsprep.org/Regents/math/ALGEBRA/AD1/qualquant.htm).  I just *told* you it wasn't a quantitative comparison, but you're still not getting it.

&gt; Once again as you feel you have no obligation to actually read the full law instead of just quoting sentences you find:

Once *again*, [you're mistakenly assuming 40(1)(b) refers to someone who is suspected of being a terrorist, but that's inaccurate](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1knrqa/is_glenn_greenwalds_journalism_now_viewed_as_a/cbqw82z).  Read the definition - it defines a person who *is* legally considered a terrorist for the purposes of the Act.

""Detaining someone on suspicion of falling under 40(1)(b)"" doesn't mean ""detaining then on suspicion of being a suspected terrorist"" - it means ""detaining them on the suspicion they **are** a terrorist"".

Or, as I and other posters have been trying to hammer through your skull for the entire thread, you can't be arrested under schedule 7 unless the UK government **already** suspects you of **being** a terrorist.

Or, to put it another way, *anyone detained under schedule 7 is by definition a suspected terrorist*, or they can't be detained under it.

&gt; I'm even holding back a fragment that destroys your case entirely

Bullshit - put up or shut up.  Nobody on this thread is buying your inaccurate reading of the law concerned, and you're getting downvoted through the floor because of it.

If I'm wrong and you have an ace in the hole then now's the time to play it, before they're so downvoted nobody can even *see* your comments.  There's no point in being right if inaccurate, factually-incorrect statements that misinform the reader are the ones that everyone sees.

Ask for written copies of everything from everyone and when you receive them question everything about them.  

Ask for copies of the qualifications of the ATOS assessors to ensure that they are qualified to make such a judgment, then ask for the translation and support to ensure the qualifications are of an acceptable for a doctor working in the UK. 

Make a formal complaint and contact your MP over this.  

Ask for every appointment to be rescheduled.

Like I said, it was inference. If your first post wasn't implying that this is a non-issue being blown out of proportion and is nothing for us to worry about then I guess my grasp on the english language isn't quite as good as I thought.

&gt;These two sentences don't match up. We don't really have any evidence of the latter being done by any UK agency. As far as we know the US could have added his name to 'Terrorists' list that gets distributed to their partners. That could be the start and end of the issue as far as the UK goes.

I don't see how those sentences don't line up? Regardless, if this is the case that he ended up on a terrorist database then how exactly is it that the line of questioning went down the route of his and his boyfriends journalism work and Edward Snowden? Nothing about actual terrorism. If reporting on whistle blowing is enough to get you flagged on a database then isn't that equally as scary?

&gt;FWIW you called me 'part of the problem' first.

I didn't explicitly say **you** that though did I? I simply suggested that if you (plural) aren't bothered by this then your (plural) apathy is what is going to give the government the power to continue to slowly but surely erode your (plural, see: our) rights.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"&gt; The Americans are taxed much less than us.

At first glance, yes. When you look in detail, it's not so different. Let's go for someone earning the UK average wage (£26,500) [source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20442666) = $40,100 (xe.com current spot rate of 1GBP = 1.56651USD).

For that wage a [standard UK tax calculator](http://www.listentotaxman.com/index.php) gives annual deductions of £3,332 income tax and £2,202.24 NI, which is a total deduction of £5,534.24 or 21.2%.

A [standard US tax calculator](http://us.thetaxcalculator.net/) gives a deduction of $3,097.65 Federal income tax and $3,067.65 social security, giving a total deduction of $6,165.30 or 15.3%. But wait! In most US states you also pay a State income tax. Let's look at Pennsylvania (because it's the State I'm most familiar with -- my wife's family lives there): they have a [flat rate of 3.07% of income](http://www.irs.com/articles/pennsylvania-state-taxes). So that's another $1,231.07 in taxes, making a grand total of $7,396.37 or 18.4% of your income. That's not significantly different to the UK total -- certainly not enough to justify a claim of ""much less"" tax.

Of course in both countries there is also a city tax / council tax, as well as sales taxes / VAT. It's pretty much impossible to give a generic value for those as they vary so hugely from place to place (not VAT, obviously).

&gt; Higher average cost of living.

To a degree, yes. Certainly some kinds of foods and a lot of electronic consumer goods tend to be cheaper in the USA, but you can make that comparison against the USA and almost any other EU country, it's not a UK-specific malady. ""Rip Off Britain"" is nothing more than a slogan used to sell newspapers and TV programmes, Britain is in general no better and no worse than any other country in that respect, except for the fact that as a nation we love nothing more than finding fault with the country we live in.

&gt; So you can only be referring to wages.

Average wagew in the USA and UK are actually extremely similar. However the number isn't really a meaningful figure in either country. For example whereas £25,000 would let you have a survivable but by no means extravagant lifestyle in London, in Northern Ireland it would put you in the top 15% of earners. Ditto for the difference in wages between, say, NYC or SF, and a small town in South Virginia or Kansas.

You linked to the HDI wiki page. Interesting. In the table below the one you linked is one which lists countries by inequality-adjusted HDI, which is probably a far better measure unless you happen to be super-rich. And in that case the UK and the USA are very similar.

&gt; Maybe something else is important to you, perhaps the great weather we have in the UK?

Yes, the weather here really is far better. We rarely *need* air conditioning, tornado shelters, earthquake-proof buildings (OK fair enough, earthquakes aren't weather!), hurricane levees or personal snowplough attachements for the front of our cars.

Other things which are quite nice are the ability to fall ill or get hit by a bus without having a credit card on you, the generally lower levels of racial tension and violent crimes in our cities, and the fact that several dozen different countries are just a short plane ride away.

Don't get me wrong, I have a great affection for the USA and it offers many good things.

&gt; An examining officer may exercise his powers under this paragraph whether or not he has grounds for suspecting that a person falls within section 40(1)(b).

However, you'll note that this does not say that the detention *doesn't* imply suspicion of terrorism - it merely says the officer concerned can exercise it regardless of whether he has *any valid, articulable reason* to suspect someone.

In fact, if you look at point (1) (same section):

&gt; An examining officer may question a person to whom this paragraph applies **for the purpose of determining whether he appears to be a person falling within section 40(1)(b).**

Ie, the power to detain only exists for the purposes of detaining suspected terrorists to determine whether they *are* legally considered terrorists or not.

To further support this point, you'll notice that all [the powers granted to the police under Schedule 5 of the Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/part/V) stipulate that the officer must ""reasonably suspect"" the person is a terrorist under 40(1)(b).  Ie, these powers aren't granted willy-nilly for any purpose the officer wants - they're specifically anti-terrorism powers, to be used solely when the officer believes the person is a terrorist.

The only difference in border areas is that officials do not have to give grounds for their suspicion.

The fact that officials are permitted to exercise this power without even the cursory requirement to come up with a plausible *reason* to deem someone a terrorism suspect just makes it even worse.

It's very hard to use words like 'complicit' and 'abuses on its behalf' when there is no evidence of complicity. That is like saying that because someone put your name on a list of warrants to be executed, that the executing officers are 'complicit'. That is not an accurate assessment.

Like people have said, very few people (relative) seem to actively is like Eccleston. The issue is that he really doesn't hold a candle to what Tennant and Smith would do on the show. 

It has less to do with 9 and more a function of, well, think of every long running show you love. Now go back to season 1 of that show. What stands out? It's new, it's trying to figure out where it wants to go, find its legs so to speak, and overall the show feels a little rougher than it would later. Also, more often than not the best moments of the series are yet to come. 

Well 9 is exclusive to that first tentative season. He has 13 episodes while the show is trying to find its footing, and when he's first introduced he's extremely mysterious and not really the main character (in the sense that Rose is the protagonist for at least half the episodes that season). 

Now people get to look back on 6 additions seasons and nearly a dozen full-length specials that comprise the series, and he's in none of them. He just has these first 13 that are sometimes dodgy and you don't know really him for half of them (Dalek marks a huge turning point). 

Finally you get the outside stuff - the fact that Eccelston quit before the second episode had aired, that he wanted nothing to do with the 50th or anything else with the show, etc.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;It's not speculation I'm complaining about. It's perfectly fine to say ""I wonder if this was politically motivated, did Cameron or his cronies have any involvement in this?"" What it is not fine to say is ""Ugh the UK is such a fascist state, so much for freedom of speech!"".

While I disagree that the UK is *literally* a fascist state, I have recently began to question at what point we would recognise our slide into one. If we wait too long for all the ""hard evidence"" it may be too late to do something etc. 

&gt; The public are really not a good benchmark to use. The idiocy of people gathered in groups is beyond comparison.

While I agree that large groups of people are usually pretty dim as a collective, institutions in a democracy require public confidence. A police officer is just a bloke with a badge and a stick when all is said and done, their authority is based upon people thinking they have authority. If people start distrusting and actively resisting institutions like the police and the government, it usually either leads to a collapse or oppression. 

&gt;What facts? We only know that they were detained, we don't even know why. I'd say it's a bit too soon to start claiming this.

Well we do know that:

a) He was detained under the terrorism act 

and

b) the terrorism act is designed to be used to detain suspects of terrorism.


That means he was either detained for the purpose the law intended (i.e. he was detained as he was a legitimate terrorist suspect) or it was used for a purpose not intended (i.e. he was detained without any reasonable suspicion he was a terrorist).

Now, **so far** there has been no word to suggest there is anything about him linked to terrorism, or why he would be assumed to be a terrorist. *Maybe* there was some sort of real intelligence for the police to follow, and if that is the case then I'll obviously support the decision.

If there is some sort of press release where this is all explained and it turns out there was legitimate concern he was a **terrorist** then I will entirely agree it was the right call (though I wont disagree with the scrutiny it has received).

&gt;I kinda can. It's not like spotting smoke, it's like trying to fight with the officers arresting you because you match a description. You may know you haven't carried out the acts, but as long as they have good reason to question you then they have every right to detain you.

Even if he was added to some sort of ""anti-terrorism"" list by the US erroneously though the police would still have to detain him (in fact it would be their duty). This doesn't explain the unusual length of time he was held for, it doesn't explain the reports he was questioned not about terrorism but NSA leaks and it doesn't explain why his media items were confiscated. 


In my opinion though, I suspect the government or the police wont be forthcoming, and years in the future when there is a different government and different police chief it will finally get revealed it was a bad decision all along. I don't think Britain is a fascist state, but I think abuses of the Police that have been revealed recently seem to be going un-curbed, and if the trend continues by the time we wake up to what's happening it may be too late.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"&gt; According to the Terrorism Act 2000, at the border an official may detain and question anyone for this purpose.

See the other thread - all it says is that the officer may exercise the powers ""whether or not he has *grounds* for suspecting the target of terrorism"", not ""for any reason whatsoever"".

I would argue that the rest of the wording in the Act makes it pretty clear the powers are intended to be used to identify and detain suspected terrorists, and all that clause says is that the officer isn't required to provide rational, articulable grounds ro suspecting anyone in particular.

That doesn't necessarily mean he can detain someone who he *doesn't* suspect is a terrorist - just that if he suspects someone and detains/searches them he doesn't have to give grounds for it.

&gt; That is not the requirement of the law

I didn't say it was the requirement of the law.  I was caricaturing your position, in the hope you'd say ""no"".

The point is that according to our legal tradition you have a right to the assumption of innocence - you can't say ""the government suspects that everyone is a terrorist until proven otherwise"", because that's clearly against most of the last thousand years of legal precedent in this country.

They may be able to detain someone on the suspcion of terrorism without providing a clear rationale for it, but that's no the same as saying everyone is automatically suspected by the government all the time.

All it says is that officials in border areas can arbitrarily *start* suspecting someone of terrorism without giving any reason why... and far from being reassuring, that's frankly a pretty hideous precedent all on its own.

I like watching excitable managers. AVB and Rodgers are my two favourite to watch, and I think their energy pours into the assistants and players. That said, I don't really enjoy all of Di Canio's actions as he seems to have gone off the end of crazy a bit during his.

As an example of energetic managers being fun to watch, check out the celebration by AVB after Bale's winner against West Ham last season. Lots of energy, the player runs directly over to him, and they celebrate together. Stuff like that makes football even greater!

You made this claim, and provide absolutely no evidence. Meanwhile the government audit found that the reason so many assessments were overturned on appeal was because the assessment process was inadequate.

The appeals are actually quite thorough, and conducted by the civil service. There is no evidence that gaming this system is contributing in any significant way to the number if successful appeals. Indeed there is evidence against it, given the detail we have on those appeals, and the concurrence of the audit. 

The notion that a significant amount of people are ""playing the system"" is the sort of daily mail fantasy that resulted in the creation of this monstrosity in the first place.

Credit cards are a must use if possible when buying anything £100 or over but on the caveat you pay them off in full before you owe interest. How they are of benefit is as follows:

1) Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. This makes credit card companies jointly liable for any purchase £100 or over regardless of how little was actually put on the credit card. So basically if you buy a washing machine, it goes faulty and the retailer has either gone bust or won't fix it then the credit card company is liable even if you only put £1 on the credit card and paid the rest in cash.

2) Cashback. I do ALL my spending on my cashback credit card making sure I pay it off every month. The annual cashback is the equivalent of a weeks extra pay.

3) Foreign spending. Another card I have I use purely abroad. I get charged nothing for currency conversion and nothing for withdrawing cash from a cashpoint so when I go abroad if I need cash I withdraw it when I'm there and do any spending on it. Again, only works if you pay it off in full the next bill.

4) Credit card stoozing. Some cards will give you a cash balance transfer  or interest free spending for a fixed period such as 18 months. Transfer the balance or put the money you would have spent into a high interest account, leave it there for the duration earning interest, make the minimum payments and pay off the balance at the end of the period and you've again potentially the equivalent of a weeks free wages depending on the balance they give you.

&gt; If people start distrusting and actively resisting institutions like the police and the government, it usually either leads to a collapse or oppression


I agree, but any time you ask a large group of people about subjects like this you'll get the loudest responses from people with an axe to grind, often because they are convicted criminals (in my experience)

&gt; If there is some sort of press release where this is all explained and it turns out there was legitimate concern he was a terrorist then I will entirely agree it was the right call (though I wont disagree with the scrutiny it has received).


This is part of my concern, that we have no information whatsoever on exactly what caused him to be detained. It could have been at random, it could have been a name on a list, it could have been that he was acting suspiciously. There are many potential factors and I feel it is important to wait and learn what the facts are before making judgements. That is what I have been arguing against this entire thread, but people simply don't want to hear a moderate voice.

&gt; I think abuses of the Police that have been revealed recently seem to be going un-curbed, and if the trend continues by the time we wake up to what's happening it may be too late.

* A front 3 of Willian Suarez Sturridge with Coutinho behind them would be incredible going forward, but we need a workhorse in mid in front of Gerrard/Lucas to do the heavy lifting and closing down (Hendo).

true,fragglet,null,null,"&gt; It's very hard to use words like 'complicit' and 'abuses on its behalf' when there is no evidence of complicity. That is like saying that because someone put your name on a list of warrants to be executed, that the executing officers are 'complicit'. That is not an accurate assessment. They are simply following an established and reasonable procedure, it is the actions of those who introduced the name illegitimately that should be condemned.

When I say ""complicit"" I mean that the UK is acting on the US's behalf in assisting in harassment campaign against journalists. Of course we should condemn whoever added them to that list; it is also right to complain to our own government for assisting in that abusive campaign. 

If the US uses that list in an abusive way (and there are already multiple documented accounts of different people being abused in this way) then an appropriate response may be to pressure our government to withdraw from participating in it. I doubt anything that extreme will ever happen, but the very least, applying political pressure will encourage our own politicians to engage in diplomacy with the US that may improve the situation.

&gt; Just following orders is a complete defence to lawful actions. Please don't perpetuate this erroneous myth.

Not an ""erroneous myth"". It may be a legal defence but it's not a moral one. People involved in an evil system have a duty to speak out against it and resist it.

&gt; There's no actual denial of the right to silence (which is not absolute in the UK), they are also not arrested so as far as I know that's why there is no right to counsel. I'm no legal scholar, but this is my understanding of the issue.

""It is a criminal offence for the detainee to refuse to answer questions -- regardless of the grounds for that refusal or otherwise fully cooperate with the police.""

""A person who is questioned under paragraph 2 or 3 must—
(a) give the examining officer any information in his possession which the officer requests;""

But again: what's legal is not always what's right. It may not legally be an ""arrest"" but the result is broadly the same (detainment, search, interrogation).

That's fair enough. I also think on the evidence it's completely reasonable to think otherwise without being called out for jumping to conclusions. I think it's completely plausible that he was stopped simply because he is Glenn Greenwald's partner.  

I said as far as I'm aware because I didn't want to claim to be certain about something unless I am. Which, oddly, I thought you'd appreciate given your stance against jumping to conclusions. You state you have a problem with his devices being taken. Why is that? Because he's not been charged, because he could be totally innocent? Because that is literally what I am saying: if he is innocent they should not be able to take his devices.

I misspoke re: arrested. Let me phrase it the correct way:
You're saying that you see nothing suspicious or wrong with the partner of a journalist responsible for releasing classified information being detained based on no evidence?

When I said no-fly list I was referring to the fact that he was detained and therefore unable to fly as a result of being on a list. I think that was obvious. 

&gt; That is how warrants and lists work.

That is, apparently, how *this* list worked. I'm certainly not comfortable with my government detaining anyone purely on the say so of the U.S. *without supporting evidence*. I don't think that the police in this country execute warrants without at least knowing why, so I am curious as to why you state ""that's how warrants work"".

I'm unclear why you think you've ""won"" this point.

My reading (which you have yet to conclusively refute) is that suspicion of terrorism is necessary, but articulation of the reasoning for it by the arresting official is not... which would mean that in order to be detained under the Act you would still have to be suspected of terrorism, even if the arresting officer isn't obliged to explain (or even privately hold) a valid reason as to why.

&gt; Yes, what happened seems to be rather over the top and we should find out why it happened.

Agreed - I'm glad we agree on that particular point, at least. ;-)

&gt; No, it's not some horrible abuse of law or procedures or anything other than most likely the US adding someone's name to a list.

That's pretty much my point though - it *is* an abuse of procedure, albeit possibly by the USA instead of the UK government.

Equally, however, we can't control what the USA does or who the USA chooses to abuse its legal system to persecute.  However, we *can* shout, scream and hurl faeces at the UK government - either for making this choice to harrass innocent people themselves, or for uncritically giving the USA *carte blanche* to abuse our legal system to persecute innocent people.

&gt; I agree, but any time you ask a large group of people about subjects like this you'll get the loudest responses from people with an axe to grind, often because they are convicted criminals (in my experience)

I have to disagree, I worked for nearly 2 years as a Youth Worker and was never convicted of any crime (though let's face it, everyone has committed one at some point, there are so many laws to break!). I saw how a lot of police officer treated young kids who had done nothing wrong. 

You will naturally get some criminals complain the police are eroding their privacy in order to put a stop to their crimes, the problem is always who decides where the line is drawn between crime prevention and privacy? In this country the Police used to simply answer to the IPCC which was entirely consistent of police officers, not exactly the most inspiring control over overly keen policing in my opinion. 

&gt; There are many potential factors and I feel it is important to wait and learn what the facts are before making judgements. That is what I have been arguing against this entire thread, but people simply don't want to hear a moderate voice.

Yeah I get your point, but I guess not everyone is also keen to sound moderate about something they are passionate about. All too often on the internet the ""moderate"" voices get drowned out or accused of picking the ""other"" side. 

Personally I think you may be a little naive if you think the government will have a good reason for how they treated him (even if the detention itself was necessary, the conditions, length of time etc will likely not be). However, you are technically right that there could be legitimate concerns, and respect someone who doesn't want to make their mind up quite yet. 

&gt;I think that people have been saying this for as long as I can remember. Yet when fascism actually did arise it came with clear indicators and the UK was a bastion of opposition.

Oh sure, I have a strong feeling this is the case, the US doesn't exactly have a massively respectable history in this regard.

&gt; You state you have a problem with his devices being taken. Why is that? Because he's not been charged, because he could be totally innocent? Because that is literally what I am saying: if he is innocent they should not be able to take his devices.

Right exactly, I would hope they had good reason to seize his equipment, but I'm not willing to jump to a conclusion either way.

&gt; I misspoke re: arrested. Let me phrase it the correct way: You're saying that you see nothing suspicious or wrong with the partner of a journalist responsible for releasing classified information being detained based on no evidence?

I don't say there's nothing suspicious or wrong, I say that jumping to conclusions and accusing the UK of being a police state based on entirely one side of the story and no real facts is idiotic. I don't want to accuse you of doing this but it has been done elsewhere repeatedly.

&gt; When I said no-fly list I was referring to the fact that he was detained and therefore unable to fly as a result of being on a list. I think that was obvious. 

The 'no-fly list' is a list of people not permitted to board an aircraft. No matter what, this is apparently not the case here.

&gt; I don't think that the police in this country execute warrants without at least knowing why, so I am curious as to why you state ""that's how warrants work"". 

Because this is how warrants work. Officers are given a name, a probable location, a physical description and a summary of the reason behind the warrant. It may be ""Fraud"", it may be ""Murder"", but as far as I am aware it does not say ""Murder of X, Y on Z based on evidence provided by I, J, K and physical evidence serial # 1234""",0,1376930960,null,0,false,0,cbqy41h,t3_1knrqa,t1_cbqy41h,t1_cbqy05b,null,1429775004,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

This is what reality TV shows love, it's what they pay people to subject them to.

Sadly it's got utterly no business being done in this context, at all.

The receptionist probably has little choice but to take the ""fake claim"" line, because if she doesn't she has to simply say ""The whole system is shit and I try to smooth it out as best I can, but I can't""

The problem is that what the government are proposing to do is fair and proper.

Realign benefits. Make sure work pays. Make sure people on long term sick are actually unfit for work. Help people find work. 

Those are all noble, and essential goals.

What they've done instead is a slap dash attempt (and in 10 years we'll no doubt find out corrupt to some degree) which results in mental cruelty to people who are at their most vulnerable.

Or he does what he has done. Full speed ahead, the ends justify the means. And he does the utterly immoral and unforgivable things he has done - vilify the poor, lie with statistics and furiously deny it's all a shitfest.

If IDS had any integrity he'd sort it out. He clearly has none.

Does Clegg really believe that his hand guiding the tories away from their worst policies is really worth being involved in this? Only he can answer that.

And Milliband has a very important role to do. And he's not doing it at all. Milliband should be the voice of reason encouraging the government a way to back down gracefully and do the right thing. Instead he grabs any opportunity to throw punches and grab headlines (poorly) and the implication is the government will look bad if they change direction.

The answer is to have advocates who work on behalf of claimants, who will assess perhaps 10 cases to every 1 case that's done by ATOS/DWP with the view of spotting opportunities to contest the decision - where they believe someone needs help sorting their case out, or where they believe it may not have been done correctly.

Once that's in place, any time advisers cock it up it will be monitored. The errors being picked up will push the number of errors in total downwards and all advisers will be under pressure to avoid mistakes/complacency. The bad ones will be quickly exposed. That's how the private sector works.

I tried my best and I failed I'm sorry to say. I've made a difference to my local community and that is very apparent by the fact unemployment is still dropping and it is a far more pleasant place to live but although I have discussed this with my MP (Who may well be a future PM) and been invited to the houses of parliament to discussed this with MPs and civil servants there is no interest in actually implementing systems that work, the daily mail reading public would never support the things that I can prove work thus any political party that implemented them would not ever get elected again. However my MP is happy to claim the credit for the result of work that he will not support (even though he was directly responsible of the success of a scheme built on similar principles before he was an MP). 

&gt; Universal benefit.

I considered we need to decided what a person needed in their life to live, a minimum baseline level (which I would base on a updated Maslow's hierarchy of needs) and we needed to ensure everyone could achieve that level. 

So if you were below it we supported you to achieve and if you were above it you supported others to achieve that level. For example, if you were pulling in £90 000 a year you would not get child support, if you were a pensioner that is worth several millions you would not get winter fuel alliance. If you were smart enough to do an Oxford degree but could not afford it we would pay (but you would pay us back if you achieve more than baseline income).  If you came up with a revolutionary new product that made money you would be able to live off that that income, but you would support the education of the person after you.


I knew the argument would have been that you needed to force people to work rather than to allow them to sit at home all day but if we had created citizens that considered an ideal life is to sit and watch mind numbing TV all day that should have raised very big questions about our society not its citizens. 


An old challenge was “think not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country” I considered we all needed to ask “what world do I want to live in? And what can I do to work towards that?”


Einstein stated that the principle reason for the establishment of a socialist society was to challenge the predatory nature of capitalism. With the growth of the military–industrial complex and the fact that the purpose of intelligence agencies was to gather information on the populous and feedback the message of fear I think we should have asked the big questions.


The only tool that could have started that process is the internet, never had any population had the opportunity to access so much information and discuss it. 


If you are still reading you’ve probably started asking why is this relevant to the starting point of benefits, I ran a programme that got people with mental health problems that had faced a life time of unemployment into employment, and I achieved a 100% success rate. This programme still runs and now makes a profit, with just the cost of Maggie’s state funeral I could have done this across the country and still handed money back.

I wanted a world that gave people opportunities not barriers.

As we never got to the point that we started thinking rather than believing nothing ever changed.

I thought it was worth it, with one big BUT.

It took me two and a half years to make it through the first six seasons, and that was mainly because of the missing episodes. (As a comparison, Seasons 7-10 have only taken me about two to three months.) Those reconstructions are somewhat difficult to watch. Not only are the stories much slower than modern Who, but it's hard to keep focused on an episode when all you have is still images and generally poor-quality audio.

Having said that, some of my favorite stories are missing (*The Power of the Daleks* and *The Enemy of the World* being good examples). So YMMV.

&gt; Your point about the warrant may be valid, but you'd never arrest someone for a crime and then question them without any idea of the charges, would you? That would be stupid. Where would you start with your questions?

The difference is that when arrested under a warrant, the person is detained and transported to those with information about his crime and the ability to question or detain him as appropriate.

Because Miranda wasn't arrested, simply detained, this was not an option.

I think this is what it comes back to for me. Honestly I just think we should do away with counting everyone in, out, checking their incomes, lets make it a big, fat, simple, **Universal**:

 - are they entitled to Universal Benefit? (Meet same criteria as NHS essentially)
 - yes?
 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income

It would mean even the Lords of the land would get whatever this basic income would be. But the beauty is that it then invests them in the welfare system. They don't see it as a benefit or a cost, they see it as an *institution*, like the NHS. That UK citizens can never fall below a basic level. People are far more compliant paying taxes into institutions that form part of their country's fibre, than paying taxes that may be given out on a complex range of criteria to certain people with certain needs but not other people with other needs.

As an added benefit, with this system, benefits is no longer anything to be ashamed about. You get it. I get it. David Cameron gets it. Nobody is ashamed of walking into A&amp;E when they need medical attention, why should anyone be ashamed of having the money to buy food?

I think these stats would support the majority of your argument above and I'd have to agree that Townsend would be my pick to start on the right. Lennon is too predictable and causes our team to become one-dimensional on the right. 

Townsend is over-confident at times, but I'd argue that's what makes him a better player. Isn't that what we value in Bale as well? The ability to beat a man, cut in, and take a shot is what makes his play dangerous. I'm not saying Townsend is anywhere NEAR the level of Bale right now, but I think he could develop and has a much higher ceiling than Lennon. Another big plus is that Townsend isn't afraid to track back and defend either- while he's always trying to take players on in the attacking half (green stars), his stats show plenty of successful defensive tackles (green crosses) in his own half.

true,fragglet,null,null,"&gt; But this is not a good use of the word 'complicit' as complicity requires knowledge. I call upon my previous analogy, that this is equivalent to assuming complicity of the arresting officers because a warrant was improperly issued.

I reject your attempt at reasoning by analogy (which generally speaking is a practice that almost never leads to good thinking). I'm talking about the political realities of the situation. There is a value in protesting that the UK is involved in this.

&gt; It is an erroneous myth. Only in situations of clearly immoral behaviour can you invoke this, detaining someone for a few hours as their name appears on a list of potential terrorists certainly doesn't qualify when the previous invocations have been for torture, murder and genocide.

Can't say I agree. Many people face moral choices every day: even if it's not on the scale of ""torture, murder and genocide"" we face choices that can inflict suffering and unpleasantness on other people. To go all fluffy idealist for a moment, it's whether you're helping to build a better world or not. In the case of the border agents, [they knew who he was](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23750289):

&gt; ""He told the BBC police did not ask Mr Miranda ""a single question"" about terrorism but instead asked about what ""Guardian journalists were doing on the NSA stories"".

The moral choice for someone like that is whether to be complicit in the harassment of the family of a journalist, or not. Someone in that position still has other options available to them: they can protest to superiors, make use of whistleblower systems, refuse to participate, or just outright quit their job. As the saying goes, all that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.

That said I don't want to imply that like I'm placing the majority of the culpability on the border agents, because I'm not.

&gt; As far as I know this section of the law has never been tested and it's unlikely it would stand up in full against the ECHR. The actual section involved with offences is #18. It's not quite as clear cut as it might seem.

I agree. But I find it worrying that such an interpretation is already being banded around.",0,1376933126,null,0,1376933439,0,cbqyy4x,t3_1knrqa,t1_cbqyy4x,t1_cbqy81b,null,1429774614,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

People are banned from wearing helmets and hoods in some places because they are well known devices that have been widely used to hide identities during crimes. it also takes two seconds to remove a hood or helmet to conduct their business, and they can pop them back on when they are leaving.

Very different to a soldier walking into a pub in their full uniform. They would be very recognisable in it as they would not only stick out like a sore thumb, but they would have badges on identifying which military branch, their rank and what regiment/squadron/ship they belong to. Depending on the uniform they could even have their full name on their uniform.

Besides, if a member of the Armed Forces in plain clothes going into a pub no one is going to know they are in the military from looking at them and no one will assume they are in the military.

I think what bugs me about pieces like this one is that I too feel that the ATOS situation is a royal clusterfuck that is actually damaging people's lives. It probably comes over as a bit like ""some of my mates are black"" or whatever, but my oldest friend has been dealing with them for a while now and I know what utter fuckers they can be.

What I also feel, however, is that articles that are presented like this one is- full of language that's quite obviously chosen to be emotionally manipulative- do more harm than good. They'll gain support from those people who already feel that ATOS are arseholes but I sort of doubt that they'll be seen as much more than propaganda by those who want the current testing system to continue, as the actual points are a obfuscated by the chosen language.

Not getting the killer goal such that a single mistake can still undo us. An inability to handle set pieces. A lack of preparedness for counter attacks.

There are plenty of nice, polite, genuine people and then there are those that aren't. A typical day in the town centre and you will see plenty of young families ""Young mums with their prams and toddlers"". Spend all day in a pub and you’ll see plenty of unemployed drunks. These are issues we face nationwide. But they get highlighted here in other people opinion so they can reinforce the idea or stereotype. However there are a lot of businesses here so the majority are at work, and there are a wide range of industries available here.
In the evenings the streets aren’t particularly dangerous. I wouldn’t say that Basildon has a crime or gang problem. You may see your local youths hanging at the shops and such. More often than not theirs no reason to be intimidated. You may get swore at if you refuse to buy cigarettes for them but not much worse. I personally have never had a single issue. I’ve never had to call the police I’ve never witnessed a crime, and I don’t actually know any one that has. At least not a serious violent crime. Seen a few shoplifters being escorted thru the town to the station and an occasional drunken fight outside a pub or at the leisure park. I don’t want to misguide you into thinking your save at all times. As I’m sure there are some areas that are affected. Maybe my opinion is biased as 6ft 2” male in his late 20’s. Plus living my whole live here means I’ve gotten to know a lot of faces. I wouldn’t take unnecessary risks thou. Keeping your doors locked don’t leave valuable laying around. Common sense really.

I remember Rafa's merry-go-round approach to who started matches and it seemed to fuck with the players' heads.

Yeah, from that link I provided we seem to be doing at only when we have to. France and Italy are installing it on their new high-speed lines *now*.

I think we are slowly moving in the right direction, with a large electrification programme and the IEP (IMO a train designed by committee, its only saving grace is that Hitachi are building it).

HS2 I can see dragging on and eventually being cancelled, which would just leave us further behind. I agree with the comments on this thread that we can improve our existing network *and* build true high-speed rail.

&gt;It seems as if we never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity on the railways

It certainly seems that way nowadays. We have gone from inventing them to playing catch up.

That isn't a question, that is a statement. You called them a liar, and then backed your claim up by saying elementary schools and middle schools use color coded folders, and it wasn't that some did, you just said that they did. You didn't say anything like ""Oh, does your school not use color coded folders? All mine did!"" which would have been you asking.

You don't have to know *specific* schools did it different, but one would think logic dictates it isn't done the same everywhere.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Growing up and going through the ""youth system"" in the US (if you can even call the ODP and travel programs we have here that, but it was high level youth play in this country) I ran into both types and always liked the emotional/animated/excitable coaches more.  It was nice to have a kind of tangible connection to the coach, it made the things they said seem more relatable.  I specifically remember a tournament final where we were tied with less than a minute to go in extra time before penalties and we were all dead tired (our semis match went to penalties and we got real lucky to get through it missing 2 of 5 so our confidence wasn't exactly high for more spot kicks) and I took down a long pass near the touch line, beat my man to the inside and let fly with a long 25-30 yard effort that was nothing short of desperate, I was too tired to bother having a go at another defender and knew I was pretty isolated up front.  Their keeper definitely should have saved it IMO (he was out of position... he said the shot moved a lot but fuck him, trying to cover his mistake... this was a standing rivalry between me team and his, and especially between me as a striker and him as one of the top keepers in the state) but it ended up in the net and we won.  My coach went insane, jumping around and yelling with the players. The assistant was a pretty quiet person (he really knew his stuff though, the coach was much better at developing players individually but the assistant was smart about making tactical adjustments) and he smiled and nodded his head, that's it.  I felt WAY better about seeing my coach go apeshit, throw his water bottle in the air and party on the sideline than I did about a quiet nod in my direction.  Something about seeing that kind of emotional outburst was inspiring, it made me feel damn good to see others feel some joy for what I was doing. 

Obviously this is absolutely NOTHING like the kind of level we're really discussing here but as a younger player it had an extra bit of impact on my mental state, made me more hungry.  Said coach didn't flip like that for every goal of course, but he always celebrated them at least a little bit (generally clapping, fist pumping, yelling well done, etc) and it just felt like an extra bit of support, extra confidence.

As a spectator I love the wild reactions and goofy things the more animated managers do, it makes them really fun to watch.

My point about the snowshoes was that different schools in different places will do things differently, depending on what works for them.  You don't have a lot of snow, so you don't have snowshoes.

In my town, right now, you can pop into the store and buy a pack of eight identical folders all in the same colour.  So most parents do, and most teachers expect it.

As I said, we only had one year when having different coloured folders was more than just a nice organizational suggestion.  That was not fun.  We went to three different office supply stores and never did find all the colours requested.  We ended up grouping some of them together.  Teal, purple and navy?  Okay, these subjects are all getting BLUE folders!  Not to mention, it made my husband cranky because it's far more expensive to buy folders individually than it is to buy a pack of them.

I honestly thought the whole ""different coloured folder"" routine was overly controlling and fussy.  It didn't create a good first impression of the teacher for us.

But that's because that teacher was swimming against the cultural tide.  In your part of Indiana, I imagine it'd be the opposite.  Your office supply stores probably don't sell folders in single colour packs.

Soldado? He was pretty good, but fairly anonymous outside of some nice little moves he made. He didn't get on the ball as often as Gylfi? 

Lennon? No way, he was average at best. 

Chadli? He was good, but he wasn't as good on defense as Gylfi or as good going forward. 

Vertonghen? Good in defense, as always, but didn't make many forward runs. Gylfi was very good in defense and offense. 

Capoue? Only played for a short while, did well holding the ball and moving with it as well as playing defense, but didn't play the pass like Gylfi and get other players involved in plays like him. 

Gylfi was the link between our offense and our defense. They often had players man-marking him, and even with them he would skip around and play a great pass to the wings or forward to Soldado. He had some really great chances, and made goal-scoring opportunities out of nothing. Watch the highlights, and you will see how many times he was involved in our critical plays. He was involved in almost every single critical play. They all came through him. He was our creative outlet, and he didn't disappoint.

But he wasn't overly sharp on sunday, not bad per say just certainly not the best player on the pitch. I agree that Soldado and him becoming familiar with each other will play a big part in both of their successes this season.  Both Gylfi and Soldado are strong at positioning and movement though neither are great at creating their own opportunity.  During the game we were very flat and plodding especially through the middle, but that was exacerbated by our decision (and minor successes) of attacking down the wings. We kept coming down the wings and lobbing crosses into the box which isn't going to be overly effective when you have Gylfi and Soldado in the middle who both thrive on created opportunities that allows them to shoot not watching the ball sail over their heads.

While i think Gylfi is hugely promising and someone that we need to play and develop Eriksen is a different calibre player (though i would aknowledge that there isn't a huge gap between Gylfi and Eriksen) and much more polished than Glyfi with a bit more ability in passing the ball and creating while being a little behind Gylfi in the ability to hit a shot (though his recent free kicks indicate he certainly has that ability)  and has a bit more upside than Gylfi.

AVB clearly likes Gylfi but i don't think that has stopped him from looking for an upgrade (and in truth it shouldn't, you should always be looking to improve a team regardless if who you have in the lineup) which is evidenced by our interest in Willian.  If we pick up Willian and hold onto Bale (which i am not entirely sold is an actual possibility) Willian would fit into the CAM slot because he is much more of a creator than Gylfi.",0,1376941445,null,0,false,0,cbr1c1m,t3_1koec1,t1_cbr1c1m,t1_cbr11ag,null,1429773500,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Edinburgh's climate is *very* Seattle-like. They're both coastal cities with an odd local microclimate that makes for clement, if windy/rainy, weather.

About one year in three we get a severe cold snap in winter, with temperatures down to -10 to -15 overnight for a couple of nights; a month in winter where it averages zero during daylight hours and down to -5 at night is rather more common. (Celsius, not Fahrenheit, I hasten to add!) While the weather's becoming more extreme this decade, proper snow-on-the-ground winter only happens occasionally (most recently in 2011 and 2010 if I remember correctly).

You might want to invest in a two-piece jacket -- outer waterproof/windproof shell with roll-up hood, zipped onto an inner fleece -- with the idea of using one or the other layer during spring/autumn and both in winter. But it's not essential to go that far.

**NOTE** One thing you *will* find unfamiliar here is that virtually nobody has air conditioning in their home (it's in around 0.5% of dwellings) but most homes have central heating -- not the US  style air ducts, but hot water pumped through radiators in each room from a central boiler (furnace). You'll also discover that architecture here is radically different -- lots of stone, brick, and concrete for houses, many of which are very old. Also wooden interior shutters, and external double glazing, and far more insulation than you'd expect in SD. This can make homes hereabouts rather uncomfortable if there's a summer heat wave (over 22 Celsius, 72 Fahrenheit). Also, the average home is around 75-100 years old and doesn't come with a garage or parking space. Also, we don't have earthquakes so you don't need to worry about stuff falling on you. And finally also, British homes typically have about one third to one half the floor space of American homes.

After reading (and posting to) this thread I called the people that now run the programme I established to ask how things are going, the vital thing to come out of that conversation is that of the thirty times they have challenged ATOS about the qualifications of the assessors they have found in every case that the assessors do not meet the minimum standards that the NHS require, some have no acceptable qualifications at all. 

If you are attending or challenging an ATOS assessment you need to establish if the assessor has the required level of ability to work as a health professional within the UK and ask what professional body they are a member of. 

Right now I think well qualified professional medical opinions are being overturned by people that could not qualify for a job as a receptionist within your local GP’s office. 

Edit, further to this: It occurred to me that if ATOS are employing staff members that lack the relevant qualifications to work within the UK they have failed to meet the requirements of the Home office and may fall foul of the UK Border Agency, I’ve passed on what little research I have on this matter to a journalist I know.

It's got a really lively independent art and music scene, loads of stuff going on all the time, lots of independent clubs, cafes, projects.  Also got some classy stuff and interesting architecture all over the place- gentrification has worked ok here over the last couple of decades (dare I say the IRA kindly triggered a much needed refurb of the city centre?).

The main issue for the majority of protestors - who incidently are not from Balcombe - is not about water contamination and traffic. Traffic is certainly not the reason people are coming from around the country to join those in West Sussex and make their voice heard. Instead, fracking ignores the major issues surrounding how we power our country. 

* Fracking is not a permanent solution to the problem of energy needs. It's old technology that will become obsolete before too long. The UK should be leading the way in investing in renewables. That is undeniably the future. Personally, I believe nuclear power can play an important part in how we power the country - I suspect many protesters may disagree with me.
* While protesters may not voice this reason as for their being at the protests I think there lies *an undercurrent* of 'The People' vs 'Big -seemingly evil - Companies/Corporations', maybe even 'The Man'. It's not surprising given the way banks have behaved in recent times, the way corporations have acted against the interests of people/wildlife and the way the government supports these major corporations - just as they support fracking.  
* Lastly, pumping chemicals - including known carcinogens - deep in to the earth doesn't seem very sensible. And yes, ground water may be affected.

Anyhoo, those are the reasons that I personally see as those for which people are protesting.

If Suarez leaves, we won't have time to adequately replace him with 3-4 different players. So accepting this and understanding that the true time table for top four is 2015 for Rodgers (said by FSG).

2. The most interesting move this transfer window (and most telling) are the loans out that we have had. Robinson, Ngoo, Adorjan, and Suso all are out seeking regular football with good competition. This does two things. First it gives them playing time to develop their talent (obvious). Second (and this is speculation), is that it gives the chance for our bench players to get in time if they aren't on the pitch every Saturday. Ibe, Borini, and Kelly got the starts and Ibe and Borini netted. That keeps them sharp and fit for when they play. I don't know how much this will continue throughout the season, but those three get valuable playing time without taking too much developmental time from those players loaned out. The club as spent a lot of time and money on youth. It's beginning to pay off.

3. Aspas looks up for it and still probably a little nervy. Mignolet looked solid after moments early on. Alberto looked great in preseason and should be exciting when he is brought on. Lucas is looking sharp than post injury. Kolo is a beast and nearly scored. 

Point is all of these things are new this year. So my opinion, if we don't add to the changes (and especially if Suarez stays) we will be preparing very nicely for the future.

1) loads of people cycle, just make sure you wear appropriate clothes!  You can pick up a cheap bike from Halfords for around £100, or you can go more specialised to one of the many bike shops.

2) most supermarkets will sell the usual gloves, hats and  scarfs. Shops like Next, New Look, Gap will sell you all the other stuff. Some supermarkets will have all the above too.

3) there are rundown areas of Edinburgh, but those same run down areas can have some nice or at least reasonable living in the same areas. Niddrie, Muirhouse, Moredun are a few I would avoid.

4) Silicon-Group on Dalry Road is okay, but you're best ordering online from Ebuyer.com as that'll be much cheaper.

The sixth doctors first season (minus the twin dilemma, which fell into the 5th doctors last season) went back to a Saturday Night and moved to the 45 minute episode format that new Who eventually ran with as their format (even though the sixth doctor is considered the least successful). 

After an 18 month hiatus Doctor Who came back (still the sixth doctor) and went back to a Monday and Tuesday night 25 minute format.

The seventh doctor came after another hiatus and the format returned to a Saturday night 25 minute format for his 3 year run before cancellation.

There have been a number of trials in the past few years where people have been convicted of plotting terrorist acts. If one of those was successful then the laws on terror would be even more draconian and objections more easily brushed aside.

Sigh. Of course we are not children. But I don't have time to look out for terrorist activity in my area and I'm guessing you don't either. So I am glad that somebody is watching.
