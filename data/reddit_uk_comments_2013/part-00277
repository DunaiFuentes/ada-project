My best help is to tell you that the most important thing, process-wise, is to find a way to build something that you can play and see if it's fun. This is the only way to determine if any idea is going to work: build it and pay it.

Adventure games are content-driven, so what you're looking for first is just 10-30 seconds of fun. This might be just one puzzle, but that gives you an important foundation to build off of. The other important element will be the world and its atmosphere, so the same thing applies there: build stuff until you find your first nugget that delivers on your vision. When you have that, throw out everything else.

Keep tinkering, keep testing, keep building. Keep throwing out the stuff that's just ""okay"" or ""good"" and keep the stuff that really excites you.

So games like that can work, but there's the question of whether it's delivering on the fantasy of being The Doctor. This is your concern of being On Rails. Because anybody that loves Doctor Who doesn't want to just be Doctor Who, they want to be *themselves* as Doctor Who.

Typically for lots of games like this, you're on rails as far as what you're trying to accomplish: you've picked a quest or the game presented you with one. The Daleks showed up, and now you have to deal with them. The self-expression comes in with how you handle it, and this can be from how you set up your character (strategy), the situational opportunities you take advantage of (tactics), and whatever flair or efficiency you put into the actual combat (execution).

I like your vision for how The Doctor solves problems. This might work as a straight-up mystery game, where the player actually has to assemble the clues themselves. This would necessitate, to a certain degree, removing the time pressure from the player, because that sort of game has to let the player piece it together themselves.

The theory is that people willingly spend too much on rent. Some people are spending 75% of their wage on rent leaving them effectively broke and reliant on hand-outs/at the the mercy of social welfare and not having the ability to save. They live pay check to pay check. Once one person is willing to hand over 75% of their wage to rent, then everyone is forced to follow or double job. That is the problem. Supplementing peoples wages so they can afford rent just means the price of rent goes up and up an up. It needs to be at a level people can afford. But people don't think about saving and other costs so they willingly hand over too much for rent. The solution (if government force is to be used) is to put a cap on the rent people are allowed to pay and so the cost of housing naturally comes down to meet that level.

I remember a variety of transport ministers promising that ATP would be rolled out and that money was no object. It happened after train crashes in Clapham, Southall and Paddington. It was even announced again after the Eschede disaster in Germany.

By then the simpler and lower cost TPWS system had been developed and was rolled out instead.

With hindsight it seems to be the 'British way'. Settle for the lower cost alternative. Definitely a matter of political will - there wasn't the will to actually fund and roll ATP out nationwide.

&gt;Extensive research has been conducted by Professor Jones-Lea and a team of economists from Newcastle University into what people think it is worth paying to reduce the likelihood of death on the roads or on the railways. The surprising result is that almost everyone converges on a figure of around £1 million: people think that if a new safety feature costs £1 million, and its effect will be to reduce the number of deaths on the roads or on the railways by one, then it's worth paying for. If it costs more than £1 million for each life it saves, then it isn't worth having.

But you're talking about a tiny sample size.
If nobody in particular scores a hattrick one day you can say they were the best striker in the world that day but it's a pretty meaningless statement.

Ronaldo has scored about a goal a game for Madrid.
Messi is rapidly closing in on a similar record as he's scoring more than a goal a game over the past 4 seasons.

Suarez is still about 0.6 goals per game over his time here.

The fact of the matter is that scoring 8 goals in 3 games massively skews things. Suarez has yet to show the sort of consistency of scoring over 40 goals in 5 of his last 7 seasons like Ronaldo and even at his current rate, won't get the 73 of Messi from 11-12.

Suarez is looking every bit like the best of the rest (ie, phenomenal) but Ronaldo is quite a bit ahead and Messi is on a different level again (injuries notwithstanding).

I'm just happy to be enjoying him. He's looking like he's going to be the best striker I've ever seen play for Liverpool.
The only thing he's missing is longevity.

""I included the reasons scout can't rely on donations from profit making companies. That an organisation who can spend may come along and make an offer too good to be refused."" Shoehorning in something irrelevant.

""My opinion yes. I was just demonstrating an extension of your opinion that the video is little more than preaching to the converted."" Whatevs.

""How is this relevant to administrative costs? That is an operational costs. Which is precisely what you think a charity should be spending money one (In fairness it was also a political move, which you are against charities having but that is different)"" I love how you keep asking for evidence of misuse of funds, and when presented with one you don't know what to do with it except blandly skim over it.

""I am yet to dismiss any form of raising money for charities in this debate. I simply don't think we can rely on them."" I disagree so much with that point.

""Still waiting for proof of this."" Pretending to play dumb. 

""Blatant misquote."" No it's not. 

""Please don't add your words to the end of my sentences. You even deleted a full stop."" I did not add my words to the end of your sentences, and the heinous crime of not cutting and pasting a full stop? Sounds like you're trying to find little itty bitty things to refute to save face.

""No I haven't, that was a misquote"" Well then I think a bit less of you if you're taking that back.

""I am not an expert. But I had a quick google using the phrase ""Archbishop of Canterbury fundraising""

The top results were the previous guy being involved in fundraising events, Canterbury cathedrals fundraising page, and the new guy talking about wonga. Please enlighten me""

First off, if you're no expert then why exactly are you so sure you're right? And secondly you are banging on and on and ON about traditional fundraising not being enough and how income investment is ok, then you go and limit your search to fundraising so that you can feign ignorance.

""Which generated more income. Meaning that they could help more people. What a terrible outcome"" I wanted that money to go to those who needed it, and they falsely said the money I donated would go to those people. 

""And, your money probably wasn't spend on that. If you donated to an appeal it would have gone to the appeal. The marketing budget would have come out a more general pot that would have been there either way."" Contradicted your previous point. Either it was spent on sending me my money back or it wasn't. The general pot of money is made up of other income. If I wanted to donate to that general pot then I would, as I am now doing for médecins sans frontières.

""They are well known, because they market. Does Madonna not spend money on publicity?"" Er no, you seriously need to understand that the world existed before you were born and charities like that have been a major part of people's lives in the past. There's even wikipedia pages and everything on them. If you're claiming that their marketing is the sole reason they are well known in the UK then that's a blatant falsehood.

""I am not all over the place. I responded point by point to what you wrote. But my overall point is simple.

We live in a world (unfortunately) where money is important.

Charities need money to function.

Charity marketing generates income. 

This is a net gain. (Income generated &gt; Marketing expenditure)

This is an investment. This means that, in simple terms. Your donation helps 50 people rather than 5.

However they should respect requests to not receive mail""

You responded point by point, thinking that if you threw enough rhetoric then you'd be in the right as you haven't even considered that you might be wrong. 

Charities became a massive industry sector in the 90s and they have to create a load of guff about increasing the effectiveness of donations in order to ignore the blatant hypocrisy of their investments supporting the very issues they are working against.

I'm concerned that if filtering becomes ""just one of those things"" other bad things could well happen. I don't know specifically what but it doesn't feel like it'd be anything good. I've not seen any studies providing solid reasoning for why even an opt-in filter would help. It seems to be a push based entirely on ideology and unsurprisingly that alone is not enough to sway many of us.

I don't think we'll suddenly become a police state and I have no problem with router-based filtering. Filtering on the back-end bothers me though as legislation tends to lag behind reality to a nearly farcical degree. As such I do not trust there to be measures in place to provide sensible oversight on such matters. If we can't do things well I do not feel it is sensible to blunder forward based entirely on the old ""think of the children"" argument.

Opt-in filtering also bothers me less as it doesn't shift what is considered ""normal"". If people wish to have filters then that is their business. The idea of having such a thing on by default on the other hand involves the will of others being imposed. If it's about ideology then I, like so many others, have a bit of a bone to pick with other adults claiming they know better than I do when it comes to what's best for me.

If it was a doctor telling me about my lifestyle choices being problematic then I would defer to their expertise. I don't think we have doctors of censorship though and as such I would much prefer ""normal"" to remain as it is unless a proper body of research shows that a change would be of significant benefit.",0,1387572232,null,0,false,0,ce6krj3,t3_1tbjvm,t1_ce6krj3,t1_ce6k9ar,null,1428049538,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Other families are already willingly paying too much so all families must also live paycheck to paycheck and not save. however, if it illegal to spend more than a certain percentage of your wage on rent, houses don't just remain empty because nobody can afford them. Their value decreases to a level that people can.  

A single parent is a different situation. If it is the norm a family has two parents (and this is changing), then a single parent family obviously would still continue getting whatever entitlement they are getting currently. The difference is, rent would still be a smaller percentage of their wage.

-Our county has a strong tourism sector, based off natural beauty- fracking ""pads"" will stop revenue (and jobs) coming in from tourism

-Any jobs that do come in will be low-pay, low-skill and temporary. The big guns are brought from outside the local area.

-There's no facility for using gas locally, so either we're going to have to all get gas pipes fitted, or the gas will go overseas.

-Transporting the gas will require pipes to be built all along to the sea, or massive numbers of trucks, which our country roads can't sustain.

-Massive amounts of water being used to frack- we live by a lake, but I remember a meeting where someone showed us that even all the water in it would not be enough.

Though there will be a small boom in low-pay labour, accommodation and quarrying, we will lose jobs in tourism at least (if there are no pollutants entering the water table, which is something that we've not been given a clear answer on).",0,1387574971,null,0,false,0,ce6lwci,t3_1tbdyo,t1_ce6lwci,t3_1tbdyo,null,1428049010,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

I then quote the next part I was going to counter which was

&gt; even if the way that money was raised has negative consequences.

That was moving on to the next point.

You deleted the full stop (which is important when it changes the meaning of what is being said) at the end of the word consequences, as well as ignoring the paragraph break as well as the context - that I was quoting you.

It is a misquote, I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't understand the line at the side meant it was a quote, and you simply didn't see the full stop, and the new line.

moving on...

------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Shoehorning in something irrelevant.

It isn't irrelevant. You claimed that instead of the community fundraiser printing posters they could get a local printing company to do the work for them. 

My point is, that printing company, if given the choice between delaying the charitable order, or the one set to make them £x million will probably choose money over charity. But charities have deadlines too, they can't rely on that uncertainty.

&gt; I love how you keep asking for evidence of misuse of funds, and when presented with one you don't know what to do with it except blandly skim over it.

You clearly don't understand the question. I am not asking for examples of misuse of funds. I am asking for examples of administrative and marketing costs being a net loss for the charity (or an overall negative)

&gt; First off, if you're no expert then why exactly are you so sure you're right? 

Because I know enough. I am not an expert on furniture, I am still confident that if I set fire to my sofa it won't be much use afterwards.

&gt; And secondly you are banging on and on and ON about traditional fundraising not being enough and how income investment is ok, then you go and limit your search to fundraising so that you can feign ignorance.

Except I am talking, as stated multiple times about amrketting as a form of investment. And I am talking about this because that was what your topic was about. You want to stop charities investing in arms dealers - I am on your side. You want to stop them investing in paper, to maximise income streams from people like you an me? That is where we differ.

I am not feigning ignorance (please provide me with a link to what you are referring too). I feel it is you that are. You can't manage a good argument against charities marketing as a form of investment, so deliberately assume I am talking about charities spending money on arms dealers.

&gt; ""Which generated more income. Meaning that they could help more people. What a terrible outcome"" I wanted that money to go to those who needed it, and they falsely said the money I donated would go to those people.
&gt; 
&gt; ""And, your money probably wasn't spend on that. If you donated to an appeal it would have gone to the appeal. The marketing budget would have come out a more general pot that would have been there either way."" Contradicted your previous point. Either it was spent on sending me my money back or it wasn't. The general pot of money is made up of other in

It isn't contradicting my previous point. I do not know the specific of all three charities you work with. I can state with certainty that one of them keeps the pots separate. I would be pretty confident the others do too - as you say it how they persuade people to give money.

However, even if they don't. A mailout generates income and is a net gain for the charity.

&gt; Er no, you seriously need to understand that the world existed before you were born and charities like that have been a major part of people's lives in the past. There's even wikipedia pages and everything on them. If you're claiming that their marketing is the sole reason they are well known in the UK then that's a blatant falsehood.

There is also a wikipedia page on ""Albert I. Prettyman"" but I had never heard of him until I opened a random wiki page.

Coca Cola is a well known brand, yet they still market. They do this because they know that word of mouth isn't always enough

The only reasons? Maybe that is an exaggeration. But they wouldn't be as well known without marketing.

Of course they existed before me, but I can talk about how I learnt about their work. 

Oxfam, was from their shops the logo on the top and looking at their website (all of which cost money). I have know started studying development so know a little more about them but that is the main source.

Save the children? Mail outs, posters, adverts in newspapers.

&gt; You responded point by point, thinking that if you threw enough rhetoric then you'd be in the right as you haven't even considered that you might be wrong. 

Have you considered you might be wrong? Because you are responding the same way I am.

Perhaps you are right about one thing, I am simply retorting to your claims.

So here is something simple to help clear this up. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. I **do** have a problem with charities investing in arms dealers

 2. I **know** at least one of the charities you mentioned wouldn't even accept a donation from an arms dealer, or company associated with them. Let alone investing in one. And actually have a team to research major donors to ensure this doesn't happen

 3. I **suspect** that the other two will have similar teams. The PR outcome of a mistake would damage any charity heavily.

 4. I **do** have a problem with charities ignoring their donors wishes when it comes to contact

 5. I **do not** have a problem with charities spending money on marketing as a form of investment

 6. I **do** believe this marketing is a net gain for the charity

 7. I **do not** have a problem with professional fundraisers who work directly for the charity

 8. I **do** believe these people are a net gain for the charity

 9. I **do** believe administrative costs are not only expected, but unavoidable. Especially in larger charities

 10. I **do not** believe that marketing has a negative consequence for the charity that outweighs the positive gain.

 11. I **do not** believe that, with the drop in income that will occur if this marketing were to cease that these charities would be able to do anywhere near the level of good work that they do.

true,SoyBotones,null,null,"Was AVB a gamble?

I didn't think so 2 years ago, actually, my thoughts were that Chelsea screwed up royally by letting him go, and that an intractable old guard in West London wouldn't let him succeed.

Then, Spurs squeaked through last year, earning 5th largely on Gareth Bale's superhuman performance.

I think everybody here assumed that with the seven new hirings, AVB would have the squad comfortably in 3rd or 4th, and steadily improving with each successive month.

In some other forum, I read a poster say: ""Well, anybody could have won Europa League with AVB's Porto squad"".

Initially, I thought: ""That's bullshit, AVB's a tactical genius""

But, the question gnawed at me for a while, and that 2010-2011 Porto squad had:

* Radamel Falcao - Scored 39 goals in all competitions, and then turned around and impressed at Atletico, and Monaco
* Hulk - Scored 35 goals in all competitions, and is still the engine behind Zenit's attack
* João Moutinho - Who is regarded as the midfield talent pulling the strings behind Porto's stellar play

AVB's successor, Vitor Pereira went on to win the league with almost the exact same side the next year, but couldn't go as far in cup competitions or Europa League without Falcao (who left at the end of AVB's tenure).

Maybe AVB caught lightning in a bottle that one year, having three of the best un(der)recognized talents all on the same side.

And maybe we assumed that it was because of some of AVB's particular genius, instead of some very fortunate circumstances that are unlikely to be duplicated in other leagues with different playstyles, and different sets of players at his disposal.

Heres the way I see it...

Right now they seem more like partners in ~~crime~~ time. Clara is basically his protector, his guardian angel, and his rock. The Doctor relies on Clara for support as much as she relies on him. Its almost like the Doctor is as much Clara's companion as she is his.

With that, the doctor clearly loves her very much but its also clear he is not in love with her. Clara also seems strong enough to love the Doctor but not fall in love as others have.

I think Trenzalore and the subsequent regeneration is going to bring about a more serious Doctor. Still whimsical and fun when he needs to be, but noticeably more serious in his approach. Trenzalore will have the Doctor see past her strengths and realize she is still a fragile human that would die without his protection. Clara will still be his rock, but the dynamic will shift from her being his protector to him being hers, thus the Doctor takes on a more fatherly/guardian role.

Or perhaps it even goes as far as him losing her again, wiping the slate clean. He'll find her again, but this time he takes on a more serious ""I WILL NEVER LOSE YOU EVER AGAIN"" approach with her. This would also make Clara's transition to a father/daughter dynamic much smoother, since that version of her will only know the Doctor as the fatherly guardian type who is constantly worried about her safety.

Season 6 is even better off, with only 7 missing (roughly the same length, I forget the exact number of episodes - 37, I think, which would make 30 archived.)

On this though, he's right, too many excuses and poor performances (the League is in our favour though). I think come the end of January things are going to get very real - If the rest of the League make big signings and get their act together, we're going to find it very hard even keeping in the Top 4 if Jose sticks and doesn't change his way.

true,LongDongShagswell,null,null,"The problem with a 4-4-2 lies in the midfield.  In a formation like that, our wide midfielders will not have enough room to cut into the box from out wide due to the presence of two strikers in there. Instead, their jobs would be to get down the wings and cross. We lack a left-footed winger. The closest thing we have is Mata, but he's not pacey enough dash down the wing and beat the opposing fullback.

Additionally, our central midfielders would have a much more physically demanding box-to-box role. We only have one midfielder that can play offense and defense at the same time right now: Ramires. Maybe Essien and Lampard could have done this five years ago, but they've both slowed down considerably. Our midfielders tend to specialize in either attacking or defense, but a 4-4-2 requires proficiency in both. Oscar could be molded into this role, but that requires time we don't have. 

One solution to this is a 4-1-2-1-2, but it does not work well against the 4-2-3-1.  If the second line of midfielders plays out wide, the opposition crowds the center of the field and our attackers will be isolated from the defense. If the middle two play centrally, we're too narrow and prone to overlaps down the wings. A flat 4-4-2 is more viable against a 4-2-3-1, but it requires box-to-box midfielders we don't have.


A 4-1-3-2 might work, but the central midfielder in the line of three has an awful lot of work to do, as he has to connect the play between the defense and the attack. He has to play as both a CM and CAM and he'll likely be against two defensive midfielders. Oscar has the workrate and the precision to play this role. 

A true 4-3-3 may work as well. It gets rid of the double-pivot of a 4-2-3-1, yet remains balanced in attack and defense. A midfield consisting of a defensive-minded pivot, a box-to-box midfielder, and a playmaker is solid. Our wingers have enough space to cut in and we have strikers who like playing alone up top. Should we opt to play possession, there are plenty of triangles. Should we need to play quick counterattacks, we'll have plenty of space to pass into. 

Strikers aren't the problem in a 4-4-2. All of our strikers are capable and willing to drop back or run at the defense. The combination of Ba and Eto'o could be deadly up top. Ba can easily put away crosses and Eto'o can chase through-balls. The speedster/big man combo is a classic.

And while I was there, this really cute girl came up to me with tally marks on her arms as well, and asked me ""You've seen them too?"" Deciding to play along, I asked her ""What are you talking about"" them looked down at my arms and screamed a little, and she laughed. We then proceeded to talk about Doctor Who for a good 20 minutes, abd then we swapped numbers before she went on her way with her own groceries. We then talked almost non-stop and watched the rest of the episodes of series 7 together, both of us just sitting there asking what multiple times after the reveal of the John Hurt Doctor. Then later when we both went to a party together, after getting drunk (my first and last time of doing it, since the hangover afterwards doesn't seem worth it to me), she and I ended up having sex (first time for the both of us, so we lost our virginities to each other), the next day we both kind of freaked out since we didn't use any kind of protection. We just texted, trying to decided what to do, and how to proceed if she turned out to be pregnant (luckily she ended up not being pregnant). We then decided that the we should actually hang out and just relax and try to get our heads on straight. So the next day we did just that. We relaxed. We went to the pool. We had a light saber fight in her backyard. And then we started watching some DW together, and we were cuddling, avid we just sorta looked at each other and started making out. It was wonderful.

I bought it for 2 reasons - my son I thought one day might want to go to uni, and this might help pay for it. The other is my brother in law was unable to afford rent/mortgage, so this helped him out.

I'll be honest - I don't want to be charging anyone £450 for it, but the rates/house prices are truly out of reach for most/many. And it's the economy in general that dictates what I charge, not me.


I do think, given the housing problem anyone with an empty property should be asked to contribute more, either by renting it out or receving a fine for not renting it out. I believe they have a similar aprouch in Denmark.

Actually, one point I forgot to make about that West ham match had to do with the substitutions.  A big reason I think we had problems at the end of the match was because none of our subs were tactical.  

That's an issue that stemmed from Sherwood choosing to start two player he *knew* he'd have to take off before full time.  Unless something really unexpected happened, Danny and Ade were always coming off.  Toss in Townsend's injury, and all of our changes were fitness related.

I don't believe there is any law obliging parents to supply their children with media on any subject, be that sex, religion or a specific culture. Indeed there is nothing to stop a parent being racist in front of their child or promoting racist views, or any other kind of views.

Looking at the list on BT's website there are many morally inflected categories: Pornography, Drugs, Nudity, Fashing &amp; Beauty, and even a general category called Obscene &amp; Tasteless:

&gt; This category will block sites that offer advice on how to commit illegal or criminal activities, or to avoid detection. These can include how to commit murder, build bombs, pick locks, etc. Sites with information about illegal manipulation of electronic devices, hacking, fraud and illegal distribution of software will be blocked along with **content that may be offensive or tasteless such as bathroom humour**, or gruesome or even frightening content such as shocking depictions of blood or wounds, or cruel animal treatment.

Seems to me BT is offering parents the opportunity to enforce all sorts of moral opinions through its system, many of which divide people. Why shouldn't BT offer a racist filter? Because there is a consensus on that being wrong? Numerous religious families in this country already try the best they can to shelter their children from certain media. Unless you want to legislate to force parents to expose their children to a set list of ideas, I'd say this is a transaction between two parties that doesn't involve you. 

Though to be clear, I'm delineating between the legal aspect and my own opinion, which is that internet filters are bullshit.

If we manage to get CL next season, I think Suarez would have to stay at LFC for the fact that we can offer him CL, a starting spot week in and week out in the most competitive football league in the world, and the wages to back up his massive talent. Also a great move from FSG to lock him down and prevent any bids coming in on January and potentially this summer.

Further to that, you and your family are checked up on. Friend of mine is thoroughly British but has some distant Irish heritage. He was rejected because he has a distant removed uncle or some such in prison in Ireland for some political things.

'Sales Order Raised means because it's being sent with Tracked status, it's a log in the Royal Mail system in case a claim is made later for missing/damaged items'

Essentially this means Royal Mail are billing Amazon for delivery. It has no bearing on the delivery time it is just a notification.

**Seriously people start typing queries into Google and do some research instead of waiting on Reddit.**

It is a **very rare occasion** that nobody has had the same issue as yourself with something. You can resolve the issue yourself. These are 3 pages of many more examples of people with the same issue. 

---------------------------------

Regarding this issue:

Your order is on 'Tracked' status and not 'Recorded'. Think of Tracked as 2nd class and Recorded as 1st class. The sender has organised a tracking number out of goodwill to be assigned to the order. As it is near Christmas this is quite common so the sender can be happy it has arrived. This means your item will be with you shortly but it may end up with a neighbour unsigned. It covers Royal Mail in case you make a claim of non-receipt. It will tell you on the tracking details if a neighbour ended up receiving the item.  

**The chances of you receiving it on Saturday the 21st are pretty high as it is already with your local Mail Centre. If not then Monday latest.**",0,1387589120,null,0,1387589635,0,ce6r7ia,t3_1td4yo,t1_ce6r7ia,t3_1td4yo,null,1428046498,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;I know that the ingredients are confidential in the states of what is actually in the fluid. Does any body have a report of what the fluid is composed of that is going to be used in the UK ? 

THey have to disclose composition in the UK by law. The fluids used are varied depending on the conditions in the frac'ing well and the intended consequences of the Frac. THey are largely inert - 90=95% water (Generally this will be freshwater, I understand that seawater can be used particularly in off shore frac'ing), 9.5% sand or commercial ceramic ""powder"". Then you have thickeners (Often guar gum as found in food) and friction reducers. Isopropanol may be used (you get this in cosmetics). Salt may be present. There ARE some fairly nasty chemicals that can be used: Hydrochloric acid, citric acid, anti bacterial agents. That's why recovered frac'ing fluid does have to be contained and safely disposed of. You can't say exactly what fluid compositions will be used ahead of time, but they do have to be declared and are subject to strict environmental controls.

What about the water is it fresh ? or saltwater ?

&gt;How come they are getting huge amounts of water when I have to pay through the nose for mine ? 

""HUge amounts of water"" is all relative. A typical Frac will use 5 million litres of water: 5 olympic swimming pools worth. They will have to pay for this like everyone else. About 20-50% of water is recovered and will be processed. A small drinking water borehole in the UK produces this amount of water in a day and there are many thousands of them in the country. Note also that the actual fracturing is a one time deal, not a continual process. You pump the water down, fracture the rock in stages, and then release the pressure and recover some of the water. The well then goes into production and the gas is recovered. You don't need to keep pumping water down there.

&gt; Have any studies been done on the release of radon gas ?

Radon is one of those bogeymen that sounds horrible: Radioactive gas. It's EVERYWHERE. Anywhere you have igneous rocks, you have radon. It has a short half life (3.4 days), and can collect in buildings. Apparently it causes about 2000 deaths in the UK each year now, mainly via lung cancer.

There is no doubt that radon is underground, and since it's  gas, it's reasonable to assume that recovering gas from reservoirs may recover some radon. Note however that radon isn't released by sedimentary rocks, it's released by igneous ones. It then has to migrate into the same reservoirs that hold gas, which takes a very long time. All the time, it is decaying and becoming less radioactive, and it decays into Solid ""daughter isotopes"". This is good in that they'll probably remain inside the rock, it's bad in that they have very long half lives and do present a risk to health. 

Suffice to say, it's very much a ""suck it and see"" process on a case by case basis. The majority of wells I wouldn't expect to have any Radon beyond the naturally occurring levels (Which as I said, are minutely present everywhere). But it's one of thoses things that if discovered in significant quantities could be an absolute show stopper for a well going into production. The costs of safe treatment would outweigh the profits, and the well would be abandoned (i.e. properly closed and left) for a better prospect elsewhere.",0,1387590450,null,0,false,0,ce6rnql,t3_1tbdyo,t1_ce6rnql,t1_ce6hvgx,null,1428046287,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Give me a break, before we deported him we actually forced the Jordans to alter their constitution to ensure that he wouldn't be tortured. All while we had the option of sending him to Guantanamo Bay, and we how the Americans treat their inmates over there.

**Reminder: I want too remain in the EU but here are some I that I think are problematic**

- Though I like the idea of The schengen agreement our country is simply too small too support Frontier Free travel, and with us being one of the most (if not most) desirable destinations in Europe for depraved newly joined EU countries it will only get more crowded.

- Though it's joked about on Reddit all the time, I do feel the EU is sucking away the uniqueness of each countries national Identity, with most our laws coming from Brussels rather than Westminster it just feels like the EU simply in the long run want to create a United States of Europe to compete with the other world superpowers.

- And simply money, we put a lot more in than we get back, that's a fact. True we benefit from trade agreements with France and Germany etc but do you think that'll change if we leave the EU? Of course it won't.

I'm currently living in Scotland at the moment and a lot of people here are pro EU because (IMHO) they haven't experienced anywhere near the scale of immigration from the Eastern European countries compared to that of England, I mean lets face it, if you're new to the country and looking for work any man with half a brain cell will choose to look for work in England. So Scotland reaping the benefits of the EU without suffering much drawbacks appeals to those up here.

I know I may come across as one of those ""those fackin foreigners"" dipshits but it's just that I'm originally from Peterborough in Cambridgeshire which had an HUGE influx of Poles coming too look for work, not that I have a problem with that but it's just annoying that most come here without speaking a word of English and only mingle with their fellow countrymen. Yes they're hard workers but that doesn't mean all of the youth in this country are lazy useless kids, though some unfortunately are.

If you're interested, there's a really good documentary but a few years old 2008 I think on YouTube about the Poles in Peterborough on YouTube.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; -No-one has satisfactorily satiated fears about groundwater pollution, which will affect local farming (one of the main occupations here)

[Read here for my explanation of how groundwater and the frac'ing strata must necessarily be separated by impermeable rock](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1tbdyo/the_british_government_is_preparing_to_offer_up/ce6dj5f)

&gt; -Our county has a strong tourism sector, based off natural beauty- fracking ""pads"" will stop revenue (and jobs) coming in from tourism

[Frac'd wells are already in production in areas of outstanding natural beauty in the UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/10233955/The-town-where-fracking-is-already-happening.html), and have been for 30 years. No one even noticed them. One of the really nice things about Frac'ing is that the surface expression, particularly once the actual fracturing stage is complete and that equipment can be removed, is very low impact.

&gt; -Any jobs that do come in will be low-pay, low-skill and temporary. The big guns are brought from outside the local area.

That's a valid concern. THe wider knock on effects to the economy of the UK would hopefully be significant and trickle back down to you (And everyone else). Fact is it WOULD generate jobs, and it would also brink those high paid, high skilled people back to the UK from overseas, where they're currently working. That's more tax revenues in income tax and other attendant taxes on earnings, and money being spent in the UK economy.

&gt; -There's no facility for using gas locally, so either we're going to have to all get gas pipes fitted, or the gas will go overseas.

Err, whut? It's not piped directly to homes. It's used to produce electricity, and is about the cleanest fossil fuel to do so. We have plenty of capacity to use it, and an established gas infrastructure because we've been producing gas in the north sea and piping it ashore for decades.

&gt; -Transporting the gas will require pipes to be built all along to the sea, or massive numbers of trucks, which our country roads can't sustain.

The transport issues are a concern - the same as any other equipment heavy engineering project. Trucks will have to bring equipment in and out. The gas will basically ALWAYS be piped out. These are wells that should produce for many years, and it's not economical or logistically sensible to truck it out. So, we do have the environmental impact of pipelines to consider. Done right, you'd never know they're there. Don't badly, they're an eyesore.

&gt; -Massive amounts of water being used to frack- we live by a lake, but I remember a meeting where someone showed us that even all the water in it would not be enough.

I suspect that whoever gave that talk was being a bit disingenuous and had an agenda, and overstating the water use. A typical Frac uses about 5 olympic swimming pools worth of water (5 Megalitres), and it's a one-time deal in that they use the water to frac, release the pressure, recover some of the frac'ing fluid, and then the well goes into production. They don't keep pumping water down the well. For perspective, a relatively small drinking water borehole in the UK produces 5 Megalitres of water a day, and that's [the approximate daily water consumption of 1000 people](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/20/water.food1). Oh, and the drinking water borehole will almost certainly have been Frac'd, as will every other borehole used to get things out of the ground. Over 2.5 million Frac's have been completed globally to date, and it was developed in the 50's, refined in the 70's, and has been in widespread use since then.

&gt; Though there will be a small boom in low-pay labour, accommodation and quarrying, we will lose jobs in tourism at least (if there are no pollutants entering the water table, which is something that we've not been given a clear answer on).

I think I've covered those points above.


I understand your concerns, but really there are not founded in the facts of what happens when frac'ing is used.

Example: *LOST*. LOST was a great show about survival and even though opinions differ on how it turned out, pretty much everyone agrees that the first season or two were fantastic. It was when they began introducing time travel and Demi-gods that things began to derail. Sure the elements of mystery were there from the very beginning but widening the scope so much really changed what kind of show it was and spoiled it for a lot of viewers.

A show that is still finding a balance between big arcs and standalone stories would be *Doctor Who*, specifically the new series. Seasons 1-4 were all very segmented and had standalone arcs that were resolved at the end of each season, and people liked it. Then Moffat took over and the format changed a lot and the arcs got way bigger, and lot of people really appreciated it but there were those that were very unhappy about the changes. I still see people advocate that he has ruined the show by introducing such big picture stories and ""changing what the show was about"". Of course it all comes down to personal preference.

As it is though, I think, as well as being irresponsible, it's morally wrong to include sex education and access to gay and lesbian relationship and 'lifestyle' material in the last category.

Following the logic of homophobic parents and authority figures, if their kid is gay, or is straight, that's how they are. Knowing other ways to be exist, won't change that.

I would go as far as to say this block in the final column could be argued to be illegal; or at least unadvisable, as by blocking access to gay material, it implicitly glorifies and priveleges heterosexual lifestyle as superior, more natural, or the only way to be. This is assuming that all parents or people in control of the internet services ARE themselves heterosexual; that homosexual content is something that there should be the option to block access to.

To flip that round, this should, following the logic, give close-minded gay parents the option to block heterosexual content; the heterosexual lifestyle etc - because they feel it to be innapropriate or offensive.

I think my favorite moment is when he moved into that one guys house in season 5.   

What resonated with me was what he said to that guys potential gf.   6 Billion people running around and most people choose to do the safe thing. Very few people actually go out to try and achieve their dreams. 
Episodes where the doctor always attempts to push the best of humanity I think are pretty good. 

I guess it is parallels with my life.  I'm launching a start-up and there are many unknown variables when you are launching a start-up.

I'd like to see a 4-5-1 as well with maybe Milner-Nasri-Navas assuming that Silva needs to be rested for the Liverpool game midweek. Nasri can fill in as a secondary striker if needed since his finishing is quite decent.

Upfront is tough, there are three games in a week so both Dzeko and Negredo will have to play..Dzeko has a better away goal scoring record but Negredo has looked better in terms of his movement. I'd probably gamble on Dzeko starting with Negredo on the bench.

""He remembered Alejandra and the sadness he'd first seen in the slope of her shoulders which he'd presumed to understand and of which he knew nothing and he felt a loneliness he'd not known since he was a child and he felt wholly alien to the world although he loved it still. He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and it's beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for he vision of a single flower.""

""When I was in school I studied biology. I learned that in making their experiments scientists will take some group--bacteria, mice, people--and subject that group to certain conditions. They compare the results with a second group which has not been disturbed. This second group is called the control group. It is the control group which enables the scientist gauge the effect of his experiment. To judge the significance of what has occurred. In history there are no control groups. There is no one to tell us what might have been. We weep over the might have been, but there is no might have been. There never was. It is supposed to be true that those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it. I don't believe knowing can save us. What is constant in history is greed and foolishness and a love of blood and this is a thing that even God--who knows all that can be known--seems powerless to change."" - Cormac McCarthy

* Clara exists along every axis point of the Doctors life.
* Capaldi appeared in a David Tennant episode ""The Fires of Pompeii"" as Caecilius, a Roman who buys the Tardis considering it as art. 
* 10th Doctor ends up saving his life.

What if the Doctor regenerates into Capaldi, but the Weeping Angels feed on him as he regenerates, and he loses his memory, and is sent back into his own timeline to meet his 10th incarnation.  And the Claras throughout his timeline have to find him and bring him back to Trenzalor to save himself.  Along the way maybe she interacts with other Doctors like the 8th.

And then all the doctors sit down to have christmas dinner with the Daleks.

Barcelona played against Bayern Munich three times. 180/270 or so minutes was OFFICIAL, the final 90 minutes was friendly. During the 270 minutes or so, no one in Barcelona has scored.

It took Torres to start a run with both Schurrle and Hazard to score a goal in EIGHT minutes. Here's the thing, it wasn't on a COUNTER ATTACK. It was from a throw in that Torres took advantage of, sent it to Hazard who THRASHED Bayern's defence, passes it to Schurrle... Get's the cross and BAM Torres scores within 8 minutes of the game. Once again Barcelona, their entire team, has still failed to score against Bayern Munich in 2013.

For those of you who haven't seen it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD4wriy3qvw#t=68

He should have been under immense pressure facing the current champions of the UEFA League but he scored against them.

Okay so he managed to score against a powerful team, but recently Manchester City has beaten Bayern Munich which was a better outcome than what we had done.

Ah yes but we would have won if that last minute goal hadn't occurred but that's not the point. I'm not a manger or anything like that but clearly Torres doesn't get service and when he does... he flops. What gives?

It's not his shooting anymore guys, he can score goals we know that but when? The answer is when he learns to dribble. The most basic and essential thing in soccer is something he has difficulties doing. He's losing the ball often but can you imagine if he can dribble like Hazard, Mata, and Schurrle? It took me a few weeks to be great at dribbling and it will come to him naturally. In training it's easy because he's under his own teammates pressure, once he learns to dribble on the pitch and not FIND but MAKE his own space he will dominate. Like he did against Manchester City. His dribble and ball control was... odd but once he executed it, it was beautiful.

Just three things he needs to work on and he can potentially become a late power striker: Dribbling, consistency, and dealing with pressure. He's 29 but still has his incredible pace.

I know you guys are growing weary of him not scoring and perhaps costing us the BPL title but I think we should keep him till his contract ends. Who knows, he might score a dramatic goal like he did against Barcelona even though we were already winning on aggregate it was still a finishing blow to the Spanish giants.

Overall I hope he stays, he can certainly be surprising. We just need consistency from him and I have high hopes Mourinho will bring the best out in him and the entire team.",0,1387610947,null,0,false,0,ce6xs5a,t3_1tckbk,t1_ce6xs5a,t3_1tckbk,null,1428043357,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Edit: I made a mistake so I apologize to /u/gruda, Im leaving this comment up 

I've only just found the time to sit down and go through and read the comments and I admit i made a glaring mistake. I missed that mistake and thought I had written down what I thought was correct which was /r/gruda correction, but in my mind I had convinced my self that I had written my comment in a way that came across as us being top through christmas but instead I wrote year, being on my phone I only saw the replies and not my original comment (which I read via there quote but missed it assuming i hadnt made a mistake/it made sense in my mind)

Rushing about, replying to a few other people, I missed that your correction was correct and because I had mistaken what you had written as me having written the same thing in a different way I assumed you were trying to wind me up and so I reacted bitterly (no excuse but try and understand i get a lot of people trying to do it)

I was wrong **but it was a genuine mistake**, not me trying to be a dick or belittle others as some have said 

(Im also a bit shocked at how crazy it all got, reading back now I feel bad because it sounds bad in the context and it really is all one big misunderstanding but some of the bitter nasty comments and PM's I've gotten over it is shocking and so far from the truth..)

Our month is based on the time it takes, for the moon to orbit the earth, it is not a coincidence that our females have a 28 day menstural cycle on average. 

The mess starts to be realised, when we understand that there is in fact 13 months in a year, 13 * 28 = 364, add one day to make the numbers line up, and an extra day every 4 years, to account for the fact that there is 365 and a quarter days in a year and we would have a much tidier calendar.

We could keep the same months we already have and add an extra one, the difference being every month would have 28 days.

We would have one day of the year, that had no date, which would be today, happy no date day.

Interest. The buy to let mortgage is interest only, that accounts for £350ish. Add insurances and its close to £400.


And yes, while the 11% margin is good! the 11% only represents £50. Iv only had the property for about a year,  but I can imagine any small hickup relating to anything big or small could have me out of pocket for months or years.

The kitchen at some point will need updating/fixing. I'm guessing the minimum I could spend would be £1000 (?) - that's 20 months rent to pay for that, unless I raise the rent of course.

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"*Iain Banks - The Quarry*

Banks has been my favourite author for a long time, and this book is a fitting send-off; he died from cancer shortly after finishing it. It concerns a young man and his terminally ill father (coincidentally - Banks didn't receive his diagnosis until he was almost finished writing this book) who live in a run down house at the edge of a quarry.

It's interesting to spot the parts that Banks wrote after he learned of his own impending death. There are a few poignant yet hilarious ruminations on death: **""I would still rather have the choice, mark you, but, as this would appear to be being denied me, I am making the best of a bad job and looking at the bright side: I shall be free, at last, of that nagging, persistent sensation that I am, for the most part, surrounded by fucking idiots.""** and an almost secondary plot involving a missing videotape.

The northern hemisphere actually has hotter summers than the south on average. Its not due to the distance from the sun, it's the tilt of planet earth that's important, so in the summer the surface area over which the sunlight reaches is more concentrated due to the angle of the sun in relation to the horizon. So the higher the sun is in the sky, the hotter it is (hense it being hotter at midday, and it being hotter the closer you get to the equator). In the winter the sunlight is less concentrated, and the hours of sunlight is much less.

This is already happening in the US and their carbon emissions have fallen dramatically in just a few years.

I will also point out, although I know this argument will fall on deaf ears, but we are already using lots of natural gas which is imported. Replacing those imports with domestically produced gas will reduce the cost of the fuel and make our fuel sources more secure.

And dare I go even further by pointing out that this would be really rather economically beneficial to Bradford, including providing jobs in a part of the country with horrifically bad unemployment.

Fantasy - ASOIAF are a must. And FINALLY, FINALLY the last book in the Wheel of Time series is out - the series itself is about 4 books too long, and can be repetetive, but for all that it is one of my favourites. 

I've started re-reading Discworld too, light, funny, and it's nice to discover I still enjoy them as much as I did when I started reading them as a young teen. 

If you like Historical Fiction, S J Parris is well worth a look (the nom de plume of Stephanie Merrit whose book The Devil Within quite literally saved my life when I was going through a particularly bad spell of depression and should be read by everyone who knows anyone with depression or bipolar disorder. Hint: you do). 

Anyway, S J Parris writes murder mystery, with a hint of political thriller, all set in Elizabethan England. Her ""hero"" is Giordano Bruno, and I haven't liked a central character so much in a very long time. Start with Heresy. 

The Big Short by Michael Lewis is well worth a read if you're at all interested in economics. 

I read Jo Nesbo's back catalogue this year - standard crime thriller fayre, but done well. Harry Hole as the flawed drunk detective is an annoying Cliché but otherwise it's a good series. 

Oddly one of the series I have most enjoyed this year was one I read with my daughter (9), Emma Kennedy's Wilma Tenderfoot series. Yes, it's a kids book... but there is a humour running through it I loved, and it's the first series my daughter has truly loved since she finished Harry Potter.

They have at points during this season. Each time i've watched Cardiff they have played a different formation and tactics, all built to suit their opponent. There is nothing inherantly weak about a high line, it works well when you want to squeeze out ball-playing forwards who like to run into space. Tottenham's problem is that they played a very high line with a 5th choice slow centerback (Dawson) and a central midfielder who is fresh to the EPL and also not known for his pace (Capoue).

I think it is likely Cardiff will line up 5-4-1 or 4-5-1 and flood the center to match up with our pivots.

He makes obvious errors and mistakes on an almost daily basis. 

Contrast /u/ElevenRedsIII with real current or former employees of football clubs, or people closely associated with football clubs in other subs such as /u/devineman and /u/englishMD - the difference is night and day (those guys actually know what they are talking about).

But his schtick works here because frankly the people who do know what they are talking about gave up on calling him out the last time he deleted his account, and the people who still take him seriously are newer fans or those who don't know better.

IMO this has drastically driven down the overall quality of this sub, as threads become full of memes and elevenreds saying something silly and everybody else upvoting it in awe of a guy pretending to be a coach at Liverpool (a coach who spends 18 hours a day making jokes on reddit).

This is just another example (seriously, how can you work at a football club and not know that this is the busiest time of year for scheduling, that there are a half-dozen games in the next 2 weeks?). heaven forbid somebody actually went through his entire comment history (which you can't do, since he deletes his accounts every couple of months) and picked out all the inconsistencies. 

It it turns out that he *does* work for the club in some capacity, that is likely worse - as it means some junior employee is all over the internets being clueless and carrying out like a clown in the name of Liverpool Football Club.

Well, it's something that's difficult to realise you are if you don't know what it is. Society generally doesn't encourage you to question your gender identity or even suggest that it might not align with your sex. So it's only with information, from the Internet for example, that you might actually question things and realise where you're at.

Maybe so - but it does not make it any less of a problem that landlords face, and by proxy that problem gets passed on to every one who rents from them.


&gt;It probably occurred to him that mortgages don't disappear into the aether like rent does

Interest is higher - consider it a (lost) rent to the bank if if you like. 

Ultimately though any kind of complaint like this is irrelevant. We need rented properties, because we do not live in a state that can/or is willing to house everyone. So while there is a supply and demand situation, the rent (influenced by mortgages) is total out of our hands.

You can't blame landlords for this anymore than house owners in general. They influence the cost of renting/mortgages/house costs.



&gt;at some point they end and then you own a house.

No more or less chance of that happening for landlords than anyone else.

Whoa there, it's not that easy.  There aren't quite 365.25 days in a solar year, there are about 365.242.  Pope Gregory ""fixed"" that by declaring that century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 4.  This gets a bit closer to the true value.

Almost 200 years? Seems pretty arbitrary, seeing that Great Britain became a country in 1707 (the title was around since 1608 or something), that it has been a predominately Christian country since basically the end of the Roman occupation, and it has been comparatively liberal for ages (Magna Carta, acts during the 17th century, and loads of other stuff).

Dunno why you had Fox News on anyway. It really is shit. I can remember a while back seeing a video on Youtube where a reporter spent 10 minutes complaining that a Muslim historian had no right to do a book about Jesus. It was ridiculous on too many levels. 

EDIT: OP actually meant 2000, not 200. It's slighty better, but still kicks up some problems, seeing that for around 500 of those 2000 years Christianity wasn't really in Britain, for 1000ish of those 2000 years, there was no real 'liberal tradition', and for 1700 of those 2000 years, there was no Great Britain.

Contrast /u/ElevenRedsIII with real current or former employees of football clubs, or people closely associated with football clubs in other subs such as /u/devineman and /u/englishMD - the difference is night and day (those guys actually know what they are talking about).

True but anyone who takes lower wages is at fault for the British workers not getting those higher wages.

the problem isn't British workers wanting more, it's businesses not paying enough, the more unskilled labor available the more power the employer naturally has. It makes no sense when there is a shortage of work to bring in more people who have even less money to compete over those already crappy jobs.

&gt;Eventually, those relatives will be wealthy enough to upgrade from their one-room dirt-floored shack. The Romanians and Bulgarians who come here will go back home, just like the Poles and the Latvians before them, and the cycle will continue.

yes, the cycle of lower wages continues, and they go back home having taken all that they want from our economy, that's just as bad for us.

now people keep trying to make this sound like an emotive issue and I don't really understand. it's not racism or xenophobia to say that it simply doesn't suit our people to allow mass immigration of unskilled laborers right now.

Christ, I know, right? It's simply absurd to put a man who clearly hates Scots so much in charge of the Scottish branch of the party. Which is probably why he was fired, eventually.

I must admit, I really don't know how the European elections affect it all. 

I haven't really heard any left wing arguments against the EU, and because the right wing parties on offer in Scotland have such little support I would assume this translates into a lack of support for leaving the EU.

This is why during the height of NH Summer the Sun never sets in the arctic. 

During the equinoxes the Earth is neither tilted towards or away from the Sun.

He has been called out and then deleted his account a few times, apparently. It seems more recently that most people have just given up. This is the first time i've seen it 'flare up' again in a while, and it was because of a ridiculously stupid comment he made above (and then attacked a user who pointed it out).

What is interesting is that he doesn't carry his schtick over to /r/soccer - he is just the big fish in the little pond over here in /r/LiverpoolFC. I think it is because he knows that while he can rule his little clique here in this sub, where dissenting voices are often drowned out / downvoted, there is no way it would fly in a larger sub with more knowledgable users.

Twenty. 

And, even if 80% were called Mohammed, does that mean that Glasgow will descent into Sharia law? 

No. 

Because all Muslim people I know, and I know a lot, are exactly like me. Some don't drink. Some pray 5 times a day. Some (female ones) wear head scarves. But you know what? I don't give a shit about any of that. You know why? Because they are my friends. They may be from a different cultural upbringing than me (I'm white Scottish) but I have a fuck tonne more in common with them than I do with an old lady from Cardiff. 

This them and us bullshit pisses me right off. 

Societies evolve over time. Christ, as every cunt in the world knows, curry is the most popular dish in the UK. Is that because only Indian people eat it? No, it's because it's fucking delicious. 

Will the UK be the same culturally and ethnically in 200 years? I doubt it. And I don't give a shit. Because it's massively different from 200 years ago too. And I, for one, welcome it.

**In the current Squad:**

* Noble: West Ham born and bred. Future captain and all around club man.

*  Tompkins: In my opinion, will be a future England centre back if he keeps developing. Classy defender who reminds me of watching Rio

*  Reid: since joining this affable Kiwi has been our most consistent player. I hope a long term partnership with Tompkins is on the cards

**Of all time (in my lifetime watching West Ham):**

* Ferdinand: I love a ball playing centre back. As a kid I remember watching him just stroll effortlessly out of defence time and time again

* Lampard: I do not get the hate this man gets. He was a West Ham man, his dad was a legend for the generation before me. His uncle was gaffer, dad was assistant manager. Great all around midfielder who essentially got hounded out of the club. FUCK TERRY BROWN (old chairman)

* Joe Cole: One of the most skillful players I have seen in person. He was  Englands most potent threat (along with Lampard) for most of the mid 00's. I'm glad he is back, although he isn't really performing at the moment.

* Julian Dicks: a strange juxtaposition. The Left Back was seen as a 'hard man', and a cultured left back. His left foot was so sweet it was made out of strawberries.

* Trevor Sinclair: one of the most underrated players we have ever had, would thrive today in the modern 'inside forward' role.

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Well, it does. If I believe that giving money to a bad charity is a sin as that money could have gone to a good charity, then by extension of the concept of opportunity cost can be involved in defining what a 'sin' is. If you accept opportunity cost within that matrix, then the 'loss' of potential children as a result of being that way inclined is the logical extension of this.

you then called me an ITK... I never said this was inside info did i? sounds more like an opinion to me

&gt; the people who do know what they are talking about gave up on calling him out the last time he deleted his account

hmmmmmm do YOU even know the reason i deleted my last account because its sound like your assuming or and more likely talking out your ass? somebody knew my name (well a few people did and do but this individual) was trying to blackmail/threaten me into sending him stuff or he'd report me, he used my name to find out where i lived, my email and other info so i panicked although I came back realizing that i had never said anything too risky in the first place, the first went because of another issue.  

&gt; IMO this has drastically driven down the overall quality of this sub, as threads become full of memes and elevenreds saying something silly and everybody else upvoting it in awe of a guy pretending to be a coach at Liverpool (a coach who spends 18 hours a day making jokes on reddit).

sounds like your opinion again rather than a fact.. am I not allowed to make jokes? am i excluded from making jokes? and am I not allowed to frequent a site I like a lot? do you have a social media account? I bet you have a couple, I bet you check that a few times a day, comment, post and whatever so no difference here

&gt; This is just another example (seriously, how can you work at a football club and not know that this is the busiest time of year for scheduling, that there are a half-dozen games in the next 2 weeks?). heaven forbid somebody actually went through his entire comment history (which you can't do, since he deletes his accounts every couple of months) and picked out all the inconsistencies.

It was something I heard mentioned and posted to sub from memory but instead of saying Christmas I wrote year, a small mistake to make, hardly worth BLOWING your fucking top over it...you must be that guy who's never made a mistake? 

As for verification I've been verified across all accounts, have (and will) send regular updated proof and most importantly I've also been verified by the mods (the only people who's opinions matter), I was also a mod here.

I've said **a MILLION** fucking times I'm not an ITK in any shape or form, I have no interest in anybody's attention/love/interest and actively discourage it, i share for those who care and I avoid as much as i can saying anything that could get me or the club in trouble something that I've also said a million times, Im here primarily as a fan first but if somebody has a light question that cant get me in trouble i have no problem answering it.

That question is one of context. You present yourself in this sub as an employee of Liverpool Football Club, therefor when you say something like 'Rossiter could be on the bench' you are implying that you know. It doesn't matter if you deny it or not, it is that association that is being made in the mind of readers and it is that association which you know you are exploiting. 

&gt; hmmmmmm do YOU even know the reason i deleted my last account b

How does all of this nonsense explain deleting your account more than once? And it isn't difficult to fake everything you just said. Did you report it to the mods, did you report it to the admins? 

&gt; sounds like your opinion again rather than a fact.. 

Exactly, it is my opinion. My opinion is that you are full of shit and have not a single clue of what you are talking about. You prey on fans who don't know better in order to get some sort of sick fulfillment in your life. You know that without the silly club coach association that what you write wouldn't be worth 2 pence, since you are so clueless to all things football. 

&gt; am I not allowed to make jokes? 

straw man. that wasn't my point.

You didn't even correct the mistake, you actually attacked another user.

&gt; As for verification I've been verified across all accounts, have (and will) send regular updated proof and most importantly I've also been verified by the mods (the only people who's opinions matter), I was also a mod here.

All of that means nothing to me. Congratulations on fooling a few more people.

you get recognition here, it is some sick and twisted personality disorder. I'd bet that when you first signed up you commented endlessly but got no attention and decided to run with this silly 'coach at liverpool' scheme to get more attention, and it worked. Only problem now is that you don't realize how far you have dug yourself in and all the contradictions and general incompetence in your comments.

In addition, like Henderson, he's increased the frequency of his incisive forward passes, so it's not like that's absent from his game. 

Not every player is Coutinho. But, then, if you consider whether Countinho could shut down Dembele or other powerful midfielders, you soon see just how great Allen is.

I heard a theory that essentially said that in hunter-gatherer society the men would go off to hunt once a month over the full moon as it was the safest time to be away from camp. As a result the women who were infertile over the same period would be at an advantage in terms of having more opportunity to conceive when the men were actually in camp. So the women who had that cycle had more offspring, and eventually it became an exclusive trait.


Also the survival pressures (rainy season/migratory patterns etc) on other mammals were less relevant because humans were able to gather and store food, and also because the investment needed to bring up a human child is years rather than just a few months.


Let's be honest though-just because we can't be certain how it occurred, it doesn't mean that some Druidic moon spirit had a hand in it...


Also interesting: the reason that we celebrate Christmas on the 25th is because that's the date of latest sunrise, even if the longest night is actually today.

I disagree about his selfishness on two fronts: first, there have been so many occasions when he's frustrated me by playing a simple pass rather than taking a player on. Second, being the type of player he is, wanting to beat players and finish moves is precisely what he should be doing. His judgement will improve with time.

  Interesting that you mention Henderson as a comparison. Henderson is developing into a top player and is in supreme form right now, but when Henderson was 19 hardly anyone had heard of him. He wasn't as good as Sterling at that age, although comparison's between the players are hard and ultimately pointless because they play in completely different roles.

 I don't think Sterling is ready to be regular starter against top opposition, but against weaker teams he should definitely get the nod. He'll get game experience and confidence that way, which will help him iron out the weaknesses in his game which are, in my view, due to his youth rather than any innate inability.

This is quite far off [the current state of play.](http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/uk-polling-report-average-2) I'd say it's not a massive stretch to say that your Open Europe link is not an accurate representation of voting intention.

I'd also critically question Open Europe itself. It describes itself as ""an independent think-tank calling for reform of the European Union"". They outline in their vision that they want a ""slimmed down, outward looking EU"". This doesn't mean their research isn't valid, but they definitely have an agenda to push.

From the results here it looks like a lot of people would be happier with Cameron's renegotiation tactic than to leave entirely i.e. they aren't convinced by UKIP's ""we must leave!"" message.

true,coinspeak,null,null,"I'm on a phone and will give a fuller response later today, but we've thought about this - we have multi-account deterrents in place, and the fact that 2/3 games you have to speak means that bots are likely to lose (since they can't speak) whenever they come across a real judge, meaning in the long run it is not profitable. If you can make a bot that convinces the judge though, more power to you! (Think there's a relevant xkcd here...)

[edit from computer:]
We treat this problem in the same way poker sites treat cooperation between players/multi-accounting.
As soon as a player is his own judge (this applies to having an accomplice judge, and also to bots judging each other), the game becomes unfair - so we have to disincentivise this (beyond checking IPs etc, which can only go so far).

Basically, to profit from cheating, you have to become your own Judge. It is infeasible to do this regularly without detection when the number of players is high, but even running only two accounts from different locations (for example), one could expect to become their own judge every so often.

However, in all the games where the player is not their own judge, and is instead a speaker, they must make some sort of argument - otherwise their opponent will beat them easily (judges tend not to give money to silent opponents/obvious bots). So a bot will lose around 2/3 of games where they do not also control the judge, and the strategy is unprofitable.

This means that if somebody did decide to flood the site with bots (ignoring the fact that they would quickly be banned), the genuine players would actually see an increase in profits - but the quality of the game would go down (you'd be matched with a bot, likely you'd win, and that would be that).

If this becomes a problem we will add a CAPTCHA to the decision-making stage - then any judging bot would fail to make a decision, would lose its stake, and neither player would lose any BTC.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;That question is one of context. You present yourself in this sub as an employee of Liverpool Football Club, therefor when you say something like 'Rossiter could be on the bench' you are implying that you know. It doesn't matter if you deny it or not, it is that association that is being made in the mind of readers and it is that association which you know you are exploiting.

context exactly, I didnt say 'as an employee of LFC Rossiter could be on the bench' I said 'Rossiter could be on the bench' YOU assumed the context wrong, even so could doesnt imply that he is or will be, it's implies possibility, once again you've assumed

&gt; Exactly, it is my opinion. 

and 99% of what you are basing your arguments on are assumptions, you said you went through my comment history but then are taking my comments that are clearly opinions and immediately associating them as fact or inside information, again thats YOUR mistake. 

&gt; You prey on fans who don't know better in order to get some sort of sick fulfillment in your life

again, what do i get out of this? nobody knows my name, I dont have twitter, facebook, a website, direct email, I never ask for anything, I dont reveal anything or/and I avoid talking about things that can get me in trouble with the club.. I spend most of my time giving training advice and the odd tactical insight, but fuck me right? HOW DARE YOUR ELEVENREDS TRY AND HELP OTHERS!! 

&gt; How does all of this nonsense explain deleting your account more than once? And it isn't difficult to fake everything you just said. Did you report it to the mods, did you report it to the admins?

ElevenReds, ElevenRed, ElevenRedsII, ElevenRedsIII are all the accounts (I also tried other accounts to shake who I am out but people recognize the way I talk and they didnt last long) I've had and i'll explain why im on this one. ElevenReds was my first and I deleted that because I started getting hit by abuse, I then made ElevenRed but deleted it because I didnt like the name, I made ElevenRedsII immediately after came back all good stayed a long time then deleted it because again I started getting threats and abuse when all i was trying to do was contribute, I got fed up and left for a few months, tried some other communities out but I didnt like them so came back here made a profile with a different name tried to blend in people recognized the way I talk and so i thought fuck it, fuck all the people being negative and trying to bring me down I'll just make the III and final account. 

Yes I reported it to the mods, I kept them in the loop the entire time, and we kept contact through email and they had a way that they knew who I was 

&gt; You didn't even correct the mistake, you actually attacked another user.

bad from me I agree and i apologize and ill apologize to them but it was a bit of a perfect storm of events, I was on my phone, I was out and about so I couldn't sit down and go throw and think about everything and I was replying to about 5/6 other comments at the time when i did get a second to talk, not good from me but I guess I misinterpreted the point they were making as them trying to have a sly dig, (I haven't even look at the replies yet but I got like 30+ to respond to) also I thought that I was right by saying we'd be on top in the new year forgetting we have a game boxing day but that was a mistake by me that I missed so I couldn't understand the hostility at the time but I realize the mistake I made.. but its also a pretty good example of how people can go from minor retaliation to full on hostile 

&gt; All of that means nothing to me. Congratulations on fooling a few more people.

so.. I provided proof and regular updated proof but now proof doesnt verify somebody even though it is verification to verify who I say I am? ...do you not see how ridiculous your argument is? 

&gt; You get recognition here, it is some sick and twisted personality disorder. I'd bet that when you first signed up you commented endlessly but got no attention and decided to run with this silly 'coach at liverpool' scheme to get more attention, and it worked. Only problem now is that you don't realize how far you have dug yourself in and all the contradictions and general incompetence in your comments.

again for somebody that has such indepth knowledge of my comment history you seemed to have missed all the times I've told people that Im here just to be a fan and when people thank me for the instight or when I make the odd post that I thank them instead and tell them very often that it's them not me that makes this sub such a great sub.. but of course yeah that makes ME the self obsessed one

&gt; I'd bet that when you first signed up you commented endlessly but got no attention and decided to run with this silly 'coach at liverpool' scheme to get more attention, and it worked.

actually no because I wasnt a coach when I first signed up here (im again surprised somebody who's read all my comments wouldnt know something like this which I've mentioned since I got the job? it's almost as if you assumed things to justify your argument?), I was a regular fan like anybody else when somebody brought up the conversation about youth contracts and I corrected what one comment said because I played in the academy and they asked me some questions and I answered them. I've had a pretty long association with the club and knew a few of the old staff from when I played so when a junior coaching role opened up a younger friend of mine who was working at the club put my name in and with his help and the older staff members I got the job, I then worked hard and progressed and they knew my ambitions from the first interview that I wanted to get into first team coaching so they allowed me to shadow the senior first coaches and Im a nice guy so i got on well with everyone and built up a good relationship.

&gt; You get recognition here, it is some sick and twisted personality disorder. 

For somebody that thinks I have a 'sick twisted personality disorder' you seem very angry and bitter over me and have assumed a lot of information and come to conclusions without any evidence other than one comment I made which i said was a mistake and a lot of assumptions, if you had just asked me I would have happily have answered all of your questions but you went on a hero rant

&gt; Good for you, enjoy it while it lasts - my bet is that you have a few more months before someone at the club notices you here or the admins here realize. After that you go back to being the sad old kid whose comments and jokes nobody paid attention to. 

again very bitter.. and people liked my jokes before they knew my job too, most people here I have a good relationship because Im respectful ",0,1387646614,null,0,false,0,ce74kga,t3_1tdvt7,t1_ce74kga,t1_ce737db,null,1428040180,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,devineman,logo,,"This is pretty much my attitude towards it.

We could have easily dropped points in that game due to a combination of luck, complacency and Fulham's desire.  At 2-0 down I was concerned that we would switch off and Pellegrini would attempt to gain control of possession instead of going for the jugular, which is something that I think he did and I continuously disagree with. I think this is the fourth or fifth time this season where this ""all out until a two goal cushion then calm the intensity down"" has almost hurt us.  I wouldn't mind him starting with a possession based game and getting progressively more open as the game goes on but the opposite way seems to be inviting trouble when away from home.

With that said however, at 2-2 I thought both the team and Pellegrini responded really well and deserved the victory.  Fulham and their manager were a little naive and it cost them today.  Muelensteen's lack of experience was something that worked in our favour as a more experienced manager would have sacrificed attacking threat at 2-2 to give their players a rest and shut up shop for a few minutes.  Instead they tried to run purely on momentum and stayed too open.

A little disappointed that Guidetti didn't get on instead of Garcia or Negredo when the game has 5 minutes left.  His development is going to suffer without game time due to his age and previous injuries and we have a decision to make in January.

At this point we can say that whilst we might play worse away than at home, our record is beginning to take shape at just the right time.    We're about to enter ""squeaky bum time"" as one old Scot used to call it, and with Liverpool at home next and Arsenal/Chelsea tomorrow, our next few performances will be important in the grand scheme of the season.

Apart from set piece problems I thought we were excellent. Cardiff's game plan was pretty crude, play the ball into the channels and try to win free kicks, and constantly in the refs ear, I can see how that might be successful at home with the crowd behind them and weak refs. It was somewhat more effective when they concentrated on  skrtel and johnson, having got nothing out of sakho all day. That was never a penalty in the first half when caulker and skrtel were grappling by the way,, if anything it was more of a foul by Caulker. Him whining at the ref for the next five minutes, and then mutch curling up into a ball when sakho brushed his head typified their approach.

If suarez hadnt ""relaxed"" second half, as he put it, we would have had 5 or 6. I'm fine with him conserving energy for boxing day, but this was the main reason we didnt add to our tally. We kept creating chances in the second, probably more than in the first half but just didnt finish them. Very happy with the performance of the midfield, apart from poor shooting by Allen and Coutinho, Phil has developed a tendency to scuff everything and Allen seems to freeze in front of goal.

Defensively Sakho got beaten once in the air off a set piece but his open play defending was outstanding. Probably my favourite moment was when there was a tussle for the ball second half and he just braced and then launched his whole body between ball and player. Dominant physical defending and technically excellent, and a more intelligent passer than many central midfielders.

The only real negatives were stoned Johnson, again, in one of his slumps, and Kelly still struggling for sharpness in acceleration and on the turn.

Again we won comfortably without having a whole lot of luck, that's another two for our woodwork tally.

This is much better for the status quo than having teenagers driven to an anti-establishment subculture, as they were under Thatcher's Section 28. 

I honestly believe that the left embraced gay rights ahead of the Tories (between the mid-70's and the mid-90's, alongside feminism) because it fitted into a consistent leftist ideology of equality.

In the late 80's and early 90's this alienated Labour from northern factory workers and miners, but London lefties took up the torch, because being gay wasn't a perversion and it didn't harm anyone.

where is this 25k of yours saved ?

saving money is all about risk - you can put up to 85k in a savings account with any UK bank and the government guarantees that amount of money per institution. But typically the average savings or isa account is only about 3% interest.

You can peer to peer lending for rates up to 6% , but it's dubious whether your money is protected in those schemes.

This reminds me of people who determine a basketball player's value based solely on how many points he scores. Being a midfielder isn't always about goals or assists. Don't forget other very important characteristics like controlling the pace of the game, stopping opponents' attacks from forming, helping in transition from defense to offense, etc.

I think both Nasri and Milner do these things well, Milner is just a bit more of an attacking threat because he likes to get forward more than Nasri does.

He has immense energy and effort and knows how to pick out a good pass, he could be a difference maker in this role and he wouldn't slouch in helping defend either. Eriksen at the #10 is a clear choice and with Holtby deeper to give us good attacking positions it could open up space for Eriksen to pick out through balls and find space. 

My hope is that this is the Spurs midfield of the future. Sandro is only 24, Holtby 23, and Eriksen 21. With time to work together they could develop into quite the deadly trio.

It's not a ""small aspect"" at all, sexuality is a fundamental part of people, and being told it's sinful creates shame for gay people which straight people do not get. They may be told to suppress their desires until after marriage, but they are not told that their sexuality is inherently sinful, in a world where homophobia is still present anyway.

learning wise doesn't get better, experience doesn't get better, such depth and the beard doesn't hurt...

BUT! I think many people hold on to what was rather than what could be.

The fantasy of the past partnership in Gerrard and Xabi, while I think both their experience and skill is priceless their age and mobility is a problem, if not now it will be in the next year or 2. While im not saying Hendo or Allen will individually or together reach the same level as Gerrard and Xabi partnership I still feel like they could be the start of something special, both 23 years young but they have a lot of great qualities that are underrated and get overlooked, they already in the breif playing time together have shown to amplify each other strengths like Gerrard and Xabi used to which helped push them to such great levels, while in the short term it would be a boost I think we should let Hendo and Allen continue to develop and continue to buy young . 

again I'd love him to come back, Im certain he would boost us, but I cant help but look at what Him and Gerrard and think why not let these 2 have their shot, but i am biased as fuck working with the younger players!

Yes, that's what I'm talking about. It isn't revisionism. 

&gt;Scots are very well represented when it comes to the British aristocracy (and indeed a large portion of the English aristocracy can trace their roots to when James I started granting English land and titles to Scots) and you have a significant rural community.

Can they really still be ""Scottish"" if their families have spent ~400 years in England? And why in the hell should this matter? 


&gt;Any evidence of this anti-Scot policy of UKIP?

""The Scots are subsidy junkies whingeing like a trampled bagpipes as they wait for their next fix of English taxpayers' money.""- ""Lord"" Monckton, Former President of UKIP in Scotland

true,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,"There are pragmatic problems in linguistics, but that's just the way it is.  

You're right and I can understand that frustration, but I get frustrated with people like /u/DogBotherer and /u/Frankeh, because pragmatically they are being pedantic. They know full well what the speaker intention is (the sarcastic ""Literally, you say.."" shows that) so linguistically, it doesn't bloody matter: *obviously* OP didn't mean that they are from different planets than Earth. That's different from your point. DogBotherer is wrong and right. That's what the dictionary definition of ""literally"" is, but it's wrong to say OP is incorrect to use it instead of ""figuratively"" because stylistically, there's no right or wrong way ""to language"" as long as context is there.  
 

  

Language isn't simple and it's a lot more complex than what a dictionary says. I'm just tired of people who come across as though it is simple, and what the dictionary says is a *strict* rule. If that was the case, poetry wouldn't exist, idioms wouldn't exist, and most of the greatest novels would never have been accepted for publication.  

Complaining about ""Literally? You mean figuratively!"" is in the same field of telling someone off for saying ""It's raining cats and dogs"" because it isn't raining actual cats and dogs. It's sheer pedantry when speaker intention is understood.

Step 3: set a timeline for each of your goals. This allows you to prioritise them (e.g. I want to save for a house within the next 2 years, I want to retire at age 67, I want to have a rainy day fund tomorrow)  
Step 4: once you have timelines established you should allocate risk. Any money which needs to be accessible within the next 12 months needs to be in a no risk, no tie-in product such as a current account or savings account. Any money needed in 1-3 years can be in a product with a tie in or you can start to look at fairly low risk investments. Any money needed in 5-10 years should be in a riskier product. Any money needed in over 10 years can be as risky as you are willing to allow. 

Best thing to do for now is think about the steps above and then come back with a more specific question.

I think 'distinctly average' is very very harsh, at 23 he's got some very good qualities already and although he may have a different passing style it's very efficient and easy to get overlooked.

I also remember young a Xabi before he was sainted and he wasn't the perfect player everyone seems to remember either, (good player better than Allen sure) but Im not sure why fans dont seem to remember this (possibly because he won the CL at 23 but to be fair Gerrard was sub human that year) but usually when you look back on a player its always highlights and their best moments but he really perfected his game at around 25-27 years old like Gerrard did and hit world class heights at 28-30 aswell..oddly enough around the same time Gerrard did (soul mates? the science says so..)

Xabi also had a lot more playing time at that point i should note, but we cant develop for the future if we keep giving up playing time for experienced player nearer the end, its kind of a need experience to get a job--can't get a job without experience situation

This has been discussed quite a bit, especially as in the new series' there have been comedic opportunities for them as well.

Some people say it's a situational thing, others think it's because they're easily defeated (I'm going to walk up to you, open your top, rewire you and kick you away, I'll open up a portal that sucks anyone with cooties back inside it, my not-a-girlfriend is going to will you into dust, etc.)

The 9th Doctor even casually referred to them as genius when the lone stranded one had to figure out that door code in their first episode back. Genius? Sell me on that.

For all that, though...if they actually *speak*, it really freaks me out. Something besides exterminate, something besides being freaked out, *anything* besides repeating or issuing commands one after the other...it can be REALLY freaky!

*Genesis of the Daleks* was the first old Who I saw after watching 99% of the new series, and while they were interesting, without spoiling, it is their little bit of dialogue that has helped echo their real definition for me ever since.

In Doomsday (two-parter so I may be one episode off) when Rose says ""You didn't have to KILL him!"" and with a quick pivot of the eye stalk — ""Neither did we need him alive."" That's some cold sh--. Clearly an intelligent being that gives zero f--ks.

true,ThrowerOfTantrums,null,null,"You are correct in that there are two main methods by which pension contributions are made into a scheme (net pay and relief at source) but I think you may have the definitions mixed around. Net pay is the method by which pension contributions are deducted from your salary before tax. Since the £100 contribution (if we use your example) are made ""gross"", there is no further relief to claim and the full £100 will appear in your pension.

Relief at source is the one where you have to go through the rigmarole of having your pension contribution deducted from your net pay and having HMRC pay 20% into your scheme (and you will have to claim for an extension to your basic rate band via your tax return if you are a higher or additional tax payer).

**Question 1**

From my understanding and assuming that relief at source is the method by which contributions are made, yes the £20 is still added into your pension pot, thus the total contribution should still be £100.

Corporation tax and income tax are two very different concepts and should be treated as such. Irrespective of what happens on the corporation tax side, it should not affect income tax matters.

**Question 2**

*Higher rate taxpayers and net pay contributions.*

The full £100 is deducted from gross pay, prior to any income tax being calculated. No further relief is available, HMRC do not owe any amounts and the full £100 appears in your pension pot. Nothing more, nothing less. The amount you state will be the amount deducted from your gross pay and will be the amount in your pension.

*Higher rate taxpayers and relief at source.*

Contributions via the relief at source method will extend the basic rate band, not higher rate.

If you have had £80 deducted from your net pay, HMRC will pay in £20 and you will have an extension to your basic rate band in the next tax year.

For Suso it made sense because he's a youngster in a foreign country, so sending him back home for a year allows him to focus on football first. 

I'm not convinced that it would be as useful for Raheem's development to send him off now. He's an established squad player and he needs to feel part of the club. If he went to another English team and did well, there's a chance that he might ask for a move, and I don't want that. I'm not questioning his loyalty, because, like any sensible young player, he wants to play for Liverpool. Sending him out might either make him think we don't want him, or he'll get used to being the ""main man"" in another team and won't want to come back as a result. We need to keep hold of him.

- Essien is suspended after picking up his 5th yellow card vs Sunderland. I think we will be seeing the Rampard pivot, with Ramires tracking Özil like you said.
- Remember our game vs Arsenal under RDM? Oscar man-marked Arteta and effectively played him out of the game. I feel Mou might look for a similar effect against Arsenal's midfield, especially if we play defensively like you say.
- While Willian has been in great form, I think he'll be a sub in this game. Judging by the line up played midweek, the Big Three in the attacking band were rested, and I think all three of Hazard, Oscar and Mata will start ths game.
- With Koscielny out injured, Wenger will roll out a physical defensive partnership of Vermaelen and Mertesacker. It'll be difficult playing long balls against them, so if we want to take that approach we'd be best starting Ba. Otherwise, we could exploit their relative lack of pace (Mertesacker especially), and play Torres or even Schürrle up front to try to get in behind them.

Honestly, Matt Smith is my favourite Doctor, and I'd love to help you appreciate him, but I don't know how I can do that.  You're nitpicking little scenes and making it seem like the 11th is somehow this big, angry guy...when he's just not.  That was 10.  

What makes the Matt Smith my favourite is the fact that on the outside, he acts like a goofy little child.  He runs around, his arms flailing about, and does a lot of silly things.  And it's all just a game, because in certain moments, he lets his guard down, and you see how very *old* he is.  How tired he is.  How much he's seen, how much he's had to do.  And you realize that all the goofiness is just a charade; he's trying to distract everyone, and himself, from how long he's lived, and all the terrible things he's been forced to do.  He's been described as ""an old man in a child's body"" and I find that description really apt.  For how young he is, Matt Smith really conveys how ancient the Doctor is.

That's why I love him, anyway.  I'm sorry but I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

I honestly don't think they do it too much for profit, but help ex-Reds support their income with signings since they never played for the money like we have today. I believe they helped with raising money for constructing Ray Kennedy's handicap accessible shower and bathroom along with supplementing the incomes of Yeats, Alan Kennedy, Callaghan, Lawler, Thomspson, Lawrence, Jones, Case, St. John, Lawler, etc. Tommy Smith worked with them often and sadly has since sold his metals to help raise money to leave for his kids and Joey Jones has been in a lot of pain due to his playing days so this helps.

I'd email them to see what they can do for you if they're still working. It might not be a signed kit, but I think a signed photo could be doable. Very affordable, not like some other shitty 3rd party brokers. The sad part is that I've purchased so many items from them, I can't fucking afford all of the custom frames I need for them!

He doesn't quite want to work out why the houses are cheaper - possibly because there aren't as many fucking jobs (and if your job is in the South East, you kind of have to live there, not in Newcastle).

When the coach leaves ""by mutual consent"" (and by all accounts the relationship was completely broken between AVB and the front office) because of results/decisions made/relationship it is rarely one sided.

Baldini offering to resign sounds a bit along the lines of ""i hold some of the blame in this whole situation as well"", actually a fairly stand up stance to have.

Levy refusing makes sense to me.  Levy has always wanted a DoF and only ditched the setup with 'Arry because 'Arry wouldn't work with one. Also sounds like Levy has held high regard to Baldini for quite some time. So Levy would keep the DoF he has wanted rather than trying to find a new manager and DoF at the same time.  Additionally, as indicated in the story, he can task Baldini with researching and building the list of managerial candidates which plays to Baldini's experience in and around the game.

Much easier to move on from someone if you can just remove them as an option from your mind entirely. Just my thoughts there.

Here's the thing, he only texts me when he's mindlessly wankered. But he does it quite consistently, I can expect at least one night a month, more often two, sometimes they'll stop at 2am but on one occasion he was still in this state at 2pm and I have a rather saucy selection of photos as a result (with no exchange - ha, I win!). However, a piece of advice I'd give to all you fellas is that if you want to get saucy, don't just do it during drunkentimes. My ego will be more flattered if you do it when sober. Hence, the poor fella consistently fails, despite his many efforts. His 'I just want some attention' text last night killed me though. And now I am in a difficult place, because he's almost a friend.

2) I don't frequent that sub, but please remember reddit is mostly full of total arseholes, so don't fret too much if they are argumentative, bitchy or otherwise all 'claws out' this place is a veritable clusterfuck of 2edgy teens and shitposting arseholes who hate their lives and vent via tippy-tappying on keys in an avenue that offers no repurcussions. Fuck 'em, fuck it all.

3) eh stringing someone along, I dunno, are you stringing them along? I assume as adults you both understand it might happen or not and there's a huge shade of maybe in between, I don't think that being in the grey bit for ages and then deciding nope counts as stringing along. I dunno, don't ask me about dealing with other people, they are all mental as far as I'm concerned, but I'm supposedly the mad one, go figure. That said, a bit of honesty goes a long way.

4) my cat is a fat cunt, turns out he's been piling on the pounds so now he needs a kitty diet, also since /u/NEWSBOT3 posted a vid of his cat now I feel compelled to video jackjack too, watch this space.

9) Aww, family stuff... dude, I'm so lucky I have family close. I' sad you stress or don't miss some of your fam, but you are totally family here. anytime :)

10) I'm gonna give up smoking tobacco soon and just e-cig it. Not giving up smoking da weed though, christ.

11) onto me: I bought myself super meat boy as an early xmas pressie and am very bloody good at it. I done all my prezzies already which is good for me, and I accidentally 16 cans of lager for 6.49 up spar so I'll probably be dead by this time tommorrow. Just kidding they are for over christmas.

Holtby and Eriksen can both distribute the ball, but they both leave us a bit open in the back. Capoue and Sandro are great defensive midfielders, but neither can move the ball into the attack. Paulinho and Dembele can transition the ball from deep to the front third, but can't make the killer pass. Yet, AVB kept running Sandro, Paulinho, and Dembele as a trio. Sandro would grab the ball, give it to one of the runners, and they'd bring it up field, and not be able to get the ball to Soldado. Instead, they'd dump it out to the wing, and with Townsend on the right side, pretty much guarantee a shot from deep.

Instead, we combine one of each of the three types of midfielders. Sandro takes the ball deep, and gives it to Dembele. Dembele brings the ball up, while keeping the option to pass to either Eriksen, or a quick moving wing. Once Eriksen gets the ball, the wings cut in, and he has three attacking options. If we lose the ball, Sandro is still sitting deep to cover the CBs, and Dembele can transition back quickly. Guaranteed four men in attack every time.

ok, so ISA

if your isa isnt maxxed for this year, i would move from your savings into your isa so that its maxed out, but only do this in march - just before the new tax year. Then when it starts, there will be new isas with at least 3% rates for 12 months in the firs tfew weeks of April. - get it transferred into one of those there and immediately fill with the extra limit, which should give you a decent savings of at least your 9.6k+5,760 at 3 or more percent.

Premuim bonds are awful these days, get your money into a normal savings account instead, it gives a better rate.

Savings accounts - there are accounts like the santander current acc which will give 3% on up to 20k balances - might be worth using that rather than your savings account. 

On top of that I would consider putting 5k or so into peer to peer lending - funding circle should give ~6% returns , which is worth a punt on. Remember to split across a lot of different debts to minimise your risks.

there are stocks and shares isas which might be worth looking into as well but i'm not very familiar with them - again i'd put maybe 5k in over 3-5 years and see how it does. There are some which you can put regular amounts into which might be a nice idea.

Secondly, my point was not that all non-believers are going to hell. My point was that everyone inherently sins and that in the Christian way of thinking everyone does bad things. From that perspective, yes, homosexuality is a sin, but no more of a sin than countless other natural human feelings or drives. A gay person no more has to remain celibate than every single Christian has to give up absolutely everything that they have and give it to the less fortunate. Both are mythical hypothetical impossibilities which no reasonable person could do, hence the need for the grace of god.

true,EarlofCardigan,null,null,"As a Chelsea fan based in the US, my opinion is not one based on geography. Thus I have no geographic hate for Arsenal or Totthenham that many UK-based CFC fans deservedly have. 
On the flipside I have met so many unbearable Liverpool fans that they have become one of my most hated teams. 

And the success of Man City and Man U make my hatred for both Manchester clubs much stronger than my hate than any London-based club. 

To be honest, I can't seem to hate the Spurs cause they never seem to be worthy of hate. They try so hard and fail every time, it's almost cute. ",0,1387673337,null,0,false,0,ce7dz8h,t3_1ten62,t1_ce7dz8h,t3_1ten62,null,1428035706,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5
