If you think Lukaku is ready for a team like Dortmund, you'd think he'd be ready for Chelsea. Which is why he's getting another spell out on loan to a club in a European competition i.e. *he's not ready* (quite yet).

On topic, my preferred player would be Zlatan for a year or two while Lukaku matures out on loan, but I don't know if those rumours have any factual basis at all. Cavani is good stats-wise but I don't know how well he'd integrate with our play style, as I don't watch Serie A (someone expand on this if possible please). Zlatan is literally the perfect finisher and with the way we've created (and wasted) chances this year he'd slot in perfectly, he's great at playing as #9 and holding up the ball/creating chances as well. 

We've of course got some outside targets like Hulk but I don't know how well they'd gel with our team either.

However I would say there's always room for exceptions, but I would expect this to be handled fairly and in a transparent and accountable manner, and not to be taken lightly. For example, I would support the deportation of Abu Hamza or Anjem Choudry, or Piers Morgan.

2) It needs to be decided on a case by case basis and handled transparently as I mentioned above. I would expect that people that are not quite breaking the letter of the law, but are inciting others to do so may come under this category.

He is simply fantastic on and off the ball and defensively. His work rate is unmatched by just about any forward player I have seen.

Tactically, off the ball he is a genius, he is incredibly inventive and I believe he has more of a willingness to pass than he is given credit for, if he trusts who he is out there with, he will make the right pass. When they got Sturridge to play alongside him we saw this.

His desire to win causes him to do everything, go and get the ball for the opponents keeper when Liverpool are behind/tied, constantly shouts for opposition fouls and handballs, everything, he does everything he can and he is the most exciting player to watch. 

He can't be marked out of a match, he can't. Messi can even be shutdown but I feel Saurez at his best is unplayable. He is better than Bale, no doubt.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What you are proposing has been tried before in the 1930s. It was popular for a while, but when people realised what it meant to live under a system like that, it fell out of favour.

When you talk about ""degenerate values"" and ""unassailable national ideals"", ""nationalistic education courses"", this is the same sort of language that the National Socialists used in 1930s Germany.
I know it's easy for someone to dismiss ideas they disagree with by comparing to the Nazis, but you really are employing the principles of fascism here, even if you don't see it.
Fascism is about the subjugation of the individual in favour of the nation state, eradicating individual and opposing ideas and enforcing conformity in service to the objectives of the government. Liberalism tries to treat everyone the same, but allows each some room to think and act differently; Fascism treats people differently, depending on how closely or not they match the government's vision for society, and expects them all to think and act the same. The Nazis used the word „Gleichschaltung“ (roughly translated: synchronisation, bringing into line) to cover most of the things you suggest. 

I am struck by your comment that women are left leaning because they are sheltered from reality. In my experience, women are just as in touch with reality as men; if they are more inclined to left-wing sentiments, it's because they are better at empathy and compassion than men, not because they are out of touch.

I also find disturbing your inability to mention the Left without using the word ""leftard"" or associating left-wing ideas with mental illness. It's as if the idea of ""left"" and ""retard"" are for you irrevocably conflated – you cannot separate the two. And you can't get away with it just by placing the word in quotation marks to suggest it's not your expression.

Look, I disagree with many right-wing views – some of the most extreme ones I really do think are deluded and symptomatic of psychosis, because they have no basis in reality – but I can at least credit right-wing thinkers with the gift of sanity and take their ideas seriously rather than dismiss them as mentally deficient.",0,1369696405,null,0,1369705137,0,ca73sff,t3_1f498b,t1_ca73sff,t1_ca701wv,null,1431014012,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I don't listen to that much clean vocal stuff but when I do it's usually:

* [Darkthrone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ1-Fc2zaK0) - Gods in the metal world (careful if you go exploring them, only their new stuff is like this)

* [Blaakyum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Jh7syd_6M) - Very good traditional heavy metal band from Lebanon.

* [Snailking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shoPsqjU8kQ) - Doom metal band that recently got big through Reddit

* [Mortal Sin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewT4xR6awsA) - Kick ass Australian thrash band (the comedian Steve Hughes was their drummer)

* [Saxon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGnhF0_rA90) - Classic NWOBHM band


And these are ones I've recently been shown:

* [Dark Quarterer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltWZN1OB_jc)

* [Christian Mistress](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5DHxm-XgMc) - female vocalist

* [Fenriz' Red Planet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYBIjPX3Wyc) - Fenriz is from Darkthrone, band at beginning. This is from a doom split he did

Then of course there's the ones everyone's heard of:

[Judas Priest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS6-vI70oc0), [Iron Maiden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPbqQOf41Qc), [Black Sabbath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rihpED_obk), [Deep Purple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCnebZnysmI) and [Motorhead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vOQ-jy0Aw4).

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"OK, big comment coming but I dislike the phrase PC and fascist partly because they are thrown around far to often. PC is a really really over used idea. It would be a hell of a lot better if we talk about insulting speech and critical but discussion based speech. As far as I'm concerned insulting speech (i.e speech based on no evidence that consists of nothing but a crude derogatory sentence to insult another person) has no place in mainstream media, at all. I'm talking about saying that because one nutter went mental that we should deport all people who are not British or raging that the winner of Pride of Britain award was 'a fuckin muzzie' [to quote one charming EDL member](http://edlnews.co.uk/index.php/edl-random-quote-generator/10-news/edl-racists/295-racist-of-the-week-amy-lady-shortie-andrews) or insisting violence in general. Writers are totally free to be critical of policy or suggest better ways of going about doing things in a measured manner. Honestly if a newspaper had a headline referred to all Muslims, not just extreme one's, as 'muzzies' and recommended the drunk violent confrontation of them whether they are extreme or not as the EDL members tend to do (even if the leadership claim they don't) what would you think? I would think that journalism had taken a big step in the wrong direction. They are news organisations designed to be interesting to read; they aren't there to give people a laugh by saying extreme things to get a rise out of people they have to be a bit more careful and rightly so. If you call that PC then so be it. 

Even having said that there are plenty of media sources for the views the EDL supposedly has but put in a way that avoids being pure drivel and is, in my opinion only partial drivel, and also avoids violence. [Here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2331368/Until-leaders-admit-true-nature-Islamic-extremism-defeat-it.html) for one is an article that was posted on the EDL's page. It says basically the same thing as the EDL claim and makes a reasonable point that can be considered and accepted or rejected. Take note, however, that it makes the distinction between extreme and normal muslims and does not deal in absolutes and tries not to be openly aggressive, vile and rude. It makes a point that is targeted and means to make a point and argue for it. That's the difference between the ""PC"" media and the EDL who can rightly be called fascists. The EDL makes no real arguments apart from 'deport all the \*instert racial stereotype here*. The media however biased argues, debates and refrains from pure abuse. The right or left wing media is not extreme or fascist even if it is biased, the EDL, BNP etc are extreme and in some cases can be called fascist because they are so unreasonable. There's a real ideological difference. Fascists are not open to changing their point of view and will enforce it with violence if necessary. Fascists are overtly nationalistic and again will use violence to enforce their views. The wiki page on Fascism has a good definition, compare it to the EDL and see if you notice similarities. My opinion anyway. ",0,1369696941,null,0,false,0,ca73xys,t3_1f4yok,t1_ca73xys,t1_ca715g0,null,1431013940,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I can see why you would think that, although that implication was not intended. I was brought up in a very strict Catholic household, although I would call myself a non-religious agnostic, I dislike the term 'Atheist' as I find it limiting. 

To clarify my earlier post, it simply seemed odd that you would claim religion to be the root cause of this incident, while also being a practicing catholic. Whereas now I understand that what you actually meant was that the misuse of religious though is the root cause. Do correct me if I'm wrong though.

true,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"For those who can't read behind the paywall:

&gt;Courts in England and Wales are facing wholesale privatisation under revolutionary plans that would end the system that has existed since Magna Carta.

&gt;The idea would establish the courts service as a commercial enterprise, paying its way and freed from Treasury control, with court buildings and thousands of staff put in the hands of private companies. It would save the Ministry of Justice £1 billion a year.

&gt;Funding for the courts would be generated by bigger fees from wealthy litigants and private sector investment, with hedge funds encouraged to invest by an attractive rate of return.

&gt;To counter judges’ fears that privatisation would erode independence, the courts could be placed under a Royal Charter — as proposed for regulating the press.

&gt;Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, instructed officials this year to explore plans for reform to ensure that the Courts and Tribunal Service provides value for money.

&gt;A paper outlining options is expected to go to Mr Grayling within two weeks, with a tight timetable for action under which the shake-up could proceed this autumn. The plan is strongly backed by the Justice Secretary.

&gt;Options under discussion include hiving off court buildings to a private company, which would run and maintain them, or a more radical proposal in which the 20,000 courts staff would also transfer to the private sector.

&gt;Crucially, the plans do not involve judges or Britain’s 25,000 magistrates. But leading legal figures opposed even the more conservative option.

&gt;The former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said: “I am all in favour of making more money from commercial court users, and I am also all in favour of those who commit crime making a bigger contribution to the courts.

&gt;“What I am not in favour of is privatising the courts. The courts should not be beholden to any private provider because the courts have to be independent of every interest.

&gt;“In particular I would be strongly against court buildings being placed in the hands of private providers. We should not have [them] influencing when courts open and close their doors or judges having to negotiate with private contractors over whether, for instance, a court can be open on a Saturday for an emergency injunction.”

&gt;Such control, he added, was not compatible with independent justice. “It is not just about independence of spirit, but about places to do justice.”

&gt;Maura McGowan, QC, chairman of the Bar Council, described the plan as “extraordinary and fundamental”. She said: “Courts are so much part of the justice system that they ought, in a proper society, to be administered by Government as a public institution, just like the health service.”

&gt;The human rights lawyer and cross-bench peer Lord Pannick, QC, said that it was right for commercial court users to face higher costs. But he added: “In principle I would be very concerned about whether the driver of economic efficiency in a privatised system would be compatible with maintaining the independent administration of justice.”

&gt;Others questioned whether the private sector had the skills to manage courts and tribunals. Penelope Gibbs, director of Transform Justice, said: “Private management of our courts risks making them even less accountable, reducing the influence of magistrates and judges and thwarting efforts to involve the community in justice.”

&gt;Slaughter and May, one of the City “magic circle” law firms, and the management consultants McKinsey have been helping to draw up the proposals.

&gt;Officials want to capitalise on the popularity of the commercial courts. Litigants such as the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich would be made to pay hugely increased court fees. This would subsidise criminal courts, where Mr Grayling has already outlined plans to make defendants pay their costs if found guilty. Fines and fixed-penalty notices would provide another multimillion-pound income stream.

&gt;There will be further mergers and between 80 and 100 court closures are expected to be announced shortly. Plans have been drawn up by senior officials in the Courts and Tribunals Service, including Sir Robert Ayling, chairman of the Courts and Tribunals Service Board, and its chief executive, Peter Handcock, in discussion with senior judges led by Lord Justice Gross, the senior presiding judge.

&gt;Officials have kept the master plan secret. The only public reference was in a statement to Parliament in March, when Mr Grayling announced that his department would explore reforms.

&gt;He said: “The courts and tribunals are at the centre of our justice system, relied on by the public to enforce their rights and uphold the rule of law.

&gt;“As in other areas, we need to look at the way we deliver our services to provide a more efficient service that delivers access to justice quickly and effectively, while delivering value for money for the taxpayer.

&gt;“At the same time, we must preserve the independence of the judiciary, which lies at the heart of our constitutional arrangements.”

&gt;Mr Grayling added that he wanted to ensure that “those who litigate in court pay their fair share, and that it is possible to raise the revenue and investment necessary to modernise the infrastructure and deliver a better and more flexible service to court users”.

&gt;The conduct of the government so far in imprisoning these individuals has been pretty ineffective take for example the group of three men that had discussed attacking Wootton Bassett will only spend around five years behind bars. There needs to be tougher sentences for planning or supporting acts of domestic terrorism, although at least they were put away before they had a chance to become a real danger.

So succeeding putting away someone *before* they manage to commit a serious crime, therefore preventing it from happening is ineffective?  Remind me, since 7/7 how many major terroist attacks have we actually experienced?  The fact this murder is so noteworthy is because it's such a rare occurrence.

What we've seen in the rise of the far right has been caused by successive failures by multiple governments who have either failed to address or completely ignore a large number of increasing desperate people.  

Fascism thrives on hardship. The message is a simple one to understand and taking a seat to play the blame game incredibly easy. It becomes a means of attaining something seemingly otherwise distant, empowerment. 

Saying people are stupid is just as much as a cop out at the other end of the spectrum. I understand the comment and it's intention, I would have said the same thing a few years ago myself but now a feel agenda has moved on since then.

This isn't about Islam or immigrants or any of those issues, that's just bullshit rhetoric from those high-jacking the poor, disaffected, and under educated for their own ends. The bottom line is this is about debt, repossessions, jobs and struggling to pay the gas bill. Until a government decides to really engage and tackle poverty in the North and other intercity areas in a way that's tangible and effective I'm sad to say the far right will gain more and more traction in the mainstream.

The typical reaction to an event like this certainly doesn't help. When people say things like 'deport all muslims' and 'we should burn down a mosque', it only ends up exacerbating the situation. It creates an 'us vs. them' mentality which may end up pushing potentially dangerous individuals over the edge. As clichéd as this sounds, we really have to work together to eradicate extremism.

Other people then can't approach the debate because they don't want to be labelled racist etc. It's a very grim situation to be in unfortunately, because it means we just can't discuss it reasonably.

Many people also need to get out of the mentality that we are approaching some sort of 'tipping point' on this issue and that everyone is going to start supporting mass deportation or genocide at some point. Depending on the root cause of the issue, things may actually start to improve in the future. For example, if it really is about foreign policy, then it can only get better. The west has learned from Afghanistan and Iraq and is now extremely cautious about action in foreign countries (look at Syria).

you mention brtish muslims fighting in syria for the oppostion/terrorist organisation (free syria army), but britain is currently supporting the FSA/terrorist group with medical supplies nd other non war related with ongoing discussions regarding supplying the FSA (terrorists) with arms. if ex FSA members want to attack britain despite helping the FSA thats just daft.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;The key is to knowing what motivates British nationals who are -born- here to become so extreme. Is it really foreign policy? Or are they literally mentally ill people who are swept up by the more radical elements of Islam? Because one thing is for sure, not everyone can nonchalantly behead a living human.

No one can tell the complete story at this stage.  We've heard what the perps had to say, and we've started to fill in their backgrounds.  But remember that on the day Lee Rigby was brutally stabbed and hacked to death with kitchen knives and cleavers (not beheaded with a machete, that seems to be an erroneous first report which was picked up and run with by the media because it fitted stereotypes), 56 Iraqis died in Iraq because of the shitfest we kicked up there, and a still classified report is alleged to contain horrific statistics on excess deaths from radiation poisoning which they are afraid to publish.  There's plenty of good motive in foreign policy, no mental illness is required.

&gt;As clichéd as this sounds, we really have to work together to eradicate extremism.

I think you're right, but we also need to remember that extremism can wear a suit, sit behind a desk and write foreign policy.

&gt;The west has learned from Afghanistan and Iraq and is now extremely cautious about action in foreign countries (look at Syria).

Hmm, I'm dubious about this.  I think they may have become a bit less gung ho because they've realised there is substantial opposition within the populations of the West, but let's not pretend we haven't _already_ become embroiled in Syria, and only a short while ago there was Libya.

White preachers who would spread hate and incite violent acts against other people for no sane, logical reason. Sound familiar?

I dove into Six Doctor audios (Big Finish) and after listening to a few was able to go back to Seven and now I'm quite fond of Seven as well.

Most people have a doctor they're registered with that they can just call up and see: if she's 8 months pregnant and having problems I imagine she'll be a very high priority, I'm pretty sure (although I don't know exactly, I can ask my mother when she wakes up as she works for the NHS) that calling up a GP surgery should get her help regardless of her registration. She can find the nearest doctors surgerys here: http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/GP/LocationSearch/4. Although I can't imagine how someone that has previously had a child, has a midwife and lives in England full time doesn't have a doctor.

Although the service had some criticism recently she could also call 111 from her UK phone and get through to an NHS phone service that will advise her on what to do, they're not the best but she might get something of value, if they can't help they'll probably just send her to a doctor and maybe explain how to find one.

&gt; We're not really sure how the NHS works (In the US, if you have money or a good job, you're usually OK, if not, you're screwed), but we thought it would be a bit better.

Everyone regardless of money should get the help they need. Sometimes it might take a few days to get an appointment with a doctor if it's not urgent but I would think if someone is 8 months pregnant they would be a priority. From an American perspective our health system is: everyone gets help but the speediness of that help may be a bit slower than in America (although not by much, as we're a much smaller country) if it's not urgent.

Who organised trapping him, the explosion of the TARDIS, and the destruction of every star in the universe? That one is what I meant, but didn't say properly, in my original post.

* It's not as common or pervasive as is believed by a lot of people
* The problem is rarely due to immigrants. The main issue of radicalization is among homegrown muslims, and that the government shouldn't be tackling the events specifically, but also be looking at the root cause. They should treating the disease, not just the symptoms
* Too much pressure is being put on the general Muslim community. I'm not just talking about revenge attacks and vandalism. Muslim's are being told it's up to them to stamp out extremism and radicalization in their communities, when it should really be the job of the police and the intelligence groups. 
* The response of groups such as the EDL is not helping at all, in fact, it is exacerbating the situation. One of the main reasons that young British Muslims can be vulnerable to radicalization is due to the fact that they feel marginalized by the rest of society.

true,sirwhisky,null,null,"There is a lot you say that I agree with. I have nearly finished doing a rewatch since the reboot (I am up to The Snowmen in season 7). The thing that I noticed the most is that the Moffat stories make the Doctor seem almost invincible. They are way too big. its not a little man coming in to lend a hand, its a giant among men striding on to the stage to save the world. 

When Clara writes him out of recorded history its like they realized this and set out to make him a fallible yet super intelligent being once again. The RTD story arcs were far more subtle, the Moffat arcs less so. 

The budgets got bigger, the effects got better and the stories became grandiose. I feel season 7 is trying to scale back the stories but keep everything else ""BIG"". I am not sure they have made it actually work. 

When 10 was a crazy man in ""Water of Mars"" or even when he and Rose got so cocky and arrogant in season 2 the universe pulled them in to line. 11 has been unstoppable. The truly great loss he had was Rory, but it only feels great because Amy decided to lose herself and chose Rory over the Doctor. 

Clara is a fabulous idea and is played by an engaging actress, I only hope that her talent isn't squandered and that her intriguing story line is used to keep the Doctor as a character who is fallible. 

Doctor Who is one of the few programs that deal with sadness and loss in a valid way. Yes the stories are fantastic but the emotions are real.

I can't guarantee they will have what you need, but they do sell a lot of stuff.

Tobacconists as others have suggested will only have very small containers of lighter fuel. Camping stores might have kerosene for stoves, again, probably small quantities.

A petrol station might have something (including petrol of course) that you could use.

I have a feeling that buying large quantities of flammable liquids might be a bit easier in the US than here. That said I did just google 'kerosene edinburgh' and found some stockists.

I had a look at the photos on your other thread and I have to say that I think burning it is a very bad idea in that small garden, especially unsupervised. But never let it be said that I let my personal misgivings get in the way of helping a stranger to this city.

Men are already the most heavily represented gender (there are more than two genders btw).

Also, sexism is institutionalised discrimination against a gender. There is no institution that discriminates against males in Western society. Any separate treatment males experience solely because they are male is a result of discrimination, not sexism; there is a difference between the two.

But this is a little off topic. For the record, I don't think Doctor Who is racist. It has had instances of racism in the past (because 20th century) but it isn't racist.

&gt;I mean that it is ingrained into society

That may be true, but what do you call a single woman who discriminates against men? According to you, she can't be a sexist because she is not part of an institution of oppression. Would she just be a misandrist? If we're getting into those words, you might as well ditch ""sexism"" all together and just call discrimination against women misogyny.

&gt;sexism, the institution of oppression against a gender

If you wouldn't mind linking me to some kind of valid source that refers to sexism as ""an institution of oppression against a gender"", that would be great. I'll be looking on my own time as well, but if this is genuine knowledge you have, I figure you might know of one offhand. 

&gt;That is not something that applies to males.

Then why on Earth are you calling it ""the institution of oppression against *a gender*"", and not just ""against *women*""? Does it apply to only women and hermaphrodites? That's a genuine question, I'm not being flippant.

&gt;But the these things men can suffer from are not the result of institutionalized oppression.

Institutionalized oppression is an extremely broad term that doesn't apply purely to sex-based discrimination. Institutionalized oppression can apply to race, religion, sexual orientation, basically *any* trait that can be oppressed by a culture or organization. Speaking of race, what exactly does what you're saying mean for the subject of racism? Would you say that that's institutional as well, given that it's an -ism?

EDIT: I searched Google for ""sexism is an institution of oppression"" (with quotes) and got literally one result, five if I repeated the search with omissions included.

(My experience is in physical sciences, maths and engineering, so maybe someone else can help to translate where the boundaries are.)

First of all, I agree that your tutors aren't apparently very helpful. Their job is pastoral, not academic. Your DoS is the one who should be whipping you bloody, and your tutor should be the one to help you find your way and deal with things.

The most important thing is to remember why you're there. In order of importance: to help with a future career and life, learn something, and enjoy your youth. As an employer and former academic, I can say that getting a 2.ii in sciences is not helping much with the first thing, and doesn't demonstrate a great advance in the second, and by your post it doesn't seem like you're fulfilling the third. 

You should seriously consider a difference subject. 

It would be different if you struggled but enjoyed it; or if you were doing well but hating it. But my experience from teaching is that cramming things into a student who hates it is counter-productive for all concerned.

Dropping out entirely is counter-productive for future career, something which is annoyingly important, though in the heat of things seems less so. But transferring horizontally into a different subject is not a bad idea at all. Getting a 2.i in some other tripos is perfectly respectable, and depending on tripos not impossible coming in from some other subject.

**You should talk to your tutor and DoS.**

I've seen a lot of students struggle on with a subject they hate, whether it be from pride, family pressure or just lack of time/will to consider alternatives. I've seen far fewer have the courage to say ""I was wrong; this isn't for me."", but they have all been far happier having said it.

Grit your teeth for another few weeks and get the tripos exams over with, and then have a frank and adult conversation with your tutor and DoS. If you know people who are sensible and have their head screwed on straight from other colleges through the department, talk to them too. Remember that you are an adult, and should take charge of your future.

true,Verochio,null,null,"**The best things:**

London’s cultural life - a lot of the world’s best restaurants, theatres, museums, galleries etc. all in one place.

History everywhere – the average UK town has more pre-1800 buildings than the entire USA. 

The sense of humour - it is rarely inappropriate to crack a joke in the UK. We joke all the time, and we have a rather finely-tuned ability for subtle irony and sarcasm. 

The BBC. Especially Radio 4.

The NHS (I’m lucky enough not to have experienced much illness in my life, but my friends who have say wonderful things about the NHS)

Queues. When other cultures would scrum to the front, we form an orderly queue. There are different types of British queue: there’s the standard single queue; the double queue; the single queue that forks into a double, or even triple, queue at the front; the single queue where the first person goes to the next available of several termini; and then we the ""invisible queue"" that forms at pub’s bar. These things are important.

**The worst things:**

The class system. We are a multicultural island, but the biggest cultural frictions are between the classes, not ethnicities. Class is not (just) about money here. It’s about taste, values and lifestyle. There are countries where, but for their money, the poor are very much like the rich: they like the same things, believe in the same ideals, share the same aspirations for themselves and their country. Not so here; the constant fighting between these tribes is the critical fracture at the heart of the UK.

Surveillance culture. The UK is the most surveilled country among the industrialized Western states. We are the closest to 1984, and getting ever closer. Here, big brother is watching you.

The importance of not being earnest. If you appear to be taking life too seriously here, you will be ridiculed. Our culture abhors seriousness and sober enthusiasm.


We did everything first. Whilst this is a point of pride, it does mean that many things are old and outdated compared to those who came after us and did it better.

We invented football, but haven’t won anything of note for decades.

1. Weeping Angels, because they are just awesome, the idea of blink is awesome and they have a great mystery around them, I definitely wanna see these things back, I do wanna know how they kill you if have the image of a Weeping Angel in your head, they didn't really make that clear, Amy escaped that fate, but I wanna see what happens if somebody don't escapes. Also I have alot of questions about them, can they fly? can they brainwash? They can let Amy count down, but can they do more than that?

2. The Whispermen, I really hope to see these guys back sometime in future episodes, they were awesome, they had awesome appearances, I loved their top hats! 
And they didn't seem to get killed or destroyed. They can teleport and kill by stopping your heart, or by a whisper. They also have a sense of mystery, are they living things, do they have some sort of consciousness? They can brain wash you, much like the Silence, but these guys seem to have some sort of opposite appearance, were as the Silence have eyes, these guys have mouths.

3. The Silence, the idea of them are brilliant, they can brainwash and you forget that they were there if you look away. I liked their clothing style, but I didn't like their face. And they were mostly killed in 1969 anyway.

4. Vashta Nerada, for the reasons mentioned by others, but then again, where are you gonna encounter groups like that anywhere else than the Library.

5. probably the Empty child, since it was spooky to see a half dead kid that looks for his mummy, with a scary skin gas mask. But it was just one time, one slip up from Captain Jack.

Quite simply, if he was good enough, even to come and be given a chance to develop, he would have been because, as we've seen, Rodgers is very keen to do that. Hopefully I'll be proven wrong, he did seem to do alright at Wolves.

Digne is a pacey, hard working full back who likes to get forward and is technically very accomplished for a full back with a touch of flair. Definitely needs to work on his delivery and aerially he isn't so smart but is really just a class above jacko and offers a lot more in an attacking sense.

'Outside there seem to be a lot of men sitting around. Many of them seem
to be having what I believe is known in military parlance as a brew–up. And Captain Carrot is organizing a football match.

&gt;'He's what?' said Vimes, lowering the bow.
Suddenly the world had to be real again. If Carrot was doing something as dumb as that, things were normal. 

&gt;'Quite a large number of fouls so far, I'm afraid. But I wouldn't call it a
battlefield.' 

&gt;'Who's winning?'

&gt;'Ankh-Morpork, I believe. By two hacked shins and a broken nose.'

&gt;For the first time in ages Vimes felt a little pang of patriotism. Everything else in life was in the privy, but when it came to gouging and kicking he knew which side he was on. 

&gt;'Besides,' Vetinari went on, 'I believe quite a large number of people are technically under arrest. And clearly a state of war is not, in practical fact, in being. It is merely a state of football.

And

&gt; Carrot ran up, bouncing his football. He'd stripped to his waist. The
whistle bounced on its string around his neck.

&gt;'I've declared half–time,' he said, sitting down. 'So I've sent some of the
lads into Gebra to get four thousand oranges. Shortly the combined Ankh–Morpork regimental bands will put on a display of counter–Marching while playing a selection of military favourites.'

&gt;'Have they practised counter–marching?' said Angua.

&gt;'I don't think so.'

&gt;'Should be good, then.'

&gt;'Carrot,' said Vimes, 'I don't wish to pry, but how, in the middle of a desert, did you find a football?' And the voice in the back of his mind insisted: you heard him die, you heard them all die.. . somewhere else. 

&gt;'Oh, these days I carry a deflated one in my pack, sir. A very pacifying object, a football. Are you all right, sir?' 

&gt;'Eh? What? Oh. Yes. Just a bit... tired. So who's winning?' Vimes patted his pockets, and found his last cigar. 

&gt;'It's broadly speaking a tie, sir. I had to send four hundred and seventy–
three men off, though. Klatch is now well ahead on fouls, I'm sorry to say.' 

&gt;'Sport as a substitute for war, eh?' said Vimes. He rootled in the ashes of Nobby's fire and pulled out a halfconsumed... well, it helped to think of it as a desert coal.

In syria on the other hand, the fighting is in and amongst the streets, guerrilla warfare with both sides catching civilians in the crossfire. They syrian rebels are fractured and unorganised, with the UN indication that the rebels, not the regiem, that started chemical weapons attacks. 

Assad isn't saint, but he was stable. under him, syria was one of the most forward and progressive societies in the middle east - the press had relative freedom, they could critique the government (though not as much freedom as western media), women had decent rights, there was relatively rapid movement between social heirarchy ranks.
(this is all relative to the rest of the middle east, not to the west)

Even the ""moderate"" factions are on par with the Muslim brotherhood in egypt, and they lack the numbers and experiance to win the rebellion. The fanatics on the other hand have a leadership with experience, often from Afghanistan or Iraq rebellions, and a lot of support.

I think there's a bit of each in all of us, but it's warm civility that has a future.  Struggling in reactionary fury can only lead to isolation, alienation and sparks of violence against the perceived invasion.

true,thedingoismybaby,cnty-uk,No luck catching them swans then?,"One of the problems is an overly extended system. Imagine someone gets arrested for drink driving and, for whatever reason, it needs to go to blood analysis. Usually this analysis takes at least 3 weeks and can take longer depending on how busy the laboratory is. This also has impacts for forensic investigations such as DNA, fingerprints, etc.

The more police rely on forensic evidence the busier these laboratories will be.

In addition officers have to manage their workloads and usually have a number of crimes being investigated which means they can't spend all day dealing with a particular job - so investigation takes longer. Imagine having to review CCTV footage for an offence from multiple cameras and no distinct time period (think a rape at some point last night, or an abduction attempt, or anything really), this takes absolutely hours and yet needs to be done to get that critical evidence.

At a time when police officers and police staff are being cut for budgetary reasons it's not surprising things take longer.

Now you could argue they shouldn't arrest until they have the evidence to charge, but sometimes an arrest needs to be made as soon as possible - to prevent evidence being lost or destroyed, to establish and challenge alibis, to complete ""ID"" parades etc and then you need to decide ""Do I have enough to charge?"" If not, ""Do I have the possibility of getting evidence enough to charge by continuing enquiries?"" If so, you bail for the shortest possible date.

I would love short bail dates, for one it means I can move onto the next job sooner, however sometimes long bail periods are needed due to the lengthy and complicated enquiries.

What you say about the risk does make sense. I guess my question is, am I better off waiting until I can afford a more substantial flat; I'm going to have to stay in it for many years so I wonder whether buying a small place now is a good idea?

I would love to put away more a month: I suppose if my mortgage was significantly less than my rent as you suggest, and my salary increases, it would be possible. I was in a similar situation to that you described (ignoring paychecks) until a year ago or so when I decided to get things together a bit.

To take your example of a drunk driver:  if you are guilty you get disqualified and banned for a year.  So all the police have to do is arrest you, order you not to drive and have you wait and after 12 months you will have been punished more severely than someone who is actually guilty.  Aside from being unfair and illogical, that means anyone saine will plead guilty the minute they are stopped whether they actually did anything wrong or not.  Hardly a free and fair society.

Additionally he can serve as a mentor to the other strikers we are supposedly in the market for at the moment like Leandro fucking Damiao, our youth strikers and Bale and company as Villa has been to the highest levels both professionally and nationally and succeeded.

Is he the answer to our striker problems? No, even if we get Villa we still need to get another major striker IMO.

that's something i find pretty scary. it seems like you would be happy to tar everyone with the same brush just to stop a minority of people from committing crimes.

&gt;I don't understand how or why my stating the fact that multiple fighters may soon be returning to Britain has been tied into your point about the Woolwich attack. It's as if you are just assuming that I've never had any knowledge or interest in the issue until this last attack happened.

my point was, the information is already there (you, a layman, know about it) and someone with the impetus could likely do it just as well as any of these people you're talking about. this sentiment is flared by things like recent events and attacks that have come before it. were you worried about radical islam before september 11th?

my overall point really is that we've gone through things like this is the past that were by all accounts much worse. day to day, i see myself as more likely to be killed by someone's negligence, something alcohol related or just general criminality. to me that's what the issue you're talking about boils down to; criminality. sadly we can't prevent these crimes without seriously infringing civil liberties, so then you ask that we reduce civil liberties for groups of people in order to stop crimes committed by the few. once the country goes that way, i'll do my best to leave, because that's a much scarier place to live, for me, than a place in which criminals, who the authorities are likely more acutely aware of than you are, might do heinous things every now and then.",0,1369742899,null,0,false,0,ca7efqn,t3_1f62ex,t1_ca7efqn,t1_ca7e89n,null,1431008922,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Honestly, consolidate the money and wages, and bring in someone world class, someone who's going to set the league on fire. The only position we really need to address is Goalie, and Reina will suffice for the next season or 2.

Johnson and Enrique are good fullbacks. Wisdom, Kelly, and Flanagan will provide decent cover - with Wisdom and Kelly hopefully pushing for starting roles. Agger is still a great defender. Skrtel is still a good defender, Coates is Developing, and again Wisdom and Kelly can cover.

Lucas, Gerrard, and Allen are all great people to play deeper in midfield, with Gerrard, hopefully, still pushing up to join attack. Henderson and Coutinho are fantastic talents - probably the best we have IMO, with Shelvey and Suso providing cover. Sterling, Downing, and Ibe are decent on the wings.

Finally, up front Suarez is class. Borini is alright (excellent movement though, seriously, woah), and Sturridge is great on his day.

While we have good cover and a young team, **apart from Suarez, (and possibly Agger) no one on this team is a World Class Player (yet)**, if we're going to challenge for top 4, we'll need a few of those.

Would Adebolajo think it acceptable to kill one of them? There are 8 Muslim MPs in parliament who - in theory at least - help govern this country. Would Adebolajo blame them too? Further, many Muslim governments such as Syria are busy killing other Muslims in political wars. Would he think it acceptable to attack Syrian Muslim soldiers in this way as retribution for their attacks?

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"The non-existence of society really is a strange idea with a kernel of truth, a wild leap and a dangerous consequence. Its based on the concept that we are all individuals that seek to, ultimately, benefit ourselves (unquestionable truth) and that this selfishness is what defines the success of *all human endeavour* (this is the leap), the dangerous consequence of this is that people believe that it is actually their duty to not be altruistic, because being altruistic goes against the notion that humanity benefits only from individualism. In which case, we should commend people for ""scrounging"" from the state because its the minimal amount of work with the maximum amount of profit; that's smart and we should all be doing it.

On another note, the entire idea that a private company should assess people in order to save the government money is incredibly strange on multiple levels. Firstly, we have an NHS with doctors who most certainly do not benefit by handing out letters that say ""this person is not fit to work"" why do we need a private company? Can't we just make our, already employed, doctors do this assessment? Why do we need to hire more people when we already have a huge organisation filled with highly qualified and highly experienced doctors who are more than capable of making this assessment?

So, this company generates income by saying ""no, you need to work"" and has a quota of people that it needs to get off benefits so we save a little bit of money, pay the company, and collect more taxes because more people are working. What the hell is the point of this? If they don't meet their quota they are unnecessary as we're already making all the savings we can make. If they do meet their quota, presumably, the calculation means the tax man breaks even because we have to pay this company.

Lastly, making terminally ill people *prove* they're dying is pretty horrible, as if they just faked cancer so they could go and live on benefits. Do people actually do this in significant numbers? Should we be going round hospices checking up to see if they're really faking it?

If people really are faking illness to just live off the state its because working is worse. Getting up early, doing a shitty menial job, kissing ass, getting stuck in traffic, being shouted at by a boss that doesn't care about your welfare or happiness and gradually watching your life fade away never feeling inspired or amounting to anything. To me this sounds like a key cause of depression, an important under researched, under funded illness that can lead to the patient being stuck in bed for days on end unable to function or communicate with other human beings potentially leading to death. Maybe we can do something about the work life balance and the treatment of employees to make people feel a little less worthless?",0,1369746769,null,0,false,0,ca7f583,t3_1f6vgp,t1_ca7f583,t1_ca7dr8t,null,1431008518,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

It's such an arrogant, apathetic, racist, callous and evil attitude towards the world and IMO it's not acceptable. There are too many people in the West, particularly the US and Britain that want to act all offended and shocked when shit like this happens. When as they are doing so families are getting bombed and shot to pieces and they couldn't give a fuck about that and if anything actively support shit like that.

These people are all for war and bloodshed as long as it's someone else doing and/or receiving all the dying, killing and destruction.

It's crucial that when you fill out the online forms that the English you use is perfect. Putting it through an English-language spell checker isn't really enough; you need to get the syntax and grammar right too. Ideally you should ask any native English-speakers you know to proof-read the thing.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"&gt; Please define what society is.

*A society* is a collection of individual peoples living within some community. The constraint of a society is largely geographical but could also be considered to be based on communication; people must share a common language for communication.

When Thatcher said ""there is no such thing as society"" or rather (""Society? There is no such thing"") she was referring to some entity of which we should surrender our individualism too. I would define a society as the collective needs of the group of individuals, to reject the notion that such a thing exists is simply to reject the notion that you have any responsibility to other's needs; this is what I think Thatcher was getting at. *There is no such thing as a collective responsibility*. 

However, the actions of the individual are not isolated, a society exists precisely because being isolated is not beneficial. In the same sense that trade allows us share and diversify labour - the atom of prosperity - society allows us to share our burdens be they to do with rival groups, the environment or nature.

Pawnbrokers are a much better short-term measure, because the worst that happens is you lose your item of collateral. In the case of Wonga / Cash Lady style loans, they are designed to put the customer considerably further in debt than the original loan.

Rag all you like on banks, but they simply do not design their products to be unsustainable in the same way that these guys do.

No one can disagree with this quote because it is meaningless and; that was it's intent.  More important was the practical outworking.  The practical outworking was less obligations and less entitlement.  So for me, that isolated sentence says more about Thatcherism (love it or hate it) than the whole quote.

&gt;MURDER victim Mohammed Abdi faced drug charges after being arrested in a police raid earlier this month.

&gt;Abdi, the son of the senior figure at Edinburgh’s Central Mosque, was killed in the shooting which followed a high-speed car chase.

&gt;He was pronounced dead after being rushed to hospital on Sunday morning.

&gt;The 25-year-old was arrested in Leith earlier this month when crack cocaine was seized.

&gt;He appeared from custody in court on May 3, charged with being involved in the supply of drugs.

Perhaps you can get together with politicians and artists and hold a march for crack dealers. ""Crack dealers aren't getting any respect from people wanting the death sentence for them in the first place.  Even before they are killed by other crack dealers!!!"" It would fly.

They're not, why would they? If someone cannot afford to pay off a short term loan when the price is £100 more than they borrowed, how are they going to be afford it in 6 months when the price hits £1000 more than the initial loan? The debt will be sold to a collections firm for pennies and the lender will lose money.

The margins on short term loans are excellent and a business would have no reason to intentionally cause their customers to default, they would **lose** money especially when you consider the cost of having employees chase people up, deal with their excuses on the phone...

Short term loans certainly aren't *good* but to suggest they're ""designed to trap the customer into a debt spiral"" is silly. What do they stand to gain? Spend 10 minutes reading through posts on a debt forum and you'll find almost every person that defaults on a short term loan never pays back anything near what they borrowed, or when they do they arrange for a payment plan where they're repaying £10/m for many years. I've seen maybe one or two people ever repay more than they borrowed and that's people that were too scared to call the company and say ""hey, I'm having problems repaying, can you sort a repayment plan for me?"" which the majority of legitimate companies will do because it's their obligation.",0,1369752277,null,0,false,0,ca7gk7y,t3_1f75as,t1_ca7gk7y,t1_ca7gb5h,null,1431007850,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,sionnach,irish,Filthy foreigner,"&gt;They're not, why would they?

They are - I work in the industry, so have a fair idea how this works. Generally, the person will pay back enough money that the lender is in profit - but they still owe **more** than the principal, even after paying back a lot more then the principal. So, any money that can be extracted from this point on is all profit. If the remaining debt has to be wiped out as bad debt, the originator still has made a lot of money, in most cases.

&gt; The debt will be sold to a collections firm for pennies and the lender will lose money.

Except that's not what happens - the debt is 'sold' to another company, who are quite aggressive but happen to be based in the same building as the loan originator and are owned by the same people.

&gt; a business would have no reason to intentionally cause their customers to default, they would lose money

They don't have a reason to cause them to default - they want to push them as far as is possible to continue to pay, and continue paying. That's the basis of a loan shark business model. If some customers default, it's not a problem - the lender probably has still made a decent profit from that customer already (as explained above).

&gt; Short term loans certainly aren't good but to suggest they're ""designed to trap the customer into a debt spiral"" is silly. What do they stand to gain?

Money. The aim of a ""short term lender"" is to recoup the loan principal as quickly as possible, but continue to rake in profitable interest / fee payments for as long as possible. That way, it's risk free profit after the equivalent of the discounted cash loan - and given the 'short term' nature of most of this, the effective discount is low.

If Wonga are happy to deal with people having problems by putting them on repayment plans that do not grossly exceed the initial amount, surely that is a sign that they're not looking to encourage people to end up owing them thousands on a few hundred pounds principal? If Wonga were setting out to encourage people to default they would not offer repayment plans would they? 

&gt; Money. The aim of a ""short term lender"" is to recoup the loan principal as quickly as possible, but continue to rake in profitable interest / fee payments for as long as possible.

So it would be better for a company like Wonga if 100% of their customers defaulted and ended up on repayment plans than if 100% of their customers repaid the full amount on time as arranged?

&gt; That's the basis of a loan shark business model. If some customers default, it's not a problem - the lender probably has still made a decent profit from that customer already (as explained above).

That's not how Wonga works though and characterizing it as loan sharking seems to show your bias...",0,1369753885,null,0,false,0,ca7h1xt,t3_1f75as,t1_ca7h1xt,t1_ca7gosl,null,1431007617,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There might be dodgy lenders out there working as you described, but from everything I've read about ""negative"" Wonga experiences, they are a company that *wants* people to repay the amount and flaunts the fact that so many people do. 

Wonga has absolutely no legal obligation to consider repayment plans, and refusing repayment plans is what most of the smaller payday lenders do (the ones that actually pray on people that can't get a loan from Wonga) but that isn't the case for Wonga...

If you do decide to stay, DO NOT work in ANY capacity, DO NOT volunteer, and DO NOT go to the GP or hospital unless it is an emergency or you have private insurance. You may be liable to pay back this bill if you want to enter the UK again.

I stayed in the UK for six months several years ago, although I made this intention clear at the border and brought financial documents with me. I passed through by the skin of my teeth.

Credit is often (but not always) a cause of bubbles, for example the recent crash was triggered in part by a crash in US house price bubbles (which were caused by deliberate reduction in an interest rate to deal with the consequences of the dot com crash). Some of the growth we experienced under New Labour was due to an excess availability of consumer credit (so ""fake"" growth) as eventually the credit must be paid off, causing a decrease in growth later.

That was the economic argument against excessive promotion of credit, but there is also the moral argument, where I don't think as a society we should be encouraging people to get themselves into huge amounts of debt without good reason.

He's proven himself in 3 games, only 2 in a red shirt? Oh, by all means pay him 80k/wk to largely sit on the bench!

&gt; people like Assaidi on the bench, who are older and shown much less talent than Carroll.

The difference in age between Assaidi &amp; Carroll isn't so big as for it to be an issue. As for talent - talent alone is irrelevant, how well it combines with others is. To get the best out of Carroll, you have to play him the way West Ham did, or the way England did, or the way we (very sporadically) did under Kenny. It's not a way he's going to get to play under Rodgers.

&gt; Or how about when Shelvey was a starting striker because there was no cover for Suarez? 

Resolved now; we have Suarez, Sturridge and Borini capable of playing up front. Even if Borini hasn't proven himself, Carroll would be coming back as the 3rd-choice striker (and there's no way he's not below Suarez &amp; Sturridge), and unable to play anywhere but the centre-forward role (all three of the above can play on the wings, and Suarez can play deeper to the main striker).

The point you make about him taking responsibility is important.  For instance, the Doctor tells House: ""Fear me, I killed them all,"" in reference to killing time lords, not to mention he has said that HE killed the time lords multiple times.  Daleks too.

However, he does not identify Hurt's character as the Doctor.  He has a different name because he broke the oath/pledge/moral/etc...

So, if he admits to ending the time war by committing the genocide, then that cannot be what Hurt did.  Hopefully it is also not having started it either.

Get off of Rafa's dick and look at the cold hard fact - no way is losing the CWC 9/10, nor is losing to QPR at home, losing to Swansea over 2 legs, and getting stuck in a dog fight for fourth with two inferior clubs. Chelsea's expectations have changed as a club, and as a result so have mine. Our minimum expectation upon entering the Europa League was winning it - we were by far the best team in it, and we should have beaten every team in it - so though Rafa deserves some credit, it was not exactly a superlative achievement, which is why he is not 9/10. This logic is not difficult. Our minimum expectation for this season was finishing 3rd - we are easily the 3rd best team in the league, possibly even the 2nd. So this is not a superlative achievement - it's a solid 6/10.

Considering Benitez's performance includes his bizarre rotation that sometimes made no sense, getting tactically outfoxed by 'Big Sam', and appearing to not have any idea how substitutions work, it is not remotely 9/10. 9/10 suggests he did near the best job he could possibly do, and that is just not true. He did an alright job - hence 6/10. Again, this is not fucking difficult to understand.

Imagine you have a broken leg, and it needs a cast, you're on the waiting list for one from the NHS. In the meantime, you can't walk, and lets just say for the sake of argument you need to claim disability, because all you can do is hobble around the house with your broken, nasty leg.

Gradually it starts feeling a little better, even though every day is agony, you've sort of gotten used to it, though you wish you were better. But then you get a letter saying you need to go for an assessment, and in doing so, they want you have to put all your weight on your broken leg, and try to go for a run. It cracks, the bone shatters, and suddenly it's as bad as it was when you first broke it! You sit during the interview in agony, they're satisfied, and you feel dispirited. You go home and try to work on getting better again. Damn, wish the NHS would hurry up with that cast...

It starts feeling a little better again over time, you're dealing with it best you can. You can tie some sticks to it to go to the shops occasionally, and it almost feels like it's getting stronger..

Then it's time for another assessment.. your leg is going to get broken again... but you have to go... and you hope they don't take a look at your broken, painful leg and decide actually, you can walk on it, go run a marathon (the marathon in this metaphor, being a job).

As to music artists - well if they are receiving some kind of payment in order to mention a brand, then that is advertising. If no payment (in kind or otherwise) then its not advertising.

We had NO choice whatsoever, and were vastly overcharged on all our basic items, simply because we had nothing else to compare with.

Then a big Asda opened up, a mile or so out of town, and we cut our shopping bill by a THIRD ! Hell, they even put on a free bus to and from the town center. Not to mention the convenience of having everything in one place, and miracle upon miracle, actually OPEN after 5pm, and on Sundays and Wednesday afternoons, when working people NEED to go shopping.

The best argument I've heard against this view of government and only having negative rights is that to have a negative right (e.g. fair trial, private property) requires a degree of organization in society for it to be recognized or enforced. They require a suitably advanced society that is able to provide a legal system, policing system etc and that members agree that they are necessary. As such negative rights don't exist in absolute terms. Once you accept this scale, you need to question why the line is drawn where it is.

Good morning members, and leaders of the English Defense League. We are Anonymous UK. We have been patiently observing your organisation, as you have inflated, indoctrinating our young with your criminal mindset. You have capitalized on the misfortunes of our peoples, taking advantage of moments of fear, of terror, and of reconciliation, to spread hatred and animosity towards your fellow man. Your constant belligerence, like a pack of raving ignoramuses, furthering only bigotry and segregation. You have angered us considerably, and summoned our wrath irrevocably. Last week, an innocent Drummer, Lee Rigby, lost his life at the hands of two vile and demented human beings in the most horrific, and heinous manner ever witnessed on the streets of Britain. This villainous public display has thrown the United Kingdom into mourning; every community, and every congregation, extending their deepest condolences. You however, have used this as another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry, and misinformation. Under the guise of national pride you have instigated crimes against the innocent and incited the subjugation of Muslims. We will not allow your injustices, your lies, and your stupidity, to further radicalize our youth into fearing and despising their fellow man. 

Our people are desperate for hope, in a hopeless society where our own government neglects us, where society has failed us, it is only natural to seek a relatable change maker. This sort of desperation, this quest for feeling of worth, is what you have taken advantage of. 

In this operation, we will begin the systematic and comprehensive desiccation of your cult. We will further expose your falsities and your attempts to censor, to your members, to the British public, and to the world as a whole. You will fall, we can say this with complete confidence. We are everywhere, you cannot hide, you cannot win We are the voices of all and the voice of one. It will not happen over night, but we WILL be victorious. 

We are Anonymous.
We are Legion.
We do not forgive.
We do not forget.

I appreciate that, and agree with it.

I do see what you're saying, but everywhere all I've seen is 'religious', 'Islam', 'British Soldier', 'Hero'. All emotive keywords used to provoke the reader. It depends entirely on which 'news' source you're consuming, as the levels of bullshit, xenophobia and jingoism vary, but the media's part in whipping up the proverbial racist shitstorm is undeniable.

I do, however, agree that it has been clearly defined that these are extremists. I suspect this is more to avoid lawsuits than anything else, but I can only speculate. Maybe I was tarnished by studying advertising and marketing as to the true nature of things.

I personally know several people in the military. A few of them were so excited at the prospect of going on tour they could barely contain it. I asked, ""Why?"" and they replied with the sentiment that they are trained to kill and they can't wait to do it.

If you look at the advertising used in recruitment for the army, it's all glorification, targeted at the young males, of the 'finer' points of war - operations rappelling from helicopters, working with your fellow man for something good, boats, cars, guns, tanks, excitement.

It is without a doubt that soldiers can see with their own eyes the reality of Afghanistan and whether they are helping or not, but it doesn't help if you've been indoctrinated into a frame of thinking where you are correct no matter what anyone else says.

true,frankster,null,null,"I don't buy into the diea that most advertising is informative, if anything much of it obfuscates or deliberately misleads.

I find the logic of the invisible hand of the market and perfect competition incredibly seductive. However they fundamentally rely on perfect information, minimal transaction costs and rational decision making. I cannot think of any market where all of this is true (and I have been trying to come up with examples for some time!) 
Therefore I argue perhaps from a slightly defeatist position, that we are so far from the perfectly competitive market that Friedman style arguments are basically arguing against a distortion on a distorted distortion of an uncompetitive market. Thus what's the point of fiddling round the edges when we're so far away.

For example, advertising that triggers a hunger response is definitely preying on a somewhat irrational part of the decision making process. Not only is a short-term emotion dictating that call to e.g. Dominos, but you don't even have perfect information about what is in the pizza and the health consequences, and even if you did, you discount the future vs the present so often you wouldn't even properly take into account the health effects of regularly eating pizza (""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" and ""Predictably Irrational"" talk about this kind of thing).

So if we were all rational infallible robots, there were no barriers to entry in any market, and there was sufficient information and understanding to choose the best decision, and we in general had sufficient time to come to that decision then I would judge Friedman's arguments to be extremely strong. But it seems our commercial environment is just so far away from that.

As to democratic choice in a democracy...companies spend billions on advertising which strongly implies that it is worth the cost - I don't believe companies behave anywhere nearly as irrationally as humans!

So if companies are able to strongly influence individual's choices (through advertising), doesn't that weaken the democratic choice in a democracy?

That is, to take fast food as an example, we love unhealthy food because of our biology and we willingly choose to eat it. Yet companies are able to entice us to eat more of it than we might otherwise thus causing measurable harm. So in aggregate some of the democratic choice in a democracy is bought and paid for by advertising. Yes we make our choices freely, but we are influenced to an extent.

Anyway as to the rules that society makes - note that I am arguing for restrictions activities or consumption with social harms or possibly negative externalities. I suspect this wouldn't be too challenging to codify.",0,1369763122,null,0,1369766530,0,ca7kagq,t3_1f75as,t1_ca7kagq,t1_ca7jiah,null,1431006092,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

In a similar way to Great Britain, British Isles is a common geographic term referring to the whole archipelago which includes the British Islands as well as Ireland. Alternate names also exist for the same area.

They confuse their safety for being a sign that people can be trusted to not hurt themselves in the workplace, when in fact what it shows is that these laws that dictate workplace routine, appliance manufacture, all sorts of things, do their job well and that nobody notices.

Do you know what I think? I think we have to stop dehumanising people who carry out these killings as crazy so that we can reassure ourselves that normal people don't do these things. Those two men who murdered Lee we probably decent men in many other ways. They truly believed in what they were doing because they took the text of the Koran literally, like many other men and women do. 

I'm not saying we should think of these men as good, innocent people; I'm saying if you stop attributing normal human characteristics to these killers so you can shift the blame from the ideology - you will keep overlooking the problem and the cycle of violence will never end.

Do you believe the Bible doesn't preach violence too? I admit it preaches it to a far lesser extent than the Koran - but why isn't there a problem with your ""crazies"" killing in the name of God? It's because as a society we have long moved on from lynchings, stonings and witch hangings. 

Brand's argument doesn't work because you can't just attribute mental illness to people who read a violent but ambiguous text and reach a different meaning than you. We need the help of Muslims now to publically denounce Jihad. We need them to ex communicate Muslims who preach violence. We need them to phone the police on anyone who holds these views.

true,Inquisitr,tennant,Tennant,"I do not love Smith and probably never will.

And what's keeping me back is honestly one word, Moffat.

I cannot stand the direction he's taking the series.  Way too much about the damn companions, way way WAY too much.  First it was Ponds Who, now it's Clara Who.  Can I just have fucking Doctor Who back?

The answer to fix any problem is some obscure human emotion.  Love stopped the cybermen, sadness stopped the great intelligence, and so on and so on.

The writing is incredibly weak.  There have been a few decent ones like the girl who waited and the Doctor's wife, but those are exceptions to the rule.  

The doctor is also now an emo bitch.  Oh no, two people I liked got zapped back in time and had incredibly rewarding and fulfilling lives including adopting children and doing good.  I mean, never mind the fact that I already tried to ditch them and I knew one day they would have to leave me, I'm going to go sit in my blue box and sulk.  I mean sure Donna's story ended up on a much worse note, and anyone who thinks the Ponds had it bad don't know shit about Donna, but no surely two people leaving to live good lives is what sends him over the edge.

Madame Vastra, Jenny, And Strax are a perfect example.  They were very funny the first time.  Now because they were popular they're being driven into the damn ground.  If you wanted to sell me you should have kept Jenny dead, that shit was actually powerful.  But no Moffat can't let anyone ever die, unless they're a dinosaur.  So just bring her and Strax back from the dead totally nullifying the badassery of their deaths.

I could go on and on and on.  I like Smith as an actor, I really really do.  But I despise Moffat running the show, he has no business doing it and he needs to give it up before he ruins it.  It's tainted my opinion of Smith.  I don't know if I like him as the Doctor because I can't get past how terrible Moffat is running the show.

The cheap e-comm mats are basically the exact same as the high quality name brand mats (like Serta.) The difference is in the component polyols, all of the other chemicals are exactly the same. Moreover, the polyols that are different are actually the same, but from a different manufacturer because the name brand OEMs have a tighter control over what processes and components they will certify.
Basically all tested the same way, generally similar specs for density, IFD, air flow, and burns (all mattresses have to pass cal-117 burns.)
The component layers do matter. If you get a mattress with 5 to 8 inches of base foam, a 2 to 3 inch convoluted middle, and a 2-3 inch visco topper... you're all set. Brand doesn't matter. The convoluted middle is optional, you don't really need it and it makes it hard to fit sheets.
Don't fall for the gimmicks either, the only one that really effectively cools is what is called ""phase change material"" which is a micro-encapsulated PCM that is dispersed in the foam and changes phase when heated to body temp.

&gt;In 1941 Reza Shah was deposed and his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was installed by an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops. In 1953, foreign powers (American and British) again came to the Shah's aid—after the Shah fled the country, the British MI6 aided an American CIA operative in organizing a military coup d'état to oust the nationalist and **democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh**.

Or maybe Afghanistan?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone#The_program

&gt;The program relied heavily on the Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who had a close relationship with Wilson. His Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was an intermediary for funds distribution, passing of weapons, military training and financial support to Afghan resistance groups.[16] Along with funding from similar programs from **Britain's MI6 and SAS**, Saudi Arabia, and the People's Republic of China,[17] the ISI armed and trained over 100,000 insurgents between 1978 and 1992. They encouraged the volunteers from the Arab states to join the Afghan resistance in its struggle against the Soviet troops based in Afghanistan.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think in a sense you are right but we must distinguish between managers who develop players, and managers who move youth team players into the first time. Mourinho is very very good at developing players but in general he has been hired to grab immediate success and to pinch pennies and attempt to develop academy players over several years into first team players over many years. Usually managers who move lots of players out of the academy have significant time to instill their first team football into the youth system as well.

I think the  article though is attempting to look at the myth in a different light though A: That Mourinho only picks players in their absolute prime. B: That Mourinho doesn't like young players at all. The article points out both the multitude of players who improved to newfound heights under Mourinho and young players in their teens and early 20's who were given important roles by him (Varane, Balotelli, Santon, Mikel and others). Were those players exlusively developed or discovered by Mourinho?  No, but ge did have a significant impact on them and I think that's the point the article is going for.

 We already have tons of talent, who have been developing in a good system, and many of our players are developing tremendously well. I hear people say that players like Lukaku, De Bruyne, Chalobah etc... will not be given a chance under Mourinho. But I don't feel that way at all and that's where I think the myth about Mourinho is.

Honestly i wouldn't be unhappy if we signed a player like Villa along with a younger striker even if it is Leandro fucking Damiao and then spent low amount on a promising young but unfinished striker like Vydra or Rebic, someone a bit more developed than what we already have in the youth ranks but with a high ceiling for cheap.

Pendle has a shit bar but decent atmosphere and spirit in the Ghetto (I'm in Pendle, people don't tend to go to any of the bars anyway, so it's not a big issue). There's also Pendle Live so you could use your musical talents there. Pendle's standard accommodation was refurbished for this year, so I was in the first year to use it, it's really nice! 

It doesn't really matter which college you pick, you'll have a great time wherever, everyone's really friendly and it's a lovely campus!

Just to add, Bowland and Furness are quite central in terms of lecture theatres, but Pendle and Grizedale are right in the middle of the campus (including SW), so they are all near shops.

I agree that memorisation and regurgitation seem completely retarded and useless. But, the most important thing you will learn in uni is not WHAT to think, but HOW to think. It's a skill that you don't realise you need to develop until it starts to.

It sounds like you are in a course that you do not like. That is a very tough situation to be in. Without knowing you personally, it's hard to know whether to tell you to stick with it or to take a leap and make a change. Making that decision is going to take a lot of soul searching, but the fact that you are considering it seems to give a lot of weight to thinking about actually doing it -- that is, changing your course or even your uni.

As to why some students ""end it"": yes, of course school pressures can build up to the point where it seems like the only option, but generally there is an underlying reason for depression and suicidal thoughts that reach beyond those pressures. I'm speaking from experience here. If you are having thoughts like that, it's nothing to be ashamed of, but it is something that you should talk to someone about. If you are having thoughts about harming yourself, it is likely that there is an underlying reason and that the pressures from uni are simply exacerbating your depression. The fact that you have reached out on reddit and have mentioned these kinds of feelings is a good thing. It means you do want to feel better. Please please please let someone close to you (a friend, a relative?) know how you are feeling so that they can help you through this. Sometimes the most adult thing to do is to know when to ask for help.

One more thing: fuck exams. Fuck uni. Fuck all of that. From what little you've said, I can tell that you are an intelligent, accomplished human being. Take pride in what you HAVE done. Not what you worry that you can't do. Take the tests, do your best, but don't stress out any more over this. Whatever happens, life will take you to the most unexpected and wonderful places. Sometimes it takes a little perspective before you realise that what you once considered a ""failure"" was actually the best thing to ever happen to you. You just don't know what life will bring. Sometimes you have to endure a ""year of hell"", but life will make it worth it.

Please read carefully because there's a difference between those things I said. Sexism is not by definition women-exclusive but it does not apply to males in Western society (aka our society, the one to which our conversation was relevant).

Besides the fact that I did state above that there are *more than two genders*, just because sexism only applies to one gender, (*if we're speaking in gender binaries*,) does not mean that its inherent definition states it only applies to X gender.

There are possibly (though I wouldn't know this) societies in human culture that are sexist against men. In which there are institutions of oppression against males. But not *in Western culture*, which is why sexism doesn't apply to males.

Well even the rebels had a large number of rifles and the Libyan government had tanks and bombers and such so I'm not sure what you are on about. Just because the equipment wasn't the very best available doesn't mean it isn't deadly.

&gt;I'm failing to see who exactly ARE the ""civilians"" in this case.

Well, you've got all the people that aren't interested in fighting and just want to live their lives such as the women and children, the farmers herdsmen, intellectuals etc.

&gt;A civil war is sometimes necessary ... a war (civil or otherwise) 

It's virtually impossible to know whether a war is 'necessary' or not until after it has happened.

&gt;protracted into a 10 year occupation such as Iraq or Afghanistan helps no one long-term.

Which didn't happen in Libya because US politicians realised the massive mistakes in Iraq and were worried about repeating them and indeed can be stopped from repeating.

&gt;Let's not pretend this is altruistic behavior by either the Russians or the EU. First and foremost it's a business opportunity.

Well, it's complicated, the Russians don't want the Assad regime to fall because they are a key ally of Russia in that area. Various EU countries have various business interests and also don't like that vast numbers of refugees are streaming from the country as well as the influence of terrorist organisations within the rebels.

&gt;I still believe we should leave them to sort it out amongst themselves, and stop forcing democracy where it's neither asked for or wanted. Especially when democracy is a front for capitalism.

If the Assad regime wins pretty much nothing will change except that it will make other governments feel safer to start bombing their own people when they step out of line. If the rebels win then you'll see a power struggle between the various groups in the rebels, the longer the conflict goes on, the more power extremists will have and could end up being a substantial security issue. 

If we do nothing then we seem weak while damning the people of syria, If we do something then perhaps we can steer the conflict to a more positive end.

&gt;What we need is far stricter rules and regulations on extremists.

&gt;2. Far bigger sentencing for terrorist plots
&gt;3. Gagging orders on the Leaders who encourage extremists, and sentencing for those who break this
&gt;4. Much larger budget given to homeland security

&gt;That is some of what we can do instead of pretending it does not happen, and labelling anyone who speaks out against it as a racist.
&gt;(Note I did not speak about any race or religion in this post.)

***

&gt;Gagging orders on the Leaders who encourage extremists, and sentencing for those who break this

Good one, we should do exactly what didn't work against the IRA, that'll fucking help.

Ignorant bigots like yourself should probably go take a look at history and actually learn from it, shit like this acts as a recruiting mechanism. Unfortunately when you live in a democracy you have to put up with some people saying things that you REALLY disagree with, you can't just cut off their voice, it only acts as something they can use to garner more support, recruits and escalate things further.

As an aside, this is also precisely why the EDL shouldn't be reacted to either. A patronising pat on the head is all they deserve. Reacting to them only engenders more support to their cause.

***

EDIT: Since the wally deleted his message below I'll put it here and respond to it here, as well as quoting the above one too as he'll probably delete that.

&gt;So what we do is..? Carry on till the next attack? Then carry on again? Then what?

&gt;I see no other option, we cannot let this extremism grow. More lives WILL be lost on UK soil, will it take the loss of someone close to you for you to do something?

&gt;I also have no issue whatsoever with people saying whatever they like, and strongly believe in free speech until it endangers the lives of innocent people.

&gt;What does the EDL have to do with anything? They are a small group of thugs who get far too much media attention.

&gt;Lastly, calling me an 'Ignorant bigot' really shows what level you are on. I am trying to find a solution to an ever growing problem. Don't bother replying unless you have a better one, or continue to live in your blissful ignorance till it really hits home. (Also I am far from a bigot.)

Next season is a fresh start as far as I am concerned and hopefully whatever problem made him look like crap for much of the season is now dealt with and behind him. I want to keep the big man around. 

The reason I think Defoe should be the one to leave, is because he NEEDS to score to be of use. He is also the sort of player who wants to play all the time and is unhappy when he is not playing. As much as I like Adebayor, I get the feeling he would be less ""concerned"" to use a diplomatic word, should he be relegated to warming the bench for a few games in a row. Defoe as an unused sub would become increasingly unhappy.

Adebayor's wages may be silly, but if he could give us even 10 games as the player we saw in the last 3 of the season then he would be worth them.

Then the pay off of her sacrifice would have made more sense.

Totally my opinion, but i think it would have really sold ""The Impossible Girl"" angle. 

I also think it would have been better for Amy only to be lost in the past. River orders the Doctor to keep Rory around, distraught, and bitter as he would be towards the Doctor for Amy's death. Then Rory would have to contend with the emotional roller coaster of losing Amy after all that, and new shiny Clara bouncing in and out. Would have been waaay more compelling. 

I always felt Rory was a tremendous character that never got used - credit to Arthur Darvils' acting.

---

Sir/Madam

 

Thank you for your email regarding an article in the Daily Mail of 21 December 2012 by Richard Littlejohn.

 

The Commission has received a number of complaints about this article following the death of Ms Meadows last week.  We are able to inform you that the Commission has previously investigated a complaint about this coverage following publication of the article, and the matter was resolved.  However, we are unable to provide further information at this stage.

 

The first point for the Commission to decide with regard to the complaints it has recently received will be whether it can take forward a further complaint under Clauses 3 (Privacy), 4 (Harassment), 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock) or 12 (Discrimination) from individuals who are apparently unconnected to Ms Meadows or her family.

 

I hope you will understand that this is not purely for procedural reasons; rather it is because the family of Ms Meadows would appear to be best placed to inform us of the impact the article had on her.  According to the PCC’s standard procedures, it would be for the family to say whether they have concerns about the article and to make a complaint; we must, primarily, respect their views on the subject. 

 

At this stage, we have not been contacted by Ms Meadows’ family with regard to this piece but, should they complain, we would certainly look into their concerns. The PCC has made efforts to reach the family and make them aware of the services we offer.

 

Against this background, an initial examination of your case suggests that you are a third party to the complaint.  However, if you believe our normal rules should be waived to allow us to take your case further (or if you do not consider yourself to be a third party in this matter) we would be grateful to hear from you in the next ten days. 

 

If, at the end of the complaints process, you are dissatisfied with the manner in which your case has been handled, you should write within one month to the Independent Reviewer who will investigate the matter and report any findings and recommendations to the Commission. Further details can be found on our website.

Further information about the complaints process can be accessed using this web link: http://www.pcc.org.uk/complaints/process.html

 

Information about our service commitments to complainants can be accessed using this web link: http://www.pcc.org.uk/complaint/charter.html.  

 

Further information about the PCC can be found on our website www.pcc.org.uk .

 

Peter Wright (ex-editor of The Mail on Sunday), is currently a member of the Press Complaints Commission. However, as the Daily Mail, the sister newspaper of The Mail on Sunday, is the subject of your complaint, he will, of course, not take part in any discussion or consideration of the complaint by the Commission.

 

Do not hesitate to contact us if you need further advice. 

 

Yours sincerely

However, if your bad thoughts are debilitating you, it really is your responsibility to let someone know. Be it a friend, family member, supervisor, college tutor or lecturer.

There are a lot of different factors and a stressful situation cumulates these factors to allow people to do things they otherwise wouldn't consider.

If someone makes a sudden, unexpected recovery, they can let them know they aren't dead. I'm pretty sure doctors don't hand out terminal diagnosis like candy, it's something very carefully assessed.

M.E. is a real condition, I don't have it, but it exists, I like to stay as calm as possible during 'debates' like this, but quite frankly fuck off saying it's just people being lazy, you're not a doctor, I mean what the actual fuck. I feel like not even replying to you after saying something as ignorant and offensive as that. Your whole attitude seems to be that if you can't see it, it doesn't exist. You can't just decide that well known, confirmed-to-exist illnesses aren't real just because, what, you say so?

I'm waiting for therapy. Once I've had it they would be more than welcome to re-assess me, but I've currently been waiting for 6 years, assessments are at least 3 times a year, it's just too frequent, and every time I have one it sets back any progress I've tried to make on my own. My mother takes me to the appointments and I have pills to take which drug me up like a horse in order to go to them.

Nevermind 5 years time, if I could be better tomorrow just by deciding I wanted to be, I would be. You seem to be under the assumption that people enjoy being ill.

The estimated fraud amount is only 0.5%, so yes I think they should just take people's word for it and leave them to live their life. This isn't jobseekers where you want to check people are actually looking for work, this is about the sick and disabled. You don't need to keep checking up on someone with, say, cerebral palsy that they still have celebral palsy 3 times a year.

They don't send cheques.

If someone with mental illness doesn't know that they're ill, then they wouldn't have applied for disability benefits, so your point is irrelevant. If you're talking about me personally, I have been diagnosed by several doctors, including more than one psychiatrists. And ATOS contact your GP to confirm you've received a diagnosis.

I really started contributing to a pension when I was about 30 - the place I worked at had a choice between a pension, or a 'house purchase scheme', whereby I paid 3% and they matched it, and I could claim the money when I bought my first house. Being young, I chose the scheme I'd see the benefit in the soonest, and while I'm not sure I'd have afforded the house without it, it means I'm now paying 7% of my salary (company pays 5%).

These make a lot of assumptions, and due to inflation, £1 will more than likely get you a lot less than it does today, but it's a good starting point. Also, bear in mind that you'll hopefully be mortgage-free or downsizing when you retire, so you need less money, and would hopefully have fungible or cash assets elsewhere, too, so don't get too freaked out!

My only advice for what to do now, is to totally take advantage of as much as the company will pay, so put in at least 3% - it's a free payrise.

One other thing - I say I put away £1000 a month; It's £800 saved, and £200 overpayment on the mortgage. If I was offering myself advice, I'd suggest that once I had a decent amount of savings (say 2-3 months joint income), everything should be pumped into overpaying the mortgage.

true,arelefsee,null,null,"I've looked back at the last couple of years and why they aren't as successful as I imagined at first. You look at players coming inn and players leaving. Alonso for injured Aqualini, Meireles for Masch was not going to improve the team. We shifted a manager and got new one with a weaker team. Then sold Torres/Babel for Suarez/Carroll, which regardless of what you hear was a overall hugely successful transfer window.

Summer came and we got Downing and Adam, we lacked winger for years and 7 G/A was a decent record and from Adam we got midfield cover that could get 6 G/A over a season (without penalties), that was not huge increase in quality that we needed. Obviously Bellamy and Henderson were not brought inn to start, but did become regular starters when fit, so even with that we fixed the problem we had with lack of wingers but not so much quality.

Last summer again new manager, this time we moved on players who were big part of the club for years and some who were bought as regulars within 2 seasons of that window. They were replaced mainly with a midfielder and forward that have showed promise, but not enough to move us 4 places up. Also Assaidi and Sahin which were probably too good price/quality to not get. Overall we probably got weaker as 3-4 regulars left and 2 regulars were brought in.*

And to this january, again we had the second successful window in the last probably 3-4 years. 

Kolo is a good signing, and if we don't do the over hyping that results when we sign new players, at best he is replacing Carra every bit, at worst he is way past his time and has no reason to bleed for the club. At best we are even, and we should be ok with that for now. The next couple of signings and sales should result in overall improvement (hopefully a lot more improvement).

I didn't count in the form of players who were here already, only the sum quality of the transfers in/out.

*edit: Should count Sahin as he was quality, but like with Aquilani he was returning from injury and didn't player at his best for a year. ",0,1369777213,null,0,1369777394,0,ca7plo5,t3_1f7imq,t1_ca7plo5,t3_1f7imq,null,1431003516,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

You'll make friends quickly and easily among like minded people. Gather a circle to yourself and you will feel much better. If you have already managed to get a group of friends together then it may be worth discussing your feelings with them. At the very least some reassurance isn't a great thing to expect of a friend.

With tensions being what they are at the moment you will probably get 'looks'. But provided you stay out of certain areas (local friends can warn you about them) it will never be any more than that. To be honest the British tend to regard strangers with a low level fear and hostility (Never make eye contact on the tube!)- even if they are of the same background. Douglas Adams coined a name for it but I can't remember what it was. Breaking that ice is hard, hence my suggestion on societies.

Yes, I do.  I was sidewiped by a left hand drive articulated lorry when I was in the third lane of the M25.  I had no idea about the blind spot (UK Gov you need to make people aware of this; we get it with the drink driving but there are other dangers).  Sickening crunch of metal and glass span round, ploughed through three lanes of heavy traffic, somehow nobody hit me, into the barrier, back out again facing the traffic before I ground to a halt.  Car was a write off.  I didn't so much as bang my elbow.  Well, it did happen in slow motion, which helped.

Some army guys were helping me (stopping me running up the hard shoulder for my insurance proof) but the driver, who was Polish, had pulled over and came back. He was crying.  I was comforting him. He admitted full responsibility and gave me all his documents etc.  

I was with YES insurance.  A big NOPE.  I spent SO long trying to get someone to deal with what, surely, was a straightforward claim that in the end I gave up.  Eventually it was more distressing than the accident.  They cited the difficulty of dealing with foreign insurers (the Polish guy was fully covered and admitted to all and sundry it was his fault).  One particular afternoon I began calling the first number I had been given at 1pm.  Over the next three hours (seriously) I was to make at least six different calls as, after I had gone over everything and given my details to each person they would, at some point, give me another number to call.  After around 3 hours of this, and at the end of my tether I finally spoke to someone who sounded genuine and gave me the ""right number"" to call.  

I dialled it.  It was the very first number I had called over three hours previously.

Like I said I gave up.  My car was written off.  It wasn't worth loads, but I'd just spent £700 on it's MOT (which probably saved me from skidding/dieing (how the hell do you spell dieing?).  I'd just dropped my son at Heathrow so I was just grateful he wasn't in the car as I would have panicked instead of just going with the flow.

SO many people were encouraging me to claim for physical injury but I couldn't sleep at night if I did that after escaping injury in such a bad accident.  So, yep, I gave up.  It was too distressing to keep trying.  However, YES insurance are notoriously awful.  If you're not with them you will probably have more luck.  You just have to keep on and on at them.  I'm not very confident on the phone, which didn't help.

TL:dr  Depends on how shitty your insurance company is and how tenacious you are.

true,tclayson,english,Cambs,"Lots of funny but not helpful comments here. You seem to have a lot of time, but it really depends what you want to get out of it. I would say go to the centre to start with. Get there early - mid morning and go to the Bullring. Get your picture taken with the brass bull (its in the middle of the two halves). Make sure you visit Selfridges. Last time I was there there was a replica of the brass bull made out of jelly beans. Take a look at Selfridges from the outside. Rumour is its modeled on a lady's chest. ;) 

Do some shopping, see some sights. When you're bored of the Bullring move down New St. There's a cool road called Corporation St you'll come to. If you go up there and turn left you'll get to what we called ""pigeon park""  and Birmingham cathedral. Lots of teenagers and ""emos"" hang out there but it's perfectly safe and friendly. Take a left the other side of pigeon park and you'll get to Victoria Square and the ""floozy in the jacuzzi"". Some fantastic buildings around here Inc the council offices, the (recently restorated) town hall and the old library (a bit further round). There's also some interesting artwork around if you can find it. 

Continue up past the town hall and you'll get to the old library. Birmingham art gallery of museum is here too, you can't miss it. Last I checked it was free entry. Lots of cool stuff. 

When you're finished walk up the stairs, through Paradise Forum and onto Broad St. First thing you'll notice is the new library. I haven't seen it yet but I saw it getting built and it looked fantastic. Next to the library you'll see the ICC/Symphony Hall. This is where Britain's got talent is filmed. You can go in to it its pretty cool inside. Once you're inside you can walk all the way to the other side and you'll come out by a canal. 

Here you can get a bite to eat. If you go over the bridge there's a load of nice restaurants and you should find Brindley place. The sealife centre is just off Brindley place. It's expensive to get in but is worth it if that's your kind of thing. 

You can also see the NIA from the canal. That's where Gladiators (with Wolf and Jet)  was filmed. Pretty cool huh. 

Once you're done in Brindley place you can find your way back onto Broad Street. Here there are loads of pubs and clubs if that's your thing. If it is then check out the £5m gatecrasher at the end of the street. It's absolutely amazing, I've never really been to a club quite like it. 

There is a cineworld cinema near gatecrasher and also a casino if you wanted to burn some cash. Plus if you wanted to venture a bit further and cross over the roundabout (its easy there's an under pass for pedestrians) you can find a little square with an amc cinema and a bowling alley (plus arcade in the bowling alley). There's also some restaurants and bars up there too. 

If you fancy walking back then you should find the ""arcadian"". It's not far from the Bullring. There are some really nice Chinese restaurants and some more bars and clubs. It's possibly a bit more mature than Broad street later at night but you'll have a good time wherever you go. 

Around here you will also find the Hippodrome theatre which might have something on that night and there are some more casinos scattered around. 

If you're that way during the day there's a set of national Trust properties called the ""back to backs"" i believe. My parents go there all the time but I have never been personally. Might be worth a look all the same. 

That should be more than enough for the day haha. I hope that helps you a bit. You won't get any trouble in any of the places I've mentioned at any time of the night or day as long as you're sensible. Broad street and the arcadian at night you'll come across lots of loud, drunk people but I've never felt scared or in danger ever. I guess if you're not looking for trouble it won't find you.

true,ProtoKun7,smith,Smith,"&gt;So the Doctor gave her *his* screwdriver that supposedly looks exactly like his.

How would this be incorporated in the 50th (assuming that's when it happens)? Another question is when is the Doctor (11) going to get the red mode? 

I think people take the getting ""his"" screwdriver too literally. He may well have eventually manufactured it with the intention of giving it to River because it's clearly not identical to any of his. Still, it was similar enough to have originated from him and not somewhere else, so it can be said to be his that way. It's probably already happened though; at the very least we saw them go to the Singing Towers, unless that was on an additional occasion. I don't know why you're assuming that happens in the anniversary though; I've seen no evidence to corroborate that. And he has already used a red setting in *Cold War* (series 7, episode 8).

&gt;**EDIT:** Another thing is River said that he opens his TARDIS with the snap of his fingers. He's only done it a few times though. I think that should be more incorporated in the show. Why would you use a key when you can just snap your fingers..?

Of course such a system would be profoundly undemocratic and dictatorial, and not something my Better Angels would ever let me support. But I think we could use fewer elected politicians at a national level and a greater number of people adept at running complex organisations, processes or research. It's for that reason I want the House of Commons to be reduced in size with much more 'federalisation' of power across the country, and for the House of Lords to be a repository of talent from the upper echelons of various disciplines. Perhaps members of organisations with a Royal Charter (e.g. The Royal Society) could combine in some manner to form an electoral college and fill those seats in the Lords, with members sitting for one fixed term (say ten years). Of course regulation of the award of Royal Charters would need to be strictly monitored, perhaps requiring a supermajority in both Houses of Parliament before a new one can be conferred. Likewise with rules governing membership of such organisations. 

It would however remain the case that the Commons retains primacy and can force through legislation, but I would amend the convention that says the Lords should not obstruct legislation that featured in the governing party's or parties' manifesto(s), to say that it cannot delay such bills beyond the lifetime of parliament or the normal period allowed under the Parliament Act, whichever is the shortest. Money bills would remain the reserve of the Commons.

true,Bonoahx,,Year 11,"Thanks. I don't like tooting my own horn, though, I did feel like crap last June. I had had one of the worst cases of conjunctivitis I ever had (and I get it frequently), which ran down my immune system so I got a fever, which began to peak in the middle of the exam, so I sort of think of the June '12 result as a void result. Which I suppose it is now, so it's all good. I'll take your offer up on discussing technique:

I think that the best way of learning GCSE History is getting a revision guide (I use the ResultsPlus one that Edexcel give us, ISBN 978-1-84690-590-2 and it costs [£5.77 new on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Results-Plus-Revision-History-Student/dp/1846905907/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369783864&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=9781846905902)) and making notes on every single point there is. When you want to have a bit of variety you could try and tackle a question on a past paper, open book or not, it's all about structure. Anybody who has the above-mentioned book could check on pages 28-43 for some good material about structure, too.

History's all about events, and dates, which is what makes it so different to other subjects like Maths and English. Half of the GCSE is just regurgitating information, which takes a long time to learn (I'm not trying to dumb down the course, it's hard and mainly boring and I hate the media and Gove and all those other toffs who say that GCSEs don't mean anything, GCSE History does mean something) and the other half is doing it in a clear and timely manner. I find the other half more challenging, my teacher told me that I couldn't really get above a high D/low C if you just write points. I'm sure you all know that too.

I'd find some PowerPoint's from my school's VLE if it didn't take ten fucking minutes to load one page, but there you go. www.schoolhistory.co.uk is pretty good. And I'm no expert on this, I'm just sharing the way I do History.

Good luck!

Northumbria and Man Met are both good new Universities, I'd probably rate Northumbria more (but I'm biased), but I have no idea about your actual course. East London and Westminster...don't even bother.

Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle are all amazing cities to be a student in, I absolutely loved Sheffield and would recommend it to anyone, Manchester is great and certainly the biggest of the three, people from Manchester *really* love manchester, and this can often make it seem better than it is, that said, its actually pretty great. Newcastle is unbelievable fun, its a unique place, its on the beach, it has without a doubt the best nightlife in the country and is surrounded by amazing countryside and history.

true,[deleted],null,null,"First of all a case could certainly be made for Suarez being in the top 5 players in the world, that's your opinion but he was the best player in the EPL this season (despite the PFA award) and he was much more influential than most of the players you named. I'll give you Ronaldo and Messi. Lewandoski is a goalscorer on a better team and he bagged less goals than Suarez and created less, you're just a victim of the hype there. Perhaps Ibra, I admittedly haven't seen enough to comment. Half the Bayern team is just laughable, I don't know where to start on that one. I can comment on the Bundesliga because I watch that league a fair bit and Suarez would walk onto Bayerns team and he'd be their best player imo. Iniesta and especially Xavi didn't have particularly good seasons so whilst on merit over the years, sure they'd be classed as better players but this season Suarez has been better. For me there's no question Suarez was top 5 in the world, and I know that most top football writers hold that opinion too..  If he isn't he's a hell of a lot closer than you make out.

&gt;where as in 2008 the clubs who weren't owned by multi-billionaires (United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, etc) 

This is completely unfounded. Arsenal and Chelsea's net spend were actually in the negative in 2008. Manchester City's and United's are largely the same and teams like Spurs would never be in the market for a player of Suarez's price anyway. The idea that the half the 'supporting cast' has left the equation is just ridiculous, if anything there are far more potential suitors now than there were in 2008 when you take into account the rise of the Bundesliga and the steady EPL, La Liga, and Serie A. Sure these leagues relatively will change in financial might but overall they are all becoming more lucrative. 

&gt;Lets not forget we signed Sturridge (a british player who was very highly regarded) for 12mil - in 2010 that would've cost us near 18.

Sturridge would have cost more because he was valued differently back then, not because of a function of the market! Player's values are affected by many factors, it's preposterous to pin this on the changing market place. A knowledge of EPL current events and the lucrative tv deal that has just been signed is all you need to see the fallacy here. 

And finally yes, admittedly it is tabloid journalism and therefore not reliable but they have little incentive to pick the price out their asses. If they were 40 million is hardly that sensational for one of the top players in the world. Anything above 45 million is definitely feasible for Suarez. I personally wouldn't take anything above 55-60 million. This is not to say I think he's worth that much, but I think his value to the team outweighs his actual value. Admittedly it's unlikely we'll receive that much but we shouldn't be selling at his actual value (45 million imo) anyway.

In saying that, I don't think it's Matt who is failing me, I feel like it's Moffat. Since he took over from RTD, the show has a weird Scooby Doo feeling to it (Coloured Daleks, Amys 'I ran away with the Doctor' opening, fucking Star Whales!). The villains are often very half assed, some storylines are complete fan fodder whose twists are so obvious because they're the 'OmFg whAt iF?!!' sort of things a teenager would come up with and it's trying so hard to be epic and convoluted but I feel it fails. They're not ALL awful, Demons Run and A Good Man Goes to War were what I considered a return to fine form, but I feel it's kind of faltered again.   

Example, after Rose's 'Bad Wolf' revelation in Season 1, the whole Bad Wolf arc plays quietly in the background till it erupts again in Season 4, and you notice all these little things over the last few seasons that tie it all together. Whereas I find we're now being given story arcs that are so pushed in your face you arent given time to be gobsmacked. Again, not all are like this (I particularly like how we are always finding out more about River) but I hate how the mystery of things like the crack in the wall were sucked dry by constantly talking about it, and now the name of the Doctor is constantly referenced and it's killing the enormity of the moment.

One, he has admitted to or effectively admitted via overwhelming hinting, that he considers himself AS THE DOCTOR to have ended the time war to various companions and the audience if you wish. **Which breaks with his *i will tell absolutely no one this secret! you will have to pry it from my cold dead fingers if you wish to know it* method of dealing with it**

Two, it's too well known. We all know that the doctor ended the time war and genocided all the Timelords, from a story telling point of view it's not gonna be the huge blockbuster story you're trying to tell if everyone knows all the major details before you have even finished writing it.   It's the equivalent to a TV show about a baseball and the huge spoiler in the season finale being that it's in the shape of a ball, I.E. thank you captain obvious.

In terms of inclusiveness, my experience with muslims in the UK is that whether they integrate or not is very much a personal choice, there are loads of muslims here, so if you want, you could surround yourself with only other arab muslims, join all the muslim/arab societies etc. and have loads of muslim/arab friends! If you want non-muslim friends you will find that 90% of student socialising happens in the pub, and basically involves drinking. That said, if you don't drink people generally won't care, one guy I was friends with when I was an undergrad was a muslim and didn't drink and as a result never came to the pub with all the other people in my flat, he never really spoke to any of us and he was a bit of an outsider. It wasn't until a few months in that someone suggested he came to the pub to watch the football with us (and informed him that he didn't *have* to drink alcohol in a pub), he decided to (although he took some persuasion!) and then from then on he was friends with everyone. So I think a lot of it is just about how much *you* want to integrate, or not, people won't really care either way.

Jack Straw gave us the [RIP Bill](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents), allowing you to be locked up for two years if you fail to provide police with your private crypto keys.  
David Blunkett allegedly demanded that rioting prisoners [be machine-gunned down by the army, if necessary](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6057528.stm), although he denied this.  
Charles Clarke gifted us the [Identity Cards Bill](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/15/contents), and the [Prevention of Terrorism Act](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/2/contents). The former has been repealed, but the latter allowed the police to lock you up if they suspect you might be a terrorist, but put them under no obligation to tell you why you were being locked up, and you would have no right to a trial.  
John Reid wanted to [pick apart the Human Rights Act](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563347/John-Reid-calls-for-human-rights-law-reform.html) to make it easier to deport people, and attempted to get serious fraud trials to be [heard without a jury](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2006/nov/17/houseofcommons.ukcrime).  
Jacqui Smith was still flogging the dead horse of ID cards, but apparently under the [impression that they were popular with the electorate](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7712275.stm).

Kits don't have to be classy, but they have to stand for something: maybe just trying to look good, maybe representing some club history or theme, maybe trying to look intimidating or striking, maybe trying to be memorable and simple for branding, etc.

The problem with these kits is that, as far as I can tell, they do none of that. There seems to be no reason for these designs at all. They don't look good, they have no connection to the club afaik, they're certainly not intimidating or simple, and they're not even really memorable (yes, they've caused a fuss, but only because it's LFC; if you saw that design on a regular shirt you wouldn't hate it, you'd just *forget* about it). As far as I can tell, their  goal for the away kit was ""make it look like our printer broke halfway through"" and the goal for the third kit was ""let's get to lunch early."" If not, what are the reasons for these design decisions?

It also seems kind of stupid to put really detailed, intricate patterns on shirts that will be worn for a sport millions watch on TV, where the details will be tough to make out anyway.

So on the one hand, you could believe that yes there were other managers available, but if I can't name any, then oh! I must be wrong! In this case you are really willing to believe that, yes, Rafa was physically the *only* human football manager alive and available as a halfway reasonable interim manager option because someone said it on the internet?  You must have no fucking clue about labor markets in general. If you can't think of someone, welp, then there must not be anyone. Yep, the one that you saw with your eyes come to Chelsea must have been the only one available! This is position of logic you have taken up here.

Most people would see how stupid this is and then re-consider that maybe they just don't follow the manager's market very much but at least fucking understand what they don't know, and would the be willing to believe that the one manager that went to their team was, in fact, not physically the only one available.

But, instead, here you are, in disbelief and asking me to back up *my* claim. Jesus. 


I really hope you have the ability to see how stupid this viewpoint is, but if you really just need to be told a name so that you realize Rafa wasn't the only person on the planet who could have come to Chelsea, then by all means try to think realllllly hard and remember the name Pep Guardiola, the available manager who turned down Chelsea because he would rather stay on his vacation.

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; M.E. is a real condition

So *real* in fact, that doctors can't even decide if it's physical or psychological. It's a disease in the same vein as Aspergers is a ""disease"", or obesity is a ""disease"". Previously we'd just call them lazy, or antisocial, or fat ... but having a negative connotation to what is essentially a negative state of mind is no longer trendy. Much better to say they are ""ill"", and let them stay home for 45 years. Sure, makes so much sense.

&gt; assessments are at least 3 times a year, it's just too frequent

I'm sorry, you don't get to set the rules. It's as simple as that.

&gt; and every time I have one it sets back any progress I've tried to make on my own

In SIX years you've made NO progress whatsoever, and it's all the fault of the DHS for making you leave the house once in 4 months ? You have a strange idea of what progress is. And there's no hope of seeing a private psychologist ? You're happy to just wait 6 bloody years ? Depression is a negative-reinforcement spiral, and you're not exactly helping yourself. You get frightened of the outside world because you're depressed, then get depressed because you can't face the outside world.

And the only people asking you to actually LEAVE the damn house are the one's who are at fault and ""setting back your progress"" ?

&gt; The estimated fraud amount is only 0.5%, so yes I think they should just take people's word for it and leave them to live their life.

No, it doesn't work like that. ""Only 0.5%"" without a context such as an amount is meaningless. Only 0.01% of people are mass murderers, I suppose we should just abolish the police force too, they're obviously not needed ?

&gt; You don't need to keep checking up on someone with, say, cerebral palsy that they still have celebral palsy 3 times a year.

Yeah, here's the thing, everytime you try to defend your position, you use a disease that is non-treatable and essentially terminal, and then apply it to YOUR case, which is patently neither.

&gt; If someone with mental illness doesn't know that they're ill, then they wouldn't have applied for disability benefits, so your point is irrelevant.

Bloody nonsense. Clutching at straws now, aren't we ?

&gt; I have been diagnosed by several doctors, including more than one psychiatrists.

Yes, and that diagnosis can CHANGE ! You've been making apparently no progress by your own admission for six damn years, and you expect someone else to just keep paying for you to decide when you feel you're ""better"" ?

&gt; the assessment is just trying to find out if you're lying about anything

Like how much progress you've just lost merely by attending an interview once every four months ?

Sorry, you are exactly the kind of person that this kind of fraud is designed to detect. Whether you have a genuine case or not, I'm sure there's plenty of other people who ""just want to be let alone, give me my money"" who have nothing wrong with them at all.

EDIT: Okay, so can we cut the crap now ?

You seem to have no problem going to McDonalds ...

&gt; I was in McDonalds

or the dentist ...

&gt; That's so nice, I went to the dentist today

or to Sainsburys ...

or swimming ...

&gt; What charity shops do you use? All the ones round here charge £4.99 for a simple top. Primark is cheaper but it's in the city. There aren't any bus stops where I live, I have a car.

And yet it is ONLY the 4 monthly assessments by the DHS for your (selective) agoraphobia that sets you back and prevents you from making any progress ? You seem to be doing just fine, when it suits you. THIS is what I'm talking about. You want to self-diagnose (to the point of hypochondria if your posting history is anything to go by), you want to be left alone, and you don't want anyone having the audacity to ask ""is this person really ill"", ""has her condition perhaps changed in the last 4 months"" etc etc, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary.

I was listening to BBC world service last year and they were doing a story on the Free Syrian Army trying to establish a supply line but not just for munitions, also for medical supplies.

I did a little digging and found out ""The Doctor"" is regarded as a mysterious yet genius strategist for the rebels.

true,EveryGoodNameIsGone,mcgann,McGann,"Though he's since been replaced at #1 by McGann after listening to the Big Finish audios, and at #2 by Troughton after watching most of his episodes, Smith is *my* Doctor, and my favorite 2005-present Doctor by *far* (and I loved Tennant and Eccleston, too).

What did it?

Two lines.

The first one made me love him:

&gt; DOCTOR: You know when grown-ups tell you everything's going to be fine, and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
&gt;
&gt; AMELIA: Yes...
&gt;
&gt; DOCTOR: ...Everything's going to be fine.

The second one made him *my* Doctor:

&gt; Nobody **_human_** has *anything* to say to me today!

That second one, man ... no line uttered by Eccleston or Tennant conveyed the Doctor's alien-ness quite like that one line did. It also cemented that Smith could go to the deep, dark places I really wanted the Doctor to go - that one line had such a sense of barely-controlled rage at something innocent being exploited, even if it was for the best of reasons. I've been very happy to see this ability used often in Smith. Eccleston had the rage and conflict in him, but it was more on the surface (as it should have been, post-Time War and all) - Smith managed to keep that, but bury it just below the surface, like I imagine the Doctor would have by this point in his life.

Things like that are why episodes like *A Town Called Mercy* are among my all-time favorites - the scene when the Doctor almost executes that dude chilled me to the bone, and I *loved* it.

Smith *is* the Doctor. To my money, the only ones that can do/have done it better are Paul McGann (*To the Death* alone, my God) and Patrick Troughton.
