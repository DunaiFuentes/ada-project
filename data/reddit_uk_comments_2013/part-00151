But whether you should move there or not depends on how rough you’re used to, you should go check it out and make your own mind up: Its nothing like where I live now but I grew up not far from an area just like it.
For example:
There’s a pub there with no windows called the gunner, most patrons seem to be on the dole. I wouldn’t go in but you can walk past with no trouble. 
The shopping centre / row of shops the pub is near looks a mess and has gangs of kids hanging about until about 10-11pm but the shops and shopkeepers are fairly nice.
Another shopping centre not far (on ferry road) is about the same, dingy pub, rundown shops, kids - but has a dominos so cant be all bad!
I think most people who live there are just working class trying to get by, most appear to have jobs, there’s decent cars parked openly on the streets.  

*edit* I should mention the buslinks to town are great  

TL:DR Its rough, but not that rough.

Think of all that discussion time wasted which could have been spent hammering out a real agreement with ISPs to improve the ability to nab CP merchants, railroaded by some harpy who doesn't even understand web fundamentals!

2) Her naivety in boldly making libellous remarks over twitter and not understanding that either her hyperbole or her I dunno plain delusion could land her in deep fucking shit. AND that that deep fucking shit that has already landed real UK citizens in JAIL for similar hyperbole or hubris.

3) Her absolute madness in thinking that 'having a word with your boss' would be either intimidating or in some other way helpful to her cause over A PUBLIC NETWORK!!! If you are going to use insidious threats to further your cause you at least make those threats through discreet channels. 

This woman must be so fucking deluded that she considers her methods completely fair and legitimate. It's madness

Even if Guido inc. orchestrated these shennanigans, which is pretty fucking unlikely, and even if it was, proving such a thing would take some serious evidence. Clearly she either:

a) has this evidence and is just fearless.

b) has no evidence and doesn't think that, yet is convinced her strong-arm tactics will measure her victorious when the dust settles.

c) Honestly believes Guido sponsored a hack, and that without any evidence she can get her way by having a word with the Editor and making wild accusations over Twitter.

I'll tell you what I see. I see some of my friends who went to uni. Some did Media Studies. Some of those went on to work for the BBC. The majority, now work at a local pound shop or one of the supermarkets.

I had a friend who went and did a degree in History. He got that degree and aced it.

There was little he could use that degree for. He applied for teaching roles and museum roles. Again, Bristol. What do you think is here for history degree graduates? Not a lot. He's been unemployed since leaving the University of Bristol in 2005. With a blank CV for the past 8 years, what hope does he have?

Some of the people I went to college with went on to do Computer Science at uni. Some of those dropped out early and are now also at one of the local supermarkets. One even went on to become quite successful in launching his own tech repair business.

Out of the rest that went to uni for CS, some finished their degree and simply couldn't get a job doing anything IT related. They simply didn't have the experience required for basic entry level jobs and graduate schemes were basically 'sold out'. So they either got a job in retail, some of them now work in Jessops, or went and stayed in further education.

One of them in particular is now doing a PhD in robotics. Great. He's suited to it. Very intelligent guy. However, we all live in Bristol. There is very little in the way of work for that particular kind of job. Whilst he is spending his time doing all this studying, he will soon realise if he wants to turn it into a real job he'll have to move to London.

So I see a lot of people simply keeping in uni because there's nothing else to do. Others have fallen and just got any job. That Jessop's guy? He's now the manager for the local Bristol store. He did his degree in Computer Science and aced it. What was the use in his degree?

More close to home, my job. I work in web development team of 9 people. None of us, including my team lead who's running on £55k a year, went to uni.

So this is what I'm seeing in my social group, I see day to day that none of us went to uni and studied computer related stuff at all, and we all have well paying jobs doing something we love.

Add to that the complexities of abdication... the queen is notoriously against any form of abdication because her mother and father (King George VI) ended up being traumatically thrust into the throne by the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in 1936.... **However**, Charles and William might take a different view to abdication - particularly with the way life expectancy is going, but the age of onset for most dementias remains fairly static around the 70s/80s.

Anyway, my guess is the Queen won't abdicate - but Charles actually might, and further down the line maybe William. It's even possible the Queen could outlive Charles (bearing in mind he's 64). Planned abdication years in advance seems to work well elsewhere and I wouldn't be suprised if the Royal Family hadn't at least considered it. There may well also be pressure from parliament and even the public for an abdication... especially if it looks like the monarch has declined to the point where they can no longer do the job, but is stuck in the role potentially for decades with all their duties conduted by the heir apparent. Indeed, if the heir apparent is going to do the job of the King - why not just BE the king.

**Tl:dr** Its too early to tell what will happen, but I would be suprised if this new child was King that late in their life.

This is a well marketed myth, even better than 'diamonds are forever'.

So basically you're saying that there is nothing wrong with a family being labeled as the royals, as long as they generate some income for the country? Why not letting the Kardashians to be our royal family instead? We all know that they can generate much more money for this country than the Windsors. What's wrong with that?

Let me hopelessly try to undo the brainwash deeply applied to you all you life:

* Tourists would not stop visiting this country when the royals go away.

The EU are actually extremely good at protecting a citizen's rights, their rights to speech, movement, a fair trial and, the one that pisses the Tories off the most, workers' rights.

Things might be better and more comfortable after a violent revolution, but I would seriously argue that the cost in lives is significantly higher than otherwise would have been. Violent revolution just to gain small incrementally better comfort isn't justifiable. We're by no means anywhere near a point in time where violent revolution is necessary.

The fact you've equated peaceful protest of policy issues to that of violent revolution is farcical in and of itself. Those taking part in peaceful protest aren't calling for the dismantling of government and state for a new and better one, they don't have issues overall with the vast governing of state, they have issues with individual micro aspects of policy making within society and want to spread awareness amongst citizens and politicians about their issues, which drives forwards campaigning and awareness.

In turn it moves the greater populace towards mindsets against and for various aspects within politics and affects the people they vote for, or affects the things the politicians vote for based on their desire to actually get elected or re-elected.

It takes a seriously long amount of time of course. And it's never going to be effective in the short term because it requires a long-term spread of information and awareness. And of course it's not going to be effective against those that are simply corrupt or don't care about re-election.

true,cstwig,lfc99,,"Hello Arsenal supporter - don't worry I don't plan on murdering you... too much.

I think I do actually - but I definitely sympathize, buying RVP last season for United was basically like buying the PL title.

Suarez would be a great fit in any team to be honest, he has so many talents and abilities, he can just play whatever and still score goals. I just don't see the point in selling to a PL club, when we are trying to claim back our former glory. I'm really in 2 minds whether I want him to go at all - he is a joy to watch and a fantastic footballer, but it may be better for many obvious reasons.

Trust me, I know we still have some way to go, but I think this season is going to be a fantastic one to follow for all the teams involved in the CL race, and even if by the misfortune of other teams I think we stand a real chance - with 4 out of last years top 7 with new managers, the potential/rumored transfers (for all teams), and the form we showed in the latter half of last season, It will be thrilling to the end.

Did you know based on the points purely from the second half of the season we came third?

If you do get Rooney from them though, I hope he performs - as that would be the icing on the cake in your revenge against United.

However if you get Suarez (I think its unlikely but we'll see) I may have to rethink that whole murder thing... ;)  ",0,1374705321,null,0,false,0,cb9l3iz,t3_1iym4e,t1_cb9l3iz,t1_cb9i2i9,null,1430348170,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt;The Tories are about making the rich richer and the poor poorer

The Tories would say that they are about making the rich richer and the poor richer, if they were to talk about it in those terms. But it is interesting to see how those who disagree with them fail to understand their motives.

&gt;the reason the Tories want out, [is] because the EU is stopping the Tories from cutting even more of regular people's rights.

The reason the eurosceptics want out is so that the people of the UK can decide what is best for themselves. You think workers should have more rights? Great! Let the people decide. I don't know about you but I prefer democracy to authoritarianism.

&gt;We will have to follow their rules on trade if we want to trade with EU 

But WE get to decide if that's what we want rather than having the decision made for us. It's also a little more nuanced than that in that it depends on what we want to trade in, not to mention that we can set our own rules for trade to.

&gt;...it will also cost us far more.

Actually, it would cost us the same but without the fees (currently £12b and rising) we pay for membership each year.

&gt;outside the EU we have no influence on their rules and regulations
&gt;we also have far far less global pull
&gt;we are not important on the world's stage

I don't think you understand how diplomacy works. Outside states can have a massive influence on EU rules and regulations, look at Japan's recent statements about the UK, as a recent example. Outside of the EU better use could be made of the NAFTA and Commonwealth. Plus the UK sits on the UNSC and punches far above it's weight at all levels of international relations.

&gt;The EU is the only way Europe can compete with the US, China and the rapidly developing economies. 

I don't think you understand how economics works either. There are a myriad other options far better than protectionism for both the UK and the EU in terms of promoting regional and global economic growth.

I wasn't, I was just trying to make the point about how such statements can be taken.

&gt;There's no shame in being middle class, but it does mean you see the world in a particular way. Read the thread from /r/restorethefourth I posted here, because s/he addresses, far more eloquently than I, the problems which transpire when enthusiastic privileged people want to run the show and don't allow others with different experience to have their share of input.

I can't find that post but I do I agree and I do understand there is a real problems with privileged well meaning people coming over the top and attempting to impose themselves on events. I'm a product of my background but I do hold my self to an ideal, that of trying to be open to being proven wrong and to seek out all the chances I can to be so. There are so many intelligent and wonderful people I've met who have seen so much more, so much different to me that I'd be an idiot to not to be open to their input. I'm no doubt not as open to that as I should be, exciting as it is being proven wrong there's so much that can get in the way of noticing when I have. I just have to largely trust in the ability of the people I've met over the years to tell me when I'm being an arrogant ass, which they've been more than capable of doing.

&gt;For sure. Ultimately everyone has to decide which side of the barricades they stand. If we (the anarchists) seem more uncompromising and tetchy than most, it's because we know from our history that you can only be betrayed by someone you trust - and the liberals and State socialists have always turned traitor in the end.

I can respect that and where it comes from and to be perfectly honest this conversation has been good for me. In large parts it's getting to the put at which I need to start to put up or shut up to become as involved with the things I believe in as I know I should be, do more than sit about talking on the internets.

The fact is around 50 per cent of our exports go to the EU, the EU also has an import tax of 5.3 per cent. Do you think that any major manufacturer will want to come to Britain? No they'll go to an EU country because they have a far larger market. 

Outside states have an influence sure, but they don't have anywhere near the same influence as a voting member inside the EU, they cannot propose regulations, they cannot influence the discussion directly, they are neutered as Britain will be if we leave.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;But as a centrist, why is privatising the NHS bad, if its still free at the point of use?

Because it won't work. Private sector provision of public services rarely works well in the UK. The suppliers have donated and lobbied; they have literally been allowed to draft the legislation and regulations. 

The result won't be like choosing between your nice shiny BUPA hospital and the Nuffield in the next town. It will be a run down service cut to the bone and provided by a select group of politically connected suppliers. And it will cost the taxpayer more than it does already. 

&gt;Before Thatcher privatised the gas/leccy companies we had 'the four day week', the lights were off for the other three.

There's no connection between the privatisation of the energy companies and the end of the three day week.

&gt;If privatising the NHS means better care for a reduced cost, why is that bad? 

Because it won't mean better care for a reduced cost.

Are you thinking of the University of Edinburgh's facilities?

It's a lot more than a ten minute walk from Heriot-Watt's Riccarton campus to the city centre!  Google Maps estimates it as around a two hour walk: http://goo.gl/maps/vRpHA

Personally, if not living on campus, I'd consider something not a million miles from the [number 25 bus route](http://lothianbuses.com/timetables-tickets-maps/timetables/25) (as that goes to the HW campus).  Probably more like Gorgie/Dalry/Haymarket which are closer to the city centre - Sighthill is not one of Edinburgh's loveliest or handiest areas unless you're big on industrial estates and car dealerships!

Alternatively places like Juniper Green and Currie are nice and within a shortish walk/cycle distance, that said they are more suburban and not so full of exciting studenty things to do.

Our starting lineup includes none of the players you've just mentioned. Right now, our midfield consists of the frequently excellent Lucas, an aging but still (relatively) capable Gerrard, and one Phillip Coutinho who has played nothing but excellent soccer since he got here. With Alberto and Henderson as backups we look pretty decent at midfield. Throw in a surprisingly capable Aspas and Sturridge and you have a pretty good squad, at least up front. 

What this means is that, while we'd be exaggerating to say that we're shoe ins for the 4th spot with suarez (regardless of what this thread says) we do have a chance. Not a huge one, but some chance at getting the fourth slot.

The way I see it, if Suarez does stay, which I'm not counting on but also feel could happen, we'll play better soccer than we've played in a few years. We won't be out of striking distance from Arsenal, but we'll clearly be the underdogs for the spot.

Really? I didn't think her growth was that great at all, other than falling more in-love with the Doctor as her tenure went on. I agree with /u/GeneralRose on Mickey's improvement, even if I didn't like him as a character. But Donna blows them both out of the water in terms of development. She universally annoyed everyone with her first appearance, and is still mostly the same when she comes back to the show, but she shows signs of growth -- at least in the sense that she's realised there's more out there than what she has/does. Far more so than Rose or Martha she called the Doctor out on his shit while learning from their adventures together.

Suarez isn't on even a third of that, and every player that signed for City knew that City would be spending hundreds of millions to build a superstar team which was going to compete.

We don't have the money City did to start building.  We also don't have a superstar international well known manager - City struggled to attract big name when Mark Hughes was manager, it was only Mancini who really brought in the big names.

Also I'm still not sure Reus would sign, granted this is specific to him, but German clubs have wage caps, if he was money orientated he could go anywhere and earn more, but he doesn't want to.  And none of that money you pay him guarantees him CL football, does the extra money matter when you can be offered good money elsewhere whilst playing at a higher level?  City could offer him everything you just said, as could PSG, Chelsea, Madrid without even thinking about it, and all of them are right now above Liverpool in pecking order.  There's also another whole host of clubs who could offer him good money and still be above Liverpool.

I appreciate I said the 100M, but look at what it took to theoretically get Reus... he scored 27 Goals last season, and Bundesliga is nowhere near as competitive as the Premiership; I'd take Suarez over him any day.

true,robinunderhood,null,null,"&gt; was surprised to see so much support for them

They enjoy a peak of popularity these years. If you asked them the same question 15 years ago, you wouldn't get the same answer. I don't believe there is something about pure non-hybrid british blood that makes people addicted to the royals, it's just the current trends.

Having said that, Britons are nowhere as volatile as the French.

&gt; they act as a good catalyst for national pride in a time when governments are proving very unpopular

When the governments of democratic countries go shitty, people can change them in the next election.

When the royals go shitty, we cannot vote them down, at least not directly and not fast enough. They have all the time in the world to play their popularity back.

Think of Diana's death in late 90s, where the monarchs were at their extreme unpopularity. If they could be unelected like governments, that would be the end of the British monarchy. But the average of people tend to have short term memory when it comes to history. That, and a little bit a of showbiz are the tools of winning this game back.

The game of showbiz is to keep the pulse going. Let's review these pulses since a while after Diana's death

* 2002: Jubilee
* 2006: The Queen, with Helen Mirren
* 2012: Another Jubilee
* 2012: 'Royal' wedding
* 2013: 'Royal' baby

And it can continue something along the line of:

* 2015: Another 'royal' baby
* 2017: Another 'royal' wedding
* 2022: Yet another Jubilee

As long as you cannot force people to abandon fast food, or stop them to consume reality shows, you cannot stop them to be brainwashed by this well engineered pattern.

**If some of you are a royal fan, and you disagree with all I said, at least have a think about this:**

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"My two big gripes with this article that I've seen a million times.

1)Not all of these things are 'Plot twists'. There's this weird fascination that every resolution in a story must be considered some kind of twist. They're not. There's a distinct difference between a twist and a reveal. A twist is when you're lead to believe one thing(Such as this character is a living person) and it is later revealed that they are not what they appeared to be(This person has actually been dead the entire time). They twist your established perception of the writing. A reveal is simply any new information. Revealing the answer to a question is not a twist, it is a reveal. Finding out Clara entered The Doctor's time stream is not a twist, it is a reveal. We never had a grounded perception on why she was splintered throughout time. The show built her up as an enigma, not established her as a solid fact. And also, you're absolutely right, regardless of my rantings, each of these can be used effectively. I wanted to choke him for criticizing Sherlock Holmes. I get where he's coming from, but the brilliance of the writing was that the movie continuously built up the antagonist as this mystical person. It wasn't until Sherlock made his deduction that everything falls into place. And, if you're actually observant, there are tons of clues and hints throughout the movie. This guy just obviously missed them because they weren't as hit-you-over-the-head as this guy wanted them to be.

2)There's a definite sense of 'If I liked it, then I will consider it a twist and good writing. If I didn't like it, then it's a bad twist and bad writing.' Just look at the last example he gives for good twists, which is the 'He will knock four times' from Doctor Who.The description itself states there's no way to have seen it being Wilf coming, and that a 'Good twist' gives hints. So how is this some magic exception to the rule since by his very definition a twist has to be foreseeable by a keen eye in order to be good. He even states that the show tricks you into thinking it's pointing toward The Master, and ends up being a completely unpredictable character. Not judging it myself, and I'll even admit(As someone who is not a big fan of The End of Time as a whole), the twist that it was Wilf and not The Master was actually fairly decent. Especially since it played on your relief as well(Once The Master was gone, surely nothing bad will happen to The Doctor now, right...RIGHT!?). However, *by this guy's own definition* it is a horrible twist.

Also, as a sidenote, his 'Bonus example' is just laughable. As a fan of LOST, I can tell you he probably didn't even watch passed the second season [Minor LOST spoiler](#s ""The mere fact that he refers to the smoke monster as a security system shows how little he knows. That's almost like showing how much you know about Doctor Who by referring to Daleks as robots"") Also, on top of this, he's just flat out wrong that nothing is foreshadowed, but then again, as we've talked about, that doesn't matter one way or the other. As I've stated, there's a difference between a twist and a reveal that this guy doesn't make. LOST had a lot of reveals, and a couple of twists, and actually, the few twists they had were pretty brilliant.",0,1374727387,null,0,false,0,cb9spzt,t3_1izz1s,t1_cb9spzt,t1_cb9s6o8,null,1430344529,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

I can't believe everyone is in a tizzy about Ba this summer. Honestly he ""seems to have gone right off the boil since moving to us"" ? Where were you when we signed Torres?!?!?!?!

I think it is a little unfair to write him off after 1/2 a season. He literally was thrown right into our 1st team squad and I am 90% sure that everyone in this sub was singing his name in Jan. when we signed him. He was cheap, was one of the leading scorers at the halfway mark last year, and he will finally have a full preseason with Chelsea. People feel so entitled that we will just drop cash on everyone and anyone, this isn't how 99% of the teams in the world operate, and just because the sub $10 Million dollar Striker isn't the $50+ Million dollar Cavani or Falcao doesnt mean he is total shit. I agree that we need a stronger option in to get us goals and I think Lukaku should be the answer but let's not claim that Ba has ""Gone off the Boil"", take a look at Torres' first two years @ Chelsea for ""Gone off the Boil""

The truth is that good foreshadowing shouldn't give away any answers. Good foreshadowing should allow you to look back and say,""Oh, I see how these dots connect!"" while at the same time not give away the full picture before you're able to see it.

true,Ozlin,null,null,"There's an interesting fun tactic in writing where you give an object early in the story and then do something to change the perception of that object, adding or revoking some emotional connection to it, or changing the audiences perception of it. Similar to a McGuffin, but with actual meaning and not merely a distraction. The best example I can think of right now is Butch's watch in Pulp Fiction, which changes from its introduction as an object of emotional importance to one of deep stress, but that's not even a good example. Maybe, Two Face's coin in the Nolan TDK film, which changes from an object of Harvey's moral fairness, to one of the unfair cruelties of life and the chances it deals. Anyway, I think Moffat is attempting something similar, but IMO he often doesn't contextualize the object enough before changing it, or rather, it's presented too vaguely that we don't really get a solid understanding or build an attachment to it before he tries to do something clever with it. And he makes it less of a ""x becomes y due to circumstance z"" and more of a ""x was really y all along but we lead you to believe it was z, haha!"" So rather than having some meaningful change (as often happens in life), it can come off as a cheap trick of mystery that gets gimmicky.

In Sherlock we at least see a bit more of what Sherlock's process is for figuring out what happened, but some of the internal connections we obviously can't see, even if they're right in front of us. I don't think we get that as much with Doctor Who because sometimes even The Doctor doesn't know what's going on so there's less clues and more just ""wait, what's that?"" which is ok to a degree, but I think it becomes formulaic. And The Doctor often has some interior knowledge we don't know that he surprises us with, or the sonic screwdriver, while Sherlock just makes connections through observation. I do still enjoy Doctor Who and I don't think Moffat deserves as much heat as he gets sometimes, but I do think he relies on it a bit too much for me. Also, for me, I need more solid ground to stand on, even for a sci-fi story, because I want some accountability and rules, something to hold on to, that too much rug sweeping just makes me doubt the entire show and its universe (questioning everything is great, but it can get to be too much). Sherlock is more grounded in reality that way I suppose as well (except for maybe Moriarty, who is just crazy). If he could bring more of the Sherlock into Doctor Who it'd be gold for me.

Allen started of great and was brilliant at keeping the ball ticking in the first few months, he fell of during the second half and I will like to think it was because of the injury he was playing with. Also, Henderson is the kind of attitude I will love to see in every player, works hard and always looking to improve, has that passion  for football which you can see in his body language. 

One thing both can work on is being more adventurous, looking for that final or killer ball more often. ",0,1374731789,null,0,false,0,cb9tz55,t3_1j059w,t1_cb9tz55,t3_1j059w,null,1430343864,-9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-9

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"What you just said is called deus ex machina, and it's a nearly-inescapable part of fantasy fiction as a genre, which Doctor Who decisively is. I think it's unfair to label it science fiction because everything in the Whoverse operates so far outside the boundaries of known science that just about any explanation becomes some hand-waving, fancy-worded, Time Lord trickery.

To me, that's fine. It's just one of the hallmarks of the show and I've accepted as what it is a long time ago. The people who are really annoyed by this (which I'm not judging, they have every right to) are the ones who consider Doctor Who to be *science* fiction, and therefore they demand that the story-arc resolutions actually make *physical sense* - something I consider impossible with the show.

Sherlock is obviously much more grounded than that. The catch is that it's also an *adult* show, and also filmed in a different format (every episode is basically a movie). Quite often people in this subreddit forget that Doctor Who is supposed to be a *casual* family show. The Brits don't watch it like the people in this subreddit. They casually tune into it every Saturday with their families, and then they don't spend the rest of the week re-watching and obsessively analyzing every little story element to be discussed in /r/doctorwho. BBC is ultimately still a British TV channel and they're not making this show for *us*. They're making it for the British, and given what the show is to them, they want Doctor Who a bit ""dumbed down"" compared to Sherlock.

Honestly given these limitations of the show's cultural context in the UK, I believe that Moffat actually does a pretty decent job trying to satisfy both demographics despite what BBC expects out of him. The story resolutions are a bit dumbed down and the clues are a bit too in-your-face in order to accomodate the casual audience, but simultaneously Moffat has incorporated a lot of multi-episode story arcs (traditionally a big no-no for Doctor Who) in order to satiate the craving for more complicated and engaging plotlines.

Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that there aren't diehard Who fans in the UK - there are. It's just that BBC very understandably caters to the general/average British audience that watches Doctor Who as a casual family entertainment hour. As a result, Moffat (who is capable of writing very cool stuff, like in *Sherlock*) ends up dumbing down his scripts a little bit for accessibility. A lot of people in this subreddit gets on his case for it, but I don't mind. I've adjusted my expectations accordingly and I enjoy the show quite a bit.",0,1374732445,null,0,1374745796,0,cb9u543,t3_1izy2r,t1_cb9u543,t1_cb9txvb,null,1430343786,36,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,36

Season six: He calls everyone out to the middle of a desert in the US, just to watch him die... a scenario he orchestrated. Huh? And it only got stranger at Demon's Run when it got inspiring and The Doctor said, ""I'm gonna find your daughter!"" 

.....aaaand completely fails to do so.

And at that point, the mindfuck just gets bigger and bigger until it makes less sense than a Frank Zappa lyric. I only kept watching because I started and needed *some kind* of closure.

The demographic is for both new and old viewers, so you don't need to watch the old series to know what is going. I mean, that's what the companions are for. Everything is new to them.

References to the old series are, obviously, not included.

Three circumstances they highlight:

&gt; if a wage increase is brought about by increased labor productivity,
it will not create inflationary pressure.

Which is clearly not the case here.

&gt;a wage increase will not create inflationary pressure if it leads to a squeeze in profits because a firm cannot pass along cost increases... competitive market pressures strongly influence the pricing decisions of firm

Since I assume that this will apply to all sectors of the economy, firms cannot compete on this. Output will remain the same for all firms, and the volume of labour will increase for all firms- I can't see the room for competition. Perhaps that would be uneven, but the incentive would be toward greater captial investment, rather than labour. 

&gt; causation could work in the opposite direction: An increase in aggregate demand may permit firms to raise the price of their products

Is still inflationary, although the cause is different.

However on this sub all of the things you have listed (minus the re watch, which is something we should do) all pop up on this subreddit, it's just once the initial conversation is over no one brings it up again unless it's during a season and they want a specific topic discussed. The problem with this sub is the people participating consistently view the cakes and the t-shirts and decide to upvote them while discussion seems to be put the wayside because showing your individual support seems to be a common theme on this sub. Don't get me wrong some of the things posted on this sub are amazing but I will say that we are overflowing with doctor who merch/food items and not enough discussion. 

On the other hand this is exactly why Gallifrey was made, to have somewhere to discuss with strict rules on what you are able to post which is something we desperately needed. The downside of this of course is the limited crowed that supports the discussion on the smaller subreddit and the large crowd that supports the pictures of random items on the large one. 

I don't see anything changing on the main doctor who sub until the mods decide to make a change stating that there will be a new sub for merch and fan made items but since that is the thing that drives this sub and also if we do that we kill the other sub since it will render having both useless we are kind of at an impasse at this point  and I see no way of moving forward other than just continuing to move on with a smile

I took it upon myself to delve into some of the old Who stuff and you know what?  It was tedious.  I watched The Daemons and it told a story over five 25-minute episodes that could have very comfortably been told in a single 45-minute episode now.  I also dipped into The Pirate Planet and abandoned it two episodes in through sheer lack of interest.

Now, I'm not saying that original Who wasn't amazing and ground-breaking for its time, but when we look back at it decades later, it doesn't really stand up to what a modern audience would expect.  Some die-hard fans really do look at it with rose-tinted glasses, in my opinion.

So far FSG have done quite alot of good work in restructuring the club and optimizing revenue streams.

They haven't really invested alot in the first team, which lets be honest, needs alot of investment to be really competitive again. Remember we made quite a bit of money selling players.

I would fear that they may be looking to make the club look good on the books, reducing wage bill, while increasing the revenue streams in order to make the sale of the club a profitable bit of business. 

Nothing wrong with that as long as the next owners are good custodians, or filthy rich Arabs :) , yet I get the impression FSG see a medium term investment with a good profit at the end.

I don't think they have any great love for the club, or football in general, apart from that. 

Rodgers has done quite well with limited investment. Though I think after this season we will have a much better idea of how the club is going under FSG and Rodgers.

On the plus side, the team (After January) have started scoring a ton of goals and we aren't relying on Suarez mainly for goals. The playing style has also been much more organised and at times we looked unbeatable. I've also been very impressed with the mentality of the team and the way FSG are bringing a team of backroom experts and BR embracing that set up. 

On the negative side, the defense has been extremely leaky, which could be down to Carragher playing a deep line and Skrtel not comfortable in a possession based game. Additionally, we've been bullied far too easily against more physical strikers. The thought of Benteke and Lukaku come to mind. 

I'm still waiting for another season before I fully make my mind up. I'm hoping that our form past January last year is not just a fluke (Similar to Dalglish's first half season) and that we'd continue that form during the upcoming season. Also, I'm waiting to see how BR plans to fix the defense with his signings. I think he's willing to use Wisdom as a back up Right back and Center Back which would mean we'd have Agger, Skrtel, Kolo, Coates (Probably get sold) and Wisdom as CBs. I'd still want to see a CB signing that can slot into the first team directly and would be an improvement to the CBs we already have available.

I have been involved in a few interviews here, and the graduates we interviewed simply didn't have much of a clue. Yes, they knew the theory behind it all, behind the programming languages, but they didn't do much in the way of actual credible work. Much credible coding that we can look at. 

Even those that did have projects we could look at and review were nothing even remotely related to web development. A guy showed us that he used Microsoft's Kinect SDK to create an app for the Xbox whereby your image is captured and then bloated to make you look fat.

Great. He can code!!!

**Wait** ....the code was god awful though :( (think big methods, most in the 500-600 line's long) and how is this related to web development? I guess we can say this shows he has C# knowledge so he would be OK with ASP.NET, or get to grips with it quickly. He had no front end knowledge though. 

I get what you are saying, but I think it's imperative to know that CS != development. At least, it's != to a development *career*.

He seems completely unable to write female characters that don't fall into the archetype of action girl, incredibly sexy to boot, with no real flaws, and so they don't really feel like humans to me; and with the Doctor (who I think is written pretty well, and all the Doctors in the new series so far have been great, putting their own spins on the character) being all brilliant and crazy and alien, the show really doesn't have main characters I can relate to, which renders the plots a little hollow for me, especially because recently they're all character driven!

Take the recent arc with Clara being the impossible girl, the girl that once again, the whole universe seems to revolve around etc. Fine; if she was well-written, but I just don't think she was; she was just brilliant, and sexy, and far too clever, just perfect. (Just like Amy, except Amy's only flaw was being horrible to Rory, and that was played for laughs rather than depicted as a true flaw) So right from the start of the arc, I wasn't really that bothered about it, but I hoped her character would develop as the series went on; it didn't, so the crazy ending didn't really work for me.
 
That's probably the biggest flaw for me, character-driven plots in a show without well-rounded characters. There are other problems, the plot arcs are a bit long and get quietly dropped after a while without any satisfactory resolution (....how did the TARDIS explode in Series 5? Who knows!) the use of science fiction ex machinas to remove all tension from scenes ([Minor spoiler from the last episode of Series 7:](#s "" 'Oh no! Jenny's dead! What can we do?!' 'I can bring her back to life!' 'Hooray!' "") and the general breakneck pace of episodes lately; they all feel breathless, crammed into 45 minutes without time (ties into what I said above) to develop characters and to set the scene.

I've not seen any hard figure (not even from the DM) on how many of the BBC's roughly five million viewers complained. Even an article in the Metro (part of DMGT) only describes it as ""a number"", from which I infer it's less than twenty.

Honestly, there's been more coverage from commercial TV stations like ITV than from the BBC, There's always blanket coverage of things like this from most media outlets. The BBC was slightly less bad than most of the others, but it's always the BBC that gets singled out for criticism. 

It appears that commercial organisations can do whatever they like without comment, but a public-funded organisation must do whatever the right-wing tabloids say it should.

So they can either pay up and get this over or go over spend on someone like Jackson Martinez or lounge in the rest of the window looking for some 18 year old French striker

EDIT: Liverpool have probably given Arsenal a deadline by which to pay up as I believe I saw mentioned in another thread. With the 35m they've gotten from Higuain and Ibrahimovic announcing that he plans on staying with PSG despite Cavani signing I think Madrid will probably pony up a minimum of 45m for Suarez which the club may just have to accept.

The website looking pretty has no basis for a forensic analysis.

The problem being at the moment is that 99% of my remit and skillset doesn't fall in to what the average public sector workplace deems necessary. Obviously things like MI5 and stuff are concerned about digital security.

The managers in charge of your average pub sec establishment doesn't understand the implications of digital security because they dont understand digital security and its importance. Iv'e found them to have a ""deal with it when it comes up"" attitude.

The problem being they apply this due to its general application in real life. 

""That lightbulb will need replacing at some point, we'll deal with it when it comes up"" would probably be the best example.

Here in lies the problem. The internet and digital services don't work like this. ""Oh someone appears to have harvested our entire contact database, what do? I know, lets add security!""


Well yeah thats useful now some chinese or russian is running around with your contact list which can be used as legally or illegally as they want. Not to mention if it got leaked that you lost them you have breached things like Data protection act, so have now got several hundred lawsuits against you

The other problem is budget.

Pub sec is dictated by budget, im not saying they dont have their best interests at heart because honestly a lot of them do. But if the numbers dont add up then its instantly a no go because the people wearing the trousers see numbers on a page rather than what they signify.

you want to hire me as a fully qualified free lancer?

Sure, that will be £70-£100,000 for a calendar year to audit your system.

I can promise i will do my best to secure your system and give you detailed written reports and advice at a level you choose. However there will be nothing physical to actually present to you.

If you give a builder £100,000 to build you something, you're going to have actually have a physical thing you can look at or use at the end of it. With me you get the digital equivalent.

We get an entire episode to think about how it is possible, but we don't have enough time. When the episode is a two-parter the mystery is equally more complex, to give us more to think about. Very few times the audience figures out the mystery before the next episode. Making the reveal pretty amazing. 

He does the same now:

He sets up a mystery:

Cracks in the wall.

Doctor dying

Clara appearing all over time and space.

But the audience gets too much time to think about it. It spends almost a full season, months on end, speculating. And the theories become madly insane, and great. People analyse and turn over every little piece of episode to figure it out.

And when the time comes for the real reveal, the theories are better than the answer. Creating this sort of disappointment. 

Russel T. Davies did it differently. He didn't set up a mystery, he hid the plot of the finale somewhat in the episodes before then.

Most people seem to think they're an expert because they have an opinion, and you quickly see how little they know when their own standards begin to contradict one another. I see this all the time when people try to be internet scholars, and this article is a perfect example.

For starters, you're right. By his definition, the Impossible Astronaut arch is a good and proper twist. However, he can't distinguish between objective standards(Even ones he sets into place himself) and his own personal opinion. So Impossible Astronaut gets tossed into the 'Bad twist' pile.  Then if you look up top, you see 'Knock four times' in his list of good twists. Again, ignoring his own standard put into place, by his definition the 'Knock four times' twist was a bad twist(There's no possible way to predict Wilf would be the one knocking before it happens). Yet despite this, he enjoyed that ending, so it gets put into the 'Good twist' pile.

I'm fine with people having an opinion, even if their opinion is that something with objectively bad writing is entertaining to them. I'd be lying if I were to say I haven't found enjoyment out of something that was objectively written poorly. Likewise, just because something is well written on an objective level doesn't mean I necessarily find it enjoyable. My problem is that there are so many people on the internet that think just because they have an opinion on how much they enjoyed something, that they have an educated opinion on how well it was objectively written.

I was just offering it up as a reason why I believe Moffat intentionally ""dumbs down"" his writing a little bit, compared to some of his other exceptional work like *Sherlock*. As a result of this, I generally have a more favorable view of Moffat and what he does with Doctor Who compared to other people on this subreddit. I like it, because I've adjusted my expectations a bit to account for what the show generally is in the UK.

I apologize for the shoddy wording. It wasn't a rant. It was more like a non-judgemental explanation for why I think Doctor Who plots aren't as ""clever"" as Sherlock's.

true,Swooshington,1953,,"Of the three who was in the best form last season? And how has Ba looked this pre-season?

I believe that Lukaku is the future for the team, and Torres is a reasonable player to have right now. I also believe Ba will be the victim SHOULD we sign Rooney or another striker. He's a reasonable squad player, who just hasn't looked as prolific as he did at West Ham or Newcastle. 

Oh and don't for a second believe I'm short sighted enough to have forgotten what Torres was like.

&gt;He was cheap, was one of the leading scorers at the halfway mark last year

And managed 6 in like 20 something games for us. Well below the expectations of everyone, including myself. This actually supports my argument that our system doesn't really support a striker more than a flaw in Ba.

&gt;People feel so entitled that we will just drop cash on everyone and anyone, this isn't how 99% of the teams in the world operate, and just because the sub $10 Million dollar Striker isn't the $50+ Million dollar Cavani or Falcao doesnt mean he is total shit. 

""Entitled""? At no point did I say we need a new player. In fact what I've said was Torres was in better form then Ba, Lukaku is a better prospect but we need to ease him in and ease the pressure, so we should effectively through Torres under the bus to protect Lukaku

&gt;I agree that we need a stronger option in to get us goals and I think Lukaku should be the answer but let's not claim that Ba has ""Gone off the Boil"", take a look at Torres' first two years @ Chelsea for ""Gone off the Boil.

Neither striker is world class, however Ba would be easier to sell. He has lower wages and we spent less on him, meaning the club could take a hit on the transfer fee. At any point did I say we need to spunk a metric shit tonne on a new player? No. I have merely stated based on form and potential Ba is currently our third choice striker. And based on form, potential, and finances, Ba is currently the most logical player to sell SHOULD we decide to bring in Rooney, or any other striking option.

I meant in the statistical sence, i.e. it's a statisic from a sample, rather than a paramter from a completely enumerated census. 

&gt; But it'd be very interested to know why we're so different from them on this.

A lot of economists have been talking about it for a while, with no real answer hence the 'puzzle' part. Most of them seem to be arguing now that people are accepting real-terms pay cuts (not nominal broadly) in exchange for jobs.

Saints were beaten by German giants FC Schalke 04 in the first of two pre-season matches to be played in Austria.

Mauricio Pochettino's side had the better of the opening 45 minutes, but could not get the better of a side that will take part in the UEFA Champions League in coming campaign.

The half-time introduction of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar seemed to swing things back in Schalke's favour, with the Holland international opening the scoring just before the hour mark.

Both sides made a raft of changes soon afterwards, and it was the German side who seized the initiative and doubled their lead through Joël Matip on 69 minutes.

There was plenty of effort from Saints, but ultimately came up short against an outfit who are only 12 days from their first competitive match of the coming season.

Ahead of the game, Guly – a hat-trick hero in last Wednesday's demolition of Spanish lower-leaguers Palamós – was ruled out with a thigh injury sustained in training on Monday.

Maya Yoshida and Gastón Ramírez also missed out as they continue their personalised pre-season programmes following their involvement at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Pochettino named a team that saw Kelvin Davis return in goal after being left out of last Wednesday's game on the Costa Brava.

As he did against Palamós, Calum Chambers started at right back with Dejan Lovren and Jos Hooiveld the chosen centre-halves and Luke Shaw at left-back.

Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis were paired in the heart of midfield, with Jason Puncheon and Lloyd Isgrove on the wings. Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez were given the nod as a front two.

Rodriguez – with three pre-season goals to his name already – looked dangerous early on as he pinched the ball from Jermaine Jones and played it to Lambert via Davis, but the move was brought to an end by an offside flag.

Then, in the eleventh minute, a good overlapping run by Chambers led to him crossing into the box but Lambert's powered header was held by Schalke goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand.

Schalke almost carved out a chance on the quarter-hour when a long ball forward set Michel Bastos clear of Lovren only for it to overrun him and to allow Saints stopper Davis to claim.

Saints quickly got themselves back into the ascendancy, though, with Isgrove knocking the ball past Atsuto Uchida only to see his quickly-taken drive fizz just wide of the Schalke goal.

The ball almost broke in the box for Rodriguez on the half-hour but Hildebrand was quick to claim, and the Germany international was at his best again two minutes later as he held Puncheon's pile-driver shot.

Schalke briefly threatened before the half came to an end as a whipped free-kick from Christian Fuchs was only headed as far as Bastos, but his half-volley was poorly struck so Davis saved with ease.

HALF TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-0 FC SCHALKE 04

Both sides made three changes each at the break, with Saints bringing on Adam Lallana, Morgan Schneiderlin and José Fonte in place of Isgrove, Steven Davis and Hooiveld.

Huntelaar, one of Schalke's half-time replacements, had the first chance of the second period when he got his head on the end of a Bastos cross but his effort was excellently held by Davis.

And it was HUNTELAAR who broke the deadlock two minutes before the hour when, after Christian Clemens got between Fonte and Davis, the Dutch international was on hand to bundle in on the rebound.

Pochettino made six changes soon afterwards, bringing on Paulo Gazzaniga, Nathaniel Clyne, Danny Fox, Jack Cork, Emmanuel Mayuka and James Ward-Prowse on for Davis, Chambers, Shaw, Wanyama, Lambert and Rodriguez.

However, the substitutions did not have the desired effect as it was Schalke who soon scored the second goal of the game as MATIP seized on some defensive hesitancy to nip in and poke past Gazzaniga with 69 on the clock.

That blow seemed to kill off any hopes of a positive result for Saints, though Adam Lallana did have a half-chance to pull one back on 75 minutes but his attempted overhead kick was blocked.

Pochettino's men did give it a go in the closing stages but could only muster half-chances as Schalke's class told. However, manager Pochettino will undoubtedly be happy with the level of performance and effort put in by his players.

The expert said that in ten years we could have a world class rail service, amongst the best in the world, if the plan was followed to the letter.

The government asked if it could be done in four years, the expert replied that it could not, so they thanked him for his time and didn't bother.

 Considering the amount of media fuss about the situation, he's been discrete but very firm, and it shows that both he and the board have the best interests of the club firmly positioned at the top of their list of priorities. It's been made very clear that Suarez is expected not only to stay, but to play at 100% unless the very legitimate valuation we have put on him is met by a bid. He is better than Cavani.

 On a slightly different note, Brendan's football philosophy enchants me. The way we played in the second half of the season was often sublime, and I cannot wait for the new season to see how the team has gelled, both with one another and with the tactics Rodgers favours. 

 Even though we can only judge on the basis of a few pre-season games so far, the signings of Aspas and Alberto look very promising, and rekindle my faith in our transfer policy.

  Rodgers is also doing something that neither Benitez nor Houllier seemed capable of doing: developing young talent. It was on this basis that Shankly started our great dynasty, and this basis which gave Man. U. and Arsenal such success over the last 15 years. Sterling, Ibe and Coutinho could, quite realistically, be league winners for us in the next five years, and that is not discounting Daniel Sturridge as our premium center forward in the years to come.

 For the first time in far too long, I feel confident and excited about the future of our club.

But I have a theory why it's so rough. I wouldn't say it's an adaptation. IMO, it's just a completely different (and somewhat jarring) writing style - Davies is more ""campy sci-fi"", and Moffat is definitely more ""whimsical fairytale"". There are things I loved and hated about RTD, and things I love and hate about Moffat. I think the only difference is the magnitude I feel for Moffat. With Davies, I only mildly hated or loved things with all the middle ground covered, but with Moffat it's one extreme or the other, and almost nothing in between. 

Also, and this might be the most unpopular thing I'll ever say on this subreddit, I think a lot of it has to do with Matt Smith. I'm pretty sure that if Ten(nant) never regenerated and the only change was Moffat, people would be praising the unique direction the show is going in.

Re benefits, you speak as one who has never been on them, or who has had a fortunate experience with them. When I lost my job I signed on almost immediately, but due to the fecklessness of the system (and those employed by it- ironically I could've done their job 10x better), I didn't see a penny for two and a half months. 

It turned into something out of a nightmare. I still had rent going out, it was killing my savings and I barely had enough left over for things like food and bills. This is the reality for most people on benefits, and it's one of the major reasons why food charities have seen such a major increase in demand since the recession hit.

A thousand years of discrmination has left women manifestly less well off then men in terms of prominent figures. It is simply a fact that there are going to be orders of magnitude more great men than women because women were largely limited in how they could participate in society.

Therefore left to a basic consideration of merit, the sexism of historical British society will be allowed to make itself known on our modern day banknotes.

History was sexist. Profoundly, and viciously so. That is absolutely something we can engage with in studying history and should not shy away from.

But out currency is not a documentary or a classroom syllabus. It is not a historical record.  It is a symbolic one, intended for use by and engagement with everyone in 21st century British society. This isn't giving someone a job despite them being less competent. It is choosing a symbol suited for the present day.

Regulators always form regulations, and these are gradually improved upon as an industry develops and matures - that's how an industry is continuously improved upon in terms of both safety and in pollution.

There are sites but the real estate value of them is horrendous and that’s before you even start to think about building a stadium on it. If you’re Sunderland you get given a piece of land on a disused pit but there’s no chance of that happening in West London.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers  said: “There was an offer a few weeks ago of £35m and two weeks later it is now £40m and £1. I don’t think it is anywhere near the value of what he is worth.

Most of the article is based on rumour and speculation, asking how Spurs never considered a potential third party on Damaio is silly because we don't really know if Spurs wanted him. It was rumoured a million times but I don't think there was anything concrete. Even so he might have been the bottom of a long list of prospects, reading the press you'd get the impression that clubs pick one player and try to buy them and no one else and when the deal doesn't happen they have to start from square one. Do they really believe that most clubs are that incompetent?

Mentioning Demba Ba going for £7m is also pretty silly. What's to say Spurs didn't offer £18m? If the player doesn't want to come to us, it doesn't matter what we offer his club

Maybe we should have bid £25m for Benteke, maybe we did. Maybe Levy doesn't think he's worth £25m. Maybe he didn't want to leave in the first place but thought he was undervalued by Villa and this was a tactic to win a better contract.

I agree with the sentiment that you sometimes have to spend more on a player than they're worth but only if he's worth more to you.

Moffat's Doctor Who, on the other hand, always feels rushed, like things were left on the cutting room floor and the story is missing important pieces of information.  There's a big difference between reeling someone in to a twist, and just flat-out not telling people things.  

With Sherlock, the twist feels like an integral and important part of the story.  With Doctor Who it feels like the twist is there purely to go ""Ha! I fooled you! I'm so much smarter than you!""  The twist feels like it's used purely to say to the audience ""Don't even try to think about where the story is going, because even if it makes no sense there'll be a twist"".

3. More independent companions, most of the recent companions just follow him and go along with whatever he's doing. A crucial factor in the original series was companions that would run off, get in trouble, disagree with him (and often be right)

4. Read more science. Science fiction comes from pondering science and looking at the wonders of the world around you not psychics and ghosts.

Because most politicians are idealists - they are following a political philosophy whether or not that philosophy actually works in the real world.  

We can prove this by observing what policies work in other countries and comparing them to our own.  For example, the Netherlands has very relaxed drugs policies which have actually reduced the amount of people who take drugs.  This policy also frees up police time so they can focus on other things.  This is an example of a policy that works, yet very few countries have adopted a similar system.

true,ojnoj,null,null,"Warning, possible controversy... Gonna try and steer clear of the obvious ones.

Without getting weighed down by what the repercussions would be for Allen/Hendo/Alberto, I think we need another defensive CM.

In an ideal world, I think Lars Bender of Leverkusen is a realistic option, however as much as big Sami might love Liverpool, I don't think he'd be willing to part with him after losing Schurrle and Carvajal in the same window. Another player who is statistically strong but I know very little about is Ettiene Capoue - a viable option who can't cost too much coming from Toulouse.

Now the controversial topic... Marouanne Fellaini - things I think he offers are height, tenacity and versatility. At the minute we really aren't an aerial threat and can be very vulnerable at set pieces, also winning the ball back from opposition goal kicks was something we struggled to do last season. Putting a big man in the spine of the team would hopefully set this right (something along the lines of the Busquets role). We are trying to play pressing football, Fellaini has proved himself to be an aggressive ball winner (particularly vs arsenal at the emirates last season) and playing deep he shouldn't have any problems with ball retention. Finally he can offer a plan B, after losing Carroll we've really only got one option. Ball on the deck, pass it around, I like to watch it but I fear getting found out at some point. Fellaini can play as the target man too, if need be.

So in a hypothetical situation where he doesn't go to either Man U or arsenal (two teams hes been a game changer against) it's been banded around in the press that he has a £24m release clause. If he would be willing to hop across town and don a red shirt i reckon he'd offer us a few things that we don't have at the moment. Whether this would ever happen, unlikely. Maybe Lucas will come back to form and this will all be obsolete.

Striker wise, I really rate Jackson Martinez, we could have had him a year ago for £8m now he could cost 3 times that at the least which is a bit of a pain in the arse. Similarly priced would be Burak Yilmaz also a goal scorer.

We could replace Suarez with a goal scoring attacking midfielder and put full faith in Sturridge, in which case I suggest Erik Lamela who scored 15 goals in serie A last season. Or alternatively Adem Ljajic who got 15 and 14 assists. However that would leave Aspas and Borini as our only true back up - neither proven yet but I have much higher hopes for Aspas than Borini (who thus far has looked hopeless)

A centre back would be good, if Vermaelen wants out of arsenal it would be worth getting him if Suarez goes that way (unlikely).
Annoyingly I think Chico of Swansea would fit in well but I never want to be linked with them in a transfer window ever again... I'm looking at you Mr Allen. 

Tl:dr - hypothetical targets
Bender/Fellaini/Capoue
Martinez/Yilmaz
Lamela/Ljajic
Vermaelen/Chico

We saw this with the drugs policy a few years ago (re Professor Nutt) and we're seeing it again with this idea of porn censorship and benefits changes.

Take the riots; they reported on them and brought it a variety of experts, political, and judicial statements. You might *assume* therefore they are defending the status quo but the reality is they are just doing their job to report the news. It was a pretty black and white issue, were it not then the contrary experts and evidence would be presented.

Likewise with the royals, they *are* news whether you or I care about it and reporting on it is their duty. The consumer wants to see every second of coverage they can and the BBC provided it. That does not automatically mean they are pro-Royalist, it simply means they are happy to report the news people want.

And like with the riots, were there an alternative point of view to maintain I am confident they would represent it as they often have in the past.

I'm sure I could go to the page for that video, find where it says ""responses to this video"" and link you to it, but you can find that for yourself. What does mindlessly posting video links here add to the conversation?

Linking YouTube videos is intellectually lazy - if you have an opinion then express it. 

We've all seen the CGPGrey video on this subject plenty of times before - that I refer to it and reject it indicates that I don't accept it as ""evidence"". A courteous response would be, for example, to ask me *why*.

YouTube videos are the 21st century version of TV shows - they allow one to present a single perspective, and to ignore any inconvenient points which might interfere with one's own argument. CGPGrey is not obliged to respond to any objections to his opinion piece and, indeed, he does not.

Grey does not, for example, address the moral aspects of the monarchy - that they are a symbol of the inequality which divides our society. It is only this year, a century after women have attained sufferance, and following decades of further feminism, that the issue of [female primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_to_the_Crown_Act_2013) has been addressed. It will be generations, at least, before we have a black ~~ruler~~ king or queen, or one of some other minority ethnicity. This might seem such an obvious statement that you find it laughable but since the royals have no power, what are they but a symbol?

This comment thread, in case you hadn't noticed, belongs to a submission of a *parody* news article, so I don't really see the need for accusations of ""[drinking the Kool-Aid](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1iy3kw/royal_baby_to_be_named_qatar_airways_after/cb9984k)"". I hoped that my use of ""no, plz"" would indicate my light-hearted intent, and the posting of the video was indeed the perfect response to my circlejerk spelling. Despite your own misspelling it doesn't feel like you're in on the joke.

Since you are so lazy, [here's the video response you wanted.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2IO5ifWKdw) I hope that, having accused me of refusing to listen to video ""evidence"", you'll spend the 10 minutes to watch it in its entirety. The presenter of that video doesn't have quite the same confident voiceover manner as Grey, and I feel his use of the Louvre is flawed, but he does show that Grey's whole video is based on faulty maths.

A fantasy universe has rules, just as the real one does. The difference is that while everyone knows what's possible or not in the real world, in a fantasy setting those rules and boundaries need to be explained to the viewer, especially if they're important to the story. If you don't explain the new rules to the viewer then they'll assume they're the same as in the real world.

You're writing a story, it's near the end and the Doctor has got himself into a pickle. Everyone is on the edge of their seat wondering 'how is the Doctor going to get out of this one?' The lazy solution is to just invent something new that had never come up before. A button that resets the universe! This is science fiction, anything is possible! The problem though is you're moving the goal posts. You're breaking the rules of the universe you invented. You never said that magic buttons that reset the universe *weren't* possible, but you never said they were either so the viewer will have assumed they weren't. After all, I'm pretty sure there are no such magic buttons in the real world. The viewer feels cheated. They expected the universe to function one way and it turns out it worked another. What's more, you've just destroyed all the tension in your story. If one rule can be broken why not all of them? What's to stop the Doctor spontaneously turning into a 12ft pink armadillo?

The information given to the audience was that it was a fixed point in time that the Doctor should die at Lake Silencio at that particular time, and Canton's line about ""that truly is the Doctor, and he truly is dead"" or something to that effect, after Amy theorises the dead Doctor could be a clone or a duplicate or something.

Now I appreciate both of these were explainable within the confines of the Doctor's universe - it turns out the fixed point was River shooting him, not him dying, and Canton gave Amy that information because he simply didn't know any better/he'd possibly been told to, BUT I have to say if that sort of information comes up in a show surrounding a big issue like the Doctor's death, I sort of expect that it should be true unless something comes up that points it out as suspicious. I expected it to be a narrative device to give the audience enough info to start trying to figure it all out whilst having some of the easiest solutions ruled out. I spent *months* trying to work out how the Doctor could die at Lake Silencio and still carry on living, keeping in mind that the rules of the game I'd been given (or thought I'd been given) said he could not be a clone or a duplicate. Then of course, it turns out the Doctor doesn't at all die at Lake Silencio, and he was a duplicate.

That was a very annoying ending for me because I felt like they'd gone back on their own rules. The breaking of unbreakable laws within the story's universe does go on, and that's definitely annoying, but it's not just confined to that - I think the real thing that annoys me about Moffat's writing (especially as opposed to RTD's) is that he gives the audience an unbreakable law then goes directly against it. It takes the fun out of figuring out the clues because you know any of the clues might actually be outright lies.

Sorry that's this has been long and probably hasn't made much sense. I'm ill and I've not put this concept into words before so I'm fumbling a bit. I'm putting this as a reply to you because I felt like it linked with your ""It's insulting to me to have the resolution of an episode be the ONE thing they spent all episode establishing wasn't possible."" - I think that's the issue with a lot of the mysteries and why Doctor Who differs from Sherlock. Sherlock gives you clues to work out, Doctor Who gives you rules of how the dilemma could resolve and then rides roughshod over any clues you've been given about the storyline, and that just strikes me as unfair to the audience and just basically a bad way to build up a mystery.",0,1374761842,null,0,1374762046,0,cb9zndb,t3_1izy2r,t1_cb9zndb,t1_cb9yye4,null,1430341191,37,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,37

Totally a cop-out, because the audience wasn't looking for the supernatural answer, since there's no reason to expect it.

All speculative fiction, regardless of how hard or soft, relies on an initial suspension of disbelief.  In Harry Potter, I accept that magic is real, and I learn the rules of magic along the way.  In Firefly, I accept that my heroes are space pirates in another solar system reminiscent of post Civil War America.  This suspension, no matter how absurd or extreme, is the state of mind I will be in throughout the rest of that piece, and anything within that context I will accept.

If you post the company name I'll see what contact information I can dig up.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;the point is what tips them over the edge. 

If in a trench, and someone throws in a grenade, the situation might make a martyr out of someone.  Few would describe the action insane, such things would fall in as a selfless sacrifice.  There comes a point when someone does such an action needlessly, that it would start to suggest they aren't sane.  There is a point where someone is oppressed to the point that something pops.  There are those who are pawns used by others in games (Duc).

Try an analogy, someone is like a fuse.  Too much current and pop, they blow.  I would suggest that moving should be within anyone's tolerances, to compare it with the systematic assault on your people and your religion is incredibly out of comparison and either shows a shocking lack of understanding regarding the result of uncle Ho's political culling and the vacuum resulting in the crumbling French power system.  Atrocities were common, I've met people who claim that period was worse than during the American war.

&gt; So no I am not comparing but I am saying £20 is a massive deal for some people.

I am not dismissing it, I am saying it might result in tipping people over the edge in to having a house share.  As a Londoner, flat-sharing is the norm for anyone who isn't comfortably off, so yes I'll be honest, I am not remotely sympathetic.  But to say it's about dismissing the money is wrong.  I am suggesting that such upheaval is life.

&gt;You act as though this is the only person who has self harmed because of the bedroom tax. There have been successful and unsuccessful attempts at suicides. No doubt you will say symptom not cause there too so what about the 48% increase in calls to the Samaritans directly because of the bedroom tax? 

I wouldn't trust any source that classifies a benefits reduction as a tax for any figures.  Sorry this might sound pedantic but as the saying in computer science goes, there are only two hard problems, cache invalidation and naming things.  When doing any statistical analysis the last point is incredibly true, you do not pick numbers that suit your point of view.  You have a method which is as rigorously balanced as possible which produces numbers on which your views should be formed.  Doing it the other way round isn't good.

&gt;the fact is we should be helping people who have mental health problems not adding to their grief by firstly calling them layabouts, and then quite literally taking what little money they have away from them.

For a start off, no money is being taken away from them, it is a reduction in money they are given.  If people view that incorrectly it is no wonder they will feel let down.  All people will have their income change in their lifetimes, most people it will happen very frequently.  If we have a system which fails to provide help for people to live ordinary lives, that is the problem.  Not reducing a benefit, which often provides more luxury than those who work can afford (see gumtree for London to get an idea how bad housing here is).

If you attack the problem from the symptom end, you'd have to remove any kind of stress that someone might suffer.  My tube was incredibly delayed and I'm not well enough to cycle.  25mins in heat with little air, people were stressed and being sick, at least one person I saw fainted and had to have a sit down and some water (they might have been faking to get a seat).  My point is we can't eliminate stress.  It's unrealistic to think we can.  We should have services in place to help people coupe.  If it's not the benefit changes, it would be something else.

&gt;A suicide or attempt at one isn't the act of someone who is crazy

I wouldn't use the word crazy, but it is clearly considered someone who isn't sane.  Unless they have something to gain (protection of family member etc).

What has driven them to that point might be legitimate life things ('love') or things which ultimately shouldn't be present (child abuse rates and suicide for instance).",0,1374763797,null,0,false,0,cba0bda,t3_1j0nu0,t1_cba0bda,t1_cb9ztu8,null,1430340876,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

I was about to dismiss this, when I realised that if you're working two jobs, you're probably not able to watch your kids constantly.

If you're earning minimum wage and you're pleased to have the opportunity to work 50 hours this week, because that'll save you having to worry about the electricity bill getting paid, then you're probably very glad if someone else will take the kids off your hands.

If the kids have their heads stuck in their laptops then you're probably just glad they're quiet, if you don't know what 4chan is.

This is a whole different situation than that of a two parent family in which dad earns enough that mum can be home (working part time or not at all) when the kids come home from school.

I'm not saying this to argue in favour of the porn filter, because I don't have all the answers. I'm certainly not a parenting expert myself, but I've done PC repair work for at least hundreds of people and a very large number of 11 year old kids have their own laptop these days and I would say that at least 50% of parents don't know or care what their kids look at on the net. And I am not speaking of families in social housing here - the parents that I have done work for could afford £50 an hour for PC repairs. I've only ever had one request to install a porn filter.

I don't think I will try an analogy, you have enough of those for everyone it seems. I'd rather stick to the facts of the matter. Your attitude it ""I have to house share, why shouldn't everyone"" - you also mentioned abuse and this is how cycles of abuse a occur. Everyone can't houseshare. You're talking about perhaps unemployed yes but also the disabled and/or mentally ill who need specialist accomodation and very, very sympathetic co-habitants. 

Being pedantic on the further details re: reduction / tax etc is childish and straight out of the mouth of IDS and his manipulative tactical playbook. The point is people have less than they did before and it results in further problems for all concerned - not least in the amount of money it will cost to rehouse people. 

Benefits do not provide ""luxury"" in any sense of the word. If some people's wages are too low then you raise wages, you don't cut benefits. 

It's clear you see people on benefits as moaning scroungers and I hope for your sake you never end up needing the welfare state you so wish to destroy to come to your aid.

true,JB_UK,null,null,"&gt; My parents lived in London before I was born, and it was always the way that you needed to commute into it if you were a normal person. It's no different now.

No, it has always been like that to some extent, but nothing like to the extent that it is now. My parents used to live in North London on a single middling professional salary (the equivalent of about £30k a year now). If they were to go back and buy the same house now, it would cost £2 million pounds, 60 years at the same wage level. It has always been more expensive in London, but not out of the reach of the majority of the population.

I'd be interested to know why you think the problem is corruption, what are you referring to? I would say the problems are two-fold:

* Lack of supply - We should be looking to build more houses, and probably looking at construction of new garden cities around the periphery of London, and we can also redevelop some areas within London, although fundamentally supply is an inherent limitation.

* The treatment of London housing as if it is just another internationally traded liquid asset, and a legitimate target for speculation. The pumping up of London house prices is of no more benefit to people living in London or Britain than was the pumping up of the Swiss currency a year or two back, because of its safe haven status. The Swiss currency is not just something for people to invest into, it is an instrument for exchange of goods, and a spike or collapse in value because of herd movement wreaks havoc on the people who actually live in Switzerland, and use the currency for its central purpose. London housing must first and foremost serve its central purpose, a place for people to live, not purely an investment.",0,1374765064,null,0,1374765374,0,cba0rrx,t3_1j0l6o,t1_cba0rrx,t1_cb9ywe8,null,1430340590,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Most of the women don't have real flaws- or their flaw has to do with men. Rose was flirtatious and cheaty (poor poor mickey), Martha was *obsessed* with the doctors love, Amy cheated on Rory. I found Donna was the most real of all characters, but she was still often 'ditsy' in the stereotypical girlish way (ignorant, not understanding what's going on, clothes focused)

I stopped watching doctor who because I just found myself unable to enjoy it any more :(. I watched two episodes with Clara and then just stopped. I literally told my boyfriend, who watches it with me, ""I just can't relate to anyone on this show anymore""

And then there's the topic that, since Doctor Who lacks any focus on characters anymore, it pumps all it's time into action and story. But, I'm sorry, am I the only one around here who *doesn't* want to know about the doctors past, or name or whatever? I like it when he's mysterious, and I loved watching doctor who for the day-to-day adventures! Where's he going to go next, who's he going to meet? 

Now it doesn't feel like that anymore, it feels like everything is attached to this long, complicated story and it doesn't have any laws or rules so it could go anywhere. I'm constantly looking at symbols and hints and going ""what does that mean? This doesn't make sense, how is that possible? Did they explain it already and I missed it, or are they going to later?"" It's exhausting.

Remember when they watched the sun explode? Went back in time and fought a werewolf? When the doctors body got adopted by that skin-person? Or when they accidentally caused a paradox? All of those episodes had references to the final plot, but they didn't *make up* the plot.

The point I am making is that if you want to support people with mental health problems you have to look at the benifits system as that is where you will find many of them, thus the bedroom tax hits those with mental heath problems hard. 

For many with mental health problems their home is an essental part of their care, it is a place of safety (hopefully) where they can act a little nuts if they want (and I include myself in this) it provides a pressure value and a place to get away from the world for many. Thus a personnel space can be a significant factor in the support of people with mental health problems, it gives a measure of control.

So part of the support for a person with mental heatlh problems may well be a place of safety, I do not disagree that the mental health support is insufficient within the UK but part of that support is the benifits system and the disproportionate way we treat those with mental health conditions in comparison to physical health conditions.

The biopsychosocial model has been used within health care for almost forty years now yet we still neglect to fully consider how financial limitations may adversly  affect those with any infirmity let alone those with mental health problems.
 
I must aplogise for any offence, as a person that has long term mental health problems that is facing eviction dispite being a really nice, hard working and very smart guy I do take things like this a little to heart.

So I consider that part of the issue of supporting those with mental health problems is ensuring they have a place of safety, their home, many people have issues with those that have a physical disability being charged extra as their home has been adapted for their needs but little recognition is given to those with mental heatlh needs.

He had an emergency and had to pay out several hundred pounds after he took a wonga loan. He tried to renegotiate with Wonga but their terms were utterly unreasonable . Come payday, and despite telling them he would pretty much be starving otherwise they took all his money out. The banks said they were unable to stop Wonga because of some automatic payment scheme. There's no way a regular bank offering an overdraft or loan could pull off stunts like this-- there's way too much regulation in place. These are not the actions of a responsible lender. 

I'm not saying PDL companies shouldn't exist, but there ought to be more regulation in place. They should not be able to walk into your bank account and take out whatever the hell they want. If you choose to default rather than pay them back then that should be your choice. After all, that is the risk Wonga took when they offered you the money. If they want to take you to court over it then that's fine. But being able to raid helpless people's bank accounts for whatever amount they want is fucking insane.

&gt; Your attitude it ""I have to house share, why shouldn't everyone""

Well what's wrong with that.  If I'm a tax payer, but not can get as good a quality of life as someone who isn't, there is a shocking injustice.  If we have a freemarket for labour with pricing accordingly that suggests that the tax burden is too high or the benefits are out of line with reality for many tax payers.  If that is the case we either need universal benefits or to you know address our housing shortage.  But the older people don't like that one.

&gt;You're talking about perhaps unemployed yes but also the disabled and/or mentally ill who need specialist accomodation and very, very sympathetic co-habitants.

So lets look at solving that!

&gt; Being pedantic on the further details re: reduction / tax etc is childish

No it's not.  A tax is money taken, by force, from someone who is earning money, because of services they get from society, or rather what society deems them to owe.  A benefit is society giving something to someone because society deems they need it.  It isn't childish, it's a very important political point.  This isn't the whole technical correctness is best correctness.  One is just outright wrong and misleading.  Taxes are taking away things that are yours, Benefits are giving you things that aren't.  If you suggest that not-calling it a tax is propaganda I'd suggest you should think about which side is using words in a dishonest manner for political points.  Hint benefit reduction is technically correct.

&gt;Benefits do not provide ""luxury"" in any sense of the word. If some people's wages are too low then you raise wages, you don't cut benefits.

So lets put Mr lucky Graddy he's 25 and on £24k a year in London.  That's £1,500 a month after taxes and SLC, he will be expected to work longer hours than those married folk.  He gets no benefits.  Travel card and its £170pcm for 1-4 zones, lets have a quick shifty on GumTree the cheapest 1 bed is about £800pcm out there, but still has electricity and gas £70 and c tax single person occupancy is about £80.  Now graddy is earning £100 p/w, JSA would give him about £67.50 a week.  He wouldn't have to live some place so expensive.  So in reality he'd go for a house share at £500pcm all inc, and have a nice disposable income.  This is why so many people live together.

If we are going to solve the accommodation problem (ie rising costs) I'd respectfully suggest we solve it for the people who are working first, rather than those who are economically inactive, as the investment might lead to more people working in such scenarios.

&gt;I hope for your sake you never end up needing the welfare state you so wish to destroy to come to your aid. 

I don't kid myself, I know it won't.  I'm responsible with my money (ie save it, and get taxed and deflated for doing so) whilst having insurance, so yeah I know it won't come to my aid.

I don't really take a stance on this but a lot of Star Trek fans would bring out the pitchforks if they heard you label Star Wars as sci-fi. It's generally considered space fantasy fiction for mostly the same reasons why Doctor Who isn't hard sci-fi (though it obviously has scifi elements).

true,HungryBook,cnty-uk,Insaniquarium,"I'm a Unite staffer, so potentially biased here ;) I have also been a representative for Amicus and then Unite in the finance sector.

As a student, the NUS can represent you in academic situations, but can only provide limited assistance regaridng the world of work. Unite (and other general workers unions like GMB, USDAW, etc.) can provide you with support and advice for a monthly subscription. One thing that's very important to know - if you're currently in dispute and not a member and then join a union, we'll only be able to give you limited support like telephone advice; we won't send an officer \ rep to represent you. That would be like crashing your car, and THEN buying insurance... In addition, some legal support can only be given after a minimum period of membership; in Unite this is currently 4 weeks - it used to be 13.

Employee forums can be useful - but at the end of the day, they are maintained and run by the company, working on the company line. Yes, you might get some great feedback about replacing toilet rolls, but you can expect very little to be done about serious claims such as pay or unfair rotas, since at the end of the day, the company is basically talking to itself, and generally what management wants, management will get.  Of course, good workplaces recognise that treating an employee forum like this is bloody stupid - but that doesn't stop 'em...

Most people think a union is there to 'get you out of trouble'. Or, actually, cause trouble for no good reason.  Nope.  In its basic sense, a union acts as a third party, to ensure that your company is following its procedures correctly and properly, and that you, as a contracted worker are being treated as an equal in that contract - i.e. your labour for fair pay and a safe working environment. Unions also work as collectives; it's easier to ignore something when there's one person asking, but when you have many more in the workforce - or even OUTSIDE your workforce when a union has over a million and a half members - things tend to get more visible.

The comment about 'not recognisng' - well, that doesn't matter, you can still be part of a union individually (and receive representation and support from officials if you need assistance regarding your company's policies.) Unions can only negotiate directly with the company for terms, conditions and pay situations if they are recognised, which means that there is a number of members there, and they have applied to the company for voluntary recognition - or through a body called CAC (yeah, I know) for statutory recognition.

I have encountered some outsourcing, agency and overseas companies suggest that people can't join a union when they work for them, because their head office is based in America, or that 'they aren't full time workers so they can't be in a union' - no, this is just silliness. We're in the UK, so you can be in a union if you choose to be, end of.

Political fund is the hot potato of Unite. Members are placed in the political fund on application, but you can immediately apply to drop out of it if you require. However it is a fiction about being labour party members - all members ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY SIGNED UP TO THE LABOUR PARTY.

The 70p political fund goes to campaigning for political reasons (from pension campaigns through to national actions), and the union DOES give some of this money to the Labour party. Unfortunately in Unite, we cannot separate this, so you either support our political actions AND Labour, or you just duck out of the fund totally, and don't support any political actions or parties - easily done, but it could be easier. 

However, it'll be a moot point, because at (insert future time) this money will no longer go to the Labour Party. Other unions have similar set ups, and I think it's Unison that actually have the two funds; one for 'just political' and one for 'political and labour party'.
Members can join the Labour Party separately, but you have to fill in a specific form to do this, and it's clearly signposted as to what you are doing - I filled one of those forms in for myself, so it's not possible for people to be signed up automatically; I knew exactly what I was doing. (And as the police have just noted, there is no crime to answer for, so it doesn't look like people were being joined up without their knowledge. If that was happening - well, that would be fraud, and the people responsible should be dealt with.)

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"I don't believe the 85m price tag thrown around, that was likely a tactic from RM to scare off other clubs. For example, if spurs wanted to sign Bernard next season, we could have Levy chat to the media about being willing to spend £40m on the player. This would drive the price up and Arsenal/Waxtap/Porto would be scared off, ripe for the picking next season when we are in a more enviable position (his contract is one year older and he likely hasn't had a season as good as his last, dropping value)

Granted that, I think we would probably get about £50m for Bale today and that just isn't worth it. Right now spurs brand is flying high in times square, on the cover of FIFA and on every BT add on the telly. The player hit 1,000,000 twitter followers today, over double that of SpursOfficial. Furthermore, his name helps the club retain key men like AVB, and sign news ones like Paulinho. The problem the arse are having right now is that it is very hard to sign a big name when you have none, but once you have one others are more likely to follow. 

On top of that, what do we gain from flogging him off now? £50m or so. We then have a void to fill and grab a few more players to bring the side back up to scratch. Problem is we look far less attractive and clubs know we have coin which will mean prices increase, Liverpool after Torres anyone? So we sell him for £50m, buyout Soldado for £25m and Bernard for £20m, probably can't afford Coentrao and so stash the rest of the money. Is that team any better than what we have now? Not really, footballing wise it is a sideways move and business wise we just lost our best asset.

When this goverment came in they changed the questions asked by ATOS by removing many that related to mental health issue, thus many people that have real life long needs are now considered fit for work and no longer receive any form of disability benefits fit just JSA.

Unfortunately people don't relate to statistics, most in relation to disability issues are freely avalible and do not support goverment policy. [The office for National Statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html) is always worth a read but can also be misleading, for example I have an issue with the employment figures. 

If we consider two people Jill and James, now Jill and James work 40 hours a week at a local factory but it gets shut down and they loose their jobs. They both sign on for JSA and are included in the figures for people unemployed and claiming benifits, a few weeks later they both get jobs but at only 20 hours a week. 

So they no longer receive JSA and are no longer considered unemployed, but this is not a neutral act. They have between them lost 40 hours work a week, so you can consider that one job has been lost never to be replaced. But the statics state that in this case two jobs where lost and two jobs were gained.

I'd like to see unemplyment figures based on hours worked as over the last few years part time work has become far more common and has a deep effect on us all.

Secondly statistics take time to collect and analyse and can be prone to manipulation, I like the fact the [UK Statistics Authority](http://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/) has the freedom to call out IDS for using misleading statistics but it happy to infrequently ",0,1374769851,null,0,false,0,cba2om3,t3_1j0nu0,t1_cba2om3,t1_cba1p2m,null,1430339689,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

OP provides some information that establishes a precedent for how FSG/Henry/Werner tend to handle player deals with other rival teams for the Red Sox.

Up until a couple of years ago Baltimore was meaningless and Toronto hasn't really been a huge player at all (plus the deals made tended to work out better for Boston).

What OP is trying to say is that based off of their track record dealing with rival teams i nthe MLB, Henry and Werner probably don't even want to give Arsenal the time of day.  They're not about to strengthen our direct competition, as shown by their refusal to do so in the past.

So, what type of club would secure the best naming rights? One with a world class superstar player who has his face on everything, or one with all else equal, but no marketable star player? The answer is obvious. With Bale at the club the quest for stadium sponsors will certainly be more fruitful compared to if he took off. When  you consider that naming rights pay for the majority of the stadium, it seems clear that securing them is more important than banking a couple of quid.

Sherlock can't, for example, disappear up his own timestream or switch the universe off and on again. That would be too far. 

But In Doctor Who, some writers think that its broad canvas gives them the freedom to pull outrageous plot maneuvers, and that they'll get away with it out of sheer epic-ness. I'd argue that Moffatt, in his weaker moments, is one of these. To me, Doctor Who is at it's best when the epic stuff is just a background, or a setup to a situation and the real story is a small, personal one. Russell T. Davies, when he's on form, is really good at this. Like David Tennant's last episode - the whole ""He will knock four times"" thing is set up as this huge epic showdown between the Time Lords, but in the end it's just Wilf in a box. That to me is a good bait-and-switch.

Not to say that Moffatt isn't good at it, too - the ending of The Girl In The Fireplace, for example.

Because that would mean he wouldn't be entitled to loyalty bonuses, and Liverpool would reject it unless the offer was sufficient. I suspect when he does leave this summer (and unfortunately I think he will) he'll have to submit one. There is no deadline for transfer requests.

When Torres and Alonso left, were there direct statements about their intent? Not until the club forced them to submit transfer requests, no. There's been a lot more statements about Suarez's intent than either of those. I guess you're one of those wierdos who thinks nothing is true unless there's the involved player or club publicly makes a quote about it. Even though Suarez has spoken publicly about wanting to leave several times this summer. Odd.

How so? His 'release clause' (as far as we know and hopefully) was either badly misunderstood or misrepresented by his advisers (to Arsenal).  We have him on contract and he boxed himself in initially by claiming he wanted out of England due to the media.  He still can play the transfer request card, but it would look really bad for him (he may not care so this could be overstated) and he is going to lose some payouts for his loyalty contract clause.  I may be forgetting something, but i don't really see what cards he is holding (besides an ability to make LFC a very confused and frustrated club for some time).

I agree with /u/smaclver that it really seems to be beyond ""speculation at this point"" that he wants out (i am far less certain he wants Arsenal, but it does seem to be leaning that way). But, i also see your side as Suarez has been vague and not openly stated his desire to join Arsenal (as far as i know).

1. He is an extremely hard working player as well as being extremely passionate for the club. Those two aspects go a long ways in generating fan support.

2. His age at 23. Every supporter of every club is going to think that the young guys will pan out. Podpool (I would have taged podpool but i seriously still don't know how to do that) hints at that with Shelvey. You can look at Suso now or even how Spearing was viewed like 3 years ago. Everyone has ultimate faith in the young guys panning out.

3. The price tag that you have mentioned. Surely for what we paid to get the player and what we are paying him he must be of quality. 

Really if you break down what you posted the answers for his support are there. The age/price/England Captain/.

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"&gt;But In Doctor Who, some writers think that its broad canvas gives them the freedom to pull outrageous plot maneuvers, and that they'll get away with it out of sheer epic-ness.

Deus ex machina. It's rather prevalent in fantasy fiction in general. Not easy to avoid it. After all, everything in the Whoverse operates so far outside the boundaries of known science that any explanation simply becomes a hand-waving, outlandish Time Lord trickery. This is basically why I don't consider Doctor Who to be sci-fi.

Personally I think RTD was far more guilty of resorting to this mechanism than Moffat is. Moffat actually makes an effort some of the time. RTD was just *lazy*.

Either way though, I honestly don't have that high of an expectation from Doctor Who when it comes to clever plots. Never have. Most of the UK sees it as a casual family show, and since BBC is a British TV channel, they naturally cater to the casual crowd. Moffat has proven himself capable of writing some very clever stuff, but he probably has to ""dumb down"" some of it when writing Doctor Who because of the restrictions of the show. He can't get too dark, he can't get too smart, he can't get too complex. Things have to be a bit in-your-face because we, the Whovians in this subreddit, are the minority and most everyone doesn't spend the week after each episode analyzing every second of footage.",0,1374774944,null,0,false,0,cba4vys,t3_1izy2r,t1_cba4vys,t1_cba4g49,null,1430338650,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

* Zimiti (Cambridge, UK),  develops innovative safety and security applications for customers that need to exchange information securely and wirelessly between small devices over ranges of up to 1km
* **OmniPerception** (Guildford, UK),  provides world-leading face biometrics, computer vision and video analytic security and identification solutions

Diminished responsibility can get a different sentence to pleading guilty, but it's not a defense- as far as I know you can't ever just walk free after it.

The bottom line is that crime isn't ok. Whether you're doing it because of a process in your brain that tells you that everyone else is a lizard person, or whether you're doing it because of a decision in your brain that tells you the reward for stealing a tv outweighs the risk of being caught. Should people with identifiable, treatable mental illness be treated for it? sure. Does that mean they should escape any kind of retribution though?

&gt;but you might be viewed as morally responsible for the death by those around you, and rightly so.

I believe it is an insult to the humanity to label a group of people as special from the time before they are born, to the time after they die. This insult is even more pronounced when it happens in a developed country.

It is fine to treat some people as special, because they are successful businessmen, scientist or politician. But it makes me uncomfortable to think that there are senior people who are as old as the queen, have worked hard all their life, and will be in fuel poverty this winter, just because they did not win the 'sperm lottery' that the queen won a few decades ago.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Two things first: 1) his fee and wage are not his fault and thus should have no bearing on his talent, and 2) no one here thinks he's one of the best in the world in his age group.

Here are the reasons I rate him:

* He is young, energetic, quick, and physically strong.  In short, he has the physical tools.

* He has good technical ability--he can hit a shot, he can pick a pass, and he can play the ball quickly and first time.

* He is versatile and can play anywhere in CM, can put a shift in out wide as part of a fluid midfield (though I wouldn't recommend it outside of an emergency scenario), and he even had one or two very gutsy performances when forced to play fullback.

* Lastly, and most important for me (when coupled with above), he fulfills a role we have not consistently had at the club for a while, and one that is very important for the top clubs--a box-to-box midfielder.  We've not really ever replaced young Gerrard as a box-to-box dynamo.  That role can be so valuable to a club, as they help with the offensive load and get goals and also help defensively and shield the back 4.  It is the hardest type of player to find and I think Henderson can fill that role.  

* Related to above, I also think this type of player can be even more important in BR's setup since you can rely on your top talent to take up the main attacking as long as you have players around them who can work hard, win the ball back and keep it.  Henderson, like Joe Allen, can be very valuable to the club solely by tracking back, keeping the ball, and making supporting runs into the opponents box.  He doesn't need to unlock defenses via pass or dribble--we can let Coutinho, Sturridge, Suarez (plz), and our fullbacks and wingers do that.

Now, a lot of the captain talk comes from his record of captaining the U21s and his tendency to play well on that international stage.  He is also another player like Lucas who took a lot of flack and hasn't let it affect his work rate or improving his performances.",0,1374777208,null,0,false,0,cba5v8c,t3_1j1g9s,t1_cba5v8c,t3_1j1g9s,null,1430338188,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

This is all pure speculation. We don't even know how much LFC want, Rodgers mentioned Cavani ONCE at £55m and now everyone says £45-50m???? Cavani was £55m to someone who wasn't a domestic rival, PSG. For all we know LFC might be holding out for £60m. FSG aren't mugs, I still rate it as 50/50 at absolute BEST. We still don't even know if the club will accept a transfer request, let alone lower his price respectively.

The Independent is a reliable source but the media have been bollocks with this story the whole way through, sensationalising it and making it sound imminent etc. No one has any idea, for all we know Arsenal may have no intention of spending more than £40m, game over.

I'm not just saying this because I'm naive and want him to stay but truth is we have no idea, I'm sick of it being plastered everywhere that this deal is definitely happening.

Honestly if I had to say I reckon FSG might be holding out for about £60m as a round figure for a domestic rival, they have been very clear their position that they don't want to sell him. They have his contract on their side and seem confident he will still play for us if push comes to shove. That's just my opinion but it is as valid and likely as any one of the other 100 floating around being touted as the truth right now!

I'm afraid a US passport is pretty shitty when it comes to getting into the UK, quite a lot of countries can come here on a 2 year working holiday VISA, but as far as I'm aware the USA doesn't have any arrangement like that.

My advice would be to either pick another country that provides more opportunities to US citizens or to come here for a holiday!

He's one of my few heroes, simply based on his musical legacy. However, the guy is seriously fucked in the head. He leaked his own album for free, the day before it was released, due to an argument with his label. In 2010 after another argument with his label, he leaked 2 years worth of work, 10 albums worth of work, over two hundred songs, all for free, completely destroying the chance of any album being released for that label. He's famous for not turning up to his own video shoots, or anywhere for that matter. Back in the day he became addicted to RWD magazine forums and would often get into trivial arguments with teenagers, resulting in some extremely quotable retorts, my favourite being, ""you're Nan is a lorry driver!"".

He's not all there. I think he may actually have genuine psychological problems. He's his own worst enemy, and if he was a bit more professional he would have made mainstream money sooner and for longer. But to those familiar with him, you just gotta sit back and laugh really, he's a lunatic and makes for great car crash entertainment, outside of the actual music that is. To the uninitiated his behaviour will be quite shocking. He's a massive prima donna. Loads of pop fans get stung by this. Any grime can will tell you to be wary of going to see Wiley anywhere, as there's a good chance he's about to throw a tantrum and Fuck it off.


People genuinely mocking his talent and music are mad though. I worked it out roughly once, he's actually written more lyrics than I've had hot dinners. Launched a dozen other artists careers.

The problem is, the doctor lies. When he's not lying, he doesn't know everything. In fact the Laws of Time were just that, LAWS that were enforced, not direct laws. The Doctor thought they were just laws of the universe, and some are, some weren't, and he suspects none are.

It's annoying yes, but Impossible Astronaut and that season was one of my favorites. The Silence were great. The Doctor did die, they he changed it. The religious order is still around even up to current time line, and see what The Doctor is doing will destroy the universe. He's already did it once by changing a ""fixed"" point in time, he can do it again. He does not want to die, will do anything to save himself.

Like The Doctor said before. He's a Coward any day, and you shouldn't respect him for that. He's more human then most of the human characters in that respect. He's visited his grave before, and people are flipping out about him visiting it this time. Albiet he averted his death before so his grave changed locations.

It's all really complicated, but The Doctor knew he was going to die, so he died. Set up the events for everyone to see him die, because he knew it was a fixed point in time. In doing that, it was enough to upset the Fixed Point in Time to nudge it JUSTTTTT enough so it was changed to a fixed point in shooting the doctor, but not his death, thus he could avert it using the tessalecta. It might be bullshit, most of these episodes are. I love the bullshit though, sometimes finding the clues which in fact those episodes did reveal clues on to what would happen, just not exactly how.

It's a show about time travel, in that sense no clues should really tell you the ending because they are changing the ending. They showed you the ending, then they changed it. The clues are what and HOW they may change the future, or the past, not exactly how.

All this malarkey about certain players not being  top 4 quality is frustrating as well.

Instead what they're gonna do is close off 2 of the roads that currently connecting there, and then remove the roundabout entirely - leaving a few sets of traffic lights in it's place.

So Gerrard does not play that role. He's a Deep Lying Playmaker. 

Its just the way our roster works out right now that we probably could not play Allen and Gerrard together, because they simply don't have the legs. Johnson and Enrique get forward often, leaving us exposed at the back. Both Gerrard and Allen, for all the tactical work done with them, have a tendency to push a little too much forward. 

Allen is certainly defensively capable, but he is different than Lucas. Allen reads the game well and gets lots of interceptions. His tackles most often come when a player is already under pressure from another of our players, and he knocks the ball loose. 

Our form last year demonstrated that, to compliment Gerrard - who is our one midfield guarantee right now - we need a smasher and a runner. Lucas smashes and Hendo does the running.

Honestly, even against awful opposition in the cups we demonstrated this need. Allen gets pushed around far too easily. So Lucas is a must. And right now Hendo really is a must. Rodgers may not start the season knowing this, but every match last year where he started with a CAM instead of a CM (meaning mostly when Hendo didn't start in the second half of the season) we got shown out in the first half and put it right in the second with a switch.

Anyways, long story short. We have one pure CDM right now. The others cannot do the job anywhere near adequately to be a stopgap in the case of a Lucas injury. We need another pure CDM and if Rodgers doesn't see it I really hope we don't pay for it because Lucas' fitness problems.

My prediction is that Suarez is here for another year with Arsenal refusing to meet our valuation. I reckon Suarez may hand in a transfer request but I expect it to not alter LFCs position too much in terms of price, they already know he wants out.

I was out the other night with a friend playing [Ingress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(game\)) in my local town.

It was about 10pm, and we were standing around playing with our phones when this young woman walked past, cheap beer in hand, and asked us for £1. She had the look of someone who wasn't doing that well in their life.

I gave her £1 and then I asked her ""What do you need it for?"".

She said that she needed to buy a ""ticket to go to Leicester to go see her Mum"". I've lived in plenty of dodgy areas and buying a train/bus ticket to see your mother is a really common reason. 

Then she started talking to us and asked us if we ""would like something"". I said, ""no"". But she persisted in asking us if we wanted *something*.

Eventually I looked at her squarely and said, ""Are you offering drugs or sex?""

""Sex.""

""No, thanks, I'm OK.""

""But I just need another £5. Can you help us out?""


She kept asking for the £5 until we got her to leave us alone.


Later that evening my friend and I went to the chippy. We ordered our chips but when I went to pay I was £1 short. I turned to my friend and said, ""Sorry, you'll have to pay for this because I gave my last £1 to a crack whore who wanted to suck my dick for a fiver. You know I'm telling the truth.""

I never said that it wasn't discrimination - in fact I actively said that it was.

What I stated was that it was not specifically a *hate crime*, because it's not.

But hey, let the OP waste his money. I guarantee you that he will be laughed out of the court, that's if the CPS are even willing to entertain the possibility of:

a) It being in the public interest to prosecute (*possibly*)
b) There being sufficient evidence to secure a prosecution (not a hope in hell)

You need to get an [NI number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number), that will track all your taxes and what not so you'll need that before you get a job, also if you do need to claim benefits or anything, it goes though that, you'll have to go to an 'interview' but as you have a UK passport this will be a complete formality, you'll walk away with a number. 

As for medical care, if you want to go to a doctor, you go to the doctor and register. You're covered for everything medical as soon as you step off the plane (its separate from the NI stuff). You'll probably want to visit as surgery pretty early on as they might want to give you a check up/ask about you history etc. and its probably best to get the out of the way. I would see this as a secondary thing to do though, unless you have an ongoing medical condition. I move around a fair bit so I'm never registered, I just use drop in clinics or register as I need to, they just ask your address and then its good to go, its all free except prescriptions which are £7, unless you live in Scotland, in which case they're free too.

Dentists are separate, and you have to pay, search for an NHS dentist [here](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Dentist/LocationSearch/3), prices are set, and they are [here](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1781.aspx?CategoryID=74).

You need a bank account, so you walk into any bank and get one, that'll take 20 minutes or so, once you get your NI number tell them that and then they will tax your interest (brilliant!).

If/when you get a car you can convert your US drivers license into a UK one by using [this website](https://www.gov.uk/exchange-a-foreign-driving-licence).

In response to conspiracies [Hanlon's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor ) is often quoted: 

&gt; Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

But I'd like to suggest an alternative:

&gt; Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by feedback between [interlinked systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)

Take an ant colony as an analogy: if it was organised in a top-down fashion with the queen running everything (equivalent to the traditional ""Dr. Evil"" or ""Dick Cheney"" style conspiracy) it would require the queen to have total knowledge of the the entire colonies operations and require vast complexity.  In the real world, however, an ant colony is run largely through feedback between the individual systems (ants), for instance: food is found because of [systematic feedback embodied in time decaying chemical signals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN0M49iqFRc) (this is the equivalent of a *cybernetic conspiracy* where no individual participant has overall control but the emergent result - the analogous ""colony"" - operates as if someone did; the conspiratard equivalent of Richard Dawkin's [blind watchmaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Watchmaker).

Or (as a more relevant example) take these three systems:

* The segment of the media that uses outrage to drive eye balls to advertisers (The Daily Mail, Russia Today, Fox News etc...)
* The network of populist politicians increasingly in positions of power (Blair, Boris, Cameron, Millipede etc...)
* The readers of the (previously mentioned) segment of the media and (potential) voters of the populist politicians

The outrage-driven-click-bait media don't care about the result of their stories.  They just care about funnelling readers to advertisers.

The populist politicians don't care what the latest outrage is *actually about* they just care about votes.  They can get easy votes by passing more and more legislation to appease the outrage-driven potential-voters.

The readers and voters (mostly) don't want a totalitarian state they just want their entertainment to have emotional appeal and to feel that the politicians they vote for are listening to their views.

Taken apart none of the three groups is benign, but their goals are rather [banal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banality_of_evil).  When taken together however, with a view to how to the feedback between the systems amplifies them, they result in an emergent force that could appear to be driven by a ""Dr. Evil"" type character at the centre of things.  The reality is far worse: *no one is in control*, our national (maybe global) destiny is in the hands of cybernetic feedback.

If you look at the UK and France you'll see that, as of 2008, we were doing far better than them. This is likely to have improved since then as the coalition has invested a lot in tech start-ups, other SME's (particularly in 'smart' manufacturing), whilst the banking sector has been recovering.

true,WDC312,lfc68,,"1. His technique, while not flawless, is very good.  Look at a lot of the goals he scores: very well taken, well hit balls.  The volleys especially (and there are many) exemplify his technique.  Also, he can do more tennis ball keepy-uppies and hit the crossbar more reliably than anyone.  (I know the last two don't mean *much*, but they still indicate how good he is at striking the ball.)

2. His passing range is actually quite good.  Most of the time he hits the ball on the ground but when he needs to he can hit it long.  From the right wing, his crosses are great (I know right wing is not where he should be played, just saying, he can hit a good ball).

3. He is a hard worker.  He has a first class attitude, trains harder than anyone (according to Kuyt) and genuinely wants to be at Liverpool.  He's captain of England U21's for a reason, and while we're on the subject, with them he consistently looks quite boss, easily one of the most composed players on the pitch.

4. He makes the runs.  We don't have too many willing runners from the midfield.  Hendo is probably our best option here.  Gerrard will burst from deep, and Coutinho will get in between defenders when he can, but Hendo is the workhorse who always looks to make runs into the box when we need them.

5. He is physically strong, and uses his strength well.  Again, we don't have too many players like that.

6. He is a smart player.  He doesn't pull off crap he can't do.  He hits the pass, he carries it a bit, he takes a strike when he's got space.

Not a worldbeater, but certainly very good, especially for a young guy.  Talent worth developing.  He may not lead us to glory, but he might very well provide a good firm foundation for us there.

**Also**, while Downing is not a top quality winger, he doesn't deserve half the shit he gets.  He works hard, shuts up when he isn't picked, has good technique, is one of the few older, experienced players we've got, and generally contributes a lot more than people think.  CCC's created?  1- Suarez, 2- Gerrard, 3- Downing not far behind, this season.

If I take my last month's usage on Sky as an example, that's 40GB during AA's ""peak"" time, and 370GB during their ""offpeak"" time, over 12 mb/sec DSL.

40GB during the day time? That'll be 32 of their ""units"" on CN20, or 16 on CN21. Because I'm not 100% sure which tech was used in my area pre-FTTC, I'll do both.

Each unit is £3,90, so on CN21, my daytime usage by itself would come to £62,40. And that's the *cheapest* of the 2 technologies. CN20 is basically double the price, so £124,80.

I'll not bother doing the rest of the maths, but the CN21 one is about as expensive as having a full Sky TV/Talk/DSL package.

He's a good finisher and shows a lot of intelligence and desire in his forward runs which helps our attacking edge when he is the game.  On the defensive side he is great at closing people down quickly all over the field, and he's got a bit of muscle to really fight for the ball when necessary. Where I'd really like to see him improve his game is how he plays with the ball at his feet.  He usually plays with his head down and seems a bit too eager to offload the ball as soon as he receives it. Needs to play with a bit more confidence in this area, and be willing to take on players on the dribble and get his head up to read the game better and make more incisive passes.

true,Memoriae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"Right, so you've got your monthly tarriff, which is the basic charge, line rental, all that fixed bollocks that rarely, if ever, gets put into the massive headline price. Which for A&amp;A is £12,20 a month for broadband, or £22,20 for fibre (either to the cabinet, or to your door).

Once you've got that, you need to work out what bandwidth you use between 0900 and 1800 during weekdays, and what bandwidth you use at all other times (basically 1800 to 0900 daily, all times at weekends, and all times during ""holidays"")

So say you use 10GB of bandwidth during the day, and 100GB during the other times, but those amounts were when you were caning the connection hard.

If you look into capacity planning, you never plan for 100% of the maximum, it's always 80-90% of the maximum. So you 10GB and 100GB turn in to 8GB and 80GB that you're ""planning"" on using.

Now, you need to work out what that would cost you in units. http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-prices.html is their calculator, but the long and the short of it, is that if you assume that you can't get FTTC yet, then you're probably on CN21 (I know my old flat opposite Cable and Wireless off Rose Lane was CN21). So you plumb in 8GB during the day, 80 (well, actually 100) during the other times, and it works out that you'll basically be paying... £35,60 a month for them. And if you go over that amount, instead of paying £3,90 per unit, you end up paying £5,64 per unit for the overage.

Which is significantly more expensive than most other providers.

If your ""planned"" usage is as high as my ""Oh fuck, Steam Sale incoming, oh fuck, WoW PTR release. Oh fuck, two systems to do the updates on"" month (i.e. last billing cycle for my Sky connection), which I'd worked out as about 40GB during the day, and 300GB during the rest of the time, that £35,60 turns in to £98,00. And that's if you plan for it.

//e It just depends on how well you plan your connection, and if potentially immense overcharges, slightly better tech support and gobshite CEO represent enough of a ""value for money"" for you.

The main benefit of this would be that it'd no longer be worth using a gp for something trivial. Hay fever sufferers are an example of that. Currently, you can either spend £1 a fortnight buying from bricks and mortar retail or £3 for a season's worth from an online chemist, or you can go to your gp, and have him write you a prescription. A gp will be paid some £50/hr, so your little 10min appointment to get some citirizine will cost the NHS somewhere in the region of £20+, which is split between you and every tax payer. If a couple of quid help dissuade people to keep the trivial stuff off their GPs, it's ultimately a good thing, I think. The budget, after all, only goes so far, and it's vital that they make the most of it.

I know enough about how TV props work.

A prime example is the Anovos Star Trek TNG uniforms, they cost something like $2000/$4000 each back when they were made (can't remember which one it is) and keep in mind this was in the 80's/early 90's. Now they cost about $1000. Why? Because all the R&amp;D has already been done, it's a simple matter of putting them on a production line, plus they're in pre-made sizes. R&amp;D, tailoring (not relevant here) for TV is expensive. 

Keep in mind that the production also has to buy the 'eternal' rights for these props and products so that they can only be sold under license and so that they can bring them back whenever they choose.

Brian May had his own home-made guitar which could make any sound imaginable, especially when plugged into a small amp that bassist John Deacon made out of parts found in a skip. And Deacon himself was an absolute beast on the bass, and is highly underrated.

At the same time, their individual passion for music, I think, is still unrivaled to this day. Roger Taylor wanted his song ""I'm In Love With My Car"" to be the B-Side to Bohemian Rhapsody so badly that he locked himself in a cupboard until Freddie agreed with him.

Plus [and this isn't exactly a musical fact], but I love how they didn't all wake up, give up hopes of 'normal' careers at an early age to become musicians and live of baked beans.

It's easy to mock people who go to the doctor with slight ailments but unless they do it *so often* that their doctor labels them as hypercondriacs/time-wasters (and henceforth ignores them) they are a lot *more likely* to have critical illnesses picked up at an early stage when they are treatable with minimum complications, as opposed to being difficult to treat or even terminal.

Lots of major illnesses if detected early enough are not only easier to treat, they are also cheaper to treat and their suffers have greater live expectancy.  Taking this into account (as a society) we shouldn't be charging people for doctors appointments, or ""educating them about the appropriate use of a doctor"", we *should be offering everyone* a free, routine medical appointment every 6 months where they are asked questions designed to diagnose the most common illnesses at their early stages and also given a series of highly cost-effective medical tests (std screening, blood tests, mammograms, prostate cancer screening etc...)

Not only would this be cost effective and also help save lives, it would also decrease ""trivial"" doctors appointments because people would be more likely to bring up their slight ailments at the 6 month appointments, rather than making specific appointments for every minor ailment.",0,1374790710,null,0,1374791037,0,cbabfzj,t3_1j1s0e,t1_cbabfzj,t1_cbaaqb2,null,1430335547,20,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,20

All the talk of £45m or a £50m deal is complete conjecture, Brendan mentioned Cavani once but then he was sold at £55m to a team ABROAD and whilst it wasn't so public he also wanted to leave and Napoli wanted him to stay (although it was a release clause in the end at £55m), if it had been Juventus, well I don't think it would have been more because I don't think Napoli would have considered it realistically. So basically don't trust anything you read right now, the media want to keep it sounding imminent etc.

ANYWAYS, abut Bale, I posted this in another thread this evening but its relevant here:

'Reports from Spain (which aren't picked up as much in the UK because he's their favourite son) suggest Madrid are still very keen on Bale this window and are raising funds (partly through Higauin) to facilitate a WR bid, probably around £85m which Spurs wouldn't be able to turn down.
Therefore apparently they currently have ZERO interest in Suarez unless Bale doesn't come, but by then it will likely be Suarez is either gone already (although as you can see above I seriously doubt the chances we'd sell to Arsenal) or LFC consider it too late for a sale. Add to that Madrid are unlikely to pay more than £35m and it gets tricky.
All of this is conjecture but it was a phone interview on talksport from their Madrid based correspondent this evening as I listened and is as valid as any of the other media stuff flying around. I like to think it has some merit because he went on at lengths to dismiss the current Suarez speculation, even stating he thought a move to Arsenal was unlikely, which is going directly against 99% of the media out there.'",0,1374791463,null,0,false,0,cbabpnc,t3_1j236y,t1_cbabpnc,t3_1j236y,null,1430335421,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I've already admitted my error on their pricing, It's been a while since I bothered to look at them (i.e only looked when they were announced.)

It doesn't cost them $4000 to make them now.

It cost them over that to make them for the show. They had to pay for the R&amp;D costs and the rights to the prop itself. 

This massively inflates the cost. All of television is like this. 

Barrowman's greatcoat for example (Miracle Day), he told me himself that his cost £3000 per coat (similar with Tennant's).

I know somebody that can make me a 99% accurate Tennant (unlicensed) coat for about £800.

They wanted £550 for the second car, third party only.  Then they realised they hadn't accounted for a claim that I made two years ago when a TNT driver hit my brother's *parked* car while I happened to be responsible for it.  So the premium went up to £650, which for a limited-mileage classic stank of bullshit.  However, being away from home for a few days I went for it so I was legal and paid the £650 upfront.

When I got home I rang a specialist, got a quote for £200 and rang Admiral back.  Being within the 14 days I was entitled to a full refund.  ""Oh yes Mr Pineapplecharm, I will be refunding you the £345.62...""

""£650,"" I corrected him.  ""I would like a full refund please.""

""Oh but sir the new premium was giving you the discount on your other car also.""

""No, that was paid up through June already, this doesn't affect the first car.  Even if it did, what I want is to go back to the situation I had a week ago and receive a full refund please as is my legal right.""

""No sir you are not understanding me.  You converted to a multi car policy with a multi car discount and now you are losing this the discount, isn't it.""

Long story short, I became irate, asked for the manager, was told he wasn't there, invoked my rights as a customer of a financial services company and told them if I didn't get a refund I would hang up and call the police.  At that point he put me on hold for about 30 seconds after which he gave me my money back.

I am sure this is policy - try to trick people into relinquishing their rights in the hope that they will just back down.  It makes me livid to think of elderly or less assertive people losing money to these dicks just because they don't know their rights or won't stand up for them.

Hoilett is one of the [selected players whose personalised kit you can order with a few clicks from club shop](http://www.shop.qpr.co.uk/gb/players/). Why hasn't Granero gone? Diakité? Mbia?

Rumours of a deal to buy out Luke Young have come to nothing. Other than that, as long as Bosingwa leaves, we might as well leave the defensive side of things alone. The three signings seem sensible and sufficient from here. If they can keep other teams from scoring, we might get away with scoring 65 goals being enough to finish in the top 7.

We have too many midfielders. So many that even if they signed Townsend tomorrow, you'd raise an eyebrow. Offload Taarabt, Granero, Mbia and Diakité and the picture should be clearer. The kick in the nuts is that those players are all in their prime, while Park, Jenas and SWP are at the end of their stories and haven't got Championship experience. While people might not have welcomed Steve Kean's warnings about the Championship, his pointing out that his stats people discovered a jump in distance travelled per game stuck out for me. It's gonna be harder on the old-timers legs. I don't trust any of them to create goals, so right now it looks like I'll be pinning hopes on Hoilett and Faurlin, possibly Traoré.

It's up front where it all looks donald the ducked. Even if they bring in Austin and he gets 25, where will the other 40-45 come from? Watford have brought in most of their goal hungry loanees from last season, and even got some Paraguayan to replace Vydra. In contrast we've got Johnson and Zamora. As you say, both are highly suspect to pull a Championship amount of games out of the bag, although they too are available to instabuy as personalised shirts for your kiddies. Can we even hope for 10 goals apiece from them? I hope Johnson does well. If Remy is with us until January, maybe he can add another 10. Then we just need to bag 15 goals from amongst everyone else. I don't think one new striker is enough. Maybe we can loan another one in.

As for the chemistry, it's hard to say without knowing where the specific faultlines lie. Amputate most of the French-speaking mob for a start to fizzle out one clique. Bumping out the overpaid would also be beneficial, but Zamora looks like he's staying and I didn't seem him earn his wages last season. Would I be stretching it to call Zamora one of the worst signings QPR made during the 2 years in the Premier League? In any case looking at contract lengths I think we might be in for a season of detox from the toxic year we just had.
