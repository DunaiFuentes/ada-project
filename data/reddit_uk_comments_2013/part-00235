That isn't their role 100% of the time (and they can switch at times), but all things equal there is a clear organizer out of the holding mids. That isn't to say your attacking mids aren't playmakers either, it is just that you are fielding a more complete team, which is especially useful when your opponent parks the bus and you need to break them down (most often spraying the ball wide).

This is the main problem I have with the Chelsea lineup if Lampard is out of the game (or invisible) then there is no one who can play this role (very well).  For starters, this role isn't even Lampard's natural position.  Mikel and Essien are options but they are better as the ball winners from what I have seen in recent years.

edit: Okay, now for some more useful information. [This section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night#Guy_Fawkes_Day) of the wiki article that OP linked describes Guy Fawkes Day being used, apart from celebrating the failed assassination /u/Ootachiful describes, to celebrate victories of Protestants over Catholics in Ireland and Scotland. Later, it just became a very generalised celebration of that sort of thing:

&gt;The Fifth became ""a polysemous* occasion, replete with polyvalent^+ cross-referencing, meaning all things to all men"".

^(*Having multiple meanings or interpretations.) ^^+ ^(that has various uses, functions, or capacities)

So it seems that 5th November was a ""yay we are protestant and you aren't"" day. This happened periodically, at least, in the 1790s and early 1800s.

Again, not sure, but it isn't as religious today as its history implies.

It looks like we form a picket line at the 18 yard mark.  People aren't moving and when someone gets on the ball and they aren't looking to drive into the box and open up new lanes of opportunity.  At this point its rare to see anyone move towards the endline (be it inside or outside the box), so we end up with a group of players standing and waiting for a pass or standing and waiting to see if the shot from the outside is parried by the goalie.

I almost get the impression that everyone is just waiting for someone else to make something happen.  

I keep thinking that at some point, someone (anyone) is just going to get fed up with the stagnant, static attack and fall back on their competitive instinct and try to beat their man to create something inside the final third.  Frankly, i think we really need something like that to happen for a player to take it upon themselves to try something making a mistake be damned.

Moving costs a fortune and you're not entitled to local authority help in almost all cases. If you're moving from one local authority tenancy and were settled there, you will not be offered another one. If you're living in private rented accommodation, it's unlikely you'll be able to afford a bond, rent in advance and agent fees, again the local authority will not help.

Moving is not a good idea for many people with mental health problems, or health problems in general. A lot of people also rely on family for child care whilst they are working.

you will see we pay pretty much the same pre tax as everyone else. the exceptions are 

**USA and Canada** - that produce their own ( esp in the form of shale gas ) [source p13](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2013_FINAL_WEB.pdf) and Canada is a net exporter usa imports only 6% and probably mostly from canada ( who have a limited close by market ) .


**Finland** which is right on russia's doorstep and imports from russia ( low import costs) 
&gt; Finland was 100% dependent on a single supplier in gas, namely Russia [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Finland#Natural_gas)


**Denmark** which is self sufficient in gas
&gt;Denmark has considerable sources of oil and natural gas in the North Sea &lt;snip&gt;  However, gas resources are expected to decline, and production may decline below consumption in 2020
[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Denmark)

**Netherlands** is self sufficient in gas

&gt;Netherlands produces 80 bcm ( billion cubic meters ) 2.3 % of the world total.  Netherlands is also one of the top ten exporters of natural gas exporting 34 bcm.

the more expensive european  countries are further away from north sea pipelines

you can also see wikipedia's list of countries by natural gas production http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_production
 the UK are 18th ( with a population of 63 million ) 
 netherlands are ( 11th pop 17 million ) and denmark ( 46th pop 5million ) 

we the UK import  37bcm of gas [source p13](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2013_FINAL_WEB.pdf)

With our next 9 games (until the 1st round of league fixtures is completed) being home to Fulham, Cardiff, Norwich and West Ham, as well as away to Everton, Hull, Spurs, City and Chelsea, it would seem that 18 points (5 wins, 3 draws or 6 wins etc) would be a realistic target and give us 38 points from the 1st round. 

That's exactly 2 points per game and obviously 76 points across a whole season which would be more often than not enough for top 4. So I'd say on schedule rather than ahead of schedule, personally.

On a related point (and this is something I'm really interested in), can you shed any light on how fitness is periodised across the season? What are your feelings regarding the current fitness of the squad (are they running at say 70% fitness or higher or lower)?

if only you would bother to look at the statistics, for get your ""its only designed to kill"" line for a minute.

on a pure number of item related deaths as a proportion of the population guns are incredibly safe, shooting rates as one of the safest sports there is.

swimming pools cars and many other items are actually many many times more lethal to children and adults alive if you look at the actually causes of deaths. 

do you say cars don't need to be looked at for safety they were deigned to transport people not kill them.

most tools we have were all designed to kill originally knifes, hammers, axes etc yet we found other uses for them.

the truth is that most of the countries you listed are cheap because they are major producers of coal or nuclear power. 

Poland  
Bulgaria  
Greece  	
Romania  
Estonia  
Hungary  
Slovenia  

are all in the top 35 coal producers source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coal_production

Bulgaria  
Hungary   
Finland  
Czech Republic  
Ukraine  
France  

are all in the top 30 nuclear producers source:

out of the countries you cherry picked that aren't on the list

Luxembourg  - pop 500,000	  
Latvia	- 2million pop. imports from major coal producers neighbours

true,ninj3,null,null,"I think if you're struggling to find paid work, your last resort may be to do some unpaid volunteering work (perhaps if you're lucky they will at least pay for some of your expenses like travel etc.) just to show that you are willing and able to work.

It will also be brilliant for your CV and interview prospects since you will be able to develop your personal skills (organisational, time-keeping, team-work etc etc) while volunteering.

Your biggest difficulty in finding a paid job will be when people ask you something like, ""so tell me of a time when you have shown good leadership skills."" If you've been doing nothing for 2 years, you'll have no good examples to talk about, or any examples you do have will be way too old. By doing volunteering you'll learn many things which you will be able to put in your CV and talk about.

In fact, you may find that being a volunteer can give you even better opportunities to ""prove yourself"" in a shorter period than if you were paid since volunteers frequently find a lack of sufficient guidance and oversight and therefore have to be quite independent and take the initiative.

Also, look for volunteering opportunities outside of the job centre, around your local community. I'm sure there are many things that people need volunteers for. Helping other people who can't afford to pay you may help you feel good and proud about yourself and build your own self confidence and self worth. It would also look nice on a CV of course.

It will be tough to be ""working"" for no pay, and it will take an absolutely astounding amount of self descipline and willpower to keep going, but keep looking for interesting things to volunteer in, and who knows, you may find that volunteering can take you to places you never imagined before. You might stumble upon something you really love and can turn that volunteering thing into a paid job!

First off let apologise for making you wait so long for my answer.

I like NetFlix, it's pretty cheap, it's innovative and IMHO worth the money. Sky, I think, is over-priced pap. But let's leave that aside for now. 

&gt;Is there some special reason we all have to chip in to make the BBC cheaper for you?

Two words.  Education and Innovation (please ignore the ""and""). Let me expand

The BBC has Education built into it's charter, it is obliged to provide the public Educational programming that you would not get anywhere else, and I'm not just talking about the grandstand programmes such as Planet Earth (which by the way made a hell of a lot of money for the BBC, thus keeping our licence fee down). I'm talking about the Open University, I'm talking about Learning Bytesize, I'm talking about BBC schools.  These projects support students from the ages of 5 to 95, they use 33ish million of the BBC licence money but they also come under the online and programming funding tranches, thus meaning the BBC spends a lot more than that on helping to educate the nation.

Innovation is also central to the BBC charter.  The BBC has always embraced this idea and this allows it to ""waste"" money on many different projects that companies like Sky would never pay for. HD television was fist broadcast in the UK by the BBC after Sky literally said they don't think it would be profitable. Sky has benefited from this extremely profitable innovation in the last few years. Not to mention the iPlayer, an app that first showed other companies that online streaming and catch-up could work. That started out as BBC redux via the BBC research and development center.

Remember the 2012 Olympics?  Sure you do, without the BBC our olympics would have been shown on a shitty service like Americans had to deal with. Instead we got multiple channels via the BBC including over 50 streams online and eventsw on the red button.

But that's the present, what about the past? Well...teletext, NICAM, DAB radio, FM radio, stereo FM, RDS and Freeview. The BBC were instrumental in developing, implementing and, in some cases, helping the Government sell these products.

By the way if you want to know how many people watched a programme, well give thanks to technology that is based on the Peak programme meter, developed by the BBC

There are so many other advantages of the BBC and so many other reasons that it should be allowed to keep it's charter.

It costs £145 a year or £2.78 a week. Well worth the money in my book.

A group of Catholics, led by Robert Catesby (NOT FAWKES), fed up of Protestant King James I &amp; VI's apparent failure to roll back some of the extremely severe Elizabethan anti-Catholic laws (despite giving the appearance that he would, before he became king), decided to take matters into their own hands.  They would assassinate the king and his Parliament, put his daughter on the throne as a puppet queen, and welcome the Pope back to England with open arms.

However, someone delivered a letter warning a certain Lord, related to one of the plotters, to stay away from Parliament, triggering a search of the grounds and the subsequent discovery of Fawkes, who was the explosives expert and the man in charge of blowing up the House of Lords.  Who wrote the letter remains unknown.  It might have been Francis Tresham, one of the plotters, or it might have been Robert Cecil (keen to impress the new king).

The whole thing was rather ill-advised.

I would love to see Henderson starting in his original position on Saturday, the chap really deserves it and he would do the job very well in my eyes.

Also Lucas deserves a lot more credit and less criticism for his entire impact on our games. He is a great ball winner and can break up play better than any DMF in the league on his day. Still young and perfect for the position.

a) Your previous argument was predicated on Rassilon whining about Gallifrey rising or falling. Now you're saying that they didn't know?

b) You're still saying that the Time Lords are being destroyed when all that's happened is they're being sent back into what-amounts-to-a pocket universe.

To expand on that: I'm saying that we have not seen them ""destroyed"" and they've gone back into the Time Lock **un**destroyed. If they die, are ""destroyed"" or ""killed"" in there... it's going to be because of something they do to themselves or the natural processes of Entropy will kill them just like it'll kill *everything in existence*, without any special action of ""destruction"" from the Doctor.

c) There is *no way* that **the Time Lords** are going to believe that travelling to a point after their destruction is going to *obviate* their destruction, because - and I think that even you have to agree - **the Time Lords** are going to understand the difference between the progression of Time in the Universe which they traverse, versus *their own personal histories which **do not have to be** 1:1 related to Time in the Universe.

d) And by the way, it much more obvious that you've misunderstood, when you say:

&gt; This has always been part of the Time War. When 8/Hurt/9 (whichever it turns out to be) time locks them, they always try to escape, and Ten always sends them back to the time lock, to be destroyed by 8/Hurt/9

If **it**'s a part of the Time War, then **it**'s supposed to be stuck in the Time Lock. The Tenth Doctor, sending them *back in*, is **after** *a.k.a.* **outside the Time War**. That entire chunk of virtually everything that happened in the Time War has been safely (*ha, Russell Davies you crappy writer*) locked away outside the Universe.

To explain:

I think you need to stop thinking of the Doctor as ""sending them back to time point A""; you need to think of the Time Lock as more of a ""bubble"", a separate pocket spacetime.

And I **do** say ""separate""; because without any previous existence there, the Lock opened up *right on top of Earth*, in spite of the fact [Gallifrey's supposed to be near the centre of the galaxy](http://www.curufea.com/rassilon/g_planet.xml).

There **is** a contradiction created by their escape and that contradiction is caused by Russell T Davies being a very poor, illogical, inconsistent writer. **Nothing** should've gotten out of that Time Lock bubble in any direction of four dimensions of space and possibly two dimensions of time.

To wit: *it doesn't matter* that the Master ""always had"" that signal in his head. The only reason it was there, *the Cause of that Effect* **was Rassilon's in-bubble action**. Even if the signal was there and Rassilon somehow modulated or ""piggy-backed onto"" it for his purposes, that's still *~~information~~* **something** *leaking out the Lock*.

The Time Lock should be *like* a Black Hole, in that [*no information should ever escape it*](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox). And that ***includes*** (*Russell Davies, you nigh-worthless bastard!*) the Sound of Drums, the White Point Star, or any Time Lord woman visiting Wilf.

(What's even more pathetic, Davies *you shitty* ***hack*** - you could've written around this **incredibly** easily. A single TARDIS sent to another universe, or into the Void. All you needed, before launching the War, was one single asset in reserve to break **in** instead of breaking **out**. Even if that asset is what triggered the Master. The addition of ten seconds of CGI and maybe four paragraphs of dialogue, you **jerk**, you could've slotted that right into your existing story! You should've hired Lawrence Miles or any of the *Stargate SG-1* writers, for crap's sake! Or even Classic series writer [Christopher Bidmead](http://www.pagefillers.com/dwrg/bidmead.htm)! Russell bloody Davies, *you should be ashamed of yourself, you amateurish* ***Faecal Suck!***)

***So***, Knockturnal, the Time Lords also would've failed trying to travel or transmit in **any** direction of space-and-time to escape the Lock.

The difference, if we want to be particular about it, is that the far end *behind* the [Event Horizon](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) still keeps some detectable presence in the Universe - the Event (and for that matter, [every other kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) of) Horizon a Black Hole has.

So, in short, Knockturnal (and, in spite of the frustration, thanks for a decent knockdown-dragout debate)... the original comment of yours saying that the Doctor destroyed Gallifrey and the Time Lords can ***only*** be considered accurate if you equate ""destroying"" with ""removing from the Universe"".

And that's a slippery slope to travel, because then you'd have to say that Rose, her mum, Mickey and the human Doctor have all been ""destroyed"" too.

Even if you wanted to say that imprisoning the Time Lords will kill them through the action of [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics)? The Time Lords can stretch that out almost unimaginably and probably last longer than the natural universe. They can collapse matter into [Black Holes and draw energy from **them**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation).

And it *doesn't matter* that they're in a Time Lock. They have TARDISes and dimensional transcendentalism. The Fourth Doctor [prevented the universe from being destroyed by entropy by helping the Logopolitans open up other pocket universe voids](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_5v.htm); turning [a closed system into an open system](http://www.tim-thompson.com/entropy3.html). The Time Lords inside the Lock could do *precisely the same thing*. Not to mention they can *engineer* ***stars*** and [***make stuff out of maths***](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Block_Transfer_Computation).

*They'll probably live longer inside the Time Lock than the rest of the Universe will*. And the New Series Doctor **lies** prodigiously. And the Doctor has still failed to commit genocide. The worst he's ever done is he ~~let~~ [tricked Davros into destroying Skaro](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_7h.htm) (and *fuck*, even that got **ignored** when they did [the Eighth Doctor's *crappy* movie](http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_mov1.htm)!.

I just find the licence fee to be rather unfair. Not for me personally, I don't miss the money and I get enough value to justify it.

But it is the ultimate regressive tax. An OAP might miss £2.78 a week. Some people say ""If they can't afford to watch TV, they shouldn't"", but of course they can afford to watch TV, a second hand set costs next to nothing. They struggle to pay the licence.

Whereas a well-off family of 4 might have multiple TVs, multiple computers, listen to the radio while they commute to work, they get massively more value from the BBC. But they pay exactly the same (*between them*) as the single OAP.

When you talk about the general good stuff the BBC do (which I don't dispute), well *everybody* should be paying towards that, and according to their ability to pay. If ByteSize is a good thing, why should it only be paid for by people who watch TV? And why should a single poor person have to contribute the same amount and a whole family of wealthy people?

I think the internet is going to start forcing the issue. I can't see my kids *ever* buying a TV licence. They have plenty else to do anyway, but they watch TV it is usually on the computer and it is rarely BBC.

Personally I think it will have to be paid for out of general taxation. The licence is an anachronism and the writing is on the wall. But I do understand it won't be the same BBC.",0,1383695087,null,0,false,0,cd7n546,t3_1px45p,t1_cd7n546,t1_cd7lneu,null,1428776017,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

HM Treasury is involved in electronic payment regulation and policy, anti money laundering e.g : 

&gt; The Treasury held or attended over a dozen stakeholder meetings and received 20 written responses during the consultation period. Respondents represented a broad range of electronic money institutions, payment service providers, trade bodies, consultants and user groups. These stakeholders helped to provide a view of the implementing Regulations from a practical, market entry and future-proofing perspective.

&gt;**What if I pay in cash?**

&gt; Sainsbury's and Morrisons can still monitor what you buy and identify products which, when they are scanned in at the till, act as '""triggers"" for the cashiers to hand over different types of incentives.

&gt; Both use a ""coupon-at-till"" system called Catalina, which proclaims on its website that it ""finds just the consumers whose buying preferences match"" a particular product. 

&gt; At Sainsbury's, Catalina also makes extensive use of the wider Nectar card database. The database contains information about what Nectar cardholders buy at every retailer in the scheme - not just at Sainsbury's - which makes it particularly adept at identifying and targeting customers according to their demographic profile. Sainsbury's is using its data to offer online discounts to in-store shoppers from large households with kids, to give them an incentive to shop online. 

&gt; Its rival Morrisons doesn't have a loyalty card database to rely on. Instead, it admits it will buy in ""very detailed and segmented demographic data"" and use this to analyse your shopping basket and extrapolate trends about what you are purchasing, so it can decide which offers to target you with.

If someone has stopped eating and drinking, and they can't be cured, and will die in 72 hours, LCP said ""don't force food and drink upon them""

The important point here is to recognise that LCP was for people who were going to die no matter what we as health professionals do, and die very soon. Therefore it provides a care plan for making that person as comfortable as possible.

If a person is acutely ill, not eating or drinking BUT has the potential for recovery then LCP would not have been used and we would do everything in our power to bring them back. 

People who are going to die in a matter of hours can't really be euthanized in any meaningful way. However interventions to save lives can be intrusive and painful -- why put someone through it if you know they won't survive anyway.

Source: I am a student nurse who has cared for several end of life patients as part of a team using LCP for guidance. 




Edit: I'm sure people have been placed on LCP incorrectly as timing a person's death is hard, however I find it hard to believe patients who were awake and able to eat and drink were denied food.

As a Cleveland Browns fan, I pray to the Old Gods and the New, that Lerner does not bring any of his NFL knowledge to Villa.  The Browns have not won a championship since 1964, they've had a few good years and many bad years since then, but they somehow dropped to their lowest level under Lerner's reign.  If there was relegation in the NFL, the Browns would have been playing in the [XFL](http://www.all-xfl.com/xfl/) when Lerner sold.

I think Lerner has been a much better Association Football owner than he was a Gridiron Football owner, but **please**, do not bring any of your NFL taint to Villa.

I'm pretty sure benefits would be cut, in that instance, and the boyfriend would have to support the family as if he'd married into it. 

If the mother failed to declare his presence in the house then it would be benefits fraud. 

Benefits application forms ask questions about the number of adults living in the house and their relationship, and claimants are required to inform the agency if their circumstances change.

This would, ironically, seem to deprive kids of stability and role models, but maybe only kids in poorer circumstances. It's probably more financially viable for a bloke to keep his bedsit on and pop over 3 nights a week for a a meal &amp;/or a glass of wine and a shag, than it is to move in, make an honest woman of the mother and become a paying father to someone else's kid.",0,1383699522,null,0,1383717318,0,cd7oy4o,t3_1py1pv,t1_cd7oy4o,t1_cd7a5x4,null,1428775175,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Even if you accept the Friedmanite concept of the NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment), the UK economy is not going to find itself running out of workers or resources. [There are around 2.5m people unemployed in the UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24547749). 

Inflation is what results when the economy is operating at full capacity, that is, when everyone that wants a job can feasibly find work and resources cannot be bought without incurring price increases. That's not the situation in the UK right now. 

What would happen if wages increased right now is that aggregate demand (total national spending) would increase. That spending would lead to a higher demand for workers, who would not be able to demand high wage increases (public sector wages are frozen for instance) because the level of unemployment is still high.  

The inter-war hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic was, as you stated, generated deliberately to erode the value of the debts owed to the Allies (to shaft the French basically).

true,dops,null,null,"&gt; But it is the ultimate regressive tax. An OAP might miss £2.78 a week. Some people say ""If they can't afford to watch TV, they shouldn't"", but of course they can afford to watch TV, a second hand set costs next to nothing. They struggle to pay the licence.

People over 75 do not pay licence fees in fact if you have paid you licence fee and turn 75 in that year, they refund your for every full month after you turned 75.

&gt;a well-off family of 4 might have multiple TVs, multiple computers, listen to the radio while they commute to work, they get massively more value from the BBC. But they pay exactly the same (between them) as the single OAP.

I think you are neglecting historical usage, someone a the age of say 83 has probably been watching the BBC since the 1960's. Almost certainly they watched Armstrong land on the moon on the BBC.

&gt;If ByteSize is a good thing, why should it only be paid for by people who watch TV?

It is also part of TV programming, it used on very late at night so teachers can record it and show to students during lessons.  Now it streams. I suppose also there is a worldview difference here. I am more than happy to have higher taxes and pay for free education for everyone in this country, I think it helps me in the long run, I see shows like bytsize and the OU as part of that. By funding these shows I am investing in the country, not just the BBC.

&gt;And why should a single poor person have to contribute the same amount and a whole family of wealthy people?

There are discounts for students and people on the dole, there are discounts available for families on working tax credits.  Not everyone pays the full amount.

&gt;I think the internet is going to start forcing the issue. I can't see my kids ever buying a TV licence. They have plenty else to do anyway, but they watch TV it is usually on the computer and it is rarely BBC.

Maybe but you have to know that your licence contributes to the iPlayer, yes TV is going more online and that is a good thing but someone has to produce that content.  Hopefully in the future, when TV  doesn't need arial technology the BBC can stop paying other companies to use their transmitting towers (at a vastly inflated price) and that will save us money.  How do you think the digital switchover was paid for?

&gt;Personally I think it will have to be paid for out of general taxation. The licence is an anachronism and the writing is on the wall. But I do understand it won't be the same BBC.

I think if it is then without the protection that the royal charter and the BBC Trust provide politics will kill funding for the BBC and have a larger input into it's programming.  The beauty of the current set-up is that we have a national media delivery provider that is pretty independent of the government and that will always be a good thing.

This doesn't apply to so-called ""higher"" apprenticeships though, so that may be where the confusion lies.

That, and a lot of ""companies"" use ""apprenticeships"" as a means for cheap labour. So, be careful on that front.

You'll have to research each company's scheme. But, having a degree behind you may mean it'll be better if you applied for their graduate schemes instead. They don't necessarily care what your degree is in, just that you have the aptitude and willingness for their learning process.

true,knockturnal,mccoy,McCoy,"A. Rassilon knows the Time Lords will be destroyed if they don't escape the time lock in the same way you know you'll be killed if you don't get out of the middle of the street when a car is coming. You don't need to go to the future and be hit by the car to know that if you don't get out of the street you'll be hit by the car.

B. I don't see how you are ignoring the fact that the High Counsel Time Lady very bluntly stated that the Doctor planned to destroy them. She claimed he was going to ACTIVELY take part in their destruction. At the point she said this, they were ALREADY time locked. The Doctor clarifies this when he says ""they can escape before they die"". This is exactly what I just said in A: the Time Lords see the car coming, and they're trying to get out of the street. For 4 whole series the Doctor made it very clear he DESTROYED them. They BURNED. This episode does not change that, it only introduces the idea that they are destroyed WITHIN THE TIME LOCK. He couldn't destroy them in ""open"" time because they were at war at ALL time. Destroying them at any point in time only meant the Time War was still going on at ALL OTHER POINTS IN TIME.

He destroys them in the sense that HE ACTUALLY DESTROYS THEM. They all die at some point in the time locked bubble universe (if you want to consider it a bubble universe). The Doctor destroys them. They burn. At some point before their destruction, they somehow found out the Doctor planned to do this (heck, considering the Doctor, he probably told them himself), and they tried to escape. They saw the car coming and tried to run away. However, the future Doctor (Ten) pushed them back into the street, and the car (the Time War Doctor) hit them. And they died. 

It's a very simple idea. Here it is in the order the Time Lords would perceive it:

1. There is a Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks.
2. It penetrates all Time.
3. The Time War Doctor forces the Time War into its own time locked bubble universe and plans to destroy both the Daleks and the Time Lords.
4. The Time Lords (and some Daleks) find out and try to escape.
5. The Tenth Doctor prevents their escape. Some Daleks are somehow more clever and get out.
6. The Time War Doctor destroys the Time Lords and the Daleks. 

This is exactly consistent with everything in the show. It requires no invocation of ""the Doctor lies"" in order to retcon 2005 - 2009 in order to fit a bad interpretation of a single line of dialogue.

Excellent!

&gt; What was your alias? Where you from?

Italy, like my gaming buddies. We were four in all, two pudgy dudes whose names I can't even remember and two skinny ones (me and the other guy).

I used a female character and my alias back then was TanithShire (some minor Star Wars character from a comic whose story I no longer remember at all.)

I could play decently with all guns, but I had a definite preference for the railgun. More than once I caused very satisfactory groans of despair from computers around me as I popped heads from across the level. :D I only wish I'd maintained that level of skill over time... I don't dare think of the awful things that would happen to me if I joined an online match nowadays. :P

Edit: I just remembered that at least some of the matches we played were on the Reckoning expansion pack - I vividly remember preferring the double-fireball launcher to the standard rocket launcher, so much that it became my second favourite weapon after the railgun.

&gt;and Red Alert.

Now that you mention RTS games, we sometimes used to play Total Annihilation as well, but me and the tall guy were the only ones with anything approaching skill (read: we still sucked, just not quite as badly), so the other two dudes' armies barely counted as target practice. :P

&gt;(alias Fluff at the time) 

I had a very brief flash of recognition when I read this, and the more I think about it the more I'm convinced I played against you at some point. I have no clear memories of anyone's alias but Pussycat's, but my subconscious wouldn't be poking at me right now if I'd never seen yours. :P

&gt;added additional machines downstairs

I had no idea there even was a downstairs. O_o man, this sounds more fun than even what I remember. Too bad I had to go away immediately after my learning vacation was over, or I'm quite certain I'd have become a regular.

&gt;I though one of them with long hair was Pussycat, though that may have been Rick

I remember him complimenting me once after a match, and I mistook him for some other guy who called himself ""Pussy"". Naive young me didn't yet know the other meaning of that word, so there was a small amount of embarrassment in the misunderstanding. :P

How long did the upstairs place last?

&gt;By a weird coincidence I was in the old shop just the other week (now a bar) reminiscing about the good times to a mate who took my place when I went to Uni. I find it funny to think that at that time the internet/gaming wasn't as mainstream and so every now and then you'd have drunk lads wandering down the street shouting 'Geeks' through the door, yet now it's so prevalent most of us carry it around with us in our pockets.

To tell you the truth, I never quite enjoyed multiplayer gaming as I did in the VGZ. I'm probably old-school inside, I dunno, but I just don't get much excitement from killing some dude over the Internet whom I'll never see or know what he looks like or even know where he is. I loved the sociality of the thing, how you could chat face-to-face with your gaming opponents and discuss the matches, or get complimented  (or insulted, as happened quite deservedly to one of my gaming buddies after - for reasons best known to himself - he got on a computer on which one of the owners, momentarily AFK, was trying to teach co-op to some kid and proceeded to repeatedly teamkill the kid in question), or grab a bite together. Man, I miss this - I went to a couple LAN parties afterwards in my area, but I wasn't in the proper crowds and missed most of those events back when they were done, and nowadays they just don't happen anymore - not here at least.

I would say as far as defenders in England go he's the most elegant and natural with the ball at his feet. I think Dembele is maybe an even better example from our squad of a player who is all about natural ability. His game is flawed in a number of aspects, but he effortlessly glides by people in a way that no one else quite replicates. Vertonghen is still a cerebral player who makes great decisions and shows a lot of grit. Dembele looks like he's just playing in the street or something. 

That said, I think players like RVP and Suarez are a cut above as far as pure football goes. RVP for being technically immaculate and Suarez for audacity and determination. That's in England of course. Messi would be a really obvious answer for the world, but probably the right one.

true,knockturnal,mccoy,McCoy,"It doesn't contradict what is on screen. You don't know if Rassilon is narrating from before or after the events. The most likely explanation is that he's narrating from before and during the events, and being cocky and assuming it's the last days of Earth. Because he assumes success, because he's Rassilon and he's the greatest Time Lord to ever live (although at this point, the Doctor probably takes that title). You're basically saying ""I don't like the The End of Time because I think RTD is a bad writer so I'm making up my own story and negating most of the actual story"". You can't do that. 

These are the only lines that matter:

The Partisan: But we know his intention. He still possesses the Moment. And he’ll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike.

The Chancellor: The Visionary confirms it.

The Visionary: Ending. Burning. Falling. All of it, falling. The black, and pitch. And screaming fire. Soul burning.

The Chancellor: All of her prophecies say the same. That this is the last day of the Time War. That Gallifrey falls. That we die. Today.

Nothing about that says that the Doctor lied previously. It is completely consistent with all previous episodes where the Doctor says that he does, in fact, destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike. He says they burn. This is what the Time Lords are afraid of, so they'd like to escape. Completely self-consistent with the entire show up until and after this episode.

How ""deep"" are you into that kind of stuff? Is it just like the standard not knowing things until the public does, or are you like, in the shit? Again, you can just say you can't answer that. 

Secondary question, have you ever been around Westfield/Danny's academy? What level of involvement does he have?

I'm going to trust you on this supposed fact, but why do you think that is?  Because guns are somehow actually safe, every day items that are just misunderstood? Or because the people who practice shooting as some kind of sport are properly trained and responsible for their use and also happen to not keep their firearms lying around where others might be able to get access to them?

The stricter our laws are regarding firearm ownership and usage, the less firearm related crimes, accidents, injuries and deaths will occur as a result. This should not be too hard to grasp.

If you are advocating the right to be able to own and use more firearms in the UK, you are basically suggesting that you're OK with an increase in shootings, accidental or otherwise.

My point is that since guns in the UK (in civilian hands) serve no real use outside of recreation, we *should* be enforcing strict laws on their ownership and usage.

Currently, the UK enjoys one of the [lowest per-capita-deaths-by-firearms rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) in the world. This is not because we are somehow more responsible as a nation.

The USA has a huge gun problem, one that is not easily solved because of the ingrained mentality that everyone should be able to arm themselves to the teeth. And I can't exactly blame them. If all the criminals and undesirables are carrying guns, what upstanding civilian wouldn't want to be able to protect themselves equally in case of trouble?

If we began to relax our gun laws, we would be starting down a slippery slope that is going to be difficult, if not impossible to recover from.

So forgive me if I don't sympathize with you, but I'm going to stand by my opinion that we should not compromise our relatively safe, non-gun oriented culture to appease those few people who have deluded themselves into thinking that just because they are responsible, everyone else will be too.",0,1383719170,null,0,false,0,cd7w2li,t3_1py2mf,t1_cd7w2li,t1_cd7ksxu,null,1428771781,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The dragon is my favourite character because there's so much potential for him *not* to be the wise, guiding, mentor character he presents himself to be. He isn't reliable. It's demonstrated on the show that he's self-serving and shameless. Why does Merlin trust him as much as he does? How do we know the dragon doesn't resent Merlin's ability to command him, and doesn't try to find ways around it? How do we know he doesn't resent humanity as a whole, regardless of who's magical, for his loneliness as a dragon? After all, magical characters like Gaius actually worked with Uther - he has every reason to be cynical and unsympathetic to humans with magic. I always thought he was a very manipulative, untrustworthy character. This interpretation kept me interested in the show.

On the other hand, didn't they fulfill their destiny on the show? Sure, Arthur died, but that was the ending we all knew was coming (right? Because of the legends, right?). At the end we see Gwen in a position of power, and knowing what Merlin did and who Merlin was. Clearly, the actions of Merlin and Arthur lead to Gwen accepting magic in Camelot. They fulfilled their destiny - just not in the way naive, optimistic Merlin thought they would. This theory is slightly undercut by the modern hobo Merlin though. He clearly exists in our world, today, at the end of the show - a magicless world where no one even believes in witchcraft or anything like that.",0,1383720439,null,0,false,0,cd7wdyi,t3_1pzn1k,t1_cd7wdyi,t3_1pzn1k,null,1428771635,8,false,merlinbbc,t5_2s3xe,8

I know which government I personally prefer, also I have lived in Britain for a very long time and the UK government is becoming more Victorian and draconian in its methods more every day. 

My comments are by no means even 1% nationalist, because I'm proud of my self and friends and what I stand for, not a nation or people I can account for. It appears to me that many british person who get involves with this conversation on reddit attack the German government prior to questioning the behaviour of their own. Of course its a PR stunt and a show, but thats what governments do, they wag their tail for treats while devising evil little plans. 

But again as I've mentioned before, it's not so much the concept of spying, it's the tenacity of the USA and Britain who feel that can construct nets or perform ""mass surveillance"" without cause or justification, I can't argue against the normal type of spying which occurs, even if I don't agree with it.

~~I definitely share his frustration with laundry! I would kill for the tumble dryer I had in my house back in the US. Sometimes, as I'm hanging up laundry, I imagine how nice it was: it was a dedicated unit with a huge drum, and I could have an entire load of clothes dry in 1 hour--1.5 hours on low heat. Ah, for those halcyon days of washing and drying 3 loads of laundry in a single day, and wearing the clothes the next...~~ EDIT: I'm buying a tumble dryer. It *does* seem more common to air-dry laundry here, but my days of fiddling with a clothes horse are numbered. EDIT2: I am dumb for not buying a tumble dryer.

The NHS makes up for it though.

I have to say, culturally I haven't had too much of a problem. Things are a little different, but not *that* much--I'd done quite a bit of traveling before, though, and I moved here from San Francisco, so maybe I'm a little more used to it. I used to live in South Carolina; if I'd come over to the UK straight from there, I think I would've had a much rougher time adjusting.

Even with the laundry issues, I share this guy's opinion: I wouldn't go back.

EDIT: I'm going to expand more on a non dryer related topic...I really like British semi-rural areas much more than the US. It's hard to articulate, but US light-commercial areas, with dilapidated strip malls, car lots, etc. are *so* ugly when compared to the same in the UK. There's a dinginess there that doesn't really exist in the UK. Also, I really like villages. In the US, there aren't so many discrete villages like in the UK (this is less true for New England). Commercialization/development sputters along in a much more spread-out fashion rather than being condensed around a small settlement...it's much less lovely.

I *do* miss the amount of completely undeveloped land in the US, however.

Okay, so the [new Nuclear power plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station) has a capacity of 3,600MW.

Our current power consumption (2008 figures) is apparently [344,700,000MW-h/year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption)

So is my maths here right? 

(344,700,000 / 365) / 24 = 39,349.31MW/h &lt;== Consumption, per hour, in the UK..

So to meet that requirement with nuclear we'd need:

39,349.31 / 3,600 = 10.93

So, eleven of those nuclear power plants could power us. 

This power plant is estimated to cost £14bn and take about 10 years to build..

So lets round down to 10 plants needed since we have wind and all that jazz.

£140bn over 10 years to switch to nuclear. 

£14bn a year, for 10 years.

Unlike an ISA, you'll pay tax on a current account, but even with tax taken off the rate should beat an ISA. That said, if you ditched all your bonds, you have the funds to fill your cash ISA allowance and have money left over for a current account.

Which isn't entirely fair, or true. The events *did* actually happen, you just assume they were just jumped on and given an alternative connotation by people with an ulterior motive. But without knowing the motives of the teachers involved, who can say *why* the kids were encouraged to find alternative lyrics to that particular song in the first place? Were they encouraged to find ""better"" lyrics, tacitly suggesting to young minds that a ""black sheep"" is not suitable? Why that particular song, and not one explicitly dealing in colours already - I can Sing A Rainbow, for instance. Whether you like it or not, there's not just black and white but many shades of grey in between. To accuse either side of being 100% to blame is disengenuous.

Nethertheless, it still doesn't detract from the fact it is seemingly impossible to criticize anyone without being labelled a racist ... even when the criticisms have NOTHING to do with race anyway.

**Selflessness**
Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.

**Integrity**
Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.

**Objectivity**
In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit.

**Accountability**
Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.

**Openness**
Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.

**Honesty**
Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.

**Leadership**
Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.

The show isn't ""live TV"", not even close. It's recorded ""as live"" which means there's an active feed from the vision mixer and all the camera feeds and the main record are ingested into an edit suite digitally and ""multi-camera editing"" techniques are used to choose the best shots, such as reactions of guests or presenters. The whole show would take around 3 hours to record  and all the chuff and unfunny stuff, interjections, etc are edited out to create a sensible and viewable show. 

Secondly, he knew what he was signing up for when going on the show. His agent, if he has one (likely) knew what was going to happen when he went on the show. The show exists on mocking the music industry and the guests that partake. You have a choice as a guest, to go along with it and enjoy this mockery or not go on and enjoy your social life/career doing other things.

Finally, let's look at the other two people who's stormed off famously from this show:

Lemmy from Motorhead - who stormed off after the show had finished recording, and Preston, some nobody who was dating a Paris Hilton look-a-like, who stormed off when Simon Amstel mocked relentlessly his girlfriend's vacuous attempt at an autobiography.

Buzzcocks has always been about breaking down brands and false images set up by pretentious celebrities. It has always been about mocking those over-confident, self absorbed personalities such as Penny Smith or Bill Oddie who think they are magically immune to criticism. The guest's attitudes on the show directly dictate the treatment they will get. This is why morons like Dappy from N-dubz are so popular, they live in their own little world which invariably comes crashing down and gets mocked when they try to impose that little world on others! Dappy embraced it, at least, and took the piss out of himself, and others like Donny Tourette had their ""hard man"" punk persona blown out of the water by people paid to weaken their pretentious self indulgence.

My Mum works with children who really should have been taken out of abusive familial situations, but haven't been.

The damage is done by the time a child is 5 or so, and the shitty foundations that are laid can screw up a kid for the rest of their life.

I think a childs' right to a decent upbringing is far more important than a parents right to a family and a child. That said, I'm more than willing to accept that some of the things I personally have seen would have influenced my thinking on this.


To be fair though, I challenge anyone to see some of those things and not feel strongly on this.

Part of the problem is the attitude people have towards asking for help as well. They struggle, don't ask for help, then screw up raising a kid.

It was in care where I was subjected to emotional and physical abuse simply because other kids, who were suffering, had lied to authorities and blamed my parents. They were innocent, I had never been abused until I was taken into 'care'. I turned out OK, though it took many years to get back on track and I lost my childhood at 6.

In this past week I have seen an ENT consultant surgeon and have had surgery scheduled in a few weeks' time.  There was no direct cost to me.
Tonight my GP (family doctor) rang at 8pm to check in on another health issue.  She is chasing a consultant to authorise a new medication and will ring me back next week.  This did not cost me a penny.  
So, three doctors and one medical procedure without a form to fill in or a bill to pay.  Pretty damn impressive stuff --yes, I know it is in our taxes but the system works well.  It is 'from birth to grave' care all woven together into one service -- ambulance to GP to hospital to nursing care.  There are all kinds of synergies created by such a system.  It is to be deeply respected, emulated, and not feared.

This made me just a little bit more proud to be British.

Instead, you're expected to have a combination washer/dryer which will take 6 hours to make your clothes marginally less damp.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"&gt; or maybe I'm stupid and I've done the figures wrong



No you are not stupid. My maths works out using separate figures we generate 69 TWh ( terra watt hours per year from nuclear ) and that is 18.9 % of our total electricity needs.

[Source](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2013_FINAL_WEB.pdf)

69 TWH is 69,000,000 MWHs per year or ( /  365/ 24 ) = 7,876 MW per hour generate from out current nuclear. This provides 18.9% of our power.

So 100% is (100/18.9)x 7,876 = 41,700 mhw our total electicity use from all sources per hour
41,700Mwh / 3,200Mwh =  13.03 ie 13 nuclear reactors 

[It's a 3,200 Mwh reactor according to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station)

13x£14bn = £182 Billion 

last year the government had total revenues of [£592 billion]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_United_Kingdom )

Even rounding to £200 billion over 10 years it would cost us £20 billion a year for ten years or 3.4% of our net revenues. However it would provide much cheaper electricity.  France has [79%](http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2013_FINAL_WEB.pdf)  of it's electricity generated by nuclear power and costs 11p/Kwh 

I would love to compare it to the cost of the bank bail out but if you look at the [treasury figures](http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/HMT_account_2010_2011.pdf)  beyond the headline grabbing £1.162 trillion - you will see that a lot of this is loans or loan guarantees ( ie paying *only* if the banks fail to pay back money they borrow  )  which is different from actual non-recoverable money spent.

The argument being that not voting can be confused with apathy and is not useful as a means to promote change. Brand point however is that the system that vote is a part of is not worth engaging in, hence the not voting, but that does not mean being a-political or apathetic hence the protest. 

In fact this is largely the same basic ideas that underlay political anarchy. Anarchy in that sense starts from the premiss that the state is fundamentally immoral which means that you can't really seek the change you want through the systems of that state. Or in other words many of the most politically active people I know are from the punk scene and many of them don't vote but seek other ways to make their voices heard and promote change.

As such it's a little disingenuous to attempt to trip him up both coming and going because of *your* view of the power of protest. Something we've seemingly been taught to vastly underestimate in this country the last few decades.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"The title is a little heavy handed, but all in all the author isn't necessarily off the mark with the sentiment of the article.

Ade is in all honestly one of the great examples of wasted potential in the PL.  When Ade is motivated he is an elite level striker but he continually seems to slide back into a state of disinterest in putting forth consistent effort, one game he is unstoppable, the next game he can't be seen on the pitch.

Truth is, if he had ever pieced together how to consistently put forth his top level performances he would have never been available to Spurs.  City would have never let him go, City would have never let him go on loan to Real let alone loan him to Spurs and then sell him. City may not have ever made the move for Dzeko if Ade figured out how to be consistent and work within the team.

It makes me curious about what it takes to get Ade to play at his best.  Good ole 'Arry got him to perform yet when AVB got his hands on him they haven't seemed to mesh, even when Ade played well for us last season it seemed he was all but anonymous the following game (or 3).  

Makes me wonder if 'Arry just stroked Ade's ego and combined with his lackadaisical practice methods and tendency to just put the same lads on the pitch was the perfect situation for Ade to succeed?  It is such a player friendly laid back environment that was combined with Ade's search for a way out from City's reserves that everything clicked.  Was 'Arry's tenure essentially the perfect storm for Ade to succeed?

Now with AVB, the players are asked to work a bit harder in practice, they are asked to be more tactically astute, toss in Ade's seemingly questionable work rate and a number of off the pitch issues and it makes me wonder if Ade would ever be able to get out of AVB's doghouse.

Its a shame that Ade can't piece together what it takes to be at his best form more often because he could be exactly what we need on the pitch if he did put the puzzle together.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;Actually, I believe in protest. It is a sign that our current political system, although deeply flawed, is worth engaging in.

Protest don't have to have anything to do with the system, voting does. That's kinda the whole point here.

&gt;But I believe in it within a democratic framework

That's up to you, just like it's up to Brand, you just can't apply your value judgement to his actions and claim hypocrisy. You can debate it if you like but your post above wasn't a debate it was statement. 

&gt;I wonder how many of the people at that protest, or who are now agreeing with Russel voted for electoral reform when we had the chance. Or voted at all for that matter.

Your value judgements aside the whole AV referendum was a joke start to finish. It was done as a sop to the lib dems and a watered down one at that. The campaign was rushed and so fully of misinformation that the people not already informed had no real chance of getting a fair understanding. People keep trotting this out as ""we had a chance"" but more than anything it typifies exactly the problem with asking people in power to take steps that might undermine that power.

&gt;All the ""anarchists"" and ""punks"" that I know, and I know a fair few from various scenes, all happily engage with ""the system"" on a financial level, whilst plotting it's downfall. Talk about biting the hand that feeds eh?

If you want your strawmen to be taken seriously you'd do better not to make them actually vaguely represent the point that was being made. I'm not interested in your laughably narrow view of what you've determined a punk or an anarchist should be. The point remains that protest can be political action outside of any given political system.  Of course you think all protest is engagement with the system so I can see why you'd want to avoid talking about that.

&gt;But at least they have a coherent ideology. The more I see of Brand, the more I am convinced that he is interested in self promotion to promote his next tour/dvd..

And that's a perfectly valid opinion for you to have but asking people not to vote and then going on a protests is *not* a logical example of incoherency. All you've offered above boils down to ""but it is because I said so"", which is not compelling.

It says advice centres have seen a 64% increase in the number of people coming to them after being sanctioned.

The goverment must be seen to be supporting UK interests and industry at all times. Do any of us believe that in this day and age, the UK needs two aircraft carriers, a nuclear deterrent and a fleet of nuclear submarines? The defence industry keeps a lot of people in work, and maintains the UK's prestige more than anything. The government is very insistent on maintaining a ""UK capability"" for our engineering and defence (nuclear power stations recently being an embarrassing exception).

If the shipyards in Scotland are kept open, the concern is that should Scotland become independent, the government (and, by extension, BAE) will feel they are obliged to move production back to what remains of the UK, losing thousands of Scots defence workers their employment. Keeping the shipyards opens means that this fear will likely stop a lot of people voting for independence.

As for the relationship between BAE and the goverment, I think it can quite safely be described as ""cosy"". BAE's predecessor, [British Aerospace, was a former goverment-owned organisation, and one which the government still has the power to veto foreign control of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Aerospace).

Besides, this would indicate that at least *some* industries would have been subsidised relics, no? Are those closing given that they can't adapt even with state support, or do we keep them open to drag on the rest of the economy, sucking in both taxes and employees from sectors which could actually be successful?

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"As someone who worked as an Engineer on the Carrier program, and on the yards in Portsmouth, Scotstaun and Rosyth, here’s my 50p;

It’s been known for some time that the UK couldn’t sustain the size of its military shipbuilding industry with the predicted defence spending on the Navy over the next decade. The first carrier is only two thirds of the way through construction, but already a lot of metal has been cut on sections for the second carrier. As the metalworking stage of the carrier program tails off, the yards workload will drop to a third of its current level over the next few years, before recovering to two thirds once the frigate replacement program starts manufacture.

It’s not hard to see that one of BAE’s three yards was for the chop. In fact a procurement officer told me in March that there was already a deal with the MoD to close one yard by the years end in exchange for a guaranteed workload. But which one?

The three big yards BAE runs include Portsmouth in the south, and Govan and Scotstaun on the Clyde (and of course the submarine yard in barrow). Govan is the oldest, but cutting jobs in Scotland is obviously going to be politically unpopular with the upcoming independence vote. Basing all of the UK’s military surface-ship building in one location might not be too popular with the Admirals, but it has other advantages in centralising the workforce and balancing workload between the yards. From a workplace cultural point of view, Portsmouth is still very distinct from the yards on the Clyde (despite having been part of the same company for quite a few years now).

There was noise about sustaining the third yard through winning foreign or commercial business, but it was never a practical idea. UK labour rates mean that shipbuilding here simply isn’t competitive compared to Asian countries. I’d like to say the quality was better for that cost, but sadly it really isn’t. The ammount of shipbuilding they do has given them a level of expertise we can't match.
 
The only reason we have any kind of major shipbuilding left in the UK is because legally all warships must be built in UK waters (even non-military vessels like the MARS naval tankers were contracted out to Korea, to be re-fitted by BAE with communications gear once they are complete).

This also has a major implication for the Scottish independence vote; if the Scots decide to leave the UK, shipbuilding on the Clyde will end. The UK won’t legally be able to build the Type 26 there, and the SNP hasn’t shown any enthusiasm to maintain the level of defence spending required to sustain two major shipyards in Glasgow, in addition to the refit/assembly yard in Edinburgh.

I don't expect Arsenal to renew their interest in him - seems fucking stupid, with their range of midfield options. 

Assuming hypothetically that he joins us, how successful he is would depend almost entirely on how Rodgers handles him and Gerrard. IMO, the two of them together isn't advisable - their skill sets overlap too much. If Cabaye's pencilled in to rotate with, and eventually take over from, Gerrard, then it'd work - but I don't know if he'll wait around to do that.

Cabaye doesn't play as the furthest forward midfielder for Newcastle - he sits deep alongside a destroyer, with the more mobile Sissoko playing a box-to-box role. Sound familiar?

Cabaye is more mobile than Gerrard, though, and shoots more often than Gerrard does nowadays (sigh). Gerrard is more creative, because he's, well, Gerrard - but if we were looking for a short-to-medium-term inheritor for Gerrard's role, Cabaye wouldn't be the worst shout.

&gt;If someone does show up but spoils their ballot I think it sends a clearer message that you are not content with the options provided.

Which is predicated on the idea that being provided an option you like would actually matter. Or in other words it simply comes down to if you think the system can be saved by the system. Some people are starting to feel it can't... at which point not voting is largely the only logical step. 

You don't engage with that that you don't recognise. I'd suggest watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AivEQmfPpk) by CGPGrey about what makes a country a country. It's an interesting illustration of the power of recognition in providing legitimacy. A country is largely only really a country is other countries largely agree it is. A government is only really a government if those it governs recognises it as such... Which is not to say I think we are on the door step of some revolution* but (and I realise this is subjective :P) I don't think you reading far enough to your line of thinking. You kinda get hung up at being provided an options when the whole argument here is about the wider validity of choosing at all.  

&gt;I think that would be a more meaningful gateway towards change.

Something I actually still largely agree with... maybe less ardently that I used to but I still think meaningful change can be best produce with in the system. I've just found myself largely playing devils advocate on this issue lately because I think there is an very valid point of view about this that is being too easily dismissed. 

I feel like some people (not talking about you in this case) are being incredibly patronising about this born out of kind of arrogance that means they are not listening to what Brand and many people before him are actually saying. If you are going to convince people engagement is important you are going to have more luck if you actually understand their viewpoint and can work to engage them with the idea their points are actually valid. Because frankly they are and many people could learn a lot about their own points of view by considering them.

* On a side note there's a very strong feeling of the inevitability of the status quo in this country... in terms of an out and out revolution I think there's actually many historically unique reasons that this may even be the case. It's also, however, a fallacy of human nature that I'm sure many people have felt about many states before it happens. People may dismiss talk of a revolution as a unthinkable joke but in doing so they are underestimating and undermining their own empowerment turning it in to a self fulfilling prophecy... again we loop back to this idea that many things are only what they are so long as people largely agree them to be.

So tuition is probably weighted towards the fulfilling rather than unfulfilling, if that makes sense. 

IT s mostly unfulfilling in itself but it's something I can do that isn't too horrendous, I can do it at home and set my own hours and I am lucky to have a bunch of clients that I relate to informally and have good working relationships. I do find it fulfilling to go out of my way and do something that makes them happy especially when mostly they came to me after someone else had made them unhappy. But that's really a Freudian hang up to do with father issues, anyway.

The irony in this is not missed by me but, in some strange way, makes the art all the more powerful. 

If we consider the slightly confused expression of the artist (or the person acting in that role, perhaps, I couldn't tell) we might wonder to what extent the feeling is a result of the spliff (marijuana is very strong these days) bringing on anxiety or is it perhaps concern about whether the subject is going to be successful in scoring once he gets the money he's owed. 

Possibly, the artist is waiting for money he's owed for marijuana he himself is selling. To be honest, I can't make out the content of his lyrics due to the exotic accent which may even have originated North of Watford and is thus leaving me in a fog. 

Having said that, it occurs to me that the obscured lyrics, also mixed quite low against the other audio tracks, have been made that way to lend a sense of mystery which cleverly juxtaposes the banality of the environment and the artist's wardrobe with the viewer/listeners perplexion.

Not always but sometimes.  It is a known thing that agencies do; throw up a very temping position in a given industry (semi-low skill but high paying IT position for example) and use the responses to stuff your database.  

You also have the aggregators at work.  For example cv-library or adzuma (two I discovered via UJM) are just scraping results from Monster &amp; Jobserve and shoving them into their own database (often with different titles due to scraping errors). 

The position was originally posted on say Brook Streets website and they also pushed it to Monster.   So in reality there is only 1 job listed twice but due to some, in my opinion, quite skeezy operators it LOOKS like there are 4 - 5 jobs available.

true,broshay,null,null,"Hmm, lets see. The major issue with the NHS is that it's out of money. How is the NHS traditionally funded? TAXES, that's right folks, it's paying taxes that is actually needed at this stage, but currently there is a shit ton of tax breaks available to you if you are wealthy, and if you are on benefits the only taxes you pay are purchase related. The Governemnt has gotten itself deep into this mess by their own policies.

Here is a couple of examples. They discouraged smoking everywhere, where the majority of the price on tobacco products is tax, so how much revenue is lost there (and talking a lifetime of smoker tax vs end of life treatment, which gets cheaper as the tech gets older, a stent is 1k for example, plus you are likely to die of the same things that kills smokers, it's just that you will live longer)

Car tax, an older car will cost you a couple of hundred per year in car tax, plus petrol tax, but, if you can afford a brand new motor or hybrid, your car tax will be as low as nothing, but generally far below £100, including great milage and thus less petrol tax. But of course, generally the people who normally bought the old bangers are no longer about since the price of motoring has gotten so steep all of a sudden that many have abandoned their cars (which also causes it's own economic mischief), not that you can get a cheap banger anymore anyway.

But ignore all the bullshit rhetoric that comes out of the mouthpieces, the actual issue with the health of the nation is economic inequality, and it's been known about for decades. The NHS itself commissioned a report about 30 years ago that is *still* relevant, as the signs of failure were starting to appear even then. It's a report that quietly got buried for obvious reasons due to it's findings (as in sod all could be done) and it's called the Black Report.

I'm not saying that its going to always be bad, but we can't even remotely predict the outcome. We're already becoming more and more self obsessed as a result of the huge role marketing plays in our lives.

Combine this with the fact that we have artistic content that is created as a result of marketing exercises, not the exploration of the human condition and you end up with truly horrible shit that, at best, adds no value to anything, at worst brings out some of the most negative human behaviour. 

Our drinking culture, for example, is almost entirely a marketing exercise and the impact this has on policing, health and society as a whole is almost exclusively negative.

&gt; First, his defensive work rate for someone in his position is outstanding

It really isn't. He gets back, yes- but no more than someone who plays his position is expected to. Now awful, but a mile off outstanding. 

&gt; Second, the difference in Baines' effectiveness with and without Pienaar on the field is exponential

The quality of Baines's performances with and without Pienaar over the past year or so don't really back this up. Once we go further back than that, then yes- it is certainly the case, but now it is far less clear. Baines has been fantastic this season without Pienaar, and his emergence has done nothing to improve is play, in fact vs Spurs they were absolutely laughably bad- creating zero chances down the left flank. Spurs played very well, yes... But zero chances is hardly evidence of a stunning partnership. 

&gt; Third his creative ability in the attacking third eclipses anyone else on our roster

This in only when he is in form though, and he is in form in far less than 50% of games- and even then I would say that Coleman, Deulofeu, Mirallas and Kone (if he wasn't broken) are as, or more creative.

But by simply following the system I'm wasting my time, the employers time and the JCP advisers time.  

&gt;The OP brings up a 'carers' position as unsuitable but the last time I checked that needed no special equipment or even extensive technical training.

A lot of the positions I've seen advertised require an NVQ 1 or NVQ 2 in caring.  They are probably exceptionally easy examinations to get but the position requires them and the employer isn't prepared to accept someone without them.

Quite so but that isn't a distinction the DWP make.  To use both examples, I could (in theory but not in practice) be a builder or Carer, but I'd need some quite simple and relatively cheap equipment (but not something someone on JSA could afford) or qualifications before I can apply for them.   The DWP itself goes to great lengths to move a lot of positions from the later category to the former.

true,giltirn,null,null,"&gt; the NHS is great in its simplicity, but GPs are so overworked that they simply hand out antibiotics like sweeties in lieu of doing any real investigation. And woe and betide if you ever have anything wrong with you that requires more dedicated medical investigation. You'll have months, possibly years of specialist appointments with at least a month of waiting time between each until you reach a diagnosis. I love the NHS but this is the true reality of it.

As a Brit who has been living in the US for over 3 years, I have to report that things are no better here. The medical system is designed around making money, so you have to be very careful when you go to the doctor that they don't try to screw you. TV ads are chock full of pharma advertisements, all advising to 'Ask your doctor about Oxytropin!' or whatever, and when you go to the doctor they often just hand it over no questions asked (especially for low-risk consumer drugs like sleeping pills, diet pills, viagra, etc). After all, the insurance companies foot the bill, the patient pays some of it and the doctor usually gets a kickback from the pharma company, so they have nothing to lose. The money they make is proportional to the amount of patients they see, so the only thing they care about is balancing the risk of being sued against their throughput. They also have a culture of overtesting (read: $$$$$$); my doctor was aghast that I did not have a recent (or in fact any) full body x-ray results. Go in for a head cold and they'll have you giving blood and urine samples. Sure there are good doctors, but there are also many more doctors who are only in it for the money.

Holtby is phenomenal, but he lacks some of the foresight to create plays (I absolutely believe he will get there, but he's not quite there yet). Holtby is an absolute shot of adrenaline when he enters a match, which is why I see his value off the bench. When the team is showing signs of getting on their heels, throw him into the mix to wake everyone up. Should this mean he is in from the get-go? Perhaps, but I see more value in Holtby coming off the bench than Eriksen... as it takes Eriksen some time to adjust to his surroundings before he starts picking them apart.

To wrap it up... I guess my point is Eriksen is flat when he comes of the bench and Holtby comes into a match like a lightning bolt.

He may try and take on the extra man too often, but to call him greedy is pretty crazy. He is far less so than Barkley and his overactive trigger finger. What he is is amazingly direct, but that is not a bad thing at all- having that ability and confidence to stretch a defence is an asset for an attacking midfielder as it opens up a lot of space for other players, and I certainly don't equate direct with Selfish- Mirallas, Hazard, hell- even Walcott now are great direct players who have a positive influence on the team as a whole. 

And I don't get the Sterling comparison at all. Sterling is a completely different player, short, slight and agile, whereas Zaha is much stronger and will bully defenders in addition to beating them with his skill. Unlike Sterling, or a lot of attacking midfielders he is great with his back to goal; able to hold off players and wait for a runner to come in, or turn a CB to get a shot away. Whilst this is going to be far tougher for him to do as a PL player, he has more than enough ability to grow into it, and nobody expects a complete package at 20 anyway. 

Also, all pace no class... Bonkers. He is oozing skill, good off the ball (although needs to learn to track back), strong, technical and fearless. Yes there is room for improvement in his finishing and tweaking around other aspects, but for a 20 year old he has all the potential to become a real top class player, which is why Fergie was so drawn to bringing him into Man Utd.",0,1383750126,null,0,false,0,cd81x3f,t3_1pubo9,t1_cd81x3f,t1_cd7mtq5,null,1428768982,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

I remember asking my mother in my early teens if you could just go to the doctor for a general check-up and being told that was a silly idea. As I understand it that's not really a problem in the US, and it's recommended in the same way as people go to dentists for a general check-up even when they have no problems. Considering stuff like cancer is much more treatable if caught early, that seems a considerable advantage, even if it does lead to getting full body X-rays for a head cold.

It is a tough one. I would however argue that very few people NEED to drive their entire journey to work (and in conjunction I would LOVE to see train fares fall significantly), many people could get away with driving to the railway-station, or driving to the city limits and cycling the rest. And yes this will mean that some people will have to be more effort in so we can a collective again as a society.

I would like think that their could be some provision in place so that we don't sting people who need their vehicle for their work (as an oppose to people who, think they need their vehicle to get to work) such as tradesmen and delivery people. Perhaps some sort of tax rebate on fuel (again we could probably work something in there to encourage the use of lower emission and safer cars).

&gt;enjoy driving

I am afraid I don't have much time for people who are driving purely for joy; at least not in our cities; our roads are already greatly over capacity and the air quality is already very poor. Personally I would like to see more pedestrianisation in our city centres along with congestion charges where necessary.

Also this is not punishing the overweight percentile of our population, it's about making a genuine shift towards a more human powered culture (think Holland/Denmark).

Expect many many places to turn you down, but with so many small IT/software places in Belfast it is possible that one of them would pick up someone like yourself on a temporary basis. 

Good luck. I can only speak about software myself but in the meantime if you are looking into software pick up a few books or do online courses, C and python are highly sought after languages. Look into ""Learn C the hard way"" online or get Kernighan and ritchie (small white book - pretty much everything about the fundamentals of C inside) and read through it and do all the exercises (I am doing this presently and it is teaching me a lot on the job). For python there is Learn Python the hard way and I cannot speak to any other reading material but /r/programming is your friend.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;It is a tough one. I would however argue that very few people NEED to drive their entire journey to work (and in conjunction I would LOVE to see train fares fall significantly), many people could get away with driving to the railway-station, or driving to the city limits and cycling the rest. And yes this will mean that some people will have to be more effort in so we can a collective again as a society.

When public transport is as convenient, quick and comfortable as driving, and can offer the same value for money, I will happily begin using public transport.

But that will never, ever happen.

&gt;I would like think that their could be some provision in place so that we don't sting people who need their vehicle for their work (as an oppose to people who, think they need their vehicle to get to work) such as tradesmen and delivery people. Perhaps some sort of tax rebate on fuel (again we could probably work something in there to encourage the use of lower emission and safer cars).

Those of us who drive are already hit extremely hard. And I live 25 miles from work. It would take me nearly three hours and cost almost £20 to get to work using public transport.

I drive a nine-year-old SAAB. It is not economical at all, but it is extremely safe. I pay *huge* amounts in tax already, both on fuel and car tax, and don't see why I should be hit further.

I cannot hope to own an economical car in the near future for the simple fact that they are too expensive. It's all very well saying that they work out cheaper in the long run, but I cannot afford the up front cost.

Until then, I will continue to drive a large, fast, uneconomical car, because it is a trade off between the vast expense inconvenience and discomfort of public transport, and the mind-blowing tedium of driving an old, slow, economical car.

&gt;I am afraid I don't have much time for people who are driving purely for joy; at least not in our cities; our roads are already greatly over capacity and the air quality is already very poor. Personally I would like to see more pedestrianisation in our city centres along with congestion charges where necessary.

Most people aren't driving through the cities though. They're on A-roads and motorways. Traffic is often a problem, but most of the time it's really not. 

As for pedestrianizing city centres. That's fine, but sort out public transport first.

&gt;Also this is not punishing the overweight percentile of our population, it's about making a genuine shift towards a more human powered culture (think Holland/Denmark).

I'm not sure what you mean by 'human powered culture'. Why is it better?

The only one talking about punishment here is you. I want to incentivise active lifestyles for everyone, not punish those who choose to drive.

What is his point? 

Politicians suck? We all know that already...

If you take anything away form this article, let it be the advice of the 15 year-old.

There is nothing wrong with not casting a vote, but a far more efficient and effective way of showing your discontent and disillusionment is to purposely destroy your ballot. If you really care about the lack of care being shown to the country, take the time to go to a polling place and spoil your ballot, these are recorded in the UK.

Write ""F*** Off (Insert current weasely politician here)"", or ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore"", or draw a big penis, whatever.

But we are given the privilege and the right to make our voices heard every four years. Make sure you use it.

Good old Russel. Sitting back, attacking others for being lazy and spewing that the UK management is faulty and needs changing. Of Course he wont actually do anything to change it, nor will he suggest any actual effective solutions to problems that these ""duplicitous servants of The City"" have to try and solve daily. Instead he just writes fluff pieces and goes on news shows whilst then partying and fucking about. He sounds like the perfect Redditor.

Those who choose to drive punish who those who choose not to. My ride to work would be a lot nicer and safer if I didn't have to deal with congested traffic and drivers with roadrage up to the wazoo (and yes I have been hit by a car in the last year).

&gt; I drive a nine-year-old SAAB. It is not economical at all, but it is extremely safe. I pay huge amounts in tax already, both on fuel and car tax, and don't see why I should be hit further.

Safe how? If it's not economical then it's not very safe to my lungs as I cycle on the same road as you.

&gt;I cannot hope to own an economical car in the near future for the simple fact that they are too expensive

Well swings and roundabout, if you had a more economical care you wouldn't have to pay as much emissions duty, buy as much fuel and thus as much tax on that fuel.

Because more people walking and cycle has absolutely no downsides.

That's in no way comparable. That is basically your average high street serving a small town - any of the residents in the way could walk up there and buy stuff. There are actually small town shops in there.

US Strip malls? ugly structures in the middle of nowhere where you have no hope of getting to without a car. Not even through public transport in most cases (apart from taxis).

They are basically the product of lazy zoning - someone zoned a shopping area, literally simcity style, gave it some space for parking and hoped to get it up and running.

Safe in that it is physically safe. It is safe to me.

Defenders: 

* Eliaquim Mangala: A commanding presence in the backline, huge build, extremely strong, great header of the ball, fantastic positioning,quite pacy and is a great passer of the ball.

I was on a trip for work, and they basically brushed me off saying it had nothing to do with them. Fought it, lost, lost people I thought were friends, as they had to lie to keep their jobs. Then just after, my dad died and I completely lost it.

Fell into a horrific depression. Loaded up on pain meds and anti-depressants, I just wanted to die. I still get the feeling constantly, and anything can set me off. Nerve damage in my back and arm means 24/7 pain, very little sleep, and doped up when i'm awake. I made the mistake of laying off the painkillers when my ATOS thing happened, so I could be clear and concise, and answer questions correctly.

Yeah, I'm fit for work. My job centre advisor read my stuff, talked to me, and told me to come back in 6 months as there was no chance they could find a job that suits me. 

If there is anyone out there that can hire me, I'm here! I can't answer the phone as I'm scared people are after me, the ringer is turned off at the moment. I can't go outside without my girlfriend, so you'll need to hire her too. I can't really use my right hand/arm, and am doped up to the gills I sometimes forget to answer when my girlfriend asks me something.

Hey, as an Englishman, can I ask you a question?

Why is it that the behavior of your countryfellows can change so dramaticaly from one day to another? I had a collegue who was nice one day, then froze up and treated me like some unwanted stranger for days. Then asked me if I wanted to go with them to have a coffee break. Rinse and repeat. I can't deal with this sort of bi-polar behavior. And she's not the only one, just the most obvious one.

Or my present collegue who went from friendly from last week (I've only been here for a month) to measured and cold this week. Obviously here I might have crossed a line but where and how? I remember an incident on Friday but that was mostly annoying for my person: someone said something about what a third guy did the day before, and was embarrassing. She did not want to repeat it, even though I asked her to (she talked way too fast for me to understand). They just pretended I wasn't there asking the question, and carried on with their conversation. If anything it was mildly offensive to me.

Or rubbing alcohol. Or that there are no tumble dryers. Or that Nyquil is better than Night Nurse, despite Night Nurse being stronger (and otherwise,  identical). You have to practically take them by the hand to their local supermarket to show them the frozen fruit and sliced cheese that somehow, they've missed. It's crazy.

Elite athletes don't get super fit and *then* choose a sport. Kids push themselves to the next level in the sports they are passionate about. These days the US Youth Soccer system has more kids (3.5mill) than US youth baseball (2mill). There is no stigma about it being foreign for kids. The club programs have grown so rapidly that many quality teenage players no longer even play for their high schools, because they'd rather be able to travel abroad with their club. It's true that the final steps of professional/world-class level are more difficult to achieve without the service of, say, Ajax's youth system, but I really feel that a US star should breakout soon given the expansion of the sport domestically.

The jobs situation will only get worse over the long-term, if you believe that technology is making more and more jobs obsolete without equal replacements. Sure, perhaps there are some areas where people can retrain. But retraining for any job worth doing takes time and effort. University has become a costly investment, and it doesn't necessarily pay off. So, the government's solution is to deny the problem. The jobcentre works on the assumption that enough jobs actually exist. People get job placements for ""experience"" in the world of dead-end jobs which create ZERO value for society, only enriching the elite and making it a buyer's market. Companies can afford to be extremely selective with who they employ, and then discard you back onto the jobcentre pile when they feel like it.

Meanwhile, the government loves to deify the ""Captains of Industry"" and ""Job Creators"" as if they are doing a noble service to society. Some do, but the vast majority don't have altruistic motives in mind when they, for example, put workers on minimum wage  zero-hour contracts and fire - no, cut their hours - if they object.

However when talking about Togo having a better player than the US has ever produced it isn't it all shocking because the changes that have been occuring are relatively recent and have been slowly building.  

Think back just 10 years to the culture surrounding US soccer when the best known US athletes playing the sport were Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain.  Naming a male athlete involved in the sport was next to impossible for the average sports fan in the US.

Given that the culture changing is in process but is relatively recent it makes it in no way surprising that virtually any other county would produce a better athlete than the US thus far.  That could and should change with the US is just reaching a renaissance of sorts in regards to the sport.

Companies who operate graduate schemes are generally very elitist because the sheer amount of people looking for a job enables them to filter the pool of potential applicants to what they want. Numerous graduate schemes, not just in finance/accountancy/actuarial jobs but also in any job in general ask for anywhere between 300 (BBB at A Level) and 340 (AAB at A Level) UCAS Points; even companies like Nestlé demand 300 points in all their graduate schemes no matter the role. After a while of being told (in polite terms) to fuck off without being able to continue the online application because I gave the honest answer that I only obtained 260 UCAS Points across my top 3 A Levels and acknowledged that by not ticking a box, I've kinda given up on graduate schemes. What employers are essentially telling me is that I should never have wasted three years of my finite life by going to university and that my 2:1 means nothing because I underachieved in my A Levels.

I have tried directly approaching companies inquiring about work experience and job opportunities going and have even emailed my CV along to them. Some companies won't even respond to you. Others will give you the typical textbook ""Please refer to our website here for any opportunities we may have going"" response.

The next problem.... job sites. I have tried numerous job sites and the best it has given me is lots of mindless inbox spam either from the site itself or from recruiters about potential jobs that have either expired or demand vastly more experience than I currently have. The even bigger mindfuck is that I've responded to a few of these emails within the same day voicing my interest and then I get what seems like an automated ""I am sorry to say that the position has already been filled"" email back either the next day or on the same day.

After reading the horror stories here, I'm glad I haven't tried to claim JSA yet. The entire system sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare.",0,1383763920,null,0,1383764967,0,cd87q6v,t3_1q0rkn,t1_cd87q6v,t1_cd7zkiz,null,1428766258,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

true,ragewind,uk,,"I wasn't advocating anything i was countering your idea that a gun automatically increases deaths, which is the simplistic way you have put across your points.

why do i think its safe? because yes all legal gun owners have to be properly trained and responsible it comes with the whole process of owning a firearm.

&gt;Because guns are somehow actually safe, every day items that are just misunderstood


in part yes a gun will not shoot anything on its own, nor will it load any ammunition on its own like a knife cant cut anything on its own. they all rely on a human being to do anything, if the user is responsible then its safe.

&gt;The stricter our laws are regarding firearm ownership and usage, the less firearm related crimes, accidents, injuries and deaths will occur as a result. This should not be too hard to grasp.

there is actually no evidence to back that up, infact the stats go counter to that when pistols were banned there was actually an increase in gun crime. in all likeliness the two are not related.

&gt;If you are advocating the right to be able to own and use more firearms in the UK, you are basically suggesting that you're OK with an increase in shootings, accidental or otherwise.

again i wasn't advocating anything in my post but personally yes i would like us to revoke the ban on the mainland for pistols as its a sport i would like to do. im not ok with more shooting but then i don't expect to get more by allowing legally registered shooters to own pistols, if they arnt out killing you with their rifles i don't expect their mental faculty to magically change if they own a pistol. you do know that some of the channel islands have more freedoms that many of the states in the US for access to firearms

&gt;My point is that since guns in the UK (in civilian hands) serve no real use outside of recreation, we should be enforcing strict laws on their ownership and usage.

we already have strict laws, you come across as someone that wants to completely ban then out of ignorant fear of them.

&gt; Currently, the UK enjoys one of the lowest per-capita-deaths-by-firearms rates[1] in the world. This is not because we are somehow more responsible as a nation.

in part it is, we have much better social and health services along with being a lot more progressive and tolerant countrythan many of our counterparts, particularly the US which shits on the poor and persecutes people for any small reason in large areas of their country.

&gt;The USA has a huge gun problem, one that is not easily solved because of the ingrained mentality that everyone should be able to arm themselves to the teeth. And I can't exactly blame them. If all the criminals and undesirables are carrying guns, what upstanding civilian wouldn't want to be able to protect themselves equally in case of trouble?

if it was linked to the number of guns the US would have many more deaths a year due to the sheer number that are there. there problems lie in there level of medical and social services which are below basic which then helps fuel criminal activity's, this is then made worse by the sheer size of the place.
they have massive land boarders on 2 side which makes smuggling of all kinds harder to control along with the size of their coasts. they also have less police officers per capita than the UK whilst covering a larger land mass. the US also has one of the worst prison systems in the developed world which is a driver for the criminals to do all possible to avoid it.
so more driving forces for crime and less resources to stop it is more likely the reason for more criminal use of guns.
the reason for the number of accidental shooting is down to the level of education in the US and the lack of basic training that's where the US has it so wrong.

&gt;If we began to relax our gun laws, we would be starting down a slippery slope that is going to be difficult, if not impossible to recover from.

allowing legal gun owner to use pistols wont make them shoot your like they don't shoot you with their rifles!

&gt;So forgive me if I don't sympathize with you, but I'm going to stand by my opinion that we should not compromise our relatively safe, non-gun oriented culture to appease those few people who have deluded themselves into thinking that just because they are responsible, everyone else will be too.

you seem to think the gun owning community wasn't free carrying of literal machine guns. what people would actually like and your understanding of that are wildly far apart.",0,1383764672,null,0,false,0,cd882b2,t3_1py2mf,t1_cd882b2,t1_cd7w2li,null,1428766101,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I am from a strong engineering backround. and I will openly admit a school leaver would be more succeesful and better adapted to this role than myself. It doesn't mean to say I would refuse it, only it would be a bad idea for everyone involved!.

Second to this however is the 60 jobs per week that you must apply for. this becomes a problem when the only jobs which are available in the ENTIRE REGION are either socail workers or care workers. or part time christmas staff. none of which or suitable to most people.

Theres no point sending someone to a temporary job knowing fine well that they will be claiming again soon after. (the only purpose of this is to satisfy statistics.)

but the biggest problem is that when you are told to apply for 60 jobs per week and you only find 35 in the jobcentre, 20+ of which are for care workers and socail workers.

the real problem here is that there simply isn't enough jobs, and the poor !""£""!6 who is made redundant is gonna have an even worse time when he spoken to like £$""!5 and gets a sanction because the care homes won;t employ him (not many care homes want plummers on the books.

This is a rather odd time of year to be looking for a 'placement', at least in the sense that most people would I think understand it. Think you might be better off just looking for a job for the period of time you need. There are always places who could do with a tester or two over the shorter term. Or is this a longer term thing you want to kick off?

Whats the background anyway? Is it university insisting on you getting a 'placement' as per the course pathway you are on? Family/Personal/Financial issues meaning you have to leave a course temporarily? No course but want on an IT career path ASAP? You don't need to be too specific, but It's hard to give pointers otherwise. If going to recruitment agents, they'll have an easier time finding something relevant if you can give a good summary of your background and what your current objective is beyond 'need placement'.

I had to leave a course part way through a year due to personal circumstances (was around this time of year too). What I wound up doing was getting a tech support call centre job telling them I would work full time until the next september then aiming to go part time after that once I resumed the course. Not a job I enjoyed mind you, but it did give me a good insight/perspective that I brought into my later career.

I was taught to drive at age 14 by my father. We lived in rural Australia, I was full height at that age, and my (elderly) father needed me to be able to operate a car in case of emergencies. 

So I was driving on the town roads and freeways (motorways), without a license, at age 14. My dad was always in the car with me, but I was fully in control.  

My father focussed on relaxed, slow speed driving. ""Anyone can drive fast and recklessly, but driving slowly and evenly is what you need to learn.""

The funny thing was that when I turned 16, and I could get my learners permit, I had to slow down and put an L plate on the car!

This generation of young people have many things to be thankful for, and are probably better off in general than any other generation so far.

It was something like a 4-2-2-2 with Coutinho and Henderson ""wide"" but shifting between central and wide positions - able to support the fullbacks in defence and attack but also moving centrally to press and get in the box (Henderson) or play through balls (Coutinho). 

As for personnel, it means dropping a centre back, probably skrtel. I think Sakho/Toure would make a good pairing but Agger/Toure also worked well at the start of the season. And Toure hasnt played so well lately so Sakho/Agger might be an option...

 I guess we expect Johnson to be available. What about enrique and gerrard?

I hope we can both see where eachother are coming from now and that because we were arguing different points we couldn't see each others POV.

In the end I got an interview at the company my Dad works for, because I'd applied on spec for a job that was only being advertised internally for someone who sits on the same floor as Dad. After the interview, which was successful, the company had a hiring freeze and suggested I come in for a week's Work experience before Christmas to ease into the job I would be getting.

I enquired at the Job Centre if this would be okay. Big mistake. They said if I went through with it I'd be ""unavailable for work"" for that week and wouldn't get benefits. But now I'd mentioned it, if I didn't go through with it, via the Job Centre and for two weeks after Christmas so there was time to administer it, I'd be sanctioned. Should have told them where to shove it, because I'd have been earning money two weeks sooner if the Job Centre hadn't interfered (or if I'd just not told them about it).

I used to live in Nottingham, and while not exactly a prosperous area whenever I was in dire straits I'd sign up with a temp agency and have a semi-stable job next day paying between £6.50 and £8.50 an hour with plenty of overtime at 1.5 times pay available (a big thank you to Pork Farms of pork pies fame: they pay their employees a really decent wage and even temps don't get stumped). A few years later I lived in ~~bumfuck nowhere~~Leominster. Had I been a trained nurse, there would've been jobs galore but outside of that the only jobs available were 6-10h/week cleaning jobs and the seasonal M&amp;M Direct employment around Christmas (which I got without fail — very decent and fair employer by the way). I don't mind scrubbing toilets, I don't mind hard manual labour, I don't mind mind numbingly boring jobs, but there simply wasn't any work available that, at the end of the day, paid better than JSA. I'm not a lazy layabout, I volunteered for charities as much as I was allowed to at the time (the limit was 16hrs/week back then — I *may* have exceeded that a bit) to keep myself occupied along side looking for jobs.

And against all stories I hear on here about how unfair and unpredictable JS+ is on here, the workers there knew just as well as anyone else that there was no work available. Signing on consisted of me handing over my diary, the case worker signing off on it, and on my merry way I was. Don't get me wrong, they did provide support: CV writing help, they had terminals there for the computer illiterate which could spit out print outs of ""job opportunities"" etc. But really, unless you worked in and were qualified for the business of caring for the elderly, jobs just weren't there.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I'm a person.

And a cyclist.

&gt;So far all you've done is make a proposition without support, here is a chance to make a case. I'm quite keen to read the argument on how discouraging driving is unfair.

Quite simply, there is not an alternative, and it is extremely unfair to penalize those that do not have a choice.

Public transport and cycling are both massively inferior to driving in a huge number of situations. Cycling takes far, far too long for a lot of journeys, and public transport is slow *and* expensive.

I've already said that I'll quite happily give up driving when public transport is a viable option, but it simply is not.

In your scenario, I'd be penalized further for using a car every day. But I don't have any other option.

I spend about £15 in petrol and two hours in the car each day. If I wanted to use public transport, it would cost about £20 and 4 hours. If I cycled, it would be free, but I'd spend 5 hours traveling each day.

The last two scenarios are simply not realistic. I cannot afford either of them, either in money or time.

Granted, there are many instances in which the situation would be very different; cycling may be quicker, public transport may be cheaper, but it's unfair to tar everyone with the same brush. Nobody loses out if you incentivize choice. Cyclists naturally believe that cars are a poor choice of transport, because they are quite obviously in a situation in which the bike works for them.

I believe that people should have the choice. Great, get more people out onto their bikes, but there's no need to persecute drivers in the process. We are not nasty, lazy people trying to destroy the world; we are trying to get on with our lives just like everyone else.

The crux of my argument is that I do not attempt to make your mode of transport more expensive, so you should not attempt to do so for mine. *Especially* when you cannot appreciate that different people live in different situations.

true,dugsmuggler,english,good ol' England,"&gt;I don't agree that we necessarily should be looking several generations back. The previous generation is the one most directly comparable, so it seems sensible to make it the basis for comparison. 

I was raised in a farming family, as a livelihood it is almost totally dependent on outside factors, mainly the weather. If we were only to consider the previous summer when planning crops we would head to disaster, and probably bankruptcy. Any ""old boy"" round here looks at the bigger picture and takes into account the last few years - the local pubs are full of these conversations at this time of year.

Like the weather, house prices are something that you and I have no control over. Could politicians really do anything about it? or is it a simple case of supply and demand? 

But then why would property developers create a building boom if it only resulted in a lower profit margin for their finished product? 
Its the same of the oil barons who under produce or otherwise restrict supply in order to hike the prices.

In reality the front 2 with Coutinho at 10 works out just the same way, but i think fluid front 3 is a more accurate way of describing it.

Re: Agger, I have him at LB simply because I would rather him there than Cissokho, and Enrique is injured. I think having either Agger or Sakho deputise in the position is defensively much sounder than having Cissokho, and in attack they can hardly be less effective than he was against Arsenal unfortunately.

Straight 4-4-2 is something I could never imagine us doing- namely for two reasons: it implies a flat midfield 2 and it implies 2 traditional wingers- a line-up in a 4-4-2 would have to be in diamond form or alternatively with the 2 wide midfielders playing in front of two holding midfielders which is better described as a 4-2-2-2. That may be largely semantics but I don't think we'll see Rodgers playing a traditional 4-4-2: that formation is all but extinct now.

In my opinion, I don't think this matters. i.e. the suitable bit

You take a job because you don't want to rely on handouts and not because the job doesn't suit you. You take the job and while doing that job, you search for a job that is suitable. 

Otherwise, you'll likely be on JSA for a year or more trying to find a ""suitable job"". 

I relied on JSA for a month and a half and I applied for any job that I could do. I managed to get myself an internship and worked my butt off to standout. Now I'm working at a large media agency in London because of that opportunity. I would not have been able to do it without JSA and luckily my job centre was quite helpful. Although, at times, they were a pain in the ass. (I actually wrote to my local MP to straighten things out and she got back to me and spoke to my job centre) 

They never really forced me to do anything other than finding at least 6 jobs and applying for them. 

In all honesty, many people won't be able to find a suitable job that fits their profile and background. People seriously need to start taking any job they can get their hands on and while doing that job - they could be applying for jobs that are suitable.

It leaves us with the conservatives still in power, because their voters have got nothing to be upset about. It leaves us with a bunch of votes from 18-30 year olds that are spoilt, most of which would have gone to Labour (I'm by no means a Lab supporter, but I'd prefer them to the Cons).

What happens afterwards?

As long as you leave at 7am each day you should be ok.  Don't join the roundabout at Sherrifhall, rather go past Dobbies and join the A720 (city bypass) there.

Stay on the city bypass until the Sighthill off ramp, and take a left at the first roundabout after Napier Uni.  Follow that road straight so you pass PC world and head over the mini roundabout at Glasgow road up and over DrumBrae.  This'll be the first major sticking point, but you'll need to take a right into queens ferry road.  After that you can stick in it till Stockbridge, or travel via Lauricton castle through Muirhouse and cut in that way.

Alternatively you could take a right onto Glasgow road and go last the zoo, then a left at the crossroads before the Chinese consulate and cut through to Stockbridge that way.

45 mins is fine as long as you know where you are going to park.  Give it an hour the first few times.
