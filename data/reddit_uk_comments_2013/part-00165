true,anagoge,null,null,"The problem with making friends is that you can't really do it in the same social situations that you can when trying to find someone to date. Sure, you have some banter with someone at the bar, but like fuck are you going to ask for some fella's number at the end of it. Imagine!

The solution to this is actually quite simple: Do more things. You say that your hobbies are going out and drinking - me too - but obviously if you do that every weekend you'd be skint. You need things to do that are not remotely alcohol related.

Join some clubs. It doesn't even matter if you have no interest in whatever the club is about, as long as you know that there will be people around your age there. So don't go joining any knitting clubs unless you want some nice new granny friends.

The activity is just an excuse to socialise with people and then, after a few times of getting comfortable with each other, you start to form a friendship that doesn't rely on that activity and you're free to do other things.

There are some good people on this subreddit too, but the difference with that is that you're seeking friendship directly - it's too forced and it's not regular so any friends that you meet here will be more occasional than permanent.

That's why meeting friends at school/college/uni is much easier - you're both there on a regular basis over an extended period of time, but your primary reason for being there is to learn. The friendship is just a nice bonus. Apply this reasoning to other activities - Think about the activity first and the friendship will come on its own.

Having said that, if you're 20-30 odd, you're in good company on this subreddit and you're welcome to make a post asking people to meet up (rather than asking for friends).

I do find Americans very polarised, they don't seem to be good at taking the middle path. I find it annoying that they believe the false histories they are fed at school and also the fact that they think they are more free than people in other countries when some aspects of their lives seem much more controlled or managed than mine in the UK.

However it still brings up questions in my opinion. For example, lets quote some of the things the NHS body’s chief data officer actually said.

&gt; ""We want to ensure that patients, clinicians and staff who plan health services have access to the best possible information to help them improve health outcomes for patients.""

""...staff who plan health services"" is extremely extremely vague.
Lets use for example, the NHS body’s chief data officer previous position ""Senior Director, Outcomes and Analytics, at (abcdef) company"".

""(abcdef) company"" describes themselves like this:

&gt; As the nation's largest drugstore chain with fiscal 2012 sales of $72 billion, (abcdef) company (www.(abcdef)company.com) vision is to become America’s first choice for **health** and daily living. Each day, (abcdef) company provides more than 6 million customers the most convenient, multichannel access to consumer goods and **services** and trusted, cost-effective pharmacy, **health and wellness services** and advice in communities across America. (abcdef) company's scope of pharmacy **services** includes retail, specialty, infusion, medical facility and mail service, along with respiratory **services**. These **services** help improve **health** outcomes and lower costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, **health** systems, pharmacy benefit managers and the public sector. The company operates 8,077 drugstores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Take Care **Health** Systems is a (abcdef) company subsidiary that is the largest and most comprehensive manager of worksite **health** and wellness centers and in-store convenient care clinics, with more than 700 locations throughout the country.

Pedantic emphasis I know, but I just wanted to highlight the point that someone could say ""(abcdef) company plans health services, I am staff at said health service! Open sesame for access to data please(!)"". 

Indeed, the NHS body’s chief data officer presented a research paper with two members of his previous employer and a third other individual **while acting as NHS body’s chief data officer** (so even after he left, he presented the paper on it). 

Next is,
&gt; ""This is why NHS England is developing the care.data service to make better use of health care information. As an early step in this programme, data from GP systems will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), transforming it into the Care Episodes Service (CES).""

""Watch the card carefully.""  
The new service which is law is the **Care Episodes Service** (please note the word ""transform""). What you discussed before was based on the HES way of things. New system means new rules. New contract means new terms. This ""transformation"" will have bending, flexing and snapping...

Lastly,
&gt; ""NHS England wishes to reduce the fees to 1 GBP in order to encourage a wider range of accredited organisations, including charitable organisations, to analyse the data.""

Can these be international organisations in the transformation? If so, then UK data laws may not apply as the data will be stored accordingly to the laws by their country and not over here. ""Accredited"" and ""charitable"" are not defined words (by him) so we have no clue what it could mean.

They may be even committing a possible anti-competition stance according to EU law by selling the data so cheaply.

I appreciate the detailed reply that you gave me on how it works by you, however you must remember that this is a new... I mean... ""transformed"" service. It would have new terms that will apply to it. 

Even the [Health and Social Care Information Centre][1] doesn't even mention the ""transformed"" ""Care Episodes Service"" on its website and I find very little results on google on it.

[1]: http://www.hscic.gov.uk/dlesaac ""Health and Social Care Information Centre: Data Linkage and Extract Service applications, approvals and charges""

Anyway, unlike the ""Edited Electoral Register"", this data will identify a person for life and if it is like the ""Edited Electoral Register"" foreign companies can retrieve the data and you must follow their country's rules to delete them... if you even able to.

So, this new system is a very big deal.

true,apexbbq,null,null,"For me, Oscar. From a technical ability standpoint, Oscar is on a different level from KDB. He has a poise and incisiveness with the ball that KDB simply does not have right now. He's been one of the most important players (if not the most) for Brazil over the last year, and I think he's going to be remarkable for Chelsea this year when he has settled into the premiership and isn't overworked. 

Of course, they play different positions (KDB is more of a wide player), but I think the qualities that Oscar excels at are harder to find than KDB's. Oscar is a fluid playmaker, has remarkable control and first touch, and is VERY good at tracking back and tackling for an attacking midfielder (so much so that he was Chelsea's 2nd leading tackler last year). The ability to involve himself in several phases of play makes him a great asset to Chelsea.

KDB is definitely more of a goal scoring threat as he makes advanced runs more often. He generates quicker counter attacks and tends to be more ambitious on the ball. Don't get me wrong, he's a very good passer as well, but Oscar has a tremendous calmness; he slows the play down, finds gaps and makes the perfect pass. When he's on, Oscar can completely control a game. 

Ultimately, both players are phenomenal young talents, and I couldn't be more excited about KDB. But Oscar has been a highly regarded prodigy in Brazil for quite some time, and I don't think the comparisons to Kaka are unwarranted. When he starts playing for Chelsea more consistently the way he has for Brazil, I don't think there will be any doubt about the answer to this question.

What grades/subjects did you get at GCSE/A Level. 

Lots of unis have science and engineering foundation years but IIRC most want some evidence of study within the last 2 years, good ones especially.

The best course of action might be to do a science based Access Course, preferably with a heavy bias towards maths and physics (Although in my experience they tend to have a more biological approach to science) but if you're close to a biggish city there should be a college offering what you're looking for.

You have a few options.

1. See if anyone will take you on a foundation year (These count completely as part of your university course and are fully funded as such). 
2. Do an access course and see what courses are available to you after your results. You should note that any good university will want at least an overall merit and many an overall distinction so you must put the effort in. With that said it's perfectly possible to achieve an overall distinction with the right effort. I got a Merit and barely bothered with it. 
3. Take home A Levels and enter traditionally.

In terms of actually applying, you apply like everyone else. Go through the horror of UCAS. 

If you have any questions at all just ask. I'd like to think I'm well qualified to answer questions about mature students entering uni haha. 

One thing to consider, you're 23. Doing something like an access course might be worthwhile because if you enter university aged 25 or older you are classed as a financial independent and thus get the maximum of everything. I currently get £13500 a year in grants, bursaries and loans so it might be worth doing the study for a year or so and applying once you're 25. 

Just ask if you need any more information.

EDIT: It's still also technically possible to get a clearing number and try to get on a course this september. It's not easy but you can do it. But it's highly unlikely you'd get in anywhere good.

And then consider that Holtby can cover CAM and Capoue (if pressed) could probably cover B2B and obviously Bale can play in CAM behind the striker.  And that is assuming that Parker/THudd are moved on and Carroll/Jake are loaned.

Out on the wings you would have Bale, Townsend, Chadli, Lennon with Siggy able to slide out when needed.

For the type of pricing in this article (which i don't think can be accurate even if the story was true) then absolutely we would get a fantastic signing for Eriksen...i just don't know how you get him in the lineup without sacrificing time for Holtby/Siggy/Paulinho.

Granted it is a problem that i would love to have to deal with but i have concerns about depth on the back line (Alderwiereld would help shore up the CB depth) particularly LB.

So much for being old, slow and past it. If it wasn't for him we would have been humiliated about 3 - 0.

Our attack was limp, we looked like we couldn't be arsed at times, and generally a day to forget. I'm not one to overreact or anything, but if we can't knock over 8 kids and 3 Celtic reserve players, there's something wrong here. Wisdom doesn't seem ready yet, Allen and Downing are terrible and Enrique is walking a fine line, when he has a bad game, he REALLY has a bad game. Johnson had an absolute 'mare too. Glad to see Sturridge back but he's still got to get match fit again. In saying that though, I'm kind of glad we got taught a lesson (even though I was fucking furious after the match). It let us see we still have a long way to go. I don't think we're a million miles away from 4th but there's still a lot of work to be done and we NEED more quality players!

Really liked how much we were able to change how we played today. Went from a 4-2-3-1 to a three man midfield then looked to me like we played three in the back for about the last ten minutes. Finally able to make subs that aren't tit-for-tat replacements.

Schwarzer hopefully got his one screw up of the season in, luckily in a friendly. Cut the man some slack.

After that goal we seemed like we didn't care about getting the ball back from the opposition and our passes were sloppy.

Second Half :

The introduction of Ramires, Hazard and Lamps changed the game. We seemed more energetic and determined. We started getting a lot of possesion. Lamps tested the Roma's goalkeeper from far quite a few times before he scored that beautiful goal assisted by Ba. The game went on Van Ginkel and Brana came on and we still had a control over the game. In the last 12~ minutes Lukaku came on for Terry and we switched the formation to 3-5-2. Hazard was bossing as usual and at the 89th minute he made an awesome run and passed the ball toward the goal, it took a deflection of a Roma player and was collected by Ba who then passes it to Lukaku who scores.

true,RandomPotato,null,null,"Well, this is just my opinion, but:

Torres was pretty invisible. Had some good linkup and almost got Essien a goal, but that was about it.

Schuerrle didn't do much for me today either. Took some long range shots.

KDB did a lot, played on both wings and centrally, had some good passes and shots.

Moses dribbled but didn't seem like he could get past anybody consistently.

Essien looked solid; it seemed maybe knowing he had Mikel to cover defensively he wasn't afraid to push forward more.

Mikel looked solid defensively. Didn't add too much to the attack, but I kinda expect that from a DM.

Bertrand looked good defensively, played the full 90. Played the bouncy back pass that gave up the goal but I can't place the blame for that on him. Also made some tackles that looked dangerous but never got called. Didn't add too much to the attack.

Terry looked solid at the back. Got denied a goal off a header.

Luiz played the first 45, looked like he took it pretty easy and had a brace of some type on his knee. Played some long balls up, don't think they led to anything though.

Azpi looked ok defensively, went forward more. Sent in a few good crosses.

Lampard IMO changed our game when he came on. Added a directness to our attack and wasn't afraid to shoot, even from distance. 

Oscar played in a few great short passes reminiscent of something Mata would do. Tracked back and help off the ball to.

Cahill had a couple of blocks, nothing really spectacular. Same with Brana.

Rami ran through Roma's midfield, but I don't know if anything came from that.

I actually thought (against everyone else's opinion) that Hazard took it easy until about the last 5-10 minutes, but then he turned it on. Had a run at goal at the 89 minute that led to te second goal.

Schwarzer let in a goal off a blotched back pass from Bertrand (little bouncy, but he should have handled it), but then made a few solid saves.

Blackman wasn't really tested but once or twice, but he managed to stop those times.

Ba looked more threatening, got into better positioning and opened up more space. Believe he assisted on Lukaku's goal.

Lukaku came on late and him and Ba made their presence known I thought. Scored the game winner too.

That's all I can think of, and it's all tainted in my idiotic opinions as well. I prolly forgot tons, but I hope it's something to get you started!",0,1376187778,null,0,false,0,cbl943g,t3_1k4ede,t1_cbl943g,t1_cbl8sai,null,1429872337,22,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,22

The whole ID card thing went through several incarnations in various attempts to sell it to the public pretty much from Labour being elected.

For example, at one point it was being pushed as an 'entitlement' card which would apparently prevent welfare and healthcare fraud.

It had also been presented as a means of controlling immigration and organised crime.

These arguments didn't work quite so well, but luckily for Blair 9/11 happened, so then it became an anti-terrorism measure.

Billions were spent on it, a trial was set up, and then the economy collapsed. Around the same time, it was also becoming apparent that Labour's hugely expensive NHS IT project was a disaster.

They're suspicious in that it's a very pro-German view of history which isn't normally what you get from British or English nationalists, but both are still a fair point and not definite indicators of Nazi sympathies.

Western Goals was a group with an interest in immigration reform and Monsieur Le Pen was an influential French politician with similar interests, it does make sense that they'd share some views.

&gt;""Lauder-Frost has previously shared a platform with Holocaust deniers such as Ernst Zündel and David Irving."" 

This lacks context, but it does seem slightly suspicious.

He's talked about voluntary repatriations of aliens, which seems fairly reasonable. As far as I can tell he's never been a member of the BNP though, he denies ever being a member and other than that one claim by Hope Not Hate (a highly unreliable source to begin with) and some other suspicious sources I can't see any evidence that he was ever a member. Whatever the truth is with that we can be sure he isn't openly a member now.

true,hyp-R,lfc99,,"*In my opinion* we are playing better, more attacking football. I know that's what BR is aiming for and in my eyes that's what we are doing - we are looking great in the final third.

We've got some more exciting players on, who although not tested yet, have shown some signs of coming together brilliantly and helping us achieve our goals and ambitions. Some of these players have only played a handful of games together when we all know, and should understand, it takes time to get that chemistry between players.

We've demonstrated that although we've been away from the top for 20 years we finally are starting to feel the effects of having an improved academy in place and are able to produce our own home-grown talent (see Sterling, Ibe, Wisdom). This helps us in both saving money and making money.

We've shown with our new scouting group (Thanks Man City!) that we have our hand on the pulse of some of the newest, exciting players that provide the best bang-for-buck and the right attacking, never-say-never mentality that will help us fight for every loose ball.

I'm really interested to see how we shape up against Stoke, but what I'm really interested to see is just how quickly people fall away from supporting a club they show so much interest in when the slightest thing doesn't go the way they intended. BR and FSG are making strides to correct the wrongs we have gone through - if you can't see that you're fucking blind. 

We haven't conducted our business in public like some, we are adhering to the 'Liverpool Way' as mentioned in this subreddit in another thread by understanding, and demonstrating, that no one person is bigger than this club. We've turned the corner and again, *in my opinion* are ready for some great results this year.

That's how I think we did.

* This pre-season I was really happy with Ibe and Sterling. I'm really impressed by the way they are developing, Ibe more so as he's come out of no where for me to be performing and blending well. 
* Aspas has shown he has that dog mentality for me, running hard chasing the ball and finding himself in the right positions. 
* Coutinho is an absolute god among men on that field and I can only see getting better and better. 
* Allen really looked to be shining in the last few games, finding his form.
* Mignolet - looking to be a great purchase.

I was a little disappointed with Johnson. I'm a fan of him, I rate him highly for what he provides up front although I concede he needs defensive work. I seen him dispossesed a few times, but it's pre-season. I was disappointed with Suarez for obvious reasons, Sterling too in light of the recent assault allegations (if proven true).

Edit to address your edit: I don't know, all of our strikers have mainly played in lone striker systems, and I think that's where they are most comfortable.

true,BAM123987,null,null,"So this is my first post and it's all about what I think should happen to the doctor after his 13th regeneration. So I believe that the doctor should die, like actually die, because him being immortal would make the series boring and wouldn't stick to the rules. But they should keep the series going. They can do this by making another character the doctor. Now I know what your thinking he's the last of his kind and all that, and making one of his companions the doctor would be a little odd since you've already seen them as his companion. (Not to mention the plot holes it would bring up)       So my idea is that we bring back a time lord not as in back to life, but do you guys remember Jenny the doctor's daughter from that one episode with the 7 day war. It was during Tennant's days and Georgia Moffett played Jenny amazingly. She had this way about her that just screamed the doctor not only this but she is alive and just roaming the galaxy they did something pretty dumb by bringing her back the same episode they killed her off but it would work perfectly if she came back as a doctor in training. So the new series takes place after the 12th doctor dies, and let's say he dies by turning into energy and going into the tardis. (Or something like that) Then he would still be sortof alive inside of the tardis but still be dead in fact they could give him a certain amount of time he can stay alive in the tardis without his presence leaving the tardis. Now since the tardis is alive he could somewhat control it. The episode would start back in the time of ""the doctor's daughter"" episode and would follow jenny in til she saw the tardis appear in front of her. This would of course make her intrigued (especially when the door swings open) now when she gets inside she would hear the doctors voice (Peter Capaldi's voice) echo around her like a ghost almost. He explains the situation and what has happened and she accepts being the doctor because she loves the thrill and wants to see the world. Jenny and the old doctor then begin on their voyage him teaching her to be the doctor but also to be less militaristic and more kind to even her foes. During first season he tells her all about the time lords and takes her to places to train and other stuff. During the second season The old doctor's energy finally runs out (or something like that) and she must voyage on her own until she finds a companion. Then she would start to die and regenerate like the other doctors before her. But maybe she can only regenerate 6 times or something I don't know that's as far as I've thought of it. Well thanks for reading please tell me if there is something I missed or if I created any plot holes.

Running into space is what 8/10 strikers can do fairly well. We need more than that to lead the line at Chelsea, plain and simple. Torres was great in two pre-season games as well making runs that opened up tons of space behind him. As I said, most strikers can do what Ba did, and do it well. 

The thing is that he can open up space but at what point to people give him less attention because they know his touch is atrocious, he's slow enough to get caught from behind, his agility is below average, etc that he becomes less of a threat to worry about. 

What I'm saying is you just need more from your striker than movement.

Agreed. Selling out before Christmas is a massive, massive oversight. I'm yet to get my home shirt and the thought of that happening again is a slight worry. How did you get one but not your husband though? Or are you using 'jersey' and 'shirt' with one not meaning a replica top?

Arsenal are obviously well positioned financially and Spurs aren't bad off either although given their spending spree thus far this summer if they don't sell Bale I'm not sure exactly how they plan to pay for it.

Liverpool is looking better financially then we have for awhile but the near £100M in debt we've accrued the past few years isn't great.  Given that FSG aren't going to do an Abramovich or Mansour and float the club large amounts of cash then convert that debt into shares, we're doing what is probably the only reasonable alternative- attempting to scout/buy value for money.  While I agree that it might a bit nice to have someone with very deep pockets just buy the best players last time I checked there wasn't a queue of such lined up outside the Shankly Gate.  Unfortunately what that means is I think we're unlikely to buy any players over say £15M or so without sales to recuperate the expense.  When Suarez leaves it'll be interesting to see who they can get to come in with that money.

I can appreciate the romantic notion, but realistically those days are well numbered.  I suspect even Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour, as examples, will expect moving forward their club's to start running at something closer to at least break even now that they're both pretty well established.  Evidence of this can be seen a bit in Chelsea actually making a profit recently.

Longer term I suspect things will change dramatically as the 'big clubs' pull away from their respective national organizations to form a new one.  Should be interesting to see how that pans out.

This comes from the fact that we rely on creativity from geniuses like 1. Coutinho, 2. Suarez, 3. to a lesser extent Gerrard and later on, 4. Alberto but simultaneously we are forced to play them at the same time as players who are relative idiots in a creative footballing sense, specifically Downing, and Henderson and Allen when they are, for some reason, played high up the pitch. We need everybody to be on the same page, and we currently cannot do that when half the team is geared to play intelligently, and the other half is limited to play in an unintelligent manner.

At any rate, I need to rant.  I know why fans hate us and call us plastic now.  Holy shit, the experience was not at all what I expected.  I can't stand the number of times a successful ""Let's go Chelsea"" chant occurred.  I just tried a simple ""Carefree"" chant, should be a classic.

No one joins in, and I'm told to go home.  Seriously?  You paid more than $100 per person and you can't go and learn the basic chants or history of the team?  I have no problem with the families who just want to take their kids and have it be a family experience, or the introverts who just want to watch the match and have some fun.  But when you go and try to act like an actual fan and all you know are generic bullshit American chants and don't even know the basic Chelsea chants, probably know squat about the squad players and history, you are fucking plastic.

The worst part?  Lampard scores an incredible goal, I try to start ""Super Frank,"" I get nothing.  Wow.  This is why we are the most hated team in the Premier League, not because of you guys, but because of these idiots.

I have no problem really with people who start following Chelsea even after they won the Champions League if they just started watching football.  But if you are a casual fan, act like one, and if you want to be a fanatic, do your research.

I started watching the Premier League in 2004, and the only things I knew about the PL then was that there was a team named Man U, and one named Arsenal.  So I was following neither one.  When I saw a team called Chelsea at the top, I thought it was an underdog overcoming all odds to fly high in the tables.  I didn't know they spent lots of money to get there, I only found out when I was already too emotionally attached to them to back out.  So there I was, a Chelsea fan.  I watched so many highlights and learned so much about the history and chants that year, I really just fell in love with the team.

I was a fanatic, and I absolutely loved watching the match they played against DC United in the summer of 2005.  I'm not asking all Chelsea fans to dive deep like me instantly, but I want the real fans to stand up, and the plastic ones to shut up.

Sorry about this long rant.  Fantastic game, I love Schwarzer despite his mistake, Obi and Ba are underrated, and Lampard, Hazard, and Lukaku are awesome.

Chelsea are turning a profit and that is my point. Man city in the future will most likely achieve that too but the huge influx of money had to be put in the clubs in order for them to first establish themselves at the top tier.

I just think after buying the club, FSG should be doing more to help us compete but I don't expect Man City levels of expenditure.

 If we don't show significant signs of improvement this season, I think the tide will turn against them from the fans point of view.

I do take your point that there doesn't seem to be a huge line of buyers outside the Shankly Gates.

I can't really understand why though. Maybe its because of the long awaited increase of stadium capacity.

1. We kept Suarez.  It looks like we will very likely keep him through the end of the window.  Sure, he's not super happy at the moment, but we've got six games before we can even consider playing him anyway.
2. We have fantastic depth up top.  Suarez, Sturridge, Aspas, Borini is a striker force that any English team could be proud of.
3. We cut off some more dead weight- Reina's wages, wee Jay, Shelvey- and brought in some good depth.  Luis Alberto and Iago Aspas were very good buys.
4. We replaced Carragher, insofar as he can be replaced.  Kolo is actually kind of awesome; I was skeptical at first, but now I'm quite glad to have him.
5. We brought in a young, promising keeper in Simon Mignolet.
6. Sturridge looks like he'll come in firing, and after time to adjust I expect big things from our boy.
7. We finally have a world-class attacking mid again.  God damn Coutinho is amazing.  What's that, you say?  A bit early to call him world class?  Yeah, well fuck you.  That kid will do incredible things this season.
8. Nearly everybody is fit.  Agger picked up a knock, but it's not too serious, right?  Crucially, **Lucas is fit**.  Kelly is back as well.  And Joe Allen looks like he'll be right brilliant again.
9. We have a ton of promising youngsters coming through.  Sterling, Ibe, Kelly, Wisdom look like a mean group.
10. We're sorted positionally, and tactically.  Everybody knows the game plan now.  Rodgers has had a year with the team, and the players understand what he wants.  We know where most everyone will be playing- in particular, here, I'm thinking about Gerrard and Lucas as our anchors in the midfield.  Last season we started before we knew whom to play where, and while Allen deputised very well, Gerrard and Sahin were going through some rough patches, Hendo had no form (along with Downing), and Lucas was injured.  Oh, and we didn't have Coutinho.

So there it is.  We can be hopeful, but probably not optimistic.

**Edit:** if you want to know why you should be happy, compare our squad right now to our squad at the start of last season.  While it might not be miles better, our team right now is a visible improvement over last fall.  The differences:

We are still short a creative midfielder, a top quality winger that can replace Bale if/when he goes, and another striker.  Plus a centre back, and possibly a reliable left back.

City have made some very smart purchases and may have a new manager, but he's quality.  Same for Chelsea.  I expect Utd to flounder a little, and I don't think Arsenal's squad is as good as ours, but Wenger has pedigree and if they land Rooney, Suarez or Gustavo I think they'll challenge us.

* It's all well and good going forward more than we did under Gus if we don't take chances, reminiscent of last season.

* Either Makismenko suddenly becomes and great left back, or we have a massive bridge sized hole to fill, there were a lot of plays up the left that just petered out of passes were misplaced.

* Agustien played a couple of nice balls at the beginning of the match but then misplaced pretty much the rest of his passes, he looks unfit (he admitted himself he was in the programme) and needs to gain some fitness before we'll see the best of him.

* Rohan Ince looks like a good player.

People (especially teenagers) are on a spectrum, it is entirely possible for a 14-year old boy to be more mature (emotionally and sexually) than an 18-year old girl.

The real issue in these areas is that people don't age and mature at the same rate, having 16 be an arbitrary cut off has no meaning, but as society we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, and the UK decided that line is 16.

Other countries have decided it is lower or higher.

The end result I think is that these cases need to be considered individually, you cannot fairly outright say a 15-year old having sex with a 16-year old is statutory rape, they may only be within 6 weeks age of each other.

With some online shopping places, you can sometimes specify that the item be left with a neighbour or in a specific location. I have a note on my door (I live in a flat) that says leave on (safe location) or take it to (neighbour at blah address). 

If I miss the item, I sign the package slip and ask them to come back and pick up the slip, and leave the item in (safe location). DHL and DPD are really good with this.

Don't take a holiday -- just explain to manager that you need to go to doctor or dentist. Arrange the visit at the beginning or end of your day (which ever is easiest for you with traffic). I make end of day hair appointments too (my hair salon is less than a five minute walk from my job though). 

I do a huge clean on the weekends and smaller cleanings during the week as needed. I used to make all my food on a Sunday to last until Wednesday or Thursday, then make something easy on Thursday/Friday. I start laundry on Thursday and hang it inside.

The rules changed with funding and now unless a student attempts every module of their course the university gets almost none of the funding, even if they drop the ball at the very end of the year. It sucks and as a result makes you much more wary of taking a punt on someone.  

When it comes to interview risks might be, a student who wants to do something quite different to their previous courses (do they know that this course is right for them? will they struggle? will they drop out?), poor attendance (Will they show up?), ropey grades (can they handle it?) or someone who is self funding (it's hard, we know it is, is their boss as understanding as they say?). The funding changes mean whereas before we could take on a few of these students and try and get them through now it could only be one or two. 

We can only work with the information we are given on an application The interview team don't see anything to do with income but I do know the issues I mentioned are ones that tend to hit students from poorer backgrounds more, but to say that their income is the deciding factor is just hitting the surface of the issue.

true,HMFCalltheway,null,null,"Ok I am just going to air the other side of the argument here as it seems to have been fairly neglected in this article. Basically I just want to make the point that probably the majority of farmers and indeed the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association are broadly against these changes. My Uncle is actually a tenant farmer of an estate and enjoys a good relationship with the estate owner. He has a pretty free reign when it comes to development of the farm and actually received support when he redeveloped the farm steading. The article almost makes out that tenants are impoverished peasants that maintain and improve their property without any recompense. While actually many of these farmers are fairly successful businessmen and women who often actually use the fairly cheap tenancies to produce an income for themselves. Many of these tenant farmers use their tenancy as a stepping stone to go on and expand their own enterprises and buy they're own property. Also under Scots law a tenant of any property can demand compensation for any improvements they have made once their lease is up. It also has to be kept in mind that many tenant farmers wouldn't actually be able to afford their properties if they were up for sale so if any legislation was introduced that didn't specifically protect tenant farmers properly, the intended beneficiaries maybe forced off their land and just another rich landowner would take over.

I'd also like to make the point that estates are not all terribly run like this article tries to make out, many have very active and enterprising lairds or well educated rural managers. These people are generally capitalists and want to make as much use out of their land as they possibly can and invest a lot into their enterprises. Many are also big conservationists so actually are very committed to protecting local habitats.

Now there are indeed bad estate owners just like you get bad landlords in the cities and the case of Andrew Riddell was indeed one of these instances. My parents actually knew him when they were younger and he was indeed hard working and committed to his farm. Now legally the landowner was completely right to kick him out as Andrew knew from the start that he was on a fixed term lease. However he just assumed that he would be allowed to stay on as his family had farmed there for generations.  When the time came however he was completely unprepared and what happened after that was tragic. Because of the case though there are now proceedings in place to grant tenant farmers greater protection over their lease properties which are quite broadly supported.

Now if you really are committed to land reform I really wouldn't say this is the way to go about it as you are going to have terrible legal wranglings with landowners like in Andrew Riddles case saying it is against their human rights to seize their lands. Better options I can see are offering low interest loans for groups wanting to buy estate land or other incentives for redistribution. Maybe also further requirements to show that big landowners are making the best use of their lands before they receive any subsidies.

Another proposal that I myself might not be in favour of but may combat the generational passing down of huge estates would be to increase inheritance tax and make it applicable to agricultural land so that new lairds are compelled to sell off land after each generation passes. However this could ruin many smaller farms and could mean that large companies become the landowners rather than gentry. 

In summary I do think there are changes that can be made to this system however compulsory purchase is not the way to go about it.

(Note: I am basing my experiences on the area I live which is fairly unique in Scottish farming as most farms are arable and are mostly owned by the farmers themselves. There will be differences in other areas of Scotland.)",0,1376214176,null,0,1376251426,0,cblezxk,t3_1k40hk,t1_cblezxk,t3_1k40hk,null,1429869507,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

He has very quick feet but unlike Hazard uses space better rather then relying on 1 - 1 skills, which does not catch the eye as much. 

People watch Oscar more! focus on his touches and his only through a game and you'll see what I'm talking about

Edit: Take into account he has yet to really grow physically. Once he broadens out a little bit and gains a couple pounds he will be a VERY good number 10. I think he might even end up more important to Brazil then Neymar (At least I wish, such a fag with that hair).

Contrast this with the 2nd amendment of the US constitution:

Here the meaning is clear: you are possessed of rights and the state guarantees not to infringe them. Rights are too important to allow ambiguous language to confuse the source of your rights. If your rights are only yours because you are granted them by authority, then who is to say they cannot be taken away from you?

Audere est facere - To Dare is To Do
-

Club moto. Plastered all over The Lane. Iconic saying. To me, it means pride, courage, and style. No 3 words are more powerful to a Spurs fan.


It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high... so high, in fact, that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.
-

-Bill Nicholson (He *is* Tottenham Hotspur. Player from '38-'55 and Manager from '58-'74) 

Bil Nick also said: ""When it is played at it's best, football remains the GREATEST GAME OF ALL"". Something that can resonate with all football fans.

Oh, another Bill Nick: ""It's no use winning, we've got to win well"". What a man.

""The Game is about Glory. It's about doing things with style and with a flourish""
-

-Danny Blanchflower, Captained the famous '61 double season. Best player in Spurs' history, without a doubt. Unbelievable player and man.

""This is MY club, MY one and ONLY club"" 
-
-Ledley King. The man was insane. Would have been England captain had he a second knee. Ledley is an ambassador for the club, and plays a role in charitable affairs around Tottenham. He's a total don, and deserves so much more than he got.

My favourite chant goes: ""Oh Ledley, Ledley, he's only got one knee, he's better than John Terry, oh Ledley, Ledley"".

-----

Anyway, onwards. The Spurs squad you see here is the best squad we've had in 50 years. It's not that we don't belong in the top 4, it's not that we don't deserve a chance at some silverware, but Tottenham as a club has grown exponentially under Levy and Lewis, who have shown that the Glory Years of Spurs are coming back.

I get the impression over at /r/coys, we as supporters understand this. Even the swathes of Americans have taken to the club, are so passionate and proud and that's what's important, I think. We know we just had a record breaking season, we've spent way more than we're accustomed to, and hence we try to be humble over it all. Because when you put things into perspective, we're in unknown territory, almost!

----

As far as the current squad goes, it does somewhat depend on Bale. We could see our squad stay as is, with Gareth blasting it in from the right wing, or we could see some new faces having reinvested money made.

Regardless, here's my Spurs 1st XI:

Lloris

Walker, Dawson, Vertonghen, BAE

Paulinho, Sandro, Dembele

Bale, Soldado, Lennon

However, given recent signings, there's so much room for rotation. Our second team has some real quality:

Friedal

Naughton, Kaboul, Fryers, Rose

Holtby, Capoue, Siggurdson

Townsend, Adebayor, Chadli

Most likely a 4-3-3, but we could see Bale behind the striker with Chadli coming into the 1st team on the left.

And that doesn't even include Parker, Defoe, Huddlestone, Carroll, some other decent squad players. We've clearly made some strong signings, smashing our 16.5m record, twice! 17m for Paulinho (not quite smashing, but still) and a whopping 26m for Soldado! Where has all the money come from????

Well, rumours say different things... Joe Lewis has reportedly become totally determined to get us into the CL regularly. Hence a full 50m budget as was provided for the Bizzler. Regardless, the signings of Paulinho, Soldado and Chadli, as well as Baldini as our technical director show we're intent on glory!

-----

We've suffered what can only be described as heartbreak in our recent history. With Lasagna-gate losing us our CL spot in 2006, we've been fighting to get back into the CL since. We did it and in 2010 made the quarter finals, only to go crashing out at a 4-0 defeat to Madrid pending a red card from Crouchy and the demise of the confidence of a so-called GK, Gomes. 2 years ago we suffered some real blows at the hands of Chelsea (CSKA London) in the forms of a 'phantom goal' in the FA cup semis, and their (through the grit of my teeth, I'll admit) *hard fought* CL win, despite finishing 6th in the league. Last year, too, having been ahead for so long, dropping out of the top 4 so late in the game, you can imagine how tough that is! We're criminally unfortunate.

Despite all of this, we're back, stronger than ever, hardened by our experiences and ready for a new season. And once more, we've set our sights so high that even failure will have in it an echo of glory. COYS!

EDIT: And on that note, we've had an okay preseason. Getting used to new signings, with Rose and Townsend back from great loan spells, our team is gelling together still. We looked somewhat uninspiring vs Espanyol on saturday, but it was just a friendly and we didn't have Bale. It'll be interesting to see how Bale will pan out. The relative media silence in the past few days has been both a joy and unnerving. There are many reasons why he would and could leave, but many he should and would stay. Thankfully he's not fighting our adamance in keeping him like Suarez, or Modric did. Whether or not he leaves, I think we're in a good position to fight for top 4 once more, providing Arsenal don't improve too much!",0,1376218740,null,0,1376228091,0,cblfj41,t3_1k4zgp,t1_cblfj41,t3_1k4zgp,null,1429869259,92,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,92

Everybody who smokes likes doing it. They are addicted to nicotine. Most smokers you speak to would ideally like to give up.

true,Jaqacake,null,null,"To be honest I don't think it's impossible that she'd send them to herself - just for background I have major depressive disorder and have had many suicidal episodes.  I obviously can't talk on behalf of anyone else but from my own experiences I can definitely identify with sending hateful messages to myself.  Sorry if this comes out like an essay, I'm just trying to give some kind of insight into how one suicidal person perceives things (which of course in no way means it's what happened in this case).

So I assume everyone kinda debates with themselves in their head - I don't mean hearing voices, I just mean talking to yourself, so at the moment I'm trying to lose weight, I'm on the border of obese with a big weakness for chocolate and sweets so I might have a thought pattern like: 'hmm, I really want to eat a 400g bar of dairy milk, no, bad jaqacake, this is why you are fat, no giant bars of chocolate, you know you'll regret it and you've been doing well lately, have a few squares of dark chocolate instead'.

When I'm suicidal the same thought pattern might go like this: 'hmm, I really want to eat a 400g bar of dairy milk, you pathetic piece of shit, can you not go one day without having to stuff your stupid face, you're so fucking useless, there's absolutely no hope, you'll always be fat, you'll always be pathetic and useless, you really need to just kill yourself'.

The 'trigger' can be anything 'ug, alarm went off five minutes ago, come on jaqacake, get out of bed.  I can't believe you're still in bed, you should have got up when it first went off, you worthless piece of shit, you can't even get out of bed, you're such a failure, oh look at you, feeling all sorry for yourself, you're pathetic, you don't deserve to live, you need to kill yourself and the fact you haven't already is just more proof that you need to - but you're so useless and pathetic you can't even do that'.  

For me it's usually any sort of perceived failure - anything from running behind, forgetting something, being tired, someone seeming disappointed in something I've done (whether or not they actually are).

And I will write notes to myself telling me how stupid, pathetic, useless I am and that I should kill myself, because there is constant reinforcement of the 'you need to kill yourself' message coming from within me.  This isn't something I'd do in a public way, I've never written anonymous messages to myself on websites, but the more I think about it the more I can see the attraction.  When my internal monologue is reminding me I need to kill myself it will do what it can to reinforce that message, pretending it's coming from a different source seems a good way to do this.  I think I've just never thought of it, mostly apparently my perceptions are skewed, I apparently interpret incorrectly that people are having a go at me and being critical, apparently I may have in some cases changed my memories over what was actually said, never as far as to think someone else is telling me I should kill myself, but certainly to tell me (or more commonly, imply) that I'm a pathetic, useless failure - ie the reasons I know I have to kill myself.

I'm not saying it's this is what happened here, more just suggesting the line 'I don't think she killed herself over messages she sent to herself' is not that simple.  If she did send the messages to herself (and I don't think there's enough evidence in the information we've been given to draw that conclusion) I would instead think that the messages were a result of the mental illness that ultimately lead to her death, rather than she did it because of those messages.",0,1376221124,null,0,1376221335,0,cblft44,t3_1k4yzh,t1_cblft44,t1_cblf6kv,null,1429869129,114,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,114

true,whistleflute,null,null,"Whilst we've made some great signings so far in this window, there is definitely a feeling amongst some Spurs supporters that we still haven't adequately replaced Modric or Van de Vaart. Paulinho and (if it happens) Capoue are great players, but both of them lack the attacking creativity we sorely need. Last season our record against the top teams was excellent, but we came undone time and time again against weaker opposition who sat back and rendered our pacy counter-attacking football impotent. Were it not for Bale's ever-amazing long shots from outside the box, we would of really struggled. Some people hope that the signing of Paulinho will enable us to play Dembele further up the pitch, but his style of attacking creativity is more based around dribbling to open up space rather than a killer through ball (à la Modric/VdV). The jury is still out on Siggurdson and Holtby, and there will be ample opportunity for both of them to try and step up to the first team. Personally, I'd love to fit Huddlestone into the team somehow, because his passing on a good day... a joy to watch (changed the game in the 3-1 vs Man City) but that's just the football romantic in me, sadly I think he's on his way out as his mobility just doesn't seem to gel with AVB's plans. Losing Bale will be an obvious problem for us, not just in his attacking threat, but also in the tactical change he imposes on the other team. Lennon is at his best when he has Bale stretching the flanks on the other side. If he's not there, he can be very easily nullified by doubling up.

On a more positive note, having a striker is unbearably exciting, and for all the talk about the Bale-outs, if we'd had an in-form striker last season we'd of had the 4th spot sewn up by March.",0,1376221322,null,0,1376221693,0,cblfty2,t3_1k4zgp,t1_cblfty2,t3_1k4zgp,null,1429869118,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Dawson: 6 - Solid. If Kaboul and Vert are healthy he'll still get much playing time due to our multiple competitions.

Fryers: 4 - Better than I expected but not ready for 1st team
Kaboul: 7 - Things changed when he came on.  He made things happen.
Dembele: 8.5 - MOTM for me.  He really dictated play when he was in.
Paulinho: 6 - Looked like a new guy with loads of talent who doesn't know his mates yet.  I expect him to be an 8 or 9 most games when settled.
Thudd: 2 - He needs to lose 30 lbs before he can be effective again. Struggled in starts/stops.
Sandro: 4 - Not comfortable enough yet to be the beast but expect him to be fully back after 3 or 4 matches.
Siggy: 7 - I agree with everything you said
Lennon: 5 - He showed flashes
Chadli: 7 - Quality addition who looks to be getting comfortable. Really impressed.
Townsend: 6 - Looked like he was trying so hard to impress. I've always been impressed. Imo it's neck and neck between he and Lennon for 1st team
Soldado: 6 - Extremely impressed but I expect him to be much better when he gels with the team.  He'll be a 9 or 10 most weeks.
Defoe: 4 - Well said

I gave lower ratings than you because this team isn't the finished article yet and there have to be higher numbers available for ranking them when they do get settled.  I couldn't believe my eyes in the first half of the match.  This team is real quality.  I haven't been this excited since January 2012 when we were in 3rd in the table but I believe this team to be very superior to that team.  That 1st squad looks to have real balance in play and I expect that balance will open up goals from guys we aren't used to scoring such as Siggy, Dembele, and even Walker and I expect Soldado, Chadli, and even Lennon/Townsend to get into the act as well.  Call me excited!

My concerns:
1. Who fills in for Soldado if he gets hurt?  The 2 guys we have now are big drop off in quality.
2. We need to buy another CB for depth.  Loved Kaboul but don't trust his fitness.
3. Looks like BAE is gone so if rumors of Coentrao coming are true LB won't be a concern but right now depth at that position is a concern.

I'm really happy Levy's favoured continental style has been re-implemented with a more willing participant in AVB with us have a director of football in Baldini. We've always been an exciting team to watch but now, unlike previous spurs teams I've seen we're much more organised and we've lost our soft underbelly by becoming a team of real  monsters recently who are still good on the ball.

Now things have changed. I'm noticing a growing perception that rape is a weapon used by girls who regret sleeping with someone. Waking up in the morning he's ugly and she regrets it and her boyfriend will dump her - cry rape. Grab a footballer and the day after cry rape. If a boy band groupie comes backstage and has sex with the band and turns out underage, that's rape.

Now I don't think the perception is entirely realistic. I don't know how many false accusations are made - the media would suggest it's at least some. I think any footballer who goes out and has sex with dozens of people is asking for trouble anyway. 

The point though is that the perception is real. And feminists now seem to be fighting a battle to keep rape perceived as the worst possible crime (let's not bring the crazy ones into it), however in the public perception rape will lose it's stigma and it's not long before we hear sentences like ""Oh, date rate, not proper rape"", where the perceived meaning is ""Oh you're just saying that the day after"".

Debt overhang, that is, the inability to borrow even for profitable investments due to existing debt, is irrelevant in the cases of the UK and Japan because they issue their own currency.

When you issue your own currency, and have all debt denominated in that currency, you are at all times the safest entity that people can loan that currency *to*. Therefore, you at all times get the risk-free rate - a rate the central bank itself sets, at least on short term debt.

That's what we see the world over, any free-floating currency-issuing government can issue 28 day bonds and get exactly the risk-free rate set by the central bank.. which is what you'd expect. Even when Japan's debt is over a quadrillion yen it does not matter, merely by virtue of owning the yen printing press the Japanese government can borrow yen for cheaper than anyone else and therefore doesn't actually need to print.

Of course, this doesn't help the Netherlands which for whatever reason decided to give up their currency.. but it does call into serious question why the UK ever chose to pursue austerity, stagnating growth and damaging wages.",0,1376222601,null,0,false,0,cblfzmi,t3_1k4w9m,t1_cblfzmi,t1_cblfbvj,null,1429869045,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Our current situation is an interesting one, because we are close to being able to challenge for more than Champions League qualification, but we have a very small window of opportunity to do so. Along with having doubts over Real Madrid being able to pay Bale's fee upfront, because I don't see Levy accepting installments, and Levy recognizing this could be our chance, as seen by his spending in the window, I expect Bale to stay another season. So, I'll cautiously continue with that in mind.

As for CL qualification, we've been incredibly unfortunate not to make it the last two years. Finishing fourth two seasons ago and having Chelsea take it away after finishing sixth was very hard to accept. As for last season, we were unable to finish without dropping too many points and it hurt us, but it was still difficult to accept after achieving our highest points total with a new manager and without two of our best players in Kaboul and Sandro.

This year, with those two looking to be back and with AVB able to build off of a successful first campaign, I expect us to be challenging for top spots again. We've strengthened our squad in many places, but still need to address a couple of spots, including CB and LB.

I expect us to use a 4-3-3 and/or 4-2-3-1 for our formations. I don't see Sandro/Paulinho/Dembele being used together too often, as Sandro's knee still presents some questions and Dembele always seems to have something bothering him. I expect us to play with a CAM role, to provide creativity and give Holtby/Sigurdsson more playing time.

**GK**
Lloris: One of the best in the league and an amazing signing, possibly even more irreplaceable than Bale. I expect him to have a big year.

Friedel: He's obviously old and getting slower, but he still has it in him to play cup games, some Europe League games and provide necessary cover for Lloris.

Gomes: He makes the impossible look easy and the easy look impossible (not my quote, forgot where I saw it, but it's dead on). I expect him to be sold.

**DEF**
Vertonghen: Showed last year that he is one of the best in the league. He is very confident in his marking and tackling and will dive into tackles that make my heart stop only to execute them perfectly. He also has the touch and passing of a midfielder, which makes him perfect for AVB's system. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOp81L4xUrE) video is a great example of those skills, impressive stuff for a defender who can also defend.

Kaboul: Not having him last year hurt us a lot. He is strong and smart and very confident of the decisions he makes. A great player to have in the defense and I can't wait to see him playing alongside Vertonghen. I still have questions over his knee though and squad rotation will benefit him.

Dawson: We tried to sell him last year, but he wanted to stay and prove himself, which is exactly what he did. I was very impressed with his performances last year. However, I don't think he will be able to perform as consistently this year, although I hope he proves me wrong again.

Walker: Had a bit of a slump last year, but was still a fine player. I expect to see him pick it back up this year and continue developing. His pace is exceptional and it's always a joy to watch him and Lennon work together down that right side.

Naughton: Played out of position a lot last year, as a LB, where he is still good defensively, but almost invisible going forward due to not being confident on his left foot. He is still good cover for both RB and LB though.

BAE: For every amazing ball he sends forward, there's two that are shit and a decision that makes me want to cry. AVB doesn't really seem to rate him and I expect him to be sold this window, with Levy getting decent money.

Rose: Fine going forward, but a shit defender in my opinion. His decisions can be just awful and I really don't trust him. Works as back up, but doesn't really seem to be capable of playing at such a high level and would probably do better going back to a club like Sunderland. Still think we'll keep him though and maybe he will prove me wrong.

**MID**
Sandro: All I can say is that it will be great to have him back in the line up. He is a key part of the team and we really missed him last season.

Dembele: His ability to use his body to shield defenders off of the ball will never cease to amaze me. A decent passer with some creativity, but not necessarily enough to play further up the pitch. Really rate the guy though and think he will be a key part of the season.

Paulinho: Haven't seen him enough to really comment on him too much, but I am very excited about this signing. He looks very promising.

Sigurdsson: I rate him very highly and think that he needs as much playing time as a CAM as possible. He was a few great saves and posts away last year from being talked about much more. He really has a great curved shot and I would expect him to come back even stronger this year. His form really showed when he got some consistency, even though he was playing out of position as a winger.

Holtby: A real steal for the price we got him at and another guy who needs to play as much as possible. I really hope to see more of him this year, because I think his enthusiasm and effort combined with his skill will only lead to great things.

Lennon: More than just a speedy player who can cross if you ask me. He really stepped it up last year, because before then, that's all he really was. I think working under AVB has done wonders for him.

Bale: Speaking of working under AVB doing wonders, this guy was a fucking monster last year as we all know, I expect him to be great again this year. The conversations been had a million times, but I expect him to stay.

Townsend: He's still a bit raw, but has plenty of potential. Wants first team football more consistently though and I don't know if we can give him that. He could possibly move before the end of the window.

Chadli: A good signing who will be challenging Lennon for his spot. Seems strong and quick with an eye for goal. Looking forward to watching him play for us.

Huddlestone: Slower than me, but one of the best passers in the league. Some of the balls he gets through the defense amaze me. He's apparently turned down a handful of EPL clubs to stay and fight for a place, so we'll see.

Parker: He had to do too much last year and was way to mobile when put next to Dembele. He thrives when he can play next to a player like Sandro who will hold the midfield down. I love him, but I don't see him in a Spurs shirt this season, he's still good enough for top flight though, so hopefully he doesn't have to settle for QPR.

Livermore: We've loaned him out a million times and in another universe, where we don't have a million midfielders, he'd see some time. I wouldn't be surprised to see him sold.

Carroll: He needs to get bigger and get some playing time, hopefully we can loan him out to a EPL side for the year.

**ST**
Soldado: Looks like our answer to all of our problems and I'm excited to watch him play. If he can perform like he did at Valencia, then we will be a very dangerous team this year.

Defoe: If he's willing to accept a lesser role, then he still has a place in this team. You can't deny his knack for scoring, even if it comes in inconsistent bunches. He has plenty of ability though and is still a useful sub. His [strike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZjoRPkTozI) against Manchester City last year shows he still has it (starts around 2:17, great pass from Holtby too).

Adebayor: There's plenty to say about him and I know plenty of fans don't like him, but I do! It's understandable though, because he's incredibly frustrating when he wants to be and a very good striker when he wants to be. His finishing is good and he is very capable of playing in the build up play. His [performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64n3CEzyLCA) against Chelsea last year is a perfect example (goal starts around :44).

Kane: Still too young to tell, but he could end up being a decent EPL striker. Would love to see him get loaned out and get more experience in the league.

It's early, so there's a chance I forgot somebody in there, but I love our squad depth, especially if Capoue comes in. I expect us to add another CB and LB before the window closes as well. 

As for my season expectation, if we can hold onto Bale, play consistently and stay healthy through squad rotation, I don't see any reason to limit ourselves. Its AVB's second year and I really expect him to build off of a successful campaign from last year. I expect nothing less than a top four finish under these circumstances and I hope we don't find another way to lose out on CL football!",0,1376223222,null,0,false,0,cblg2is,t3_1k4zgp,t1_cblg2is,t3_1k4zgp,null,1429869007,23,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,23

With AVB this season I feel we will adopt the 4-3-3 formation as this is something I know he is confident with and something we could make use of. These past three transfer windows (last summer, winter, this summer) have been incredibly effective. They have allowed us to sign top 4 talent such as Lloris, Vertonghen, Paulinho, and finally a replacement for Berbatov in Soldado. As somebody else stated in the comments, most Spurs fans feel we still haven't replaced Modric/VdV and a creative midfielder is something we desperately need judging by our preseason, whether Holtby/Siggy become the creative midfielder or we bring somebody in. Obviously the Bale transfer is the main centre of attention this window, as Modric was last window. As days go by I am becoming more optimistic that he is staying, although we will only find out when the announcement is made. The signings we have made have given us so much depth. Most Spurs fans would agree that if Sandro did not get injured last season we would have gotten top four. The signings we have made (with the rumours of Capoue imminently joining the Lane) allow injures to not have such a detrimental effect to our title chances. With Bale I say top 3, without I say top 4. 

Spurs 11

Lloris

Walker / Dawson / Vertonghen / BAE

Sandro

Paulinho / Dembele

Bale / Soldado / Lennon

However, with our added depth we could bring in Siggy/Holtby as more of an attacking midfielder (Holtby is slightly overboard/hyperactive when he is on the pitch but hopefully that will be rectified)

Overall I am very optimistic for this season, I feel top 3 is definitely a possibility providing a few things go our way (memories of the lasagne incident come to mind here, where most of our players succumb to food poisoning before match-day) and if Arsenal don't strengthen then top 4 is almost a given (I say almost because anything can happen in football).

I love what you're doing in the subreddit mate, keep it up!

The castle was built on an impractically massive scale, particularly its great south gatehouse, but much of the area inside its curtain walls was always empty and unoccupied.

Earl Thomas was later executed for his role in the barons’ rebellion against Edward II and the castle’s next main building phase consisted of an intense period of modernisation in the 1380s under John of Gaunt (who died in 1399). At the end of the Middle Ages, the castle fell into disrepair and became ever more ruinous as stone was removed for use elsewhere.

During the Second World War, the Northumberland coast was felt to be vulnerable to seaborne attack from occupied Norway, and the castle ruins were incorporated into an elaborate defensive network of trenches, gun emplacements, barbed wire and a minefield.

I'm expecting to find a parked bus from Hull

I expect a back line of cole, terry, luiz, iva.  Thought process is that we want Iva and Terry for set pieces, Luiz for his passing and Cole is just Cole.

Pivot of MVG and Essien to control midfield and restart attack.  I think Ramires is a waste against a parked bus lets make sure he is good to go against man u.  Could see him getting a run out if we get a lead just to stretch his legs.

Front 3 of Hazard, Oscar, Mata if he is healthy and KDB if he isn't.  I don't see Mata going more then 45 minutes though.

If we get a lead I see subs of Ramires, Moses, Schurrle for Essien, Mata and Hazard. If we are struggling to score I see subs of KDB for MVG with KDB dropping deeper, if that doesn't open them up i see Ivanovich dropping for Ba with Essien shifting deeper amd a scary Oscar/KDB pivot amd then when we score it will be Ramires or Mikel for Mata",0,1376225682,null,0,false,0,cblgfaa,t3_1k4yv5,t1_cblgfaa,t3_1k4yv5,null,1429868842,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

How does wilfully presenting as 18+ which is several years past the age of consent and entering an area where people will presume you are 18+ affect consent, should it affect that?

true,Sioreth,lfc68,," Perhaps ""ask"" was the wrong word. I don't think we can *demand* more than continued improvement.

&gt;  Acceptance of mediocrity?

How is wanting to improve an acceptance of mediocrity? It's kind of the opposite. Last season was a massive improvement. And I don't think we can *demand* anything more than that. If we improve by the same amount again this year, top 4 becomes a very realistic thing. (I think we will improve again, but not by as much.)

&gt; I'm sure the players would expect more, including our captain.

I'm sure they aim for more. Every time we play our aim is to win. That doesn't mean we expect to win every game in the season. Goals and expectations are two different things.

&gt; Another season of 6-7 th and the tide of opinion may turn on BR, even from FSG.

It depends on your attitude. I would be very disappointed if BR was sacked while the team is continuing to improve. If the improvement plateaus, then of course questions must be asked.

* 7th is clearly not an improvement.

* 6th, perhaps. If we finished 6th, with no more points than last season, only ahead of Everton because of Martinez, then that's clearly not an 

*  If we finish 5/6th, continue to improve our quality of play, get ~10 more points than last season, less than a game from 4th, I'd be pretty happy with that.

* 4th+ is our current primary aim.

But make no mistake. I'd be happy with improvement. But not content. I always want us to win. If we won the treble this year, I'd be ecstatic.

Next year I'd want to win the quadruple.

But I'm also realistic. I don't *expect* such things to happen. I can recognise that a moderate improvement over the season might not be what we dream about, but it's still what we need.

------------------------------------

Anyway, the real core of what I want to say, is that regardless of what our goals/expectations are for this season, we can't judge or decide whether those goals/expectations were met until the end of the season.

This was in response to the blog post, specifically:

&gt; We're ready for Stoke next week. Sigh.

&gt; Yes, yes, it's still preseason. Don't overreact when Liverpool play well, so don't overreact when Liverpool play poorly. And, admittedly, it wasn't nearly as bad as last season's ""bad.""

&gt; Nonetheless, it's slightly worrying that so many of last season's disappointments reappeared today, against the toughest opposition that Liverpool have faced over these seven friendlies. That's not a welcome sign right before the real football starts.

I guess, I just want to say that we need to chill out a bit. Too often I hear such sweeping generalisations (good and bad) made from the result of one match.

Yes, we can have matches where we play well and don't get the result. Or play average and win easily. Or the opponent plays very well. Or the ref makes a bad decision against us. Or for us. Or it hits the bar and goes in. Or bounces out.

My point is that these things tend to even out over the season. That's the good thing about playing everyone home and away. Every match seems to be discussed here like it is an indication of our entire season, some matches are even put up as examples of where the entire club presently sits in relation to others. But a single match is only 1/38th of what makes up an entire season.

I'm not saying don't discuss individual results or performances. Just, rather than decide how good we are based on a single match, let the season run its course, and decide afterwards how well we went overall.

As noted, we had a terrible start last year, improved late, finished in 7th, 12pts from 4th. In terms of individual matches, that's only a few losses into draws and draws into wins. But it won't be until the end of the season until we can safely compare, since at any time we can go on a winning/losing streak.

Even performances, which generally influence what the results are, will fluctuate. We can't tell if a single performance is just fluctuation, or whether it is indicative of the overall without having many other matches to compare to. Maybe history will show that the Celtic match was an indication of continued problem areas that were identified last year. But we can't tell that from just one match.

Football results are so often such a fine margin. Entire results can come down to whether a player can execute that one great pass, shot, tackle, or save. Because it is played at such a high skill level, every match players are being tested to the extremes of their abilities, and will not always get it right. Just think of some of the great goals scored in the EPL last year, by players like Suarez and Bale. If they had been unable to pull off the skill required to score those goals, many results would have probably turned out differently. Score a great goal, get the win, everyone says well played, good win. But if you perform the same in all areas, and just don't pull off that one piece of skill, suddenly the result is different, and we look at the match differently. Yes, if it continues to happen, that may indicate a lack of skill. But also, if you pull that piece of skill off several times over the season, it will quickly add up to a large difference at the end. And I guess that's what a season can rest on. You can play really well, but sometimes it's really up to those dozen times through the season when you can execute the perfect skill at the pivotal moment.

TL;DR: The season is long. Chill out and don't worry too much about each match. It's where we end up that really counts. It's a bit of a rant sorry. Just my thoughts on the subject really. I'm not against match analysis. Just against knee-jerk reactions to results, when really those results can come down to a single key moment.",0,1376228731,null,0,false,0,cblgy1w,t3_1k3o5o,t1_cblgy1w,t1_cblfkxg,null,1429868599,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

D'Urso is just the worst referee i have ever seen and we have had bad luck in all three games so far this season so i am not taking too much negativity from recent results (furthermore last season was phenomenal and we only had one point more at this stage).

We are certainly in need of an experienced full back, after Shorey was rejected i assumed we had a much better younger alternative who could drop in yet we still dont, and we need a cb to replace Greer.

I think the key issue is the changing style of football; Oscar is encouraging us to be more attacking and giving our creative players a more free role than Poyet allowed however this will take a few games to gel effectively and i think could be something really positive when CMS comes back or we sign another striker as we need options with the recurrent injuries amongst our strikers.

Finish on a high note though, 2 games and 2 goals for Ulloa in the league, when was the last time we didn't start the season with grumbles and concerns that perhaps we were light up front and don't have a 20 goal a season player.

If more decorative inclusions are desired, I suggest Chapter 8 of the same publication as fodder for how recent governments have gone to far, and where lines in the sand protecting the citizen could be drawn.  It's entitled, *the Great Repeal Bill*.

I would have thought a little bit of protection, easily identified and codified, would do well with things such as Prism, selling NHS records, Atos medical assessments, citizens being lifted under the European Arrest Warrant when it is known that there is no case against them and having to defend themselves across Europe. 

It's not an either or case.  

You don't have to take the rough with the smooth with the ECHR or European Directives like Consumer Directive 2013/11/EU which will actually serve to weaken consumer protection, by allowing companies to choose - or shop around for - a favourable ombudsman. despite all the initiatives in the UK to attempt to strengthen it.   You (We) can easily take the good, eject the rough, and centrally codify in a way that people can easily understand and which serves to limit continuous government encroachment.  It's not like a football match; you don't have to support one team or the other.  You can have a third fantasy 'football team' and make it manifest.  You can repeal the ECHR and cherry pick the good stuff and make it UK relevant.  There is no copyright to it.

And whilst we're at it the 1689 Bill of Rights included the legislators oath that ""[N]o foreign prince, person, prelate, state or potentate hath or ought to have jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence or authority within this Realm.""  Since it hasn't been repealed, we should probably go back and do some housecleaning there too and bring it into the fore whilst we're Fisking the ECHR to establish wheat and chaff.  Because that's surely been forgotten and is grounds for a referendum (a provision risen in the aforementioned chapter X).

true,LordMugwort,flair6,,"My case for going after Coentrao was that he's unsettled and seems to want to leave. He's clearly 2nd chice behind Marcelo at Madrid and the Portugese connection with our very own AVB could well be a factor if he chose to come to us. Also this partnership between clubs is supposed to work both ways.

Going into the season with just Rose at LB isn't anywhere close to ideal at the moment. He's shaky as hell defensively and while i'm all for giving him a chance we have to have someone who can step in if he doesn't work. AVB clearly doesn't fancy Benny for this and he looks very likely to be on his way out.

Coentrao is a massive upgrade over both. While i agree with you that he can be shaky on occasion at the back he's still a better option and a run of games rather than being in/out at Madrid would work wonders for him.

I wouldn't want us to go above €17 for him though. Hell a loan move with an option to buy would be even better. Beyond that we wait til next year and try for Shaw or someone else we haven't considered yet.

As for our transfer policy this season it seems we have finally decided to go for it. Having broke even over transfer dealings since the first season Harry was here we have money to spend. New tv money and another possible 3-4 outgoings means we probably end up spending £70 overall.

true,IntellegentIdiot,flair5,,"Spurs have a long and illustrious history. We are 131 years old this year. In 1901 we were the first amateur team to win the FA cup, a trophy we went on to win 8 times by 1991, the joint highest at that time. We were the first British club to win a european trophy when we beat Athletico Madrid in 1963 to win the Cup winners cup (later merged with the european cup to become the champions league). We were also the first ever winners of the UEFA cup. We were the first club to do the double, winning the league and FA cup in the first season in 1961. We were the first team to float on the stock exchange.

There's something that many fans, even Spurs fans are unaware of. In 1951 under manager Arthur Rowe, we developed a new style of play which was dubbed ""push and run"". Before then players generally passed the ball to a team mate but the Spurs players realised that it would be far more effective if the passer moved after playing the pass so they could be in a position to receive the ball back from the teammate they'd given it to. It revolutionised football and we now generally call it a one-two. It was the key to winning the second division in the 49/50 season and promoted to the first division we won that the following season 50/51. Of course, most teams realised how effective it was and soon everyone was playing this style.

Supporting Spurs can be a thrilling and agonising ride at times. Over the years we've experienced the highs but also the lows. After winning the league in 1951 and the double in 1961 the 70s were tough on Spurs fans with the club being relegated to the second division. The 80's were a positive time for the club, we bought two Argentinian players after the 1978 world cup which was unusual at the time. We won the FA cup in 81 and 82 and the UEFA cup in 83. We were FA cup finalists in 87. The 90's got off to a good start with a FA cup win in 91 and we had some exciting players like Paul Gascoine and Garry Lineker. The premiership arrived and many clubs decided to splash the cash, however Spurs' new owner Alan Sugar (later Sir Alan, now Lord Sugar) decided to enforce financial prudence on the club. It was understandable after the club had had serious financial difficulties shortly before Sugar bought it. However Sugar may have stuck with this strategy longer than needed and the club invested very little throughout the 90's and we suffered on the pitch too. Throughout the 90's Spurs finished in mid-table every season and didn't reach a cup final until 1999 when they beat Leicester City in the League Cup final and lost the next final in 2001.

Shortly after, Sugar sold the club to a company called ENIC who were partly owned by the new club chairman, Daniel Levy. Levy had a rocky start, hiring former successful Arsenal manager George Graham before firing him and putting former Spurs legend Glen Hoddle in charge. The Hoddle years weren't successful and Hoddle left and former manager David Pleat took over for the rest of the season until a new manager could be appointed. In the summer of 2004 Levy appointed French manager Jacques Santini as the new manager, after that summers World Cup. Dutch manager Martin Jol was given the assistant manager position and Frank Arnesen was appointed director of football. That summer was, in my opinion, the birth of the new club. The new management team made some key signings in England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, Michael Carrick, Pedro Mendes and Michael Dawson who joined Jermain Defoe who'd signed in the Janurary window. Santini walked out after a few weeks and Jol took over, Arnesen was poached by Chelsea but Jol and new director of football Damien Comolli took the club forward. Under Jol we finished 9th, our highest finish for many seasons and in his first full season we finished 5th, an astonishing achievement after almost 15 years of mediocrity. We missed out on the Champions League thanks to a virus infecting most of the squad the night before the final game, which ended in defeat. The next season gave us our first taste of european football for 6 years, and the extra burden seemed to slow progress in the league but we managed another 5th place finish. Jol was sacked and replaced by Sevillia manager Juande Ramos who led the team to the first trophy of the decade but his disappointing league finish and start to the following season saw him replaced by Harry Redknapp. The team bounced back and finished 5th again in Redknapps first full season but the following season we fought of a challenge from Manchester City to finish 4th and win entry to our first ever Champions league. However like Jol's first attempt at the UEFA cup, we struggled to progress in the league while playing in the Champions league and disappointingly we could only manage 5th place before finishing 4th the following season only to be denied a place by a Chelsea team that finished below us but won the Champions League. In truth, we should have finished 3rd but a disastrous run in the last few weeks saw us scrape 4th. Redknapp was sacked and replaced by ex-porto and ex-Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas. Many fans were sceptical of this, fearing that his results at Chelsea suggested he was a poor manager and early results were not received well despite a squad that was beset by injuries and several new signings who had yet to integrate into the team. Some fans feared the worse and hoped for a quick sacking but Levy kept faith with AVB and was repaid with a haul of 75pts, our highest ever tally since the premiership began 20 seasons ago.

I'm very positive about the future. I was not a fan of Redknapp who I felt had a good squad but didn't make the most of those players. I feel AVB has shown the sort of decision making that will maximise the potential of the squad. Next season we will have two key players back from injury. Kaboul, one of our best players, missed the whole of last season and Sandro, another crucial player, also missed a large part of the season. We have made some promising signings breaking our 6 year old transfer record to sign Pauliniho and breaking that by signing Spanish striker Roberto Soldado. That signing has been a relief to many fans who've felt the club needed to sign a great striker for many seasons. I believe we've been without a top class striker since we sold Berbatov and Keane 5 years ago. For the first time I can remember we have a strong attack and a strong midfield at the same time, we have a pretty good defence and a great keeper.

The only thing that could dampen this is the sale of Gareth Bale. A great player but one who'll inevitably leave the club one day. However, I believe that we will still be in great shape even if Bale does leave this summer, although clearly it will have an impact

Furthermore, European games are exciting.  I don't care what anyone says about the quality of the competition, last year's run provided some of the best games of the season.  In any case, outside of the top couple leagues the Europa League actually is a big deal.  A good run (especially a win) raises our profile abroad so we are more likely to snag talent like Chiriches or Halilovic.

true,kitsandkats,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; Rape used to bring a picture of a hooded man grabbing a lone woman at night. It used to be a horrific crime of violence which everybody knew would scar the victim forever.

Which was completely the wrong image for people to focus on to begin with. Most victims of rape are attacked by someone they know - a spouse, a 'friend', acquaintance, family member. Assault by a stranger when out at night is much rarer, and is certainly not the only ""valid"" definition of rape.

&gt;  I don't know how many false accusations are made - the media would suggest it's at least some. 

Sure, people do falsely report crimes, and for a variety of reasons. But the idea that rape is more commonly falsely reported than other crimes is based on little to no credible evidence,  and is [extremely damaging](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/13/false-rape-allegations-ra_n_2865823.html) to victims.

&gt; ... feminists now seem to be fighting a battle to keep rape perceived as the worst possible crime (let's not bring the crazy ones into it), however in the public perception rape will lose it's stigma and it's not long before we hear sentences like ""Oh, date rate [sic], not proper rape"", where the perceived meaning is ""Oh you're just saying that the day after"".

Rape *is* a horrible crime. It's painful, shameful, and victims of rape are treated differently to victims of other crimes - no other crime results in the level of scrutiny of a person's life or conduct than a sexual attack. A man who is mugged is not asked how many times he went out wearing an expensive watch in clear view of the mugger; he is not asked what he thought he was doing walking in *that* part of town at night; he is not asked if he had been drinking before he was mugged. 

Is it the 'worst crime'? I don't think there is a 'worst crime'. Rape just happens to be a particularly horrendous crime, that disproportionately affects women - of course feminists care about it.

Regarding date rape - it's a real crime. I don't understand why people consider it ""less bad"" if someone is subjected to sexual activity without their consent if they had been drinking with/were drugged by the person who raped them. It certainly isn't code for ""I had sex with ___ and then I regretted it"". 

&gt; I would say there's going to be a problem if the word rape is used to encompass what's perceived as several different crimes.

The word 'rape' not being used to encompass several different crimes. [It has a very clear legal definition](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1).",0,1376236435,null,0,false,0,cblitwr,t3_1k4i6a,t1_cblitwr,t1_cblfxy5,null,1429867719,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

There's [this](http://web2.bma.org.uk/pressrel.nsf/wall/1F182180B5D17A6B80257B8800472B4D?OpenDocument) but that's vague as all get out. I had a look at their 'call for e-cigarette regulation' paper from earlier in the year. [Link to pdf](http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/.../tobaccoecigarettespublicplaces_jan2013.pdf).

.

From there they cite passive 'vaping' as a confirmed phenomenon. Checking out the sources for that yields three papers to check out. I'm having to use the abstracts here as I don't have access/subs to the journals publishing these papers.

.

[The first one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22672560) confirms passive vaping is a thing, but offers no comments on the effects, as they don't even know the chemical composition of the vapour inhaled. There was a measured increase in volatile chemicals and fine particles in the 'inhaled vapour', but no comment is made in the abstract on the size of the increase.

.

[The second one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913171) confirms an increase in fine particles and volatiles, confirms the volatiles as the propylene glycol and glycerol used as the solvents. [Glycerol toxicity assesment](http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/56815.pdf). [Propylene glycol toxicity assessment](http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/57-55-6.pdf). Both of these are low toxicity. If the vapour's fine particles were *all* the slightly more toxic glycerol, it'd need to be ten times more concentrated to even cause local irritation. Paper concludes that the effects of the chemicals in e-cig vapour specifically hasn't really been studied.

.

[The third one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23033998) claims a broader range of chemicals in e-cig vapour than the others. Tests carcinogen risk and ""Non-cancer risk analysis revealed ""No Significant Risk"" of harm to human health for vapor samples from e-liquids"" and ""The study indicates no apparent risk to human health from e-cigarette emissions based on the compounds analyzed."". Says all I really need to, here.

.

If these are the *best* three sources to support a ban.. they're really struggling to justify it. The papers sourced by the BMA themselves say they don't know, and need to study more, or that there isn't a health risk.

.

The ban seems to be in line with some of the notions from the papers - that e-cig use will normalise smoking again. Is that really enough justification? I'd have thought the burden of proof would be on the people trying to ban the stuff. Are bans a legitimate way of altering culture?

true,dave8001,null,null,"Until recently, I would have said that Rose was the best place to start for new fans.  However; given that you have a good 3 years worth of episodes I would now say that the best place to start is ""The Eleventh Hour""; but do it in mind that the doctor regenerates.  This means that effectively he becomes ""a new man"", and therefore a new actor takes on his role.  

kind of like the cliché ""a cat has nine lives"" the Doctor has (at the moment) 13; and therefore, when something happens that puts The Doctor in mortal danger he regenerates.  

My last statement is not strictly true...

1st Doctor (1963 - 1966):  Became tired in the end and regenerated into a new body to effectively rejuvenate himself.

2nd Doctor (1966 - 1969):  Was forced to regenerate by the timelords (he is a renegade, and it takes a long time to explain the backstory of this part, but in the future when you watch classic episodes you will get the gist.  

3rd Doctor (1970 - 1974) - he regenerated after being in mortal danger brought on with his interaction from spiders from the spider planet.

4th Doctor (1975 - 1981) - regenerated after falling from a satellite trying to save the world from The Master

5th Doctor (1982 - 1984) - fatally exposed to radiation on Androzani and therefore regenerated.

6th Doctor (1984 - 1986) - although effectively unseen, he regenerated due to some interaction with The Rani.

7th Doctor (1986 - 1989; 1996) Came back to earth and stepped out of the TARDIS somewhere in America and is shot.  He falls unconscious and is taken to hospital, doctors who are unaware that he is alien try to operate on him and subsequently cause his death.

8th Doctor (1996) - unknown; though it is suggested he regenerated through the timewar.

From this potted history of regenerations watch from The Eleventh Hour, and catch up to present day, probably in time for the 50th Anniversary, and therefore potentially up to the time when the doctor regenerates into his next incarnation.

When you have time go back and watch the episodes from 2005 including Rose right up until the End of Time.  

Then in time go back and start watching as many of the classiscs.

&gt;Are bans a legitimate way of altering culture

That's a completely different argument. Train companies are not banning products to change social behaviour, they are banning them to please their customers and thus prevent losing revenue. They couldn't care less about what it means socially.

There's 1.3 million e-cig users in the UK according to a bbc article on it last month. Were I a rail company, I'd rather not alienate potentially 2% of my customer base.

.

I'd really like to know how many customers being made 'uneasy' it takes for a company to consider something worth banning. I imagine it isn't many. Most of the discomfort I've seen of around e-cigs has been people not knowing e-cigs existed, or how they work. People assume that because it provides inhaled nicotine like a cigarette, it must be just as dangerous as a cigarette. It seems unjust to tell people they can't partake in what seems to be a harmless activity due to others being uninformed. I realise this is only anecdotal but I've never seen or heard of any objections to e-cigs that weren't 'that's a real cig!' and 'surely it's dangerous!'.

.

I guess you make a good point that private companies do what they want. But that doesn't mean their decisions can't be dumb. I doubt the number of complaints matches the proportion of rail users that use e-cigs. I don't think there's enough evidence-based justification for a ban. From all aspects this appears to be a stupid decision.

.

And finally, like I said in my other response to you - consumer choice on the railways is a total joke. So although this is a private company, from whom I can theoretically withdraw custom at any time... it isn't. I don't own a car and coaches go long distances at half the speed in none of the comfort.

true,HMoy,english,Coventry,"""THE website Ask.fm, on which Hannah Smith, 14, received hate messages before she was found hanged, has provoked further controversy by claiming she posted many of the comments herself.

Ask.fm executives are understood to have said privately that the company has analysed the profiles of the senders of the bullying messages and concluded that Hannah had set up most of the anonymous identities herself and sent the vast majority of the messages.

“With the Hannah case, the company have looked at every identity — the IP addresses are trackable. She posted the anonymous things herself. The police has all that data,” a source claimed.

In private briefings last week, the company said “98%” of the messages had come from the same IP address as Hannah’s, with about four posts that had not.

The company’s claim is likely to further upset those who say the company is not doing enough to tackle internet trolls on its website after it was widely blamed for Hannah’s death.

In a post on his Facebook page yesterday, her father David Smith reacted angrily to the company’s claims that Hannah had been sending the messages to herself.

“Mybe [sic] she was but she was tryin to do anything to stop people from bullyin her hannah was bullied at school on her phone and on the internet she was a desperate little girl that had been ground down . . .”

Last night he accused Ask.fm’s executives of trying to “cover their backs”.

“They would say that, wouldn’t they?” he told The Sunday Times. He added that he knew the identity of one of those who had bullied his daughter on the site.

“I have evidence she was being bullied by someone on the site. They [the bully] had admitted it.” However, he declined to give any further information, saying it would be made public soon.

The schoolgirl, from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, was found hanged nine days ago. It emerged she had been taunted for months on the site over her weight and the death of an uncle. One user urged her to “drink bleach”.

The site operates as a question-and-answer forum used by millions of teenagers and its users have in the past been targeted by trolls who are able to hide behind the site’s facility to post anonymously.

Since Hannah’s death, there has been a public furore about online bullying and a growing advertisers’ boycott of Ask.fm. Smith has called for the site’s owners to be charged with manslaughter.

David Cameron last week urged a boycott of “vile” websites that allowed cyberbullying.

Brothers Mark and Ilja Terebin, Russian entrepreneurs who founded Ask.fm in Latvia, have indicated they would in future identify anonymous users via their IP addresses and “ensure this information is accessible to the appropriate legal authorities”.

They described Hannah’s death as “a true tragedy” and said they had been in contact with Leicestershire police.

But claims by the company that Hannah was responsible for the majority of the messages will be seen by many as a desperate response by a company that has taken a financial battering after advertisers pulled their contracts.

Leicestershire police said it could not comment on what the company had told it. A spokeswoman said: “Hannah’s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Officers acting on behalf of the coroner have secured a computer and a mobile phone as part of the coroner’s investigation into the circumstances surrounding the unexpected death and any activity on social networking sites.”

Since news of Hannah’s death emerged, household brands including Specsavers, Durex, Vodafone and Laura Ashley have instructed advertising agencies to remove them from Ask.fm.

Hannah’s is the latest death linked to Ask.fm. At least four teenagers in Britain and Ireland are said to have taken their own lives after being abused on its forum.

A company employee said it had been working hard to keep website abuse in check since the previous deaths: “Report buttons and support services were made. They grew from a team of 8-10 people to 50 where most are full-time moderators.

“The anonymous function was never designed to support bullying. Teenagers are shy and it takes a lot of courage to approach someone you like.”

Late last week the company called in the British law firm Mishcon de Reya to launch an independent investigation of the site and its safety features.

The company has previously provoked controversy by claiming teenagers who killed themselves were in fact bullying themselves online.

Ilja Terebin claimed in an interview in May that an analysis of key words such as “kill yourself” on the site found that “about 90%” of this type of bullying originates from young people who are “trolling themselves” anonymously.

“Kids lack attention, mainly because parents are doing other things such as watching TV, drinking beer and reading the tabloids,” Terebin told a technology blog based in Finland.

“When they come to sites like these, they start trolling themselves so that their peers start protecting them. In this absurd way, they get the attention.”

* 1908: Finland competes separately from the Russian Empire. Not permitted to fly their flag.

* 1920: Some losers of WW 1 not permitted to participate. One punished by losing the right to host.

* 1924: Germany not invited.

* 1936: Ireland boycotts the games. Peru and Colombia leave after an incident.

* 1948: Germany and Japan suspended from the games.

* 1952: Those two still suspended.

* 1956: Boycotts from the Arab world, Europe, and China.

* 1964: South Africa suspended because of apartheid. Two countries boycott.

* 1968: The Black Power salute, today seen as a significant historical event. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1972: Predecessor state of Zimbabwe banned for apartheid reasons. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1976: Canada makes a fuss about Taiwan playing because they didn't recognise it. China boycotts when they finally cave. Meanwhile, Africa boycotts. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1980: Half of all participating nations boycott, led by the US protesting the invasion of Afghanistan. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1984: The Soviet bloc has revenge by boycotting in retaliation. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1988: A bunch of Second World countries boycott. South Africa still suspended for apartheid.

* 1992: South Africa has political reforms, releases political prisoners, allowed to participate the Olympics.

* 2008: A hundred and one calls for boycott and whatnot from everyone starting with the Prince of Wales and Spielberg to prominent European parliamentarians to everyday people.

George Orwell's view on sports comes to mind. The fact is that the Olympics have consistently been used to score political points. I, therefore, disagree with your statement that one does not mix politics with the Olympic games.

massive understatement. I've installed it a couple of times, and even something that's supposed to be relatively ""simple"" or ""easy"" like ubuntu is terrible. You want to watch a youtube video? well, first you need to apt-get install this package and it's 12 dependencies. well, I say 12, but 3 of them have their own dependencies too so you need to do them first.

You've spent 45 minutes doing that? ok, now you need to go into an obscure text file and edit 17 hex values because apparently linux doesn't know what hardware you're using, and you have to give it that information yourself. There you go! now you can nearly get 20fps watching a 240p video because the linux drivers for your gpu are shit.

You want to use your netgear wifi adapter? well, you need to download the NDISwrapper package and pull the files from the windows drivers you obviously have lying around on a disk. Now you've done that, you're just 3 hours away from being able to do what windows can do out of the box. See how great this is?

Linux is, in my experience, a piece of shit incapable of doing virtually anything graphics related and it's not accessible, at all. I've spent more time trying to get shit working in linux in the ~month I've had it installed than I have trying to get things working in windows over my entire life. /rant

It isn't the case that workers in the Netherlands necessarily have an average of ~£8K more per year to spend -- Taxation is very different in the Netherlands, and is much more weighted to favour low earners than in the UK. For example those earning under ~€20K pay only 5.85% income tax. By contrast those earning over ~€33K pay 42% - much higher than the comprable UK rate (the same amount, £28K, pays just 20% here).

Personally, it seems to me that while this isn't wonderful news for us as individuals - for the UK outlook in the long term it is actually fairly good news. This is because it is further evidence that legislative reforms are actually translating into increased competitiveness. Lower wages for workers mean lower operating costs for the buisnesses that will help to drive some sort of recovery. The question is, how much lower will they go and what effect will that have on living standards... and the other question is are the economic benefits of lower wages actually equalling increased competitiveness (i.e. are rising energy prices, shipping costs, taxes etc. undoing the effects of lower wages).",0,1376240474,null,0,false,0,cblk1x8,t3_1k4w9m,t1_cblk1x8,t1_cblg6f6,null,1429867109,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

A global financial crisis was inevitably going to have a larger effect on a nation like the UK whose economy was far more centred around financial services than the export orientated economies of Scandinavia.

Tougher regulation of their financial service sector isn't the reason why they came off better... the fact their financial service sector was much smaller was the reason. And the reason their financial services sector was much smaller was because it is over-regulated.

One of my bugbears is how people have turned on our financial services industry these past few years, but I didn't see them complaining when they were getting cheap credit cards or buying sofas on hire purchase... we all benefited from that industry - unfortunately the downside was when it got hit by a recession that originated in the real culprit of all this.. the USA... we were slightly more exposed to it - but that is no reason to turn our backs on banking as an industry, or to start dumping restrictive regulation on it. But rather, the real key is to diversify our income sources.

What **is** interesting about Scandinavian economies is that their export structures are very similar to ours, Sweden in particular:

I want Luiz and Cahill in defense because they complement each other. One is extremely adventurous and Cahill is so focused on his duty that you will rarely find him off his position. This is why he keeps backing up to block shots as the last line of defense (something for which he is criticized for). In reality he is backing off so the keeper always has one defender to rely on regardless of what happens. This is an extremely good tactic to use against teams that use through balls and play all that fancy football of catching defenders off their line.

Look, many of your points are valid and your grading of what would be deemed progression I would agree with.

I don't judge the team game by game, I have been harping on about the need to get some proven quality into the first team all summer, and since BR took over actually.

I look at the squad and see a few different faces but nothing to show me we won't encounter the same old failings as last season.

Kind of my point. I just don't see the progression this summer. I know its a matter of wait and see during the season.

What players have we added who will help us compete better with the top 6 teams in the league or solve the issue of being bullied by high tempo, physical teams who soak up our possession football and kill us on the break?

I just look at the team. Form, winning runs, results against rivals it all just comes down to the quality on the pitch. Not circlejerk internet forums, media manipulation etc.

When it all comes down to it. Its a simple game. ",0,1376243268,null,0,1376243743,0,cblkyf2,t3_1k3o5o,t1_cblkyf2,t1_cblgy1w,null,1429866688,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Which means your wealth is probably less, regardless of the amazingly high PPP figures. So PPP is not the be all and end all of economic measurement, and data on income and, yes, unemployment, is relevant to decide how well off people are.

I don't know if you understand this: the *definition* of unemployment is [being without work *and actively seeking work*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment). If you genuinely don't want to work, you aren't unemployed, you're just not part of the labour force. Which means that, above the natural rate of unemployment where people are mostly actively seeking a better job than they have found yet, unemployment means that people who want to work can't, which isn't good for their wellbeing. It also means that the country isn't producing as much stuff as it could, as it could make more if the unemployed people had jobs. As output becomes income, this means everyone is poorer (adjusted for PPP) than they could be.

true,lightsaberon,null,null,"&gt;Which means your wealth is probably less, regardless of the amazingly high PPP figures. So PPP is not the be all and end all of economic measurement, and data on income and, yes, unemployment, is relevant to decide how well off people are.

PPP takes into account how easily people can afford things though.  No one claimed ppp was a be all or end all of economic measure.  Obviously, in a state with a decent welfare system, people wouldn't end up with ""nothing""!

&gt;Which means that, above the natural rate of unemployment where people are mostly actively seeking a better job than they have found yet, unemployment means that people who want to work can't, which isn't good for their wellbeing.

I'm not exactly sure what you're saying in the early part of this sentence.  What is ""the natural rate of unemployment""?  

You again use the term ""wellbeing"", which you haven't bothered explaining.  As I asked before, is someone forced to work a shit job wellbeing?  

&gt;It also means that the country isn't producing as much stuff as it could,

China produces far more than we do, are we now less wealthy than them?  Are the Chinese better off?

&gt;as it could make more if the unemployed people had jobs. As output becomes income, this means everyone is poorer (adjusted for PPP) than they could be. 

This is not true.  If the unemployed are given adequate welfare, they're able to then help boost spending, which makes the economy grow.  This in turn leads to more jobs.  Whereas, if we force the unemployed to take low paid work, spending will be markedly less, the economy will shrink and will lead to fewer jobs.

As soon as people rejected the idea of net neutrality then certain information channels were always going to become privileged. 

Once Google provided a reliable way of indexing content then it presented a system which the moneyed could exploit to their advantage.

If anyone were to start a site tomorrow about politics or television or any popular subject the chances of them succeeding by good content on its own without SEO or backlinks from a site that is already enormously popular would be next to nothing, even if one piece of content were more relevant to a particular web search than any other page on the web.

So that's what it's about: in a place where traditionally your money or your cultural capital or your professional and social standing mean less than the content you provide and the quality you display to other users, the mechanisms of societal control have been less easy to exercise.

The turning point was Arab Spring. Western leaders applauded the people ""freeing themselves form tyranny"" and thought 'fuck. That could be us.' So now we see well meaning interventions; The children can see porn! The children are being bullied! The children are committing suicide!

Perhaps we should start an intervention of our own: Help the children are being herded and led by their noses into a system that regards them as no more than assets, meat machines to be utilised and manipulated to prop up our failing monopolies and oligarachies!

If the injury is a problem, Kenneth Omeruo has shown similar quality and can be recalled from loan (6 choices).

Coincidence? Not at all. 

Saying that, it is necessary to be able to read your guests. Last night, I had two ladies who ordered a bottle of wine and I pretty much left them alone all night, save a couple times I checked up on them to see if they needed anything because I knew they didn't want to be talked to and wanted to visit with each other. At the same time I had a party of four on the other side of the row who were laughing and joking with me and having a grand old time. 

Also, having a good personality and involving your guests is a nice way to completely turn a table around. I was super busy (last night again) and running around for four tables that got sat at once (2 4's and 2 2's) and I'd forgotten one 2-tops soup order. Brought it out and sat it down and then ran off to do all the other things I had to do. Came back and they'd finished the soup but said it was cold but it was fine because I was so busy. Made sure to pay more attention to them and chatted with them the rest of the night (taking off the cold soups, of course) and they were really happy at the end and left me a really nice tip.

Even just last week I had 2 guests who hadn't been to my restaurant in 6-8 months who told me, ""This is so weird, most of the other servers at this restaurant have no personality and we never talk to them... We can't remember the last time we talked to one of our servers about anything."" They ended up giving me a list of some really good stores and restaurants to check out!

If the recession had been caused by a sudden global shock to timber exports or oil production then they would have been more vulnerable. One of the reasons the Swedes had a vastly smaller financial services sector in the first place was because it is over-regulated and stiffled.

Our fairly unregulated financial services industry isn't particularly the problem... the problem is that a country based around a single industry is always going to be excessively vulnerable to shocks in that industry. We have already taken steps towards diversifying, and that is the real solution - not destroying one of our only major industries.

The same could have happened to Sweden if an agricultural disease suddenly infected the Spruce and Pine trees that make up 80% of their huge timber export industry... but fortunately for them that isn't what happened... and we shouldn't forget that all of this current problem originated in the USA, not the UK.

&gt;Playing LB still allows him the option to attack but means defenders won't be ready for him or concentrating their defence his way. He's got the fitness to run up and down all day so he's not going to tire out. Plus 'Arry reckons he's a left back and he knows what he's doing.

The diversity and choice in opinion, in subject and in tone that internet voices provide are somewhat of a problem to people whose business model resides in restricting choice and viewpoints.

No, no one really takes FFP super-seriously, but even City and Chelsea are trying to reign in spending a bit (as are we) because it's not sustainable to keep shoveling money into a club.

You really need to reset your expectations if you think the owners should (or will) continue to spend their personal money on LFC.  They've already done so to a fair amount and, while they will continue to be supportive within reason, they're very unlikely to continue to allow £50M losses each year.  The alternative is LFC starts taking even more loans against the club to finance transfers but this is precisely one of the courses of action that almost lead to administration last time.  You're also implying that United and Arsenal, both of whom live within their means, aren't serious about 'contending' which just seems incorrect to me.  Consider those two the rule, Chelsea and City the exceptions rather than the other way around and you are closer to reality.  

In addition, it's not as simple as Henry or any single individual writing a check as FSG is composed of 17 (I think that's right, going from memory) investors.  So, any additional investment would have to be approved (and funded) by the collective (and/or they would have to agree to a change in share allotment- currently Henry is majority owner, with all others holding less than 10% of the shares).",0,1376249896,null,0,false,0,cbln4hn,t3_1k4ltq,t1_cbln4hn,t1_cblmity,null,1429865604,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

United have probably resigned to the fact that Rooney isn't going to change his mind anytime soon. They're smart enough to realise that keeping him will destroy the team morale and be a waste of money. They're now prepared to sell him off but they want to push it to the last few days for these reasons.

1. August 26th is their game against us. There would be nothing worse than Rooney  going back to Old Trafford in a blue shirt and scoring a hat trick against them while we crush them 6-0 while Rooney celebrates his goals by kissing the Chelsea badge and revealing a ""once a blue always a blue"" under shirt (wishful thinking. I know) but they know Rooney is a class player and if they're gonna strengthen our squad by giving us him, they won't do it before our game.

2. United want to challenge for the title this season and giving us Rooney makes it so much more difficult for them. They'll probably have a chat with Arsenal or Madrid or literally anyone that isn't challenging for the title. If they give us Rooney now, none of these teams can make a rush decision to try and buy him before we do, because we'll already have him.

3. It gives them time to search for a new signing to make it not seem as bad when they lose Rooney. They don't want any #MoyesOut campaigns now do they?

true,simonask,eu,Danish guy in UK,"&gt; That's a pretty simplistic analysis of the north south divide in the UK.

I'll be the first in line to admit that. :)

&gt;  It isn't really fair to blame it on Conservative governments simply ignoring the less populous north. Indeed this current government is pushing enterprise zones quite aggressively with limited sucess due to much more complex barriers to financial sucess in the north -- The reality is the north:south divide is a product of longstanding geographical, social, political and industrial changes - and is in no small part largely caused by 50 years of progressive industrial decline that was poorly managed by sucessive governments (not just conservative) and further exacerbated by the inability of the northern economy to rapidly adapt to the changes that were occuring to remain competitive in other industries.

Everyone sort of seems to agree, though, that if it hadn't been for Thatcher [that is, the people who elected her], the North would be doing a lot better than it currently is.

Another biggie is the fact that education is a consistent factor in improving social mobility, and access was just recently limited by the increase in tuition fees, enacted by the current Conservative government.

All in all, the Conservatives can't take all the blame for the state of the North, but they sure deserve a significant portion of it.

I'm not saying it's not morally dubious, but it's not child rape.

Other countries just decline to prosecute a lot of the cases which fall into the teenage-boyfriend-girlfriend category.

Only a tiny percentage of cases of rape is prosecuted in the UK (and worldwide).  Any child (teenagers included) cannot consent to sex, especially if the other party is an adult.  That's the end of it.  If said adult can prove to have believed them to be older then sentences are generally reduced or dropped but the case should go to trial.  That is the only way that the way in which rape and rape victims are treated will improve.

&gt; Then there was a rumour a couple of days ago that we would soon make a third bid. Usually the press is really fast with coming out that the bid was rejected but in this case I didn't read anything yet so the offer was probably pretty good and they have to think about it

Ok this is where your theory falls over, Chelsea haven't made a 3rd bid, if they has we'd know, everything so far has been open and in public, no reason they would change that tactic

&gt; It's also rumoured that Rooney already told his teammates that he would come to us.

The ESPN article with no quotes... No one can use that as evidence of anything but terrible Journalism.

But I'll reiterate, we have nothing to worry about when it comes to the Argentinians invading, I'd imagine that the Dauntless and limited air force stationed on the islands would be able to repulse any attack (which won't happen because the Argentinian Navy is almost non-existent).

true,Jamaicaman90,swans1995,1912,"[Here is a nice starter guide for you](http://fanchants.co.uk/football-team/swansea_city/) (even if it has quite a lot missing).

And now for my personal favourite (for very biased reasons):

You know how, when one set of fans are quiet for a while, the other set chant something along the lines of '*Are you sleeping over there?*', '*Shall we sing a song for you?*', or '*Can you hear the X sing, no, no*'?

Well, we have our own song. To the tune of Sloop John B, it goes like this:

&gt;We'll sing on our own,

&gt;We'll sing on our own,

&gt;We're Swansea City,

&gt;We'll sing on our own!

The reason it's my favourite is simply because, achieving a childhood ambition, I started it. It started at a League Cup first round match against Shrewsbury Town away around two years ago, where the atmosphere was dreadful and we lost. A few beers down my neck and a laughably poor home support prompted me to sing:

&gt;I'll sing on my own,

&gt;I'll sing on my own,

&gt;I can hear my own echo,

&gt;I'll sing on my own!

I sang it at the absolute top of my voice, and it really did echo around the ground. The stand nearest to me actually got quite agitated by that one, and it brought the crowd to life for a good ten minutes at least. Our travelling support gave me the honour of a '*You Jack bastard!*' chant, and the adapted version has been sung home and away ever since, and I even heard it from the fans who travelled to Sweden. My stupid bollocks getting all the way to European competition, who'd have thought it!

A bit of a tangent from what you were asking, but that story doesn't half fill me with pride when I think about it!

In my opinion, Welsh football has some fantastic players to select from right now - except strikers. Bellamy is quality, gives it his all and has a good record... but he's getting older. There's nobody else right now who is really good enough to get us to qualify for a major tournament, and this has been the case since... well, since Earnshaw went off the boil.

On top of that, they are both big Cardiff boys. Hartson was the last real Jack to play up front for Wales (even if he never played for us, he still proudly represented the city), and when he was young and he had his first senior cap for Swansea, I really hoped that he would push on and make it.

If I remember correctly, he got that first cap around the same time as Joe Allen. I'm sure any of you watching then will remember that Allen looked very suspect in his first few games, and many fans thought he wouldn't amount to much.

true,ChivalrousWombat,null,null,"Well...you should know something of these things:

Our manager **Jose Mourinho** first came to us back in the 2004/2005 season off the back of a UEFA CL victory with Porto. Upon his arrival, he announced he was ""The Special One"", this seemed to be very high brow and...arrogant. Soon, he proved his words right by winning Chelsea's first top flight league title in 50 years with the highest points total ever achieved(95) and with the fewest goals conceded(15). Two records we still hold today.

After that, we won the league again, and also the FA Cup and the league cup. Every domestic title in England was Mou's.

In 2007, Jose left because of some background turmoil.

Our **Captain**, John Terry, is a centre-back(central defender). He used to play for and Captain England, but has since retired from International duty. He graduated from the Chelsea Academy, and has played for us for the majority of his career, only spending a short loan away. He bleeds blue and he's a club legend, a Mourinho favorite and his partnership with Ricardo Carvalho, a recruit from FC Porto, was one of the toughest and most effective partnerships of the last decade.

Another **legend**, Frank Lampard, is the highest ever goal scoring midfielder in the history of the Premier League (1992), and Chelsea FC's highest ever goal scorer with 203 goals. [He equaled and surpassed club legend Bobby Tambling's goal record of 202 goals this past season against Aston Villa with these goals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXcy6YaHt50)

We purchased Frank from West Ham in 2001 and for the past 10 years, he's scored more than 13 goals each campaign. A phenomenal record for any player, let alone a midfielder.

A **Frank Lampard - Jose Mourinho moment**. Frank was infamously quoted saying that Mourinho came into the showers after the game, ""While I was cleaning my balls, told me I was the best player in the world.""

Other great players who are still on the team are Petr Cech, our goal keeper. Ashley Cole, our left back. Branislav Ivanovic, for his great bum(also a defender). Eden Hazard, a modern day superstar. **Juan Mata, a midfield genius likened to our voted greatest ever player, the Italian Gianfranco Zola**. Oscar, brazil's number 10. David Luiz, Brazilian CB, awesome goals from his and a great head of hair. And more.

Recently departed legend, **Didier Drogba**, many would say that he single-handedly won us our greatest trophy. The UEFA Champions League. They wouldn't be far from the truth, after he gave an inspired run of performances that dominated the best teams in the world, scored in the final to carry us into penalties and buried the final penalty that sealed our greatest and most controversial victory over Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich's Stadium.

With his final kick of the ball in a Chelsea jersey, Didier Drogba cemented his place in Chelsea history. It's practically a fairly tale. We were the underdogs in almost every tie, and many taunt us over our ""Defensive"" performances against some of the best attacking sides the world has ever seen in Club football. But we won.

We play at Stamford Bridge in West London. There's talk of us moving to a larger stadium, but suitable areas are very hard to come by in London, giving talk of expanding our current stadium, which would be, arguably, too expensive, and insubstantial to fit our needs as a top club. We house about 45,000 currently. A club of our stature would ideally fit in about 60,000.

Some events you should know about;

Our Champions League semi-final match versus Barcelona in 2009 was extremely controversial. Chelsea were denied countless, legitimate and obvious penalty shouts by the referee. And we lost the match in the dying minutes of the game. Didier Drogba was recorded live on television saying it was a ""F___ing disgrace."" Emotions ran high and everyone felt cheated, and rightly so. We've had some great matches before than against Barcelona, notably in 2005, we won 4-2. Fantastic match. But this game was different, and it created a venomous hatred toward Barcelona and UEFA for many fans.

In 2012, our infamous victory over Barcelona on the way to our CL victory, was viewed as sweet revenge for 2009. Fernando Torres scored the final goal of the game and is honestly one of my favorite moments.

In 2008, Chelsea played Liverpool in the Champions league, the second leg of the tie ended 4-4 and is a fantastic game to watch.

In 2009-2010, Chelsea ended the campaign under then-Manager Carlo Ancelotti by winning our first ever domestic double. That is, we won the Premier League and the FA Cup. And we did so in style, scoring 103 goals in 38 matches, a record total. The highlights for that season are fantastic.

The new season, that is 2013-2014, Mourinho has returned to Chelsea, now referring to himself as ""The Happy One"". He's loved by the fans and press, though sometimes controversial, he's a fantastic manager with an impeccable record of winning wherever he goes.

Many call us favorites for the title this year, but make no mistake, the PL is very competitive and there's no guarantees. Every one of our rivals has strengthened tremendously in what must be the busiest transfer period in years.

Now, I've not posted everything, not nearly everything. Hell, I've probably missed some stuff. But part of following the club will be finding out about this stuff for yourself. That's part of being a fan; showing the desire to follow the club.

Do some reading. Follow the news(not all of it), watch the games.

Glad your following Chelsea! Keep the blue flag flying high!

Edit: Another fun fact. In 2008, Chelsea were one kick away from winning the coveted Champions League. It was a penalty shoot-out in Moscow, versus English rivals Manchester United. John Terry, the club Captain, Leader and Legend, stepped up to take to would-be winning penalty. To the dread of every Chelsea fan around the world, John Terry slipped, missed and was reduced to tears.

We all help to create and maintain the situations we find ourselves in and paradoxically we are all being shaped by the world around us. Most bullies and those bullied live in the same distorted reality field that is shaped by survival strategies. One strategy to living in a world that is perceived as terrifying is to feed off the weak another strategy is to shut off and become passive. Both are equally deserving our sympathy as they represent people living in a world that is unsafe and where we are fundamentally isolated from each other, but they are also both in the end only solvable by the person in that field of reality.

Bullied and bullies are only acting out a more exaggerated version of what most people are doing. The absolute worst thing in my book is the complete lie by adults that the bullying dynamic is a strange phenomenon of childhood rather than a fundamental dynamic of human societies that is only resolved by understanding that both the bullied and bully are failed strategies for life and that both represent a mask that is not who the person truly is. That both are intrinsically loveable and both are aspects of all of us.

When smoke is introduced to the open chamber, the ions attach to the smoke particles, and this inhibits the conductivity of electrons across between the electrodes, which triggers the alarm.

Some, however, are optical based; with an LED and a photon detector to check if the air is clear. If the light from the LED is blocked, then it assumes the air is filled with smoke, and that triggers the alarm.

true,mormengil,null,null,"London is the best English speaking city in the world to be a tourist in.  Do your research.  Do some of the tourist things.  Do lots of less touristy things.  Just walk around.  Go to Hampstead and for a walk on Hampstead Heath.  Go to Greenwich.  Take a boat on the Thames from Kingston to Hampton Court Palace.  Of course, the British Museum.  National Gallery.  Other museums according to taste.  Harrods Food Halls.  At least several Indian restaurants.  Numerous pubs.  Go shopping.  Find interesting shopping places like Burlington Arcade (expensive, but you don't need to buy anything).  Do go see the changing of the guard, and or Trooping the colours, if its on and you can get tickets.  

Besides London, if this is your first visit, I would not go to any other cities (possible exceptions, York or Edinburgh).  Instead, head for the legendary and fabulous English countryside (for this, you probably need a car).  From London, the obvious place to go is the Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire Cotswolds.  Do your research.  Lovely villages, great walks.  Pubs galore.  Other candidates would be Hampshire (Jane Austen's house and then down towards the New Forest, Solent, Isle of Wight).  The West Country, (Devon and Cornwall).  The Lake District.  The Yorkshire dales.  

You can't go wrong with any of these, but for heavens sake don't try to do all of them.  Many tourists try to jam too many places into too short a time when they come to England.  My recommendation is to split your 3 weeks in two.  Spend half in London, and half in one of the above mentioned districts in the English countryside.  Don't worry, you can come back.

If they wanted to keep the rule as canon though for drama's sake, there are a couple ways to get around it.  Number one, The Doctor has been exposed to massive amounts of time energy before, including sucking the time vortex into himself when he saves Rose.  We don't know what kind of effect that would have on a Time Lord but it could easily be used to explain the Doctor having more regenerations than usual.  Second, it has also been mentioned that Time Lords can be brought back from the dead and given more regenerations somehow, so there could always be a storyline where The Doctor goes off to find this method.

Another thing to consider is that even with 13 rule, the 13th Doctor is not the final Doctor but the 14th, since it's 13 regenerations after the original Doctor.  ",0,1376273026,null,0,false,0,cblulpj,t3_1k2h1c,t1_cblulpj,t1_cbkos4d,null,1429862104,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

If you wake your Mrs by entering her then that's rape, and that naked tickle-fight that ended with penetration was probably technically rape, even if it was great sex that you both enjoyed. I think we can agree that what happens between adults in a non-abusive, loving relationship in the privacy of their own bedroom is their own business.

If you go out and get completely shit faced and have rubbish drunken sex with a girl who is as drunk as yourself, it's rape if she is drunk enough to legally be unable to consent, but it's usually okay because single people go out to get drunk and fuck. If you're sober and she's paralytic then that's predatory and clearly wrong, and in between there's a line somewhere.

A 20 year old dweeb who is seduced by a 15 year old bicycle may be a statutory rapist, but it's probably a good thing for both parties so who cares? On the other hand that 16 year old bad boy breaking your 15 year old princess in and then embarrassing her about in school the next day should fucking burn for being a rapist scumbag.

Let's go with a definition: good enough to play in a World XI (or one of 2 so they have an opponent to play). What kind of player does the best player have to be? Does it matter what style of football he plays? Is it important who his team mates (specifically his defensive partners) are? Are we to judge based on current form, or over a longer time period?

true,strolls,null,null,"The debate was on the topic *""Israel should withdraw immediately from the West Bank""*, and Galloway was hired to present the *for* side of the argument.

So his opponent was clearly advocating continued Israeli occupation.

You're welcome to think Galloway is a dick, but this is part of his position, on which he has long been consistent: *""no recognition [of Israel], no normalisation [of Israel]. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the apartheid state is defeated. I never debate with Israelis nor speak to their media. If they want to speak about Palestine – the address is the PLO.""*

I would dare to say that he is prepared to discuss the occupation of Palestine with anyone except an Israeli, and that's what he arrived at the Oxford debate expecting.

I dare to say that Galloway considers the Israeli state criminal, and guilty of crimes against humanity. I mean, this is not really an unreasonable position, and he wouldn't be alone in holding it.

Anyone else can argue from an impartial position, whereas an Israeli has a vested interest in promoting the state of Israel. Not only that, but asking him to debate an Israeli legitimises the state of Israel - he would probably say that this is like inviting Gary Glitter on TV to discuss the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Clearly Galloway should have laid out his terms in advance of attending the debate, but he did *not* walk out because the bloke was Jewish. He walked out because the bloke was an Israeli advocating the occupation of the West Bank.

This season looks to be one of promise. With 3 of the top 5 squads going through managerial changes, it seems that a second year of AVB could prove to be very good for the squad. The variety of additions the squad have not only bolstered the first XI but provided great squad depth. Soldado should be the goal scoring #9 Spurs have been looking for. Paulinho thrown into the midfield of Sandro and Dembele provides Spurs with one of the most physical and technical midfields in the PL. Chadli and Capoue, in addition to loan returnee Andros Townsend, provide the depth on the wings and in the midfield that Spurs lacked last year. If Bale sticks around Spurs have no doubt one of the best first XI's in the PL. We should give a lot of teams headaches, and I reckon we can get has high as 2nd in the league, but a 3rd place finish is most likely in my eyes.

That is a very broad question though. Does it mean all Israelis should leave the West Bank, or just the government? 

&gt;So his opponent was clearly advocating continued Israeli occupation.

Not necessarily. As I said, the question is a bit vague. You could oppose the statement under the idea that you'd want gradual repatriation, or something along those lines.

&gt;Anyone else can argue from an impartial position, whereas an Israeli has a vested interest in promoting the state of Israel. 

Really? If you are born in Israel, you would call yourself Israeli. However, as I said, this doesn't automatically mean you support everything the government do. I would agree however that it means you support the idea of Israel remaining a state. However, I think the idea that Israel should unmade a state (for want of a better word) is wholey unrealistic, for the same reasons that unifying Ireland is unrealistic. There are a whole lot of Israelis in Israel, and a lot of Palestinians and other Arabians who dislike them, and putting them both under one nation or government would inevitably, in my eyes, lead to a civil war. This is neither here nor now though.

Also, the office hags all jump on there at lunchtime and share Daily Mail-standard memes, then read what snide comments their less favoured relatives have put on some aunt's timeline and debate how best to post some other shit and 'get them back' or 'teach em a lesson'.

Aspas has really impressed me this pre-season. Very tricky and fits well in Rodgers' play style with fluid movement to open up play.

Hendo, a powerhouse. He runs and runs and runs. He has the potential of being a great passer, and will certainly cover for the full backs bombing up the pitch if played out wide.

Sterling, the pace demon. This guy has so much pace, I believe he can challenge Walcott. He can dribble and knows how to beat a player, but does not know how to finish.

Downing. He might leave, thus the (?). He is quite predictable, but definitely above average. He has decent pace, and can cross quite well. His left foot is great and his shots are pretty strong. However, he can not beat a defender easily and relies on passing and his pace.

Assaidi. Definitely a trickster, dribbling with ease around defenders during pre-season. However, I have not seen him play much and have heard he does not make too many runs or get in good positions.

Alberto. Don't know what to think of him, really. He passes quite well and has a rocket long shot. Fits in well with the team too.

Allen is also an option. Putting him in AM and pushing Coutinho out wide.",0,1376294654,null,0,false,0,cbm0mu2,t3_1k6mg8,t1_cbm0mu2,t3_1k6mg8,null,1429859289,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Personally I think BR just didn't rate Hendo and probably believed Gerrard was in decline. Sahin was available so the move was pushed through without the necessary research. It was a loan so the risk was minimal, but BR soon realized this one guy, good as he was didn't bring in enough to justify his wages, so the loan was cut.

The French, who suffered so much not being able to compete with the other top European leagues a few years back, headed by Michele Platini introduced the FFP rule so to give the French sides an equal footing to compete. (He said is for the good of all european countries, but we know better). Just as most other European league has come to terms with the rule and cut their spending (Madrid and Barcelona not indcluded of course) a lot of the French sides were bought by the oil rich sheiks. Now they're the ones paying silly money for players, Monaco, with population barely reaching 5 figures are splashing out money like its out of fashion, PSG, buying up players like no tomorrow, they're already making a mockery of the FFP rule, has Platini come out and condemn them? If I remember correctly, he made all kind of noise when Chelsea were bought by Abramovich and spent 100s of millions buying players, same with Man City. He's even worse than Blatter when it comes down to be a governing body official. At least Blatter gives you a laugh with his decisions. Platini is just downright slimey and conniving when it comes to protecting his countrymen above all others. 

And what is he going to do about Madrid and Barcelona? Ban them from all European competition? They're too rich and powerful to conform with rules that stops them from growing, and if they want to form their own European competition without the sanctions of UEFA, there's nothing they can do about it because everyone wants to watch them, and other top European sides will follow.

3. It's much more effective in general than playing long balls all the time. We have just been graced by the presence of players like Tim Cahill and Fellaini who can win *everything* in the air somehow. Our play style now lets us hold more possession and drastically reduces the amount of chances other teams get. Don't know if you noticed but Real Madrid had to play the counter-attack to get through us. (Albeit, something we need to work on defending still.) 

For my more personal assessment, we look strong, and we look tough to play. We are without a doubt a solid team.

They'd only turn to crime to recoup their losses and redress the perceived injustice. 

So if you're going to seize their assets for creating a mess, you might as well go the whole hog, put up some fences and put the whole lot of them in prison camps. 

It's not trolling to laugh at ridiculous and impractical suggestions - there simply isn't some simple, easy, overnight solution to the problems of the traveller community. 

What you have to accept is that laws only work because almost all of us agree they're fair and that they should be obeyed.

When you're dealing with antisocial people who are part of mainstream society, at least they have peer pressure to go straight, the support of family and friends if they do so. At least their kids have the stability of the same school for several years at a time, long-term friendships and law-abiding neighbours.

The idea that one can simply apply authoritarian laws to people who don't believe in them - well, it just ain't gonna work.  

So the solution is to sling shitloads of money at ""rehabilitating"" the travellers, and there ain't the political will because it'll take freakin' generations. You can spend a fortune educating their children and trying to win their trust, and politicians will shitcan your attempts because you made the barest dent over a decade. 

Failing that, it is, in fact, the fairest solution for them to make a mess on the village green, for the nimbies to get their knickers in a twist and for the rest of us to pay for it.

If you treat creating a mess on the village green as criminal then you're going have to deal with the consequences, and no-one (not anyone with any sense, that is) actually wants a whole generation of travellers' children raised in prison &amp;/or separated from their parents.

*This* thread is about travellers making a mess on the village green and the rest of us having to pay to clean it up, and the short story is that we tolerate travellers making a mess because (as per my other comment) it's better than sticking them all in prison.

If you do end up applying for a job as a copper you will learn that discretion is sometimes the better part of valour. 

If we wanted to start a war with the travellers, we could confiscate all their vehicles, we could arrest them all for stealing replacements, and they would quite happily say ""fuck you, stick me in prison, then"". And we could make an example of them - as soon as we let them out, they'd go any break some more laws, and we could arrest them again. And generations of travellers could be raised and die in the camps we'd have to build for them.

So there is a middle-ground by which we don't tolerate them stealing when we catch them blatantly at it, and we don't drive them to further excesses, either (by confiscating their vehicles to pay for the mess they make). 

So, yes, I'm sorry that your bourgeois, mail-order, Little England sensibilities are offended by travellers making a mess on the village green, but it's pretty much a fact of life.

true,Fineus,flare-brum,Balsall Heath,"&gt; As a cyclist I'm regularly held up by slow moving cars and buses delaying my journey. The key to safely using the road is share it with all users, give priority to the most vulnerable user, and not get frustrated when your held up.

I take it you don't do what the cyclists I've seen do, then, and zip in and out of traffic? 

Also, look at the way you've phrased your sentence - mentioning safety and giving priority to the most vulnerable road user: these things look great on paper and are great rabble rouser's (who doesn't want to be safe, after all) but when you consider that roads are being *shared* between bikes, public transport and other road vehicles - it is quite one sided. 

Yes, there should always be an interest in road safety, but without any expectation of entitlement from *any* party and road layouts should play up to that fact and allow for everyone to go about their business without cross purposes are what should really be aimed for. 

Around Birmingham it seems there's an abundance of cyclists content to coast between 5 and 10 mph, weave between traffic, cycle on pavements and so on - but doing these things contributes to the problems of road safety just as much as lunatic drivers hitting 50 in a 30 zone. 

In summary I hope that any changes they make keep in mind that just because they want cycling to be safer in Birmingham doesn't mean that cars, public transport etc. will suddenly evaporate from the roads.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"Your logical conclusions are anything but, being poorly reasoned, nonsensical and denying agency to travelers. Also, your proposed solution is to treat people differently under the law (i.e. fascism). So far I am not impressed.

If you are trying to prevent criminal damage being committed you can reward compliance and/or castigate breaches. Rewarding compliance may be more effective but it is fundamentally unjust to reward (ex-)criminals from not breaking the law whilst not doing so for non-criminals. So castigation is fairer but harder to implement and less likely to deliver ongoing success. It's a bit of a Catch 22.

In an ideal world those who caused the damage would be made to put it right, but without sufficiently severe sanctions the courts cannot enforce this.
