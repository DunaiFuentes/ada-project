We were very lucky with Sturridge and him.

Even with Sturridge, as excellent as he is, the injuries he picks up are a real worry.

My point is, these deals don't come around very often.

Waiting to improve the squad with these kind of signings is fine but we will be losing players such as Coutinho over the coming seasons unless we are finishing better than 5-6 in the league

As the manager stated, if you want proven quality, you have ro pay for it.

People can argue the quality and value of Willian but to me thats irrelevant. 

The manager of the club saw him as the perfect player for the team.

BR has been very understanding with the constraints placed on him by the club.

He obviously felt this was a deal that could be done and that would be very important for the team.

Why FSG didn't push to get him I don't really understand. 

Good owners believe in their manager and give him a fighting chance.

I even linked to [the scene from All the President's Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5upE_vP3WU&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=96) when Woodward and Bernstein are in Bradlee's office and he yells ""when is somebody going to go on the record in this damn story!"", pointing out that what is considered to be the greatest work of journalism in all of history didn't have any quotes in it, and ppl still don't get it.

A lot of people misunderstand how journalism and news work, so they fill in their knowledge with what they hear other people saying. 'No quotes' suits this especially when it is a story you don't want to believe.

The most amazing thing to me is that in football you can't have a discussion around a transfer story without numerous comments from armchair amateur journalism detectives.

Excellent at chance creation from open play, allow very few chances at our end. Question marks over chance conversion, physicality and set pieces. If you look at the individual players the most obvious areas for potential improvements are the defenders and henderson. As we're talking about attackers here, concentrating on who might replace Henderson:

Mkhitaryan - now he would have been PERFECT. Does pretty much all the things Henderson does but is better on the ball and a better finisher. Win win.

Costa - would have been very useful. Wouldn't have done some of the midfielder stuff henderson does but would have provided physicality, goals and improved our set pieces at both ends. Given that Sturridge looks the most injury prone of our attackers, of the players we've bid on Costa looks the most capable of leading the line.

Willian - in comparison to those two he looks like a luxury player. Main asset is chance creation but we're already good at that. Not a great goalscoring record, doesn't look to do much pressing-wise or defensively, and would leave us even less physically strong overall. Somewhat limited in the roles he can play.

Of course maybe suarez will be sold, have another sulk or do another bite, and we will have injury problems with our other attackers. It's not reasonable to think coutinho/suarez/sturridge will be available in every game so it would be good to have Willian in the squad. He's a good player. But perfect for us? I don't see it.


However, if Brendan really thinks Willian is the ideal player for us, and he's communicated this to FSG and The Committee, they should have been willing to stretch a bit to allow the transfer to happen. Maybe they did, and Anzhi kept pushing the price up in the knowledge that other clubs would still bid more.

You have missed a few steps which are important.

At the beginning of each transfer window Ayre, Werner and Henry work out what the transfer budget will be. Not many clubs do this, it is a very american approach. Last season it was £25m, this year it *looks* like it was about the same again.

The committee will scout players but they won't attach their own value to them per se, and then buy whoever matches their value and not buy who doesn't match their value. Who they buy and who they don't buy is completely determined by the transfer budget and the requirements of the squad.

Not buying Willian wasn't because the transfer committee and Anzhi had different interpretations of what the player was worth. If that is the way it worked, you would never end up buying anybody. Transfer fees are *always* a negotiation.

Our problem is that we didn't have the cash. That is why Ayre's offer was padded out with addons and the silly sell-on clause. 

This is exactly why transfer budgets don't work. They don't reflect how negotiations works. You can set budgets in the NBA where you know exactly what a player will cost (for eg. 1 max player, 1 mid-level, etc. = $34m per year), but in football the valuations are fluid. 

The committee would find the squad requirements, go through their list of players scouted and then find out from each club what their expectations are on price. They would then go back and attempt to fit all these jigsaw pieces into the transfer budget.

This is also why we sold Shelvey. Selling him at this point makes absolutely no sense in any way. He is on low wages and on a long term contract. With one full season in the Premier League he can get closer to his potential and either become a first team player at Liverpool or become a player who is worth £15-20m on the market. We sold him because we needed to broaden the transfer budget so we could fit more pieces inside it.

The sorry tale of how much harm one man can do to a town. For once the Daily Mail gets it (mostly) right :

&gt;Millions of television viewers saw Del Boy and Rodney Trotter take their pals to Dreamland during a seaside ""beano"" trip in the feature length ""Jolly Boys Outing"" episode shown in 1989.

&gt;Dreamland and its famous coaster were still attracting more than two million visitors a year up until the mid-90s - but locals have watched as it became increasingly run down.

&gt;A pressure group [Save Dreamland](http://www.dreamlandmargate.com/) was set up to secure the future of the park and the historic coaster.

&gt;Locals hoped the Scenic Railway's listed status would prevent it being knocked down and replaced with a lucrative housing development mooted for the site by developers.

We had a bloated, mostly incapable squad on CL wages with no CL.  A complex stadium issue that needed resolving.  A quasi-hostile subset of local supporters who seem to have a particular distrust of all things American.  An incredibly difficult league where the supporters want to win trophies and play in the CL when, by any reasonable estimation, both of these are just above our financial reach baring major, major investment.  

It takes time to rectify all of these things and yes, FSG have made some mistakes.  Commoli being a huge one, the slime ball that he is.  But I do think that overall they're doing a credible job and I have no massive complaints.  Are they asset stripping the club?  No.  Are they supportive?  Yes, they've clearly put money into it.  Whether you feel it is enough or not, one can't deny that they have and they didn't have to.

What is our alternative?  Signs at Anfield saying FSG out?  Further abuse of Linda Pizutti via twitter?  Maybe an effigy burning at half time?  Reality is there is not a sugar daddy waiting on the other side of the Shankly Gates otherwise all they would have to do is ring up John Henry and offer him ~£500M or so and I can almost guarantee FSG would sell.

Why would I care if the owners left?  I don't particularly care who owns the club, so long as they aren't asset stripping it.   If they leave any profit (of which we've had none) and let the club reinvest it, I'm more than happy with that.

Its getting to the point where people in government in the UK seem to believe that we respect them for these actions and they shouldnt be responsible to the people. It's to the point where even on mass protest of the people would mean absolutely nothing to whoever is in power. Other than a comment or two from them it means nothing. They are not responsible to the people.

There is a serious issue when you consider than in the past the use of guns in England, Wales and Scotland by the government against its people was considered to be a serious issue because of the ramifications of force on the people. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_use_of_firearms_in_the_United_Kingdom 
&gt;The United Kingdom is made up of four constituent countries: England, Scotland, Wales (which make up Great Britain) and Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, all police officers carry firearms. In the rest of the United Kingdom, police officers do not carry firearms, except in special circumstances. This originates from the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service in the 19th century, when police were not armed, partly to counter public fears and objections over armed enforcers as this had been previously seen due to the British Army maintaining order when needed. The arming of police in Great Britain is a perennial topic of debate.

BUT we are the point where none lethal force can be used against the people / citizens of the country keeping them in check, meaning the government will never HAVE to be responsible for their actions. They go about everything as bussiness as usual because after a day or two, or a week or two they think it will have all blown over and people will continue with their lives and forget. The news and media keep spewing out all the daily crap and people stop talking about it. 

Schools are being handed into the control of religions, wars are started by them. They impeded people more and more in relation to freedom of expression and movement.

League - Top 3 or 4, depending on the next few weeks. If we end up with Willian and Lamela and another fullback, we can reasonably expect to qualify to the Champions League group stage. Same goes for any situation where we keep Bale. A title, even failing to reach the goals in our other competitions, would be a successful season without a doubt.

Europa League - I'd like to see us make a run at the title as we are one of the best teams in the competition, but the tough part may be getting past the round of 16; the first leg of that round is sandwiched between league matches against Chelsea and Arsenal. If we sacrifice Europa League to make sure we qualify for Champions League next year with wins in those important matches, I think it's understandable. Once past that point though, no excuses for falling sooner than the semis I would think. I think a title here and a top 4 finish would qualify as a successful season regardless of the other cups.

FA/League Cups - A good run in at least one of the two, and not dropping matches to clearly inferior teams.

* Police routinely infiltrating activist groups with help from MI5.  Sleeping with and in at least one case having a child with an activist. 
* Police infiltrating and attempting to smear the Lawrence family.
* GCHQ setting up fake internet cafes at G20 to spy on attendants data.
* Armed police in London demanding to see peoples papers (if their skin was the wrong colour).

* Detention of Miranda (who was not charged, and was not allowed legal representation) for 9 hours in order to intimidate journalists writing about state surveillance.
* Smashing Guardians HDDs for same reason as above.
* Long jail sentences if you don't hand over passwords for encrypted volumes.
* The Justice and Security Bill allows for secret courts to be used against UK citizens; you and your lawyer cannot be present to hear evidence against you, and neither are you / your lawyer allowed to challenge the evidence that you have never seen.

The above is far from exhaustive.  Just out of interest though, what do you think a police state would look like (I'm not taking the piss, mean it as a serious question, I'm writing about these things at the mo)?

Back in 1998, my first contract paid £25/hr and my second one was £38/hr (very short term, but they would have extended it had I not already made plans). I was simply an embedded/C software engineer with 2/3 years of experience.

In 2012 I managed to get £320/day (3 month contract) outside of London but they kept complaining that I'm too expensive even though I pointed out that I had to pay my own holidays, tax, accountant, insurance, pensions. 

Unfortunately, there is virtually zero work for what I do in the East Midlands. I'm an embedded Linux engineer. So I get offers from everywhere BUT where I live.

Most of my ""low wage"" viewpoint is based on the weak UK £ versus the strong Australian $. But still, pound-for-pound I'm facing 1998 wages. 

Then I look at fulltime salaries for engineers and I'm appalled. I've seen job adverts here offering £20K for a graduate. My first wage in Australia was $36K, in 1995. Why would an engineer bother staying here, or look for work outside of London?  They might as well get a holiday working visa and head straight to Australia!

I wonder to what extent Greenwald and the Guardian underestimated the resolve of the government/security services?

You've been sucked in by the unsubstantiated claims of one guy who has been exposed as lacking the knowledge to understand the technicalities of the claims that Snowden has made.

You are now of the mindset that Snowden is a pathological liar and as such you're all for being spied on all the time by a government who doesn't give a flying fuck about you, your rights, or your life.

Simply not true, the NSA [can use data](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/20/exhibit-a-procedures-nsa-document) they've collected *without* a warrant.  

And from [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/fisa-court-nsa-without-warrant): ""Section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act (FAA), which was renewed for five years last December, is the authority under which the NSA is allowed to collect large-scale data, including foreign communications and also communications between the US and other countries, provided the target is overseas.

FAA warrants are issued by the Fisa court for up to 12 months at a time, and authorise the collection of bulk information – some of which can include communications of US citizens, or people inside the US. To intentionally target either of those groups requires an individual warrant.""

&gt;NSA cannot read your data in transit due to the infeasibility of breaking SSL

They don't need to.  They use an interception proxy [like this](http://www.zdnet.com/how-the-nsa-and-your-boss-can-intercept-and-break-ssl-7000016573/).  They built one in the AT&amp;T buildings in the 2000s, in a room known as Room 614A.  ISPs and tech companies are legally forced to oblige them in any way possible.  Read about Lavabit if you doubt this.

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"&gt;What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?


We did alright last season. Especially considering the turmoil with the manager and the squad issues. To be honest, since Carlo left, I've always felt that Chelsea have been a team in transition looking for an identity. Hopefully with Jose back, we will see us come into our own soon.


&gt;What are your expectations for this season?

Anything other than the Title would definitely be a disappointment.


&gt;With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

One thing is for sure, irrespective of the actual strategic inputs Jose brings, the psychological edge of being a winning team certainly appears to have made its presence felt (see: Villa game). We will see the team gelling a little better as the season progresses, I am yet to see Luiz and Mata settle into Jose's system which is why I hold my response back o nthat one.

Of course I'm happy he's back. Most Chelsea fans are, I'm sure.


&gt;Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

Defence is definitely less leakier. Transition is (as is typical of Jose) lightning quick. We come out of the blocks firing all gunds (atleast based on the Hull and Villa game), we should look to not fade out is all.


&gt;In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

One hopes so, but its Jose AND its Abrahamovic, so who knows. Jose definitely seems more settled this time around though.


&gt;Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?


At this point of time it's actually a toss up on whether he will get Rooney. But I hope he does. If not, I'm told that Lewandowski (pardon the spelling) and Etoo are on the radar. I would be happy with Lewa, not so much Etoo (unless Etoo is happy with a 50-60% reduction in salary).

In either case, to be clear, Jose knows what he's doing. By being this public with his approach for Rooney and making him the center of everybody's attention, he's definitely disrupted the United squad rappo and that's what he has been going for. He wants Rooney, thats for sure. But if he doesn't get Rooney, he will have sufficient caused anxiety in the United dressing room, which also helps him. In my opinion, Rooney should come to Chelsea and United should put their ego aside and sell, if a player doesn't want to stay, why force him? And if Rooney comes to Chelsea, I don't see anybody stoppping us from winning the Title and making a deep run in the UCL/FA Cup. Who knows, Rooeny could be the RvP to our treble.


&gt;Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

I don't have any response to this. Don't think we need Willian, haven't followed the goss around it.

&gt;Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

First of all, Barca can just fuck right off with wanting Luiz. Want Luiz to mature more in the CB role, don't think there is a need to have him come to CDM (since we have brought in / back Essien and MvG). But if Jose thinks he can do better in that role, then I will defer to his greater understanding in these matters.

&gt;Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Other than Rooney? I recall that De Rossi was a target, wish they would bring him in. Alternatively, maybe one day Pogba? 

&gt;Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Yes. If we get a striker, would be happy to see Torres or Ba find a new place where they start regularly.

&gt;Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Too many people to pick, but in order of priority -

Oscar;Schurrle;Mata;Hazard;KDB;MvG;Essien;Torres.

&gt;Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

Marco van Ginkel and Tomas Kalas.

&gt;How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

I like Moyes. Hope they do well, but doubt they will. Team's in transition rarely fare super well. If they do, I will have a mad respect for Moyes. Like crazy mad.


&gt;United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

I hope this is an intentional strategy on the part of United (the missing out on key players) because if not, it's just making them look silly. Under SAF, if they (really) wanted a player, they almost always got him. Moyes will not have such an effect on prospective players. United need to upgrade their Scholesy position with an intelligent deep lying play-maker (in the mould of Pirlo / Riquelme - heh), that will send RvP to an entirely different level.

&gt;Finally, what is your prediction for the game?

true,SCFoximus,troughton,Troughton,"I believe the ""issue"" is that you have nothing to base the show off of and are practically going in blind. My girlfriend, for instance, couldn't stand the first episode, the second she liked a little better, but she held off for a week before she would watch another episode. A few weeks later she wanted to watch episodes three at a time, and now she is completely enveloped in the fandom.

Yes, the ""first""episode, ""Rose"" is a bit rough, but this was a pilot trying to revitalize a show that previously thrived best in the 1970's, where the production values were no where near this quality. And coming from that, this pilot episode itself doesn't have the greatest production values, because there was little money at the time (2005) for a show that hadn't been produced since 1989 (with the exception of one 1996 film). Plus, the villains of this episode, the Autons (which were considered frightening in the '70's), were played in a campy way as to make the episode a bit more family friendly. But the villains do get more interesting / frightening in the episodes to come.

Another problem you could be having is that you're missing out on 40 years of backstory (which is not totally necessary to watch the current show), but it is mostly summed up in the first few episodes. A quick crash course: The Doctor is a 900 year old Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, he has a time machine, the TARDIS (short for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space), and his earliest and major nemesis are the Daleks, a race of mutants who live in robotic shells and have enslaved entire planets.

Anyway, as the show goes on the production values do get better, but most importantly the stories get better, which is what this show is truly worth watching for. Sure, there may be some episodes not as good as others (this pilot being one of them), but there is all of time and space ahead of you, please don't let one slightly corny episode turn you off.",0,1377254580,null,0,false,0,cbtnl6k,t3_1kxknn,t1_cbtnl6k,t3_1kxknn,null,1429728744,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Hopefully by encouraging more people to actually question the sources thrust upon them and encouraging them to more fully investigate the claims made it will encourage more reasonable and productive discussions of the actual issues.

When one side is arguing off the version of events as represented by their media outlet of choice and the other side is arguing off the version of events as represented by their media outlet of choice and neither version is quite the truth then reasonable debate becomes extremely hard to foster.

In all honesty I despise what media is doing. There are very few outlets that really just expose the facts as they are in an article and then add their own commentary on the facts in a separate article.

Like this version of events with the Guardian, or the Miranda detention or even the NSA leaks. Every article has the facts, or some of the facts, there but they are always coloured by the commentary of the author according to their agenda.

I would much rather have an article saying explicitly what happened, such as 'Minister contacted me. Requested I destroy or hand back material. Said that they would use legal avenues if we don't cooperate. We agreed. GCHQ came in and oversaw and advised on the destruction. End article'. Then have another article saying 'This is what I felt they were doing. At this part I was astonished by the request. Here I thought it was bizarre to destroy physical drives'.

Competing for the title, maybe a cup if we get lucky.

We are very, very lucky to have Mourinho back, as a season ticket holder I am relieved that we have a manager with such an amazing home record and very excited about the coming season. He has settled in fine and I am enjoying his comments, its all very early days though.

We have only played two games and both have started off at blistering pace and then settled down. Its very early in the season though.

I wouldn't get my hopes up but from the sounds of it he wants to settle in England. I like to think Abramovich realises we won't find anyone better and will give him time if things go wrong. Anything can happen though.

Personally I don't think we will get Rooney unless Man Utd make a major signing to replace him. If we don't sign Rooney I hope we go big for someone like Lewandowski, if not Eto'o. As for our current options Ba and Torres are not good enough, Lukaku is still young.

EDIT: I have no idea why we are looking to sign Willian. He is a top player but we already have too many players in that position. Moses is surplus to requirements, which is a shame as I like him and even if he does go it will still be tricky to give everyone game time if we play a 4-2-3-1 system. Its funny that we are messing up Spurs plans

He is very underrated as a central defender, I would much rather see him there then in midfield. This season we have Essien back and Van Ginkel to play that position.

Only a striker

I would like to see Chalobah and McEachran get loans to premier league teams. I wouldn't care too much if Torres, Ba, Mikel or Moses left but I wouldn't like to see them leave.

Hazard, Oscar, Mata, De Bruyne, Lampard, Luiz, Cech, Van Ginkel, Schurrle.

Players like Lukaku, Hazard and Oscar are still young but you know all about them already. Van Ginkel has really impressed me in preseason. He looks like Justin Beiber but he has the positional understanding of Makelele, not afraid to put a tackle in either. De Bruyne is class. We also have a CB/RB called Kalas in the squad who looks good.

Badly

I wanted Utd to sign someone big because we would be more likely to get Rooney if you had a decent replacement. I think they will sign someone

true,thejanitorch4,IE,ireland,"&gt;What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?

I think last season went ok. Obviously disappointed with RDM sacking and FSW appointment but things turned out alright in the end. New players settled in nicely (Hazard) and I'm glad we improved our league form over 11/12.

&gt;What are your expectations for this season?

FA Cup winners, CL quarter finals and 2nd at least.

&gt;With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

He seems to have settled in very quickly, pictures and reports from pre-season and training always have him with a smile on his face, laughing with the players. I'm delighted he's back.

&gt;Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

Everything is a lot quicker about how we attack, less passing around the box and more direct.

&gt;In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

I think he wants to hone our young talent into the best it can be. Wether Abramovich gets tired of him we'll have to wait and see but I think he wants to stay.

&gt;Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

I think we will get Rooney, but he'll have to put in a transfer request and United will leave it as late as possible. He has said that there is a plan B and C though but I'm not sure who that could be.

&gt;Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

I think it's just Anzhi trying to get more money out of Spurs. If he does sign with us, hopefully it's Moses, not Mata that's on the way.

&gt;Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

Luiz is a centre-back and that's where he should play. His positioning isn't great for midfield.

&gt;Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Just Rooney.

&gt;Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Ba if we get Rooney.

&gt;Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Kevin De Bruyne

&gt;Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

I hope Tomas Kalas gets minutes this season.

&gt;How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

I think you'll get 3rd or 4th. The players will know how to beat most teams, but without Ferguson I think you'll struggle in the big games.

&gt;United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

I think it's hilarious. I'd say they'll sign a midfielder, but that's it.

&gt;Finally, what is your prediction for the game?

We'll play defensively and grind out a draw (or hopefully, 3 points).",0,1377256087,null,0,false,0,cbtnskc,t3_1kxni2,t1_cbtnskc,t3_1kxni2,null,1429728649,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Key highlights:

* By three-to-one (66%-22%) people back Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, 2000, which allows the police to stop, examine and search passengers to determine whether they are engaged in terrorism (and without needing a ‘reasonable’ suspicion to do this).

* However, only 37% agree with the view advanced by some ministers and officials that it was appropriate to detain Mr Miranda on the grounds that he might have information useful to terrorists. A slightly large number, 44%, thought the police action inappropriate as Mr Miranda was not actually engaged in terrorism.
 
* The public is divided on whether journalists should be allowed to do their work ‘without being detained, or mobile phones seized, unless there is specific reason to believe they have committed, or are planning, a crime’ (45%) or whether ‘the police and intelligence agencies can be trusted to act reasonably when deciding whether to detain journalists entering or leaving Britain’ (38%).

* The picture of a country split down the middle extends to the actions of the Prime Minister and the Guardian over the hard drives containing Mr Snowden’s information. 43% thought Mr Cameron was right to instruct the intelligence agencies, via the Cabinet Secretary, to seek to recover the hard drives, while 40% think that either he should have stayed out of the decision (25%) or that the action was wrong whoever authorised it (15%).",0,1377256145,null,0,false,0,cbtnsvg,t3_1kxltd,t1_cbtnsvg,t3_1kxltd,null,1429728645,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

true,UncleDuster,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Well, the request from the Government was for The Guardian to 'return or destroy' the files so it was the choice of The Guardian to 'burn the whole office' (to use your analogy). Presumably the other option was to hand over the drives so the Government could forensically delete all restricted files from them before handing the drives back. However, I completely understand why for journalistic, legal and dramatic reasons the paper didn't want to do that.

As for the second point, I do realise the futility of the action but from a legal point of view the Government *has* to go through the motions of recovering restricted files. If they do not even *attempt* to recover them then it creates a dangerous precedent where the UK government has basically said 'some people in the UK have Top Secret level documents without permission and we don't care'.

Huddersfield's not so big, but it wouldn't make sense to recommend something in the town if you're out in the sticks, or vice versa... I'll try make a few though.

One thing we do have in/around Huddersfield (just like most of Yorkshire) is views. Travel uphill in most directions for a couple of miles.

If you're up for a beer [The Grove Inn](https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=grove+pub+huddersfield&amp;ll=53.643824,-1.788744&amp;spn=0.008077,0.009023&amp;sll=53.644201,-1.789323&amp;layer=c&amp;cid=9825614416992344613&amp;cbp=13,213.2,,0,0&amp;panoid=FXXWINFJPpvH2lQPUDWRUQ&amp;hq=grove+pub+huddersfield&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;cbll=53.644192,-1.789238) is probably the best around for good beer.
It might not look like much, but the beer choice is one of the best around.

The town centre itself is pretty crappy these days, mostly generic stuff you can find anywhere. The [Byram Arcade](https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=Byram+Arcade,+Westgate,+Huddersfield&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.646836,-1.783213&amp;spn=0.005711,0.004511&amp;sll=53.644193,-1.789237&amp;sspn=0.008103,0.009023&amp;oq=byram+ar+huddersfield&amp;t=h&amp;hq=Byram+Arcade,+Westgate,+Huddersfield&amp;z=18) is a nice building, and has a few interesting independent shops.

[Castle Hill](https://plus.google.com/106235775300152617602/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en) A.K.A the Victoria Tower is probably the most well known landmark, great view from there. However in October it's likely to be windy as hell, and probably pissing down too.

[The railway station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_railway_station) is fairly nice looking from the front, often has events on in the square in front.

If you like football stadiums, you could go see that ([John Smiths Stadium](https://plus.google.com/108367045337223055574/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en)). It's alright I suppose, for a football pitch. There's a driving range, cinema, and some other stuff like that there too.

true,i4foot,EN,england,"&gt;What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?


Not one of our best. The anger that the fans felt due to the action of the board (made up for it with re-hiring Jose) and at times looking like we may miss out on top 4 due to Rafa having a hard on for the Europa league. Happy that we won it, especially as only a few years ago we would have love to have just been competing in it, but not the type of trophy we should really be competing for at this stage. Just relieved we did get champions league football and getting Jose back.

&gt;What are your expectations for this season?


At least a trophy. Competition for the league is tough this season, so at least top 2, hopefully beating both of the Manchester clubs to the league title. I would love to regain the FA Cup and hopefully do a lot better in the Champions league this time round.

&gt;With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?


I’m ecstatic knowing he is back in the Chelsea dug out. Loves the club, the club loves him. Hopefully a recipe for success. Done well so far, playing good football especially in the first half of games. Just need to keep that going in the 2nd half as well. 

&gt;Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?


We are a lot more direct so far compared to last season. 

&gt;In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. 
Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?


I think so.  I think he will be here for at least 5 years (a long time for us). With any luck the board agrees with the majority with the fans and keep him for the long haul. 

&gt;Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?


I would love for it to happen. Torres and Ba not good enough for a club looking to win the league and Lukaku is too young and inexperienced to lead the line for the whole season. I can’t see it happening but I’m sure the club will keep trying until the end. If we don’t get him, we have a Plan B and a Plan C as Jose put it. We have been linked to other players (Eto’o etc.), I just hope we sign someone, and then offload one of Torres and Ba. 

&gt;Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?


Think it’s just the media. Struggling to believe Skysports with anything they report regarding transfers recently. If someone is surplus to requirements, it would be Moses. 

&gt;Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.


I am very glad the interest has ended. Think he can be a great player for us and is captain material. I prefer to see him at centre back with JT. He is clearly a much better player at CB than he is in midfield. 

&gt;Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?


Rooney.

&gt;Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?


If we get Rooney, Ba or Torres

&gt;Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?


Hazard. I think he will be our player of the year. Big things coming from him.

&gt;Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?


Young players in the first team squad I’m looking forward to seeing is Van Ginkel. Impressed during pre-season, hoping he is given the chance to start/play in the league this year. Obviously we have other young players in the first team who are already very good (Oscar, Hazard, De Bruyne, Lukaku and Schurrle). In the youth teams, Loftus-cheek, Baker, Boga and some others look promising. Also hoping Chalobah gets another good loan move.

&gt;How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?


They won’t do anywhere near as bad as some people are predicting, especially with Fergie still about behind the scenes.

&gt;United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?


Haven’t paid a close eye to United’s transfer window. I just know David Gill left and that may have affected United. Coupled with the loss of Fergie at the helm. 

&gt;Finally, what is your prediction for the game?


I think it will end 2-2.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?

Benitez did what was expected of him. Got us in the Champions League. The Europa League is incidental. A sidenote. We could have kept Di Matteo and won it I think.

&gt; What are your expectations for this season?

Second or third. A title challenge is a must, something we haven't seen since 2011 and event then it was a bit shit. Progress, in other words.

&gt; With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

Wish we'd kept Rafa, to be honest. I loved that guy. He should get a statue outside the Bridge.

&gt; Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

Under Jose, or overall? Under Jose we're a bit tighter, a bit less gung-ho than under Robbie, but then that change came under Benitez, too. I think we have the depth to be able to try different formations and attacking styles. Last season it was pretty much Oscar, Hazard and Mata with Moses coming in occasionally. Now we have a wealth of options.

Attacking style with requisite defensive discipline, is how I'd describe it.

&gt; In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

Well the 'long haul' doesn't happen too often at any club. People point to Wenger and Ferguson, but they are the anomalies. I'd be happy with three years again. If he fancies doing something different and building a legacy like his idol Ferguson, then I'd obviously be delighted, too. Of course we don't live in a fantasy world and Roman could pull the trigger at any moment.

Notable, I think, is the fact that he's got a four year deal - which he didn't even get first time around, so the intention is there, but as ever with us we do like a sacking - even before Roman we were a hire and fire team.

&gt; Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

Well Torres and Ba aren't good enough and Lukaku is barely removed from the womb, despite being the size of a JCB. Rooney would be perfect for us, absolutely perfect. The problem is that United know that and, I think, won't sell to us under any circumstances. When we get the final 'no' I think we'll go for Eto'o.

&gt; Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

Well the surplus is probably Moses. Would I take Willian over Moses? Obviously. Do I think we could use that £30m elsewhere (like centre back, or defensive midfield) instead of yet another attacking midfielder? Yes.

I think it's Kia's way of screwing Spurs for more money though.

&gt; Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

David Luiz is a centre back. A centre back that has been given a pretty tough time by Hansen and his cabal of dour pundits. Scoring a few wonder goals does not a midfielder make. Thankfully Jose's already address this.

&gt; Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

I'd have loved De Rossi. And a centre back. And a centre forward. Specific names I'm not so good on.

&gt; Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Fernando Torres because he's a complete distraction. Is he back?! What will it take to 'unlock' Torres?! And so on. That and the fact that he's utter garbage and disgustingly overpaid.

&gt; Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Eden Hazard.

&gt; Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

Probably next season now, but Chalobah should go on loan to a Premier League team. Him.

&gt; How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

Ferguson made the club what it is today but you don't suddenly lose his ethos when he goes. United are shrewder and cleverer than that. Second by a whisker I reckon. City will be a bit too strong.

&gt; United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

You'd have thought they'd sign someone. I don't see the point in Baines - the most hideously overrated English player in the League. Does my head in. Fellaini - again, I'm not sure what United need. What they need is Luka Modric, in my opinion.

&gt; Finally, what is your prediction for the game?

Moyes to quieten some of the criticism I think. 2-1 United.",0,1377257793,null,0,false,0,cbto1yj,t3_1kxni2,t1_cbto1yj,t3_1kxni2,null,1429728527,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

While you should keep an open mind for dissenting views when it comes to opinions, it's not true that you must always be open to writings that are completely factually incorrect and designed specifically to misinform.

Sometimes, there is a clear cut right and wrong. e.g. Evolution is based on evidence, creationism is made up rubbish. It would be absolutely silly to suggest that creationism should be considered, shared or taught at all as a viable ""alternative theory"" to evolution.

Getting back to the point, there are right-wing newspapers and writers out there who really add to the debate. There are real merits that can be discussed about right-wing policies sometimes.

But the DM has never, ever been one of them. There has never been a more despicable publication so widely distributed in the UK which is so obviously written to misinform and mislead the public.

true,lachiendupape,null,null,"&gt; What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?

Tumultuous is the word that springs to mind, a large part of the home crowd were obviously not happy with the appointment of Benitez and it split the club in my opinion. But that being said apart from some very poor performances in the league and a disastrous group stage of the champions league we won a trophy and gained CL qualification, again. It wasn't out finest hour, but we showed we're a European team to contend with still and the winning mentality has not left the club.

&gt;What are your expectations for this season?

I think we need to have a much better run at the title this season and get to the semi's of the CL at least for it to have been a successful season, I'd really like to see the young players given starts in the league cup all the way through the comp. I think we have a very exciting squad this year, we're only lacking a 20 league goal as season striker.


&gt; With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

He has settled in just fine, Jose seems more experienced from his European jaunts and more mature as a manager as he stated himself he's one of the only active PL managers to have actually won the competition. he still has the capacity for mischief though and will continue to try and deflect the pressure from his players.


&gt;Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

Well we've only had 2 games and pre-season but the initial though is we seem to be quicker coming out from our own half, which bodes well as long as we can get back quick enough, this has sometimes been a weakness of ours over the last few seasons.

&gt;In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

Who know's? I really hope so. I do however believe that tenures of the length of Sir Alex's will very much be the exception rather than the rule

&gt;Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

Yes, I would love us too sign Rooney, I think he's a perfect Mourinho player, he's adaptable and can bring so much to a team, a great instinctive football brain and the physicality with it that make him a real threat, if we were to sign Rooney then we would have a very good chance at the title.

As for other choices out there, I guess Lewandowski but that's highly unlikely. If not I'd be happy with our forward options. Torres for all his knockers (and I am one of those) could still, maybe find the goal again. Ba needs to find the back of the net and settle into the team but if he can, would be a great option and then there's Lukaku who if he can find his west brom scoring boots should put away a few for us this season. behind those three we have the best attacking options in the league if not Europe to compensate if non of our front men can get 20+ in the season

&gt;Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

Media rubbish I think, we have not much need for the player, despite being linked with him in the past, which started when AVB joined and has continued ever since. if there is noise from our camp, it's purely to wind up spuds.

No one is surplus to requirements 

&gt; Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

Yes Luiz is a good player with potential to become much better, I hope Mourinho can help him find the balance between his attacking runs and his defensive duties. I much prefer Luiz at Centre Back than in midfield and we have a lot more cover for the centre mid positions this season, so there should be no reason to play him there.

&gt;Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Rooney

&gt; Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

nope

&gt; Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?
Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

Hazard and Oscar will come on again this season, Hazard is a thrilling player whose trickery and smart runs into the box makes us a joy to watch. Oscar is a footballers footballer. A fantastic mind, great distribution and an eye for goal two, watch him come on leaps and bounds for us. Also watch Lampard this season, I'll think he'll be rejuvenated under Mourinho.

Of the youngsters Kevin de Bruyne looks like a dynamic attacker not afraid to take people on and Van Ginkel looks like a solid midfielder who'll be ready to take Lampards place.

 
&gt;How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

Fine, i don't see the system changing too much and I'm sure SAF is on the the end of a phone if needed. The squad as ever is very very good, although midfield still looks weak and the reliance on Giggs must surely be lessened this season. Europe will be interesting I think, here more than the domestic league you might find Moyes lack of experience more telling

&gt;United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

I think United will make 1 or 2 signings before the transfer window ends, they need a midfielder, but will have to come up with some cash to trouble Everton. If Rooney goes (and I think he may just) you're attacking options should still be good as long as RvP keeps up his run of being injury free.

&gt;Finally, what is your prediction for the game?

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"You are actually onto one of the main elements of AVB's philosophy here. He loves a 4-3-3 that looks like this:

                             Fast Keeper

          Attacking FB - Smart CB - Smart CB - Attacking FB
         
                     Passer - Destroyer - Runner

          Inverted Winger - Clinical Striker - Creative Winger

Now, on attack the two Attacking FB's move forward, allowing the Inverted winger to push up as another direct goal threat and the Creative Winger is allowed to move inside more (as the FB keeps the width) to create. The DM moves back to cover the loss of FB's with the CB's splitting. On attack it looks something like this:

                             Fast Keeper

                   Smart CB - Destroyer - Smart CB
         
                           Passer - Runner

    Attacking FB -  Inverted Winger - Creative Winger - Attacking FB

                          Clinical Striker

You don't actually need a creative guy like Modric in midfield. If you play with aggressive FB's they can be the 'wingers' on attack with your actual wingers drifting in to play other roles. Look at Cazorla, Isco or Silva (even Iniesta at times), these guys all create from the 'wing'. 

Spurs can rock their Dembele - Sandro - Paulinho midfield perfectly fine, on defence that thing is a wall. On attack however Sandro drops back and Dembele/Paulinho just need to deliver the ball to the guys in front of them, your winger (e.g. Willian) can drift in and create from this area. This is why AVB is happy playing a traditional 10 in Siggy on the LW, in attack he doesn't actually need to be out there.

These players are really just looking for ambition, they don't want to sign and then have the ball kicked from under their chicken, if Bale is replaced (looks excessively likely) than they should be happy to carry on I imagine. The 0-1 and 0-5 victories certainly help.

Honestly, this no-mans-land we are in at the moment is the most unsettling, journos asking all the players what is happening. If Bale is sold, good, put it behind us and move on. If not, well, same thing. Sept 2nd will be good, we have a new squad and we can put the window behind us and look to steal CL football from you.

It's heavily based around explaining the Guardians reasoning for their actions but all the above points are made clear. Very much worth a read if you want to hear the Guardian explain its actions.

There's still some attempt at framing this in their narrative and you can pretty much skip the first 8 paragraphs if you already know it. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london

The key part here is bellow and it's context I think is important because it shows the Guardian's reasoning (of course you can always argue with that) for why they felt they were forced into having to destroy the drives.  

&gt;The Guardian's lawyers believed the government might either seek an injunction under the law of confidence, a catch-all statute that covers any unauthorised possession of confidential material, or start criminal proceedings under the Official Secrets Act.

&gt;Either brought with it the risk that the Guardian's reporting would be frozen everywhere and that the newspaper would be forced to hand over material.

&gt;""I explained to British authorities that there were other copies in America and Brazil so they wouldn't be achieving anything,"" Rusbridger said. ""But once it was obvious that they would be going to law I preferred to destroy our copy rather than hand it back to them or allow the courts to freeze our reporting.""

&gt;Any such surrender would have represented a betrayal of the source, Edward Snowden, Rusbridger believed. The files could ultimately have been used in the American whistleblower's prosecution.

&gt;""I don't think we had Snowden's consent to hand the material back, and I didn't want to help the UK authorities to know what he had given us,"" the Guardian editor said.

&gt;Furthermore the computer records could be analysed forensically to yield information on which journalists had seen and worked with which files.

&gt;Rusbridger took the decision that if the government was determined to stop UK-based reporting on the Snowden files, the best option was destroy the London copy and to continue to edit and report from America and Brazil.  Journalists in America are protected by the first amendment, guaranteeing free speech.

true,TrollPad,1905,,"What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?

Third place so not too bad. Obviously both the Manchester teams were a class above the rest so fairly satisfied with our finish.

What are your expectations for this season?

Decent cup runs with winning at least one trophy and a strong title challenge. Champions league quarter finals.

With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

Very glad, he seems more calm not to say less arrogant, and his mind games are a bit more subtle now. In the first two games I can already see he's done wonders to some of the players.

Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

Especially against Hull, I think our attacking band seemed to have more of an idea to do with the ball, and the overall passing in the final third was more fluid. Ramires is becoming Makelele 2.0. His passing and breaking down of the play is becoming a lot better than before in addition to his engine he can be an important piece to this team. 

In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

Yes I do, although quite clearly he has said that he wants to stay for longer than 4 years to please the supporters, I think he understands it's time for him to settle down and stay in one place. He has also achieved everything there is in major European club football. His only challenge now may be to create a 'Ferguson-esque' dynasty.

Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

More than happy to get Rooney, he's an excellent player who I always rated highly with one quality that I rate higher than any, work rate (or heart to play the game, passion etc.). He's also English so home grown. If we fail to get Rooney I'd be satisfied with our strike force although honestly, Torres is done. He needs to go but unfortunately if a new addition steps in he'll be replacing Ba. There's no place in a one striker system for 4 strikers, even if occasionally we'd employ two when chasing the score.

Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

Really hope it's media rubbish, we have a surplus of talent in the attacking three and I don't see him as an improvement over 4 or 5 of our players. Add to that his price tag and it's a big no in my opinion. He's only better than Moses who still has heaps of potential to be an effective winger but Moses' home grown status makes him more valuable to the squad in my eyes.

Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

Luiz is a future Chelsea captain and a man who loves the team and the city he's in. He's a rare central defender because when he brushed off his defensive errors and the occasional lack of concentration he still is a great ball playing central defender. 
 
Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Rooney, could settle for another striker but no one of the same quality is left. (I sometimes dream of Lewandowski in blue.)

Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

We already got rid of the deadwood and our squad is set.

Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. Also interested in Oscars and Hazards development.

Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

I guess you're already acquainted with the likes of Oscar, Hazard, Lukaku (that fella that put three past you last season) etc. so I'll give a bit less known name. Tomas Kalas, a central defender/right back who's been a Chelsea player for the past few albeit out on loan at Vitesse. He's got a squad role this season and starts the season off with injury so we'll see how it goes.

How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

Most people write you off but we can't forget the fact that your team ran away with the title last season. The retirement of SAF and addition of Moyes is nothing more than a face change at the beginning. It'll only be fair to judge him after 2 seasons or so but as we know the press would be quick to write him off if there is a spell of bad results.

United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

You should hope that United signs some players. All the teams around you (with the exception of Arsenal) have strengthened their squads quite considerably while United haven't. Although realistically I think you'll end up with Fellaini and Baines.",0,1377260621,null,0,false,0,cbtojvw,t3_1kxni2,t1_cbtojvw,t3_1kxni2,null,1429728252,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Most banks require a credit check before you can open an account. Strange as it may seem because you are the one lending them money when you put it into their bank. But still ...

Lloyds bank is the easiest to get an account with. I was lucky because I still had my bank account from 1998. So I had a slight headstart.

Bank account is essential. Your credit rating is based around regular payments into your bank account as well as regular payments out of your bank account. Set up your direct debits and get a job.

You'll have virtually no chance of getting a credit card from the bank. Google for ""credit building credit cards"" and you'll see what the alternatives are. DO NOT CLOSE ANY OTHER CREDIT CARDS YOU ALREADY HAVE. My wife made the mistake of doing this and you can't go back and re-open it. It's a completely brain dead system.

Register on the electoral roll. 

Without any credit rating, getting a phone plan is harder. So the usual way around this, and all the phone salespeople will tell you this, is to buy a 30 day plan, use it for a couple months then upgrade your plan to a 12/24 month plan. Maybe even get a phone on the plan as well. I had my own phone, so I went SIM only.

Strangely enough renting a car requires no credit check. Go figure. I couldn't get a 12  month phone plan for a £500 phone - EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED TO PAY THE ENTIRETY OF THE PLAN UP FRONT - but I could rent a £40K Mercedes on the back of a foreign credit card and a foreign driver's license.",0,1377260996,null,0,false,0,cbtomov,t3_1kvn79,t1_cbtomov,t1_cbtnmsj,null,1429728216,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

No comments. It was what I personally expected in the league, we failed in UCL and we dissapointed in CWC.

Yes. He's back where he belongs.

No.

&gt;In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

Time will tell.

&gt;Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

Personally I hope that you will keep Rooney. I'm willing to take a risk with out current strikers.


&gt;Over the past 24 hours, you have been heavily linked with Willian. Media rubbish, or do you think there is something concrete in it? If there is, what does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

Sadly it looks like it's more than a media rubbish. I don't think we need him and I don't want him to join.

&gt;Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.
&gt;Heh, we knew that he won't go anywhere. Those rumours were media rubbish.

&gt;Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Messi, Ronaldo. 
jk. We are good to go, we don't need anyone.

&gt;Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

See above :D

&gt;Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Lukaku, De Bruyne.

&gt;Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

See above + Van Ginkel but he will have time to shine in the next couple of season, I don't expect much from him this season.

&gt;How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?
Top 3 with some chances of title.

&gt;United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?
top lel. 

&gt;Finally, what is your prediction for the game?
No idea. Right now I can tell you that draw is right and that even if we lose it is fine but once the match starts I'll be screaming my lungs off hoping for a win.

No. No I do not agree that the suspension of my civil liberties is justified by a potential threat to national security. 

You're talking about something that has the potential, ie, not proven to cause or has not yet in fact caused, some degree of impairment (unspecified) to a part of the apparatus which in turn is (through unspecified means and significance) a single component of the overall system for preserving 'national security', again an unspecified term assumed to mean 'stops people from being killed by terrorists'. You could charitably say one person has been killed by terrorism in this country this year, and then 0 per year since 2005, when it was 52, then zero per year again until 2001. To me, that's four degrees of separation from something that poses between a zero in seventy million and one in seventy million chance of killing me. 

This is not of sufficient weight for me to be happy that my own freedom and the freedom of those who keep the unbalanced power of government in check has been curtailed.

I think we need to ban the phrase 'national security'.

&gt; Let's finally talk about Fiorentina's Adem Ljajic, who has been linked with a move to Milan, Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Galatasaray. He could be the bargain of the summer if he is allowed to go for as little €10m (which may be the case as he has only one year left on his contract). So who is he then? He is a 21-year-old Serb who plays as an attacking midfielder for Fiorentina and is very, very good. Today the club's president, Andrea Della Valle, admitted there is a high possibility that the player will leave the club next week. Ljajic has been in the news all summer with Milan and Fiorentina falling out over the transfer to such an extent that there were reports that La Viola wanted to insert a clause saying he couldn't join Milan if he extended his contract.

&gt;Either way, this is what Della Valle told Sky Sport Italia today: ""Ljajic? I cannot give any answers right now, but there are a few different options available. He could still stay at Fiorentina, though there's not that much chance of that happening. Next week we will make a decision.""

&gt;So why is he not playing for the Serbia national team at the moment, if he is that good, you may ask. [The answer is that Sinisa Mihajlovic will not select him because he refuses to sing the national anthem before internationals.](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/28/serbia-adem-ljajic-suspended-spain-friendly)

true,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,"I agree that they have one of the best run downs of it and they do include the facts. What I don't like about their reporting is their blatant framing of the issues and drawing attention towards the parts they want to highlight with descriptive and emotive language, like the GCHQ agents identifying what to destroy, and downplaying the parts they don't really want people to focus in, like mentioning in passing once that the government had made a request of them.

For a first hand account of events it blatantly frames the issue for its own agenda so the average reader will take away the facts that the Guardian wants them to and forget the parts that they don't.

And I agree with the assessment that they might have considered using the Official Secrets Act in this scenario which could potentially have resulted in an injunction on reporting, although I'm not sure how successful that would actually be. I also would have thought that the Guardian taking a stand and bringing any potential attempt to the Courts (and potentially the ECHR) for freedom of the press, as they threatened to do last time the Met tried to invoke the Official Secrets Act in 2011, would have been a much more beneficial decision.

But the fact that the government didn't go straight for a court order and injunction on reporting and, as far as Rusbridger's accounts have gone so far, never requested that the Guardian cease any sort of reporting on the cases completely flies in the face of any claims that the Guardian were being bullied or harassed into ceasing reporting on the issue.",0,1377262424,null,0,false,0,cbtoy0b,t3_1kwj9d,t1_cbtoy0b,t1_cbtojp6,null,1429728069,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Sgt_General,,Do it for Redders 4: Never Stop Doing it!,"So about, the Championship fantasy football league...

I was so, so optimistic about my chances before the start of the season but now I'm second from bottom, while the first-placed team in our league has two players that haven't even featured all season but Deeney has carried them to the top by himself (no offense if you're the owner of that team). It just shows you how freaking crazy fantasy football can be.

I wish that I knew more about Leicester City before investing so heavily in them, though. Knockaert was a big factor in their top six finish last season and he's barely featured so far. The same goes for Wood, who was one of *the* main goalscorers last season, but due to Leicester's 3-5-2 formation he's been left out in favour of Nugent and Vardy. The worst part is that I made him captain, since I was so sure of his ability to earn points, and the bloody game won't let me change my captain!

I also made so many last minute mistakes on the eve of the season: ""Vaughan isn't a prolific goalscorer, so let's sell him and buy Beckford - Freedman will know how to use him."" Vaughan has been scoring important goals for Huddersfield and Beckford has done nothing because Freedman obviously doesn't know how to play him, seeing as he's been used up front on his own.  
""Watford will concede too many goals, I should put Alex McCarthy in goal instead of Almunia."" Reading have had a really leaky defence so far this season.  
""Will Buckley is an awesome winger, he's sure to get me loads of points."" Then Brighton's manager changed to a system that doesn't utilise wingers like Buckley and LuaLua, so he starts on the bench every game.

At least I'm doing better in the Premiership, so far. The only mistakes I've really made have been leaving Benteke on the bench for the first game, making Defoe my captain (at least I can change who the captain is on this one!) and not finding a way to make room for Van Persie. Then again, I couldn't bring myself to buy any Manchester United players.

If you are in a full time job and earning money on the side then in general the money on the side is taxed at either 20% or 40% as your full time job has used up all your tax free allowance. This is all worked out with the tax code on your payslip. 

Bear in mind that you can say that you incurred costs in order to earn that £800 and therefore the money you earned is less and the tax you pay is lower. There is quite a wide range of things you could potentially claim - travel, food, equipment etc so always keep your receipts.

I'm not an expert but you shouldn't have to pay tax on the savings income, I think you should declare it on the form but then they won't tax it - this tax is meant for people who have savings income but aren't paying much or any income tax.

Obviously spurs are owned and run by excessively wealthy people as well, but for spurs it has not been a quick cash injection to buy championships for billionaires that are bored with earning a squillion dollars per minute. For spurs it has been a gradual and rocky ride over 5-10 years toward financial freedom that has allowed us to build up the squad, year in year out, growing and growing until we reach a level that we are able to afford spending 100m in a single transfer window.


It also helps that we are selling one player for 100m, which therefore allows us to spend that money in return. Levy has basically taken out a mortgage on Bale this summer. 

If Man City or Chelsea had sold a player for 100m and then spent that money replacing &amp; re-strengthening, then nobody would ever have complained.


In my opinion, there is no stigma associated with a transfer policy which balances profits from sales with purchases. There is, however stigma associated with a bloke sinking money into purchases without any form of legitimate monetary return.

So your problem here is that a first hand account designed to explain their thinking and reasoning happens to have a narrative frame that matches their thinking and reasoning? 
 
Their early report on this was unquestionably emotive and selective and I agree with you straight up facts are useful *but* I'd like to point out that even those can come across as editorialised. In fact the reason I felt I had to address the issue of context is that your run down was infused with a use of bolding that *without* the context implies that the Guardian chose to destroy the drive to further their narrative. 

No doubt that's not what you intended but it's very easy to start reading into something things that are not there when you have a preconceived notion of the intent. 

&gt;And I agree with the assessment that they might have considered using the Official Secrets Act in this scenario which could potentially have resulted in an injunction on reporting, although I'm not sure how successful that would actually be. I also would have thought that the Guardian taking a stand and bringing any potential attempt to the Courts (and potentially the ECHR) for freedom of the press, as they threatened to do last time the Met tried to invoke the Official Secrets Act in 2011, would have been a much more beneficial decision.

We can debate what might be of best value all we like, currently I feel keeping the leaks going is hugely important and apparently so did the Guardian. Either way it's clear they had valid reasons for doing what they did given we are debating the value of it. Which is largely the point I felt had to be made.  

&gt;But the fact that the government didn't go straight for a court order and injunction on reporting and, as far as Rusbridger's accounts have gone so far, never requested that the Guardian cease any sort of reporting on the cases completely flies in the face of any claims that the Guardian were being bullied or harassed into ceasing reporting on the issue.

The government going straight for a court order would have unquestionably been an act of censorship and there would have been uproar. As a result the government wanted an excuse; ""we asked them nicely but they *forced* us to take them to court"". You shouldn't forget that they can benefit just as much from a framed narrative as the Guardian. 

Instead they used the legal threat of shutting down reporting worldwide to through weight behind a move to shut down reporting in the UK, which they achieved through voluntary action that... handily... doesn't have a legal recourse. 

Now while the Guardian unquestionably overplayed this in their early reporting I honestly don't think there is a question that there was a good amount of truth behind it.",0,1377264649,null,0,false,0,cbtphzy,t3_1kwj9d,t1_cbtphzy,t1_cbtoy0b,null,1429727810,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A) He looks pretty selfish.
B) From what I've heard he has a bad attitude and lost the manager his job when he (the manager of fiorentina) lost it and attacked him (apparently for good reason- fiorentina were about to get relegated and adem was not playing with any determination.)

As for these issues, he's still really young (21), can be got on the cheap and can definitely mature into a fantastic aquisition. I've been an admirer of his for some time (football manager haha) and I really think he could be a fantastic buy. 

He's apparently not allowed to join Milan after the two clubs 'fell out' over him so I actually think we'd stand a decent chance of signing him. At 21 he's also in no rush to be playing CL football imo and might prefer the playing time we can offer him. 

I've read that fiorentina might be willing to let him go for as little as 10m now rather than later (since they messed up and let montolivo leave on a free). 

Ofc this is all speculation and he definitely represents a risk in his character.

true,sdpaton14,num23,,"TBH i hope we sell Bale. for a few reasons.

1. The squad is extremely well balanced without him, IMO. There is no one star that shines brighter than any other, except Soldado, but he seems way too modest for anything that would upset the squad.

2. I can almost guarantee that Bale's head is about 500x the size it was 12 months ago, as a result of being (undeservingly) rewarded with every individual award in britain. As well as the flirtation of a ridiculous price tag that should not be emulated for years.

3. He's nowhere near as good as everybody values him... He's fast, strong, can cross &amp; shoot. That's it. He's not creative, he doesnt work hard to find the ball, he's got no defensive capabilities of any kind. 

in my opinion he is the perfect example of a player who has not kept his feet on the ground, he's been caught searching for the limelight. Don't get me wrong, the bloke can put the ball in the back of the net. But that's not what Tottenham need. Tottenham need a player who will work tirelessly for the team and for the manager in order to best get the machine working to full capacity, firing on ALL cylinders. We need someone who will work to improve those around him, not go missing for 85 minutes and then pop up in the final little bit of each game attempting to bail out a poor team. Tottenham need a quality team that are far from relying on one bloke.


**** Can I also say, that I do not *necessarily* blame Bale for going missing in matches. I blame Spurs' lack of creativity last season, and the fact that Bale was played out of position every week, to the detriment of the team, so that he could bail us out in the final minutes of the game.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Last season was one of the most awkward and uncomfortable in Chelsea history, the entire Rafa reign was beset with criticism and a lack of faith, much of it deserved and much of it justifiable. He wasn't judged unfairly, he still got a polite round of applause during his final game and lap around the pitch. We underperformed for both Di Matteo and Rafa, low points include the 4-1 drubbing to Atletico, the loss to Corinthians in the WCC, losing to QPR. It was a season that could have been a disaster, rescued by winning the Europa League and finishing 3rd

This season we have our talisman back, expectations are higher and justifiably so due to returning loan players, new acquisitions and of course, Mourinho. While looking to reach the top within his first season is an overly ambitious target, I'm hoping to see the club in the mix for the title to the very end, a strong cup run and a strong showing in the Champions League. We have a better squad than last season and more numbers, combined with fewer games we are hoping to see improvement in all areas

We suspected it would take him all of 5 seconds to settle in, he may have needed less time than that. The loudest reception I've ever heard a manager receive and his name will continue to be sung out like it has been since the first game in 2004. He's our man and his success cast a shadow over all proceeding managers. There's nobody I'd rather have standing on the touchline and I believe there's nowhere else he'd rather be

It's too early to tell and we're still in the transfer window. Mourinho likes a counter-attacking style of play with 0 defensive errors and wide men to stretch out the opposition and create space for runners from midfield. We were one of the most narrow teams out there last season with Hazard, Oscar and Mata all trying to occupy the same space, we'll see more tactical discipline and a shake up of the first team to bring about the wider style of play

We can't say what he wants to do, all we know is that the Portuguese National Manager's job is how he wants to see out his managerial days. I'd struggle to name a team he would still want to go to seeing as how he's won everything in 4 countries already. If he stays for the long term he can become even more of a legend than he already is

Rooney is a top player who could probably do with a change of scenery. We've heard nothing from the man himself but he may wish to work under Mourinho, live in London, any number of explanations really. He's arguably the best option for our weakest area and he's also very marketable. We'll clearly see another bid after Monday, whether it's accepted or not will surely depend on United bringing in a marquee signing of their own, not Mata

I thought the Willian story was bollucks, Kia Joorabchian posturing to get a few more £s out of Spurs or to get that last £10k or so on Willian's contract. As of 10 minutes ago, Mourinho has confirmed that he believes Willian is joining Chelsea. I'm surprised, but it does fit Mourinho's preference for quick wide-men to stretch the game and counter-attack. Against Villa we were at our compact worst and many teams will just park 10 men on the edge of the box, going wide is the only option. We're likely to see Moses out now, Ba out if Rooney signs. Mata, Hazard, Oscar, Willian, De Bruyne, Schuerrle for the 3 positions behind the striker, along the traditional Mourinho approach of 2 men for every position

Luiz is fine in midfield against weaker opposition but lacks the experience and discipline to do it against the better teams. He's a good defender but every player has their price. If Barca had offered around £45m, it would be worth contemplating. He's gained a huge following and people tend to have a high opinion of him, though I sometimes think this is mainly from his antics and friendly persona more so than his abilities as a CB. I think Mourinho can bring the best out of him and we'll see a better defender than we did under previous managers

I fancied De Rossi and Xabi Alonso but neither of them has transpired this Summer. We could still do with a midfielder capable of spraying the ball around, a striker and an upgrade on our wide men. The last two seem to be more realistic with Willian and Rooney replacing Moses and Ba

As mentioned, Ba and Moses if we sign better players in their positions. As much as some of us would like to see Torres leave, his wage demands, age and levels of performance mean we'll struggle to find anyone who wants him

I think Hazard will have a stronger season than last year, I'm also pleased with De Bruyne's start at the club and Lukaku's performances so far. On a tangential note, Courtois looks unbelievably good in Spain, but that's one for next season or even the season after

I think Moyes doesn't need to change much, so he won't. However, Chelsea and City have improved a lot since last season and United need to find the consistency and level of performance to match them. Where I think Moyes will struggle is in Europe, no experience and he may be completely out-thought by more seasoned managers. I doubt Fergie will stay silent if things start going badly, he's only ever within walking distance of that changing room

Central Midfield was United's obvious weakness, like Striker was/is Chelsea's. Both sides have failed to correct this so far. While United may not want to spend £30-40m on a CM, that's in the range of what will be required to get an improvement over the current lot. To be honest, I don't think there is an abundance of such players around. I have no idea who they'd sign but as I mentioned, I don't think Rooney will leave without said signing. 10 Days to go, we shall see

1)  I see it as very possible that England lose the 2nd spot in the coefficient rankings to Germany soon.  Shortly after, I can see a scenario where Italy pip England to 3rd and then we're down to 3 CL spots.  To me, that creates a nightmare scenario where we simply can't get back in the CL so long as Sheikh Mansour and Abramovich are around.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm going to diverge with a choice few of the answers here: 

**Expectations for the season**: I don't believe we will win the title this year. Not without significant investment -- but that's something I also don't want. I'd rather we develop our youth and not win this year (with the chance of building a legacy) rather than buy big and win once. A cup would be nice. Preferably not the mickey mouse cup. 

**How will United fare**: they are going to fare well, very well. Their win at Swansea was vintage United. Didn't play particularly well, but they were clinical and destroyed the opposition. I expect to see more of the same. It's a title winning squad you have, and it hasn't changed much. Youngsters like Buttner and Jones will only get better. RvP is hardly going to get worse (unless he gets injured). 

**Prediction for the game**: a win for Utd. Sorry to be so pessimistic I just can't see us winning. The squad right now isn't meshing well. Mata looks off his game. Ba is awful, Torres isn't much better. A scraped lucky win against Villa is hardly confidence-inducing. 

**Thoughts on Mourinho's pursuit of Rooney**: as someone who has been watching the premier league since Rooney made his debut at Everton (I know, it's not really that long ago but I'm young so cut me some slack) I can safely say that I *despise* Rooney. He's thuggish, temperamental, not-clutch (aka he fails on the biggest of occasions, basically the anti-Drogba in that sense), prone to streaks of bad form, brilliant on his day, and one of the finest strikers in the game. I cannot express how upset I would be if Mourinho bought him. Both because that would signal a lack of faith in the renovation project that we have arduously been building over these last few years (ever since the end of Carlo's reign), a project that has cost the jobs of 3 managers. And also because it's a waste of money, and frankly I'd like Chelsea not to go into administration and pull a Leeds or a Pompey. 

Some scattered thoughts.

The parts that weren't highlighted had been covered in the article. It was drawing attention to the points that i added so it wasn't skimmed over and dismissed as being identical to the original story.

And I was in no way attempting to place any implication of the reasons for which the Guardian cooperated or their intentions. Especially given that they don't report on the issue for a month after it which would be an incredibly strange move for an organisation who cooperated with the explicit intention of creating a story out of it. I do think that they subsequently decided to spin it for their own benefit but I don't think there is any indication that that was their intention at the time.

I would also say that it would be entirely possible to continue revealing the leaks even if an injunction was brought against them, which the editor even seems to allude to with his comments about carrying out most of their reporting in their US and Brazilian offices. The UK may have been able to prevent them from publishing it in the UK but the court would have no jurisdiction in either Brazil or the US, and with the Internet such stories wouldn't exactly be able to be kept out of the UK.

And I don't see how 'we asked them nicely to give back the details so now were going to order them to stop reporting' is any less of a story than simply 'were going to order them to stop reporting'.  Any time, for any they order that a story can't be run it will result in a plain outcry of censorship from everybody. It doesn't matter if they tried to politely request self-censorship first because the end result is still imposing forced censorship. 

But that still ignores the point that they didn't request self-censorship or threaten forced censorship according to the narrative of events. 

For your second last paragraph I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. The government didn't threaten to shut down reporting worldwide, nor could they if they wanted to because of jurisdictional issues. They threatened legal action to retrieve or destroy the information which Guardian lawyers surmised that such legal action had the potential to include an injunction on reporting in the UK. 

(On a side note the UK didn't propose legal ramifications. When they said that they would bring legal proceedings it was in response to the editor asking if legal proceedings would occur if they didn't destroy the information.)",0,1377266399,null,0,false,0,cbtq141,t3_1kwj9d,t1_cbtq141,t1_cbtphzy,null,1429727563,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

We'd sell fucking hundreds of the things to clueless teens on 125s and blokes who thought .5mm of leather suit made them the next Carl Foggarty.

There's a reason why a 'proper' race suit costs upwards of £800 and fit's like a glove; it's tripple stitched, made out of proper leather from real cows, kevlar and carbon fibre and doesn't melt if it gets wet.  If it's only £200, you can see daylight through the stitching, fits you like a pair of rapper's jeans and is made out of cardboard it's going to do fuck all when you chuck your self down the road.  

I really *really* fucking hated selling the fucking things, and would do everything possible to convince the idiot buying them that he'd be better protected in jeans.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;And I was in no way attempting to place any implication of the reasons for which the Guardian cooperated or their intentions. 

Again wasn't saying you were just pointing out that given your tone that you *could* read it that way. I was trying to make a point about how it can be very easy to read what you want to read into things when you come at them with preconceived notions. 

&gt;I would also say that it would be entirely possible to continue revealing the leaks even if an injunction was brought against them, which the editor even seems to allude to with his comments about carrying out most of their reporting in their US and Brazilian offices. The UK may have been able to prevent them from publishing it in the UK but the court would have no jurisdiction in either Brazil or the US, and with the Internet such stories wouldn't exactly be able to be kept out of the UK.

Actually you're right, I totally misread that and honestly should have realised it didn't make sense... it's been a long day... and that clearly puts my ability to meaningfully debate on shaky ground so maybe I'm wrong about everything buuuuuut the wider points I'm pretty firm on (I think ha) so I'll carry on regardless.    

&gt;And I don't see how 'we asked them nicely to give back the details so now were going to order them to stop reporting' is any less of a story than simply 'were going to order them to stop reporting'. Any time, for any they order that a story can't be run it will result in a plain outcry of censorship from everybody. It doesn't matter if they tried to politely request self-censorship first because the end result is still imposing forced censorship.

The end result is the same because that was the intent but lets play out what would happen with each option. Going in using the law first would be seen as the government directly using power to silence a critic, it forces what will likely be a long drawn out court battle they might *lose*. Asking always has the possibility that the Guardian hands over the files and allow them to use the threat of legal action to shut down the reporting without actually having to risk losing and it's only if all that fails that they take this to court which was the first step otherwise. 

It also largely works as better framing, the proof? The fact we are having this discussion.

&gt;But that still ignores the point that they didn't request self-censorship or threaten forced censorship according to the narrative of events.

Please explain your reasoning for this. 

&gt;For your second last paragraph I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. The government didn't threaten to shut down reporting worldwide, nor could they if they wanted to because of jurisdictional issues. They threatened legal action to retrieve or destroy the information which Guardian lawyers surmised that such legal action had the potential to include an injunction on reporting in the UK.

Again I was wrong so some of the logic in that won't make sense :) 

&gt;(On a side note the UK didn't propose legal ramifications. When they said that they would bring legal proceedings it was in response to the editor asking if legal proceedings would occur if they didn't destroy the information.)

Source? Also what does that matter exactly to the over all point? Are you saying the government *wouldn't* have threatened legal action if the Guardian didn't destroy the data if the Guardian had only not asked them about it being the result of those actions?

And asking them to hand back or destroy files on national security without any stipulations on what can and can't be reported on doesn't represent censorship. However getting a court order that says 'destroy theses files and stop reporting on anything contained in those files' definitely does. 

And I would say the proof that we are still having this conversation represents proof that the government wasn't censoring the Guardian in its actions since the Guardian has continued to report on the situation for the past month since the hard drives were destroyed with no repercussions.

My reasoning is that the editor has not identified any time where the government told them that they should stop reporting on the leaks, or indeed requested that they stop reporting. The only thing he has identified the government as requesting was the retrieval or destruction of the classified material obtained by the leak.

As for my last paragraph:

[During one of these meetings **I asked directly** whether the government would move to close down the Guardian's reporting through a legal route – by going to court to force the surrender of the material on which we were working. The official confirmed that, in the absence of handover or destruction, this was indeed the government's intention.](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters)

* Hatem Ben Arfa - really hitting his prime now. prone to injuries in the past but we could do a lot worse

* Fellaini - pure class in my opinion. if we spend the money and united don't bid then why not?

* Michu - expensive and happy to stay at swansea, but if he played behind soldado he would be pure class.

* Thomas Ince - Great young winger, he's the player we deserve, but not the one we need right now.

* Benteke - been mentioned above already. Not seen him play behind a striker but you can't deny he's a great front man

* Sakho - expressed interest in leaving, a good defender but would he be happy if dawson started ahead of him?

* Hulk - too expensive I think, but you never know. Probably not worth the investment but it would be brilliant to see him in action for us.

* Luke Shaw - young, quality left back from southampton, sound familiar? Gonna be a star in the future, but Rose looks very good going forward, hopefully he doesnt make defensive mistakes against the better teams in the prem

The difference in Hendo on the right for Kenny and Hendo on the right for BR is enormous because of the way BR's wide players work tactically.  They're not hugging the touch lines and they're not confined to the wide channels by any means, they're free to come inside and move a lot more.  This makes Henderson much more effective starting to one side in BR's system, as we saw against Stoke.  He recovered centrally plenty of times to fill gaps when Stoke tried to transition if Aspas/Coutinho had moved elsewhere while we were in attacking possession.  He's a smart footballer and reads play very well.  BR seems to have given him the freedom to plug the gaps in the middle when necessary so he doesn't have to completely sacrifice the substantial threat that Coutinho and Aspas provide when they're attacking from a more central position.

I still don't think BR is using Henderson in his best position.  I really think he's best as a center midfielder who can play box to box.

true,ColonelMolerat,null,null,"My advice is get online banking and update a list every day showing incomings and outgoings, and what they are - Drawings (personal money), capital investment (not day-to-day items, so things like computers or furniture), other business-related items (I have categories for stock, office, transport, etc).

If something is split across different categories (e.g you're going somewhere for work, but seeing relatives there too) you can split it depending on the values. Eg, for a £100 train fare to work seven days somewhere and spend three with relatives, put £70 in the 'transport' section and £30 in the 'drawings' section. If you're driving, you need to keep track of mileage, for public transport keep the tickets.

Include all incomings, even cash payments. I have a different section for money that won't go into the bank, so that my internet banking total always matches what my online account says. At the end of the year I add my 'offline' and 'online' spendings.


KEEP ALL RECEIPTS, number them and add them to a section containing what they are, how much and the category.

At the end of the year, add it all together and fill out the categories. If your turnover is less than a certain amount, you can just fill in the simple form - total outgoings/total incomings/what's leftover. I don't know the exact for the minimum earnings thing, ask HMRC for help. Their phone line is good, but you may be on hold for a while.

Interest is a bugger. You need a form from the bank. Yuk.

Don't worry, it's not that difficult once you get into the habit of doing daily accounts. Each year it gets easier, as you work out the difficulties you had at the end of the previous year and adjust how you do your daily accounts. For example, last year I didn't calculate the total as I went along, so I had to add up the categories for the entire year for my final accounts. Now I add the totals as I go along.

Does all that make sense?

Sure, people enjoy reading the Sun, but what they're enjoying also comes with political propaganda.

The Mail's Sidebar of Shame is a worse example than Page Three, sure, and they've both got the same purpose that I've an issue with that I think should be communicated and opened for debate.

What The Sun and Mail do is to skew the public debate on issues by using tactics that more rational and less profit hungry media sources don't use. I think that's a huge problem and directly leads to a much less pleasant country and society.

1. The article never said that Snowden leaked the documents to them. It said the information was contained in documents that Snowden had retrieved.

2. Snowden and Greenwald have already leaked details about GCHQ that are much more controversial than this. Does nobody remember the reports on Tempora? Or the claims about GCHQ spying on G20 leaders during the conference? Compared to those the revelation that the UK is spying on the Middle East is a lame duck. 

Adding to this, why would the Government use the Independent? It is a direct competitor of the Guardian for it's political positions, I.e. it has the same positions.

It is a nice place. It just gets old pretty quickly. There are some good pubs; The Fat Pig, The Hour Glass, The Old Firehouse, The Rusty Bike and further out of the city The Double Locks and Turf Locks which run along the canal and river.

The town centre is generic to the extreme with a couple of new developments and a lot of empty shops; it's now mostly charity, pound, and mobile phone shops, banks and three department stores - because apparently you can't buy enough home furnishings. There were queues outside the John Lewis when it opened, which shows you the general boredom of the place. There's no market and the ""farmer's market"" is overpriced and completely naff.

The area around and including the Cathedral itself is very nice, especially on a sunny day. The Quayside is also pretty nice but generally underused with only a few over-priced antique shops and a couple of pubs. Though there is rumour of St Austell's setting up a micro-brewery there but I'm not 100% sure that's true. It's nice to walk along or canoe the canal / river from the Quay out to the country pubs.

The council are useless and their planning and general operations are about 10 years behind everyone else, they constantly turn down things that would be welcome to the area for job creation or you find out things like at one point they were going to concrete over the grass around the Cathedral. Morons.

It's about 1 hour from Bristol and Plymouth - although trains don't really run past 9pm which isn't very useful. Not that you need it for the town centre as it'll take you 40 minutes to go to any location. Bus transport is not to be relied upon and extremely expensive. You need a car to go anywhere else.

true,ExileOnMyStreet,lfc68,,"&gt;Even with Sturridge, as excellent as he is, the injuries he picks up are a real worry.

Exactly. There are four senior forwards on the team: Suarez, Aspas, Sturridge and Borini. The later two have less than encouraging injury histories. 
I believe FSG in general is trying to practice good ownership--but if you think they're in this because of their undying love of the sport of ~~football~~ soccer, then you're the one smoking something... They're running a business they have not nearly as much experience as they think they do (football is surprisingly different from baseball, who would've thought) and making some bad mistakes. Overspending on Caroll, Downing and (arguably) Henderson is making them doing the opposite now, not spending what's needed to get the team to the level of genuine contenders, that is. Whether you agree with this, I assume, depends on how good you think Willian really is. I happen to believe he is not only really good, but would also be absolutely custom made for the kind of team Rodgers is building. 
&gt;Waiting to improve the squad with these kind of signings is fine but we will be losing players such as Coutinho over the coming seasons unless we are finishing better than 5-6 in the league

Spot on. Not to mention--as others have pointed out a countless times already--that because of the upheaval at several top four contenders, this season looks like an opportunity to reshape the top of the table. I would just really, really hate if didn't take advantage of it because of what appears to be a dogmatic approach to spending.

Norwich last year would have been perfect if he didn't get hurt.  Playing in the U21 matches and a few cup/europa matches isn't enough time to really do him justice to prove what he can do.

Coulthrist i think would also benefit from going out on loan if possible, he looks to be very good but he is also very young and would benefit from going out to a lower side and getting time against better talent.  There is such a massive, massive gulf between U21/U18 sides and the 1st team that asking him to jump up and get playing time would be completely unfair to him and shorting us on usable talent.

Government spending went up in Thatcher's first term as the UK was in recession from 1979-1980 and economic stagnation until 1983. However as steady growth and then a boom kicked in the need to spend dropped markedly. The UK then experienced both a marked 14 month long recession in 1990 and the ERM crisis, which meant again that government needed to take up the slack until 1994 when growth was firmly entrenched and the economy in good shape. This removed the need for government to be as active a player in the economy and so government spending dropped off. part of Labour's pledge in 1997 was not to reposition government as an active force in the economy, and Gordon Brown pledged to follow Ken Clarke's economic plan, which he did until the 2001 election. Then we started spending cyclically and voila, an unsustainable boom. 

And yes Labour were largely responsible for the GLOBAL financial crisis. Yes the world has to look at Clinton's repeal of the Glass Steagall act and pushing Fannie and Freddie into sub-prime lending, Bush's reckless deficit to fund tax cuts and borrowing to fund overseas wars of aggression, Greenspan and Bernanke's questionable monetary policy. But it also can't be ignored that Gordon Brown alone out of G6 leaders had responsibility for economic policy throughout the entire cycle and instigated the biggest wave of deregulation to the world's biggest and most important financial centre, all whilst essentially doping an already booming economy with extra government spending.

If we pick sides and say ""well because the Tories are shit Labour must really have been good and all the gainsaying pure slander"" then we'll get more economic gerrymandering and another bust. Osborne is a clusterfuck, but that doesn't take anything away from the fact that Brown himself as arguably the most damaging chancellor in our history. 

Labour broke the car, and it was our misfortune that in Osborne rather than a mechanic we had a man without a clue who decided to give it a damn good thrashing.

true,crm14250,null,null,"Doctor Who is a silly science-fiction show with strong characters and fun, adventure-filled stories. The fact that each week the show could take place in any place at any time opens up tons of possibilities in terms of what the stories can center around, from going back in time to meet famous historical figures, to seeing the human race carry on billions of years into the future. Doctor Who can come across as cheesy, which is often what turns people away from it, but really it's an intentional part of the show's humor, and after a few episodes most people are used to it, and come to quite enjoy it. And if that's not your favorite thing in the world, the show certainly has an abundance of serious moments, and many that are just, well, sad/amazing/inspiring/badass, etc. The main character, the Doctor, comes across as very mysterious, as little about his past has ever been revealed (in the 50 years since the show began, he hasn't even given away his name). He's a great character to watch, and comes across as quirky, wise, funny, intelligent, and always very easy to like. Doctor Who started in November 1963, ran for 26 seasons up to 1989, had a TV movie in 1996, and was properly relaunched in 2005, when the current version of the show began. If you start from the 2005 relaunch, you'll know everything you need to understand the show now, as the relaunch was made to be easily understandable for anyone brand new to the world of Doctor Who. If the first several episodes don't impress you, try to keep watching.

^All ^ages ^as ^a ^rough ^guide
 
Under 10s I'm fairly careful. No swearing, no misbehaving etc. show them someone ""adult"" caring etc.

10-16: general sillyness. minimal swearing. playful.

After that it kinda depends on the situation, but from 20 - 40 it's ""my age range"" and so I do the same shit, same jokes etc. that I've always done. Toilet humor stays, sex jokes, laughing at old aunt fanny etc.

Over that 40ish age I tend to ""mature"" up to them as it were.

Again, the ages described are very loose. And it is all very context dependant. So in an interview, and the interviewer is 27 I have an interview face etc.

What it's made me realise now, when I was 12 making toilet humour with mates and not seeing adults doing it. Wasn't because adults don't do it. It's because they hide it from that age group because it's inappropriate.

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I accept your position that if you ignored the context o it and had preconceived notions about what it sought to achieve you could. However I'm not sure how it's possible to read the Guardian in an alternate way to their framing of the issue.

Again agree they are framing, in this case it matter of degrees. 

&gt;And asking them to hand back or destroy files on national security without any stipulations on what can and can't be reported on doesn't represent censorship. However getting a court order that says 'destroy theses files and stop reporting on anything contained in those files' definitely does.

How can you report on documents you haven't read? How can you substantiate any claims you made without the documents those claims are made on? The end result is the same, they can't publish or work on the documents in the UK.  

&gt;And I would say the proof that we are still having this conversation represents proof that the government wasn't censoring the Guardian in its actions since the Guardian has continued to report on the situation for the past month since the hard drives were destroyed with no repercussions.

It's true that the whole thing is rendered impotent by the international nature of the newspaper but that newspaper is *unable* to work on the documents in the UK. It might not be effective censorship but it's censorship none the less. Given it's pointless why did the UK government bother? because they could? because they had to? either way it an expression of their power to get their way with the Guardian in the UK, showing that they think what the Guardian is doing is illegal and a problem for national security.   

&gt;During one of these meetings I asked directly whether the government would move to close down the Guardian's reporting through a legal route – by going to court to force the surrender of the material on which we were working. The official confirmed that, in the absence of handover or destruction, this was indeed the government's intention.

There's nothing in that paragraph that suggest anything other than he asked about legal action. You can read it as either asking for direct confirmation, or of classification of the suggestion of legal action. You can also read it the way you did and that no legal threat was made.  

&gt;And the difference is the same as me saying 'would you cut your tree back from over my garden' and 'would you cut your tree back from over my garden or I'll take you to court over it'. One is a more forceful request while the other is more amiable. Neither are particularly threatening but one Is much less confrontational and demanding.

Ya but being asked to cut down a tree by your neighbor is different to being asked by the government to hand over or destroy documents based on national security. That doesn't *but* the implication that there is legal action if you don't. Can you imagine a government taking no for an answer? So they framed it in a polite way to start with because there is no reason not to, they might get their way off the bat without the bad PR of going straight to threats. Again it's the context that is important and how reasoning can change when you strip it from the core of a matter.

Two questions, first with Villa being at home will they look to get on the ball and push up more, or will they continue to sit deep launching it to benteke with weimann and agbonlahor supporting. Probably they will stick to the gameplan that has worked in the away games.

Second, with villa being a predominantly counter attacking side, will we sit deeper to nullify agbolahor's pace, or hold a high line and press. In the first half of the same fixture last season we were caught in between, with some players pressing and others sitting back. We got the equalizer in the end with two passes from the edge of our box after villa had pushed up. Probably the best game plan will be to sit relatively deep.

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"The westside is, generally, the wealthier, flashier part of the metropolis; the east and south sides are, generally, more working class and industrial. Of course, Los Angeles, like London, is a deeply fragmented city so that there are ALWAYS exceptions. It's like a patchwork that defies any easy patterns, so that while the initial characterization I gave is a useful overall frame, there are certainly exceptions. For example, there are oil refineries on the westside, and palatial neighborhoods on the east side. And then, the various valleys and Orange County add another layer of complexity which does not map easily onto the central metropolis. 

LA gets a bad reputation from visitors, and it's not surprising, really. It's a shitty place to visit because of its fragmentation and sprawl. There is no clear center where tourists all congregate and have a good time, as they do in cities like London or New York, and it's difficult to get around because freeways much more fickle than the tube or the subway. On the other hand, it's a great place to live for those same reasons. It has so many different neighborhoods that you can always find a place that suits you. Once you get used to the traffic patterns, you'll understand how to get where you need to go--or, more accurately, *when* to get where you need to go, since the trick to managing southern California traffic is truly in the timing less than the route.

true,pastpresentfuror,null,null,"Think AVB's trying to go with a 4-2-3-1. The reason we continue to be linked with the likes of Eriksen, Pjanic, and Willian despite having so many midfielders is because he wants someone to sit behind the striker and orchestrate everything attacking from the halfway line to the D.  The 4-2-3-1 works much better for Soldado (and Defoe) than the 4-3-3, because it allows a center midfielder to be tasked exclusively with initiating forward play. The 4-3-3 asks a lot of the box to box player and doesn't define the roles as clearly (which is why we have seen a lot of crowding and stepping on toes in the middle third so far this season). This attacking center midfielder will have the least amount of defensive responsibility (even less than the striker) and will help make so there is no time in which the forward is isolated. 

He does like the inverted winger, hence the purchase of Chadli and using Townsend on the right (also hence why Lennon popped up on the left a lot last season). This allows for a lot of attacking fluidity when combined with a number 10 who is comfortable on the wings (Lamela). This however puts huge responsibility on the full backs, which is why almost every game under AVB has been either a stellar or a poor performance by Walker and Rose/BAE.

It really is a brilliant formation and my personal favorite, but it is completely contingent upon faith in your fullbacks' defensive abilities.

Right now, Kane isn't good enough to be in our squad, like i said i'm not sure he ever will be but if he is going to be good enough he needs to be on the pitch regularly against better opponents, getting 15-30min game time in 5-10 games isn't regular enough to see if he can cut it in the PL.

The general lore about that time period (not just from the show) is that Christianity was rapidly replacing any pagan religions (Druidism being a forerunner of those). King Uther was someone who was very Christian, so he championed that religion above any pagan religions. He -- and essentially all other leaders/rulers of the time, more or less -- believed that Christianity was a way to help organize and civilize people, so their kingdoms would be much more solid (and not scattered about, as pagan tribes typically were).

In the show, they made Uther hate magic, which I think is an exaggeration of the typical lore. In lore, it seemed like he was more against the non-Christian religions than magic itself. (Him hating magic bit works as a handy plot device in the show.) But also magic isn't nearly as common in the typical lore.

His son Arthur was known as much more of a diplomat, so he tried to unite the warring Christians and pagans; he took his adviser as Merlin to help represent his acceptance of pagan religions... as long as they followed the Christian ruling and order. Arthur was definitely ""for"" Christianity, but he realized that he would never have a civil, disciplined kingdom without somehow appeasing the pagans. (Merlin was never a servant of Arthur's, as he is in the show; that word was only used in regards to Merlin to say that everyone who was close to the king, such as the knights, were servants of his.)

But back to the general view of religions at the time: Uther's strong belief that Christianity was the only true religion and that pagans were savages, was widely held. (You can think of it as a parallel to the early settlers of the U.S. and how they viewed and treated the American Indians.) So to translate that to the show, since their emphasis is definitely on magic instead of paganism, it would be pretty widely believed that magic-users were vile savages who needed to accept Christianity and become civilized. It follows that it's safe to assume that even if other kingdoms didn't outright ban magic, it would be despised, and therefore usually kept secret by those who had it.

true,foolweasel,1905,,"&gt; What are your thoughts/comments on what happened to you last season?

We did as well as could be expected with such a toxic atmosphere due to the majority of the supporters hating Rafa.  Counting on Torres as our primary striker during a slump in form helped contribute to a generally underwhelming attack.  David Luiz and Eden Hazard had great showings, nonetheless, and we came on strong to make sure we'd be in CL this season.  I wouldn't call it a failure, but it never felt like we were going to contend for the league championship.

&gt; What are your expectations for this season?

Top 2 finish, preferably #1.

&gt; With Jose Mourinho back at the club, how do you feel he has settled in? Are you glad he is back?

Feels like he never left.  I'm extremely excited about his return.

&gt; Is there anything that you've noticed that he has changed about the way you play?

It's hard to say with only 2 games in the bag, but it feels like we're not sitting on leads and we're playing a lot more aggressively from the start of the game.

&gt; In his managerial career so far, Mourinho hasn't been at a club for longer than three years. Do you think he will be here for the long haul this time?

It's my hope that Abramovich has learned that you need stability in addition to great (and expensive) players.  I really hope he'll stick with Mou for as long as we have success and not be so quick to pull the sacking trigger as he has with previous managers after the smallest of stumbles.

&gt; Mourinho has made it clear that he wants to sign Rooney, and has said that he is the one signing he wants to make. Do you think he will get his man, and if not, are you comfortable with your forward options as they are, or would you like to see another player come in, and if so, who?

I'm not a fan of this concept.  Rooney is great, but I don't think he's a necessary addition to the roster, especially for the amount Man U is going to want for him.  As much as I think we could find a forward better than Torres, I think Rooney is just as much of a gamble.

&gt; Mourinho has confirmed that Willian has chosen Chelsea. What does this mean for your squad? Is someone surplus to requirements, and if so, who?

I don't have an opinion on this yet.  I just found out about it yesterday afternoon after a game of pickup when a friend mentioned he was pissed that Spurs didn't get him.

&gt; Luiz had been linked to Barcelona, with them making a bid, but Martino has said that he isn't going to sign a centre-back. Are you happy that this interest has ended, and where would you like to see Luiz play most often this season? Last season he played some games in midfield and seemed to impress.

I don't want Luiz to leave.  His improvement over last season shows that he has potential to be a game-changer in the future.  I realize there might come a time when we don't need a hybrid player and want to get some cash for him, but for now, I'd like to see him continue a role similar to how he ended last season.

&gt; Are there any more players you would like to see sign for Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

A striker of some sort to give Torres and Lukaku (and Ba, I guess) a reason to look over their shoulders.

&gt; Are there any players you would like to see leave Chelsea before the transfer window shuts?

Torres.

&gt;Which of your players are you looking most forward to seeing this season?

Hazard.  His skills on the ball are just insane.  Makes defenders look like amateurs on a regular basis.

&gt; Are there any young players of yours that you're excited about/who we should look forward to seeing?

Lukaku is a physical specimen with a lot of raw talent but not a lot of refinement.  I'm interested to see him improve this season.

&gt; How do you think United will fare under Moyes this season?

I think Moyes is more than capable of picking up where Fergs left off, but it remains to be seen if the players will buy into what he's selling.

&gt; United have been linked to various players this summer: Thiago, Fabregas, Fellaini, Baines and others, but haven't made any signings so far. What do you make of this, and do you think United will make any signings before the window shuts?

I think your squad is pretty solid at this point.  You won the table a bazillion points ahead of everyone.  If it ain't broke...

&gt; Finally, what is your prediction for the game?

At the risk of taking flack from my fellow Blues.. 1-1 draw.

I don't think we will sign anyone near the quality of Willian, but I just want one player who is known for defense-splitting through balls. That's really all we need for our attack.

We are on the 11th with John Hurt possibly being a forgotten one.  This means the new Doctor, Peter Capaldi, could be the 12th or 13th.  I have read that the limits on regeneration was set by the time lords.  It is not biological or anything more than a choice or rule.  With no other time lords who is to say that the Doctor cannot just keep on going.  Also the Doctor is clever and can get out of situations, so maybe he will find a way around it.  I apologize if any of this is incorrect.  I am a big fan but I know there are much more knowledgeable people out there and this is what I have found reading their stuff.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"He said he likes working with 22 players which means the 22 players only include the top players. By that logic no one has to leave.

By Premiership rules we will use the 25 man squad maximum limit + as many additional U21 players as we want. 

Going into a Premiership season with 22 players would be suicidal. We need a squad of at least 25 with 8 homegrown players.

That 25 Player squad will be :

1) Cech

2)  Schwarzer

3) Hilario

-) Blackman (does not count U21)

4) Ivanovic

5) Luiz

6) Cole

7) Cahill

8) Terry

9) Azpi

10) Bertrand

-) Kalas (does not count U21)

11) Essien

12) Ramires

13) Lampard

14) Mata

15) Oscar (Might not count, to be determined)

16) Mikel

17) KDB

-) MVG (does not count U21 (? To be determined))

18) Torres

19) Moses (homegrown so he might still not be loaned)

20) Schurrle

-) Lukaku (does not count U21)

21) Ba

22) Willian 

So we can at this stage fit everyone in easily yet it still will be under Jose's 22 man main squad and to get Rooney someone will have to leave or be traded which could be Ba or Moses. Don't expect anyone to be leaving for no reason, if anything expect youngsters to be added for depth when the squad is announced on the first deadline.

true,square13,null,null,"5 months ago, The Guardian openly supported the measures suggested by The Leveson Report which would have put statutory regulation of the press in place, ie the government would be regulating the press. I did not see Alan Rushbridger making videos and TV appearances around then talking about how this was a huge threat to modern journalism, probably because it would hinder his rivals most.

It did not care when Rupert Murdoch's journalists houses were raided at 6am and computers taken away to try and discover their sources. But when they were visited by the cabinet secretary to discuss confidential data and one of their journalists was questioned and then released at Heathrow airport, all of a sudden they make out they are part of some huge police state conspiracy that is 'the biggest threat to modern journalism'. The government had the power to arrest, seek an injunction or raid The Guardian HQ if they thought it to be in possession of this material and it did none of these. I accept our government is not perfect, and I am uneasy with the idea of constant surveillance, but to pretend we live in some kind of authoritarian police state where we must all life in fear of being persecuted for political crimes is laughable and an insult to people who actually DO live in countries where journalists are genuinely persecuted and even murdered, like they are in Russia.

Miranda was not held because he was the partner of Greenwald, he was held because he was on a flight paid for by the Guardian and was alleged to be in possession of confidential information from Edward Snowden, a man who is now being granted Asylum by Russia. Does anyone here HONESTLY think that in the knowledge of this, The Home Office is going to say 'Sure, come on in!'? I can understand the argument against detaining him under the terrorism act, but it is clear that the state had genuine reasons for detaining him, not just because he was the partner of someone who has been a thorn in their side.

The security services are in a constant battle against terrorism, intelligence as everyone knows is a shady area and when things go wrong we get cases like the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and when things do go wrong like this it is papers like the Guardian demanding to know 'Why did the security services not know about this?' 'How did this slip through the cracks?' etc. It is then hypocrisy of immeasurable magnitude and stupidity when a bunch of unaccountable, unelected journalists who often have their own pervese agendas then decide that it is their role to then decide what state information should remain classified and what should be released to the public.

Plus despite it's flaws it offers a pretty unique challenge and is a good game.

XCOM is perhaps not quite to your tastes in that it's sci-fi and set in the future, but it's a strategy game where you defend Earth from alien invasions in a bunch of non-linear missions (most of which you can choose between) and you get a squad of soldiers (which you can customise in terms of weapons, abilities, appearance, etc.) with which to complete the missions. XCOM is the entire programme though, so you're in charge of base development, fighter fleets, international relations, r&amp;d of new technologies. It's pretty good, really scratches the strategy itch I get sometimes but the graphics suck arse and even the soldiers from places like India have American accents. I'd recommend it though, it'll be pretty cheap now.

That said, at his age he's really not going to be more than a bench player. And he isn't going to reach the heights of a few years ago, which weren't really that high...

Presuming we get Willian and a striker we'd have 11 players competing for 4 attacking positions, so Ba and Moses would probably go. We only have 7 defenders, 8 including Kalas, so I doubt we'll get rid of any of them. If we get rid of any of the deeper midfielders it would be Mikel - Mourinho loves Essien while Lampard, Van Ginkel and Ramires are all getting playing time. Getting rid of Mikel could signal an intention to give McEachran or Chalobah some playing time this season.

The high street used to be much more interesting, but in the past 10 years had reverted to the standard phone shops and cheap stores like every other town. The Princesshay development (which is still fairly recent, 5 years or so?) is definitely a big improvement on what was there before and has helped to revive it.

Nightlife has shifted dramatically. Whereas it used to all be around the Quay at night (standard overpriced clubs full of underage kids, but I still have fond memories), some upmarket developments in the area and complaints from the new residents have killed it off. Now there's a handful of places scattered along the high street. The last time I went for a night out there on a Saturday it felt eerily quiet relative to what I remember. Others have pointed out some of the bars, but I've not seen anyone mention The Cavern yet, which is (was?) one of the better live music bars in town. Another interesting place is The Pheonix which is not so much a bar, but an arts and media centre that puts on some interesting live shows (but also has a bar). If you want to creep yourself out a little, The Well House pub around the cathedral has a skeleton in the cellar that you can pop down to see which they found, along with the ruins of a Roman bath house, when they were doing some digging.

The cathedral and quay are both very nice areas to hang around in the summer, and I especially like the little antiques market on the quay. Other things of note are the medieval underground tunnels which have their entrance near the bus station, and the ruins at the bottom of Fore street (although no one hangs out there due to it basically being a traffic intersection, which is a shame).

(interesting detail, the reason the buildings in the city centre are more modern (relatively) compared to the buildings around the cathedral, is that during WW2, Hitler tried to wipe out the city in a single strike, known the Exeter Blitz, but somehow that area was largely missed).",0,1377281955,null,0,false,0,cbtw1i4,t3_1kxqv2,t1_cbtw1i4,t3_1kxqv2,null,1429724644,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Townsend is unsettled because he wants to play, and i think he is dong what he needs to right now to get that chance but coming into this season he was behind Lennon and Bale so it looked like he would just be another squad player. From his standpoint he wants to play and we are trying to bring in Chadli, Willian, Lamela...all who play the wings, truthfully i like the way Chadli looks but i think Andros is close in terms of talent and development though if we bring in Lamela he is on another level.

Kane was solid against Tbilisi, a team that should be a win for every team in the PL and at least 1/2 the Championship.....not saying he didn't do well, but it is literally not the level of competition that he needs to be facing regularly, he probably should have started against Tbilisi but given we are trying to build chemistry and form of the front liners we opted not to use the kids and i think that was a good call by AVB.

But the major leagues do use loans, Italy uses loans at a significantly higher rate than the PL....look at the top teams and the number of players out on loan just this year...Juve (10 players on loan), Napoli (20 players on loan), Inter (25 players on loan), AC Milan (19 players on loan), Roma (10 players on loan), Fiorentina (14 players on loan)..most of those players are sent down the chain to the lower divisions.

The bigger clubs in Spain and Germany do use loans but also have the added advantage that their reserve teams play within the lower divisions, hell the Barca B and Real Madrid Castilla teams are in the second division.  No reason to send players on loan when you can keep them at home and still have them play against higher talent than the youth leagues. 
For us to get our youth experience that is better than the U18/U21 sides the options is to get them out on loan to the lower teams.

In this sub people don't get so worked up and attack whole religions based on something as small as a TV channel presenter saying something out of line. Many of those comments would be downvoted and hidden on a normal day.

Even more important though, is that the system Liverpool is playing this year is much more fluid, and even less reliant on crosses.

Student fees? Well, it's shitty and I don't like the idea of a US style huge student loan debt scenario but at the end of the day I'm not a student. It really isn't my problem. Hell, they upped the earnings limit to much higher than originally so I imagine a lot of people will be better off even though technically having more debt. 

Austerity? What austerity. In my day to day life I've not noticed it whatsoever and as far as I can tell neither has anyone I know. 

Miranda? Well, lets take a step back here. It wasn't a reporter with the hard drive, it was his boyfriend and he was leaving the country with it. I don't see this as an attack on freedom of press as much as I see it as pretty standard protocol when someone is attempting to leave the country with classified information.. When has it ever been policy to knowingly allow that?

true,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,"&gt;Statements from Greenwald and the Guardian don't make it seem likely that all of this information is available for their reporting staff.

Not being available to their reporting staff does not mean secure. They stated that the information was held in servers in the basement of their London office before they cooperated with GCHQ employees to destroy it. If it is held on their servers on site there is always the possibility that it can be accessed.

&gt; I'm surprised you immediately attack the Guardian, but from your further comments I think you might be allowing your opinion to form the evidence rather than vice versa.

I didn't attack the Guardian. I offered an alternate scenario from the ones you posited. 

&gt;I grant you I ignored the Met, but I haven't read anything about them having access to this information.

[The Met has been examining the information and launched a criminal investigation with regards to it.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/david-miranda-court-victory-data-police)

&gt;NSA documents claimed they did have access to company servers. These documents[1] seem to support that close relationship.

No. The NSA claimed they had access to servers, not company servers. [This document released by Greenwald](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/27/nsa-inspector-general-report-document-data-collection) shows that the NSA is required to obtain warrants for retrieving data. [This article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/06/google-microsoft-twitter-facebook-user-data-fisa-charts) describes the total number of court orders, including FISA court orders, the various companies receive and comply with. And [here](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/12/google-prism-ftp) is an article describing how the NSA is given access to an FTP server to retrieve data from the companies complying with court orders, or have it delivered by hand.

&gt;The NSA reportedly has access at any time to 75% of domestic internet activity in the United States as reported here[2] .

First, that says page not found. Second, because I am familiar with the claim, that is grade A bullshit. They have served court orders on telecomms companies in the US whose total services cover 75% of the US. It has never been claimed that the NSA actually has access to all 75%, and the article itself even says as much stating that they get court orders for the companies to forward specifically defined information on to NSA servers.

&gt;The NSA has been shown to have illegally surveilled people while purposefully circumventing oversight from the FISA court as reported here.

The court stated that the NSA had inadvertently collected up to 56,000 emails of Americans over the course of 3 years because they had not adequately investigated the packets used by internet companies. The internet companies were combining unrelated packages for transport across their network so a package containing legitimate data from a legitimate target could also contain data on an illegitimate target and the court required the NSA to properly parse that.

&gt;David Miranda was held under section 7, nominally an anti-terror statute for 9 hours. I won't rehash the details, but apparently this statute can be used for harassment.

Where did I say that he wasn't? And does that somehow excuse Greenwald's blatant manipulation of his readers by excluding the relevant detail that his partner was carrying classified material and claiming that the government was now targeting journalists families?

&gt;Also, bizarrely, the UK government destroyed physical hard drives when encrypted copies of the files were stored for the 3 primary journalists in some kind of intimidation tactic approved personally by Cameron, as reported here.[4]

The government didn't destroy anything. After a month long consultation process between the editor of the Guardian and a senior MP, apparently Heyworth, the editor of the Guardian agreed to destroy the hard drives rather than take up the other two options of returning the data to the government or of requiring the government to go to court to get a judicial order to destroy the hard drives. They were then destroyed by Guardian employees being instructed by GCHQ agents as to what should be destroyed.

&gt;I think that you are actually trying to mislead me here. I think that this 'revealed' information is only a fraction of the behavior that the British and American governments have been participating in. It seems that all claims thus far are credible and have been sourced.

You say that all claims are credible thus far while not attempting to refute the claim about xKeyscore? I can only assume you therefore accept that it wasn't credible?

&gt;The fact that you think any party in this 'ordeal', by which I assume you mean their act of informing the public, is more credible than Snowden/Greenwald is astounding.

This isn't a game of ""who is more credible"". If both are dishonest then neither is credible. The fact that you think different is highly disturbing.

Neither side is credible. One has a clear agenda they are more than willing to bend the truth or deceive for and the other is protecting itself. But one of them has a burden of proof since it is making the claims so it actually requires credibility to be believed.

If all footballing matters are equal, wages and first team positions would come into the equation, though I strongly suspect wages and agent fees would win out. 

Of course, there are the oddball scenarios like Monaco, PSG, and Man City where money is used to outweigh footballing interests. 

The thing about the Willian transfer is that even if you take into accounts Liverpool's higher revenue of 50 million, Spurs still had an extra 40 to play with. Considering the disparity in football and financial situation, on top of the fact that Spurs would definitely want Willian more in order to fill up a first team place left vacant by their 20+ points Bale, Liverpool would have done well to just save the time and go somewhere else.

 Considering how the transfer looks to turn out, with Willian choosing Chelsea for better football, more wages and higher agent fees, it's really worked out well for everyone on his side. I think Liverpool went in hoping no one else were interested, lost to Spurs, and stopped the game. Spurs, in a pretty similar manner, went in hoping Liverpool were their only opponents, and lost the moment Chelsea turned up. 

I also, by the way, think that Willian is overrated, but that turns this discussion into an argument about opinion. I can tell you really like him, though, so to each his own.",0,1377286387,null,0,false,0,cbtxsvx,t3_1kwksr,t1_cbtxsvx,t1_cbtnweu,null,1429723798,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Well yes and no, he was detained under terrorism legislation with the argument being that the supposed classified data he was carrying could be used by terrorists to carry out attacks. If they detained him purely because he was carrying classified material, then he could not be detained under this legislation. Instead the police would have to go through more regular channels.

However, if he was detained for the first reason (which he officially was)  then the only course that they really needed to take was to take his electronic stuff and move him on his way as it was the data which was the issue, not the individual himself. Instead he was detained for the full 9 hours allowed when it was obvious that he wasn't a terrorist.

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"WCML was designed primarily as a Freight Line. heck it runs Quad lines down the bulk of it.

You can hardly claim that Capacity is an issue when the Passenger trains on it run half empty, it tends to be local stations that are busiest with long distance not so much.

As taken From HS2 Alliance

*What are the Alternatives to HS2?
Government say there is a major capacity issue that only HS2 solves. 
First, they misrepresent the capacity issue.  WCML will not be full in 6-10yrs, or ‘completely overcrowded by 2022’, not even Network Rail forecasts say this.
Second, they ignore the alternatives:

1.	The ‘best’ option: DfT didn’t require the ‘best’ option be developed: ie to make incremental changes against demand; do low cost rolling stock and capacity changes first; address pinch-points when demand is strong enough.  Rail experts say the ‘best’ WCML option is:

	Rolling stock: build on what’s already going to happen (two timetable changes, some longer trains and Evergreen 3): rebalance first and standard class; add more carriages (ultimately to 12 car except for Liverpool).  Together this delivers 121% more capacity (181% in standard class) and need not wait to 2026

	Eliminate the acute overcrowding on the Northampton/Milton Keynes to Euston commuting services by modifying Ledburn Jcn without delay

	Do other low cost infrastructure changes as needed: with the rolling stock changes this can give 144% extra capacity (211% extra in standard class) with an increased train frequency from 9 to 11/hr.  This more than satisfies DfT’s forecast background demand (of 102% increase by 2043), and delivered at greatly less cost than HS2

Rail experts say there are low cost ‘best’ solutions for ECML and MML too.

2.	DfT’s own option: even the alternatives developed for DfT solve WCML’s capacity issue:

	Rail Package 2 (RP2) involves more rolling stock and removing seven pinch-points. This delivers 151% more capacity against DfT’s background demand growth of 102%, not the 54% Government misleadingly claim, and RP2 is less crowded 

	RP2 looks like being over twice the value for money of HS2 for just one sixth the net cost, and this is despite Government latest attempts to distort and bury RP2

	RP2 won’t be disruption-free but neither is it comparable with the wholesale replacement of WCML under its last upgrade, or the 8-year rebuild of Euston that HS2 requires – described as like ‘open heart surgery on a conscious patient’

The other rail options for other parts of the ‘Y’ generally produce huge amounts of extra capacity and unsurprisingly are not good value for money.

3.	Other alternatives: these are not properly considered eg Government’s own initiative to reduce travel (by faster connectivity with broadband, videoconferencing); rail pricing.

Quite honestly, I'll be happy enough should we finish the game with 11 men! I'll go with a **1-1 draw**.

Here's the team I think McDermott will play:

---------------Kenny

Peltier---Lees---Pearce---Warnock

---------------Austin

Tonge-----------------------Murphy

------------McCormack

--------Hunt---------Varney

I think that Hunt will definitely return to the starting line-up for this game. McDermott will want a more workmanlike side to press Ipswich and give them little time on the ball, while he will probably feel that he can afford the luxury of starting Poleon at home. I also think that he might just replace Green with Tonge, because Tonge has put in two strong league performances so far this season, while Green's last two performances have been average. Tonge has shown that he can work hard for the team and is much better at looking after the ball, so I definitely would change the line-up, although McDermott might well feel that he needs Green in there for his work rate.

The landlord changed agents and apparently landlord too, though I only found that out today. And I started getting lots of problems, illegal charges etc. I also found out about these ""arrears"".

I didn't know they were wrong at first, and just assumed I'd made a mistake some time (I didn't always have a rent standing order). So I paid. And then, tracking through my records, I proved that I was never in arrears.

I've moved now, and had problems getting that money back - but a few things were in my favor including having put all my issues in writing, being able to prove breaches of contract, being able to prove all payments I've made etc etc. Even then, the thing that finally got me the cheque - persisting and ultimately trying to confirm the landlords name and address as part of starting the small claims court procedure (which is probably cheaper and easier than you think).

Agents and larger-scale landlords may like to threaten people with court, but generally they'd rather avoid it themselves - if the tenant is in the right, it'll end up costing the landlord more in time and money than if they just pay you to go away. And that's essentially what happened to me yesterday. I was even given slightly more than I think I was owed.

Private landlords are probably more unpredictable - some may think they can win out by acting the bully-boys. That obviously backfires sooner or later, which is why most agents avoid that, or at least use legal bully-boy tactics.

My new flat is with a private landlord anyway - that's why it's a larger and better yet cheaper flat (fewer overheads). I'll probably have some landlord-management issues, but I think that's just part of what you sign up to when you rent direct from a smaller-scale private landlord. If you find a good flat at a good price with a mostly good landlord, it's worth some effort to keep things that way.

true,TakingYouByStorm,lfc99,,"At the beginning of the season, a LOT of errors were attributed to poor defending and poor goaltending. I forgot how many Skrtel mistakes costed us the game. Reina was injured and the beautiful Brad Jones was in. He's a fine 3rd string keeper, but he did make costly mistakes. I forgot that Carra was benched for a sizable part of the season, and he was only placed in later (which did improve things). Also, when Reina came back in, he was a bit flakey as well. Now we've got Toure and Mignolet. There were many shots that Reina had good reaction for, but he couldn't reach the ball. With Mignolet's size, I'm thinking we're moving up in that category. I also forgot that for the first quarter of the season, Lucas was still out with an injury. Defensively, I think we're still flakey, but we're definitely better than same time last year.

In midfield, we swapped Shelvey for Luis Alberto. Despite Shelvey being reckless, he did manage to be our top goal scorer for Europa league (which we don't have anymore). He was always played out of position (since we didn't really have forwards), so I don't really blame him for that. Anyone remember how they felt at the beginning of the season with Henderson? Almost everyone was calling for his head, but throughout the season he has improved massively. He went from someone that people wanted out, to someone we desperately want to keep. Suso is away on loan, but we have our new star Coutinho now. Just with the addition of Coutinho, a healthy Allen, and a better Hendo, our midfield is much better in comparison.

We were at risk of relegation due to a poor start, and we were slowly climbing back up. I don't think we were even in the top 10 by new year. Before that, we had no teeth (as some of you have said before). Our forward 3 were: Sterling, Suarez, Downing. Sterling will be magnificent, and Downing can provide good crosses, but Suarez was really the only one who could shoot well. We don't have Downing anymore, but we got Aspas and Sturridge in front, both are much MUCH more clinical. Considering what we started off with last year (and Sterling is only getting better with age), we've improved up front massively.

Am I hopeful for this year? You betcha. In almost all categories, we seem to have improved. I know to move from 14th to 13th is a lot easier than moving from 5th to 4th, but I also remember that we played very well against strong the top teams. We were missing just a few components (defensive error, lack of forwards, etc.) and we've definitely filled many of them. Sure, you can say our players 1v1 might not match up, but we also play with a very strong philosophy that doesn't rely on individual talent. Now that the philosphy has settled in, I'm going to say this season we're going to be less dependent on Suarez as well.",0,1377291661,null,0,false,0,cbtzul1,t3_1kyqzd,t1_cbtzul1,t3_1kyqzd,null,1429722843,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

&gt;I have a 3D printer and love interesting projects for it. When I saw [this cool foldable TARDIS](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:132557) I thought it would be cool to put a game on the inside of it so you can fold it open and play. The ""board"" would probably be no more than 3x8 inside it, so it'll be a micro game. It would be possible to put a little [TARDIS console inside](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:121808) that could maybe even double as a die.

&gt;Roll and move games suck, we all know that, but they can also be done right. I've been looking at Senet since the board is similar, but I hate the winding-ness of the way Senet lays out it's board.

&gt;I'm wide open to suggestions here. What sort of game would you make within these constraints?

I've been playing with the idea of a race game, 3 different tracks where you race to the end like the suggested [Das Wurfelspiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/118023/keltis-das-wurfelspiel), only even smaller. In this case ""Doctor Who"" is merely a theme for the foldable box to wrap around, which is cool enough as is, but I'm still open to suggestions.

One of the best parts about Das Wurfelspiel is that you're pushing your luck with the dice rolls. But with 3 tracks a 6 sided dice doesn't work (for the bonus points mechanic necessary).

true,BouncingLlama,null,null,"This'll be a long post where I dump all I know about relevant lighting. Feel free to respond for clarification and I'll do my best (tomorrow) to respond. I'm a little tipsy right now.

There are three main types of lighting commonly used in the domestic area: GLS (""normal light bulbs""), down lights (""spot lights"") and flood lights.

For GLS, fluorescents win by a long shot. Good quality ones last the distance, cost a fraction and use at worst marginally more electricity than the comparable LED bulbs. The only time LEDs start to compete in this arena is if you're looking for dimmable bulbs or if you have to pay someone to replace your bulbs. The main problem here is that LEDs are inherently directional lights, while GSL applications usually require near omnidirectional lighting and while there are semi-properly diffused LED bulbs out there, they generally don't warrant the cost for domestic applications. 

Speaking of which, though, many people use ""2D"" lights in their bathrooms (kind of butterfly shaped flourescent tubes). There are LED replacements available, but they require some rewiring of the existing equipment (usually) and are only worth it for long term tenants.

Spot lights, though, LEDs win hands down. Matching standard halogens in terms of light radius is pretty easy with modern optic designs and achieving a comparable light output given current technology only requires around genuine 6W, a touch over 10% of what halogens need. Compared to CFL alternatives (usually around 11W) they still consume less power, they don't require the warm-up period of fluorescents and more importantly they don't care about switch cycles^[1]. Best of all, reputable brands offer warranties of 2-4 years. The initial investment is often quite steep, but the TCO is well worth it. Hint: if the bulb advertises the number of LEDs it sports and it's more than 4, don't touch it with a barge pole.

Being able to dim the lights is a big issue for some people, mind, and while many LED lights claim to be drop-in replacements paying attention to this aspect is *very* important. The way dimmers work and the way LEDs want to work is not compatible (most dimmers are triac based and ""snip"" the AC sine wave, LED controllers pulse the LED itself after doing DC conversion, dimmable LED bulbs translate between the two approaches). Some bulbs plain aren't dimmable, of course, but they also tend to be cheaper.

But let's not forget, there are three competing types of down lights: GU10 mains lights and low voltage lights (MR16 and MR11). GU10s bulbs have a ""push and twist"" fit mechanism, while MR\* has a plain ""push in"" mechanism. MR16s are the same size at the front as GU10s, MR11s are quite small. GU10 LED replacements have the AC/DC conversion built into the bulb, but that's OK because modern offerings are very reliable. MR16 replacements (two straight prongs on the end) are often designed to deal with existing low voltage DC transformers and their reliability hinges on the type of transformer used. Usually it's more cost effective to replace the LV lamp holder with a GU10 lamp holder and just ditch the LV transformer.

Given current technology, integrated LED units are the most reliable, but GU10 replacements do amazingly well with some manufacturers offering 4 year warranties on the *bulbs*.

Flood lighting depends on your requirements. There are replacement modules for existing 150W or 500W halogen fittings; they are niche products. There are, however, replacement integrated units which can really save you hassle and money in the long run. A 30W LED flood light serves most domestic purposes, a 50W LED flood solves quite a few more demanding issues. Basically, if you're currently happy with a halogen light, there's probably a more effective LED light available where the TCO is much better. If a 500W light is not your bag, well, go Metal Halide or Sodium. Those two still reign supreme for seriously high output flood lighting.

true,paul4er,null,null,"""Sorry"", but I think you are the one being one naive ""liberal"" fool and acting as little more than a mere pawn in the Republican game of attacking everything  Northern Ireland. There has been a very blatant online campaign ongoing for the past few years to effectively  censor all symbolism of Northern  Ireland.

The ""government buildings"" in your ""legal status"" merely refers to that concerning Parlaiment Buildings and its surroundings and court houses (where the sovereign flag is flown, and probably is the only one that ever has done up to now -- the difference most likely due to not wanting the current non-democratic lot at Stormont to be wasting time arguing over it). There are numerous other government properties flying the Northern Ireland flag, including town halls, schools , memorials etc. It is the flag flown for evey single  sports team representing Northern Ireland I know, on TV for all our competitors representing NI individually, and official for the Commonwealth Games, including a coin made by the Royal Mint recently, the symbol of our fire service etc. Ask people on the street and a majority will tell you what our flag is. THAT is what matters, as flags are adopted as civic symbols. The fact of the matter is that, unlike other countries (which is where Republicans are exploiting this issue), British flags have never really been defined in law, with even the Union Jack actually merely DE FACTO of the COUNTRY (not de facto for a few buildings you mention but for the country as a whole), with those of other regions the same.

Fair enough if you want to design something new (who knows, I might like some of them) but coming out with this nonsense ""legal"" mumbo jumbo is doing you no favours to that end, and calling the Northern Ireland flag ""old"" when that is very much not the case is not only getting rather ahead of yourself, but little other than insulting to hundreds of thousands of people across NI.",0,1377292618,null,0,1377292881,0,cbu074v,t3_1kr4to,t1_cbu074v,t1_cbtnj6s,null,1429722684,-4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,-4

We also need a fast rail link to reduce congestion on the London-Birmingham part of the West Coast Mainline.

I felt it was a bit strange giving him MOTM, but then I re-watched the game and focused on him and really it's the same stuff I saw in the Confederation's Cup. He's a wonderfully efficient player. Reads the game brilliantly, is almost always in the right position, uses his energy wisely, and works well off the ball. 

You can watch a match and not really remember many standout moments from him (though I do think you will see more of this eventually), but then when you look at his performance as a whole you see he regained possession more than any player in our team and completed the 3rd most passes @ 90% accuracy. 

He made good decisions with and without the ball and helped put our more creative players in good positions. Unfortunately said creative players had no end product. 

I think he was a bit shackled by the partnership with Dembele. It's an interesting combination for sort of a 4-4-1-1 because both players are well-rounded, but I think it limits both their ability to get forward. I also think our link play was a bit stifled by Palace's tactics and Gylfi's lack of agility. The center of the pitch was flooded and we didn't have a player with the individual quality to wriggle out of tight situations. They conceded the wide areas and we just whored the ball to Walker.

It's a good start, but it was vs Stoke and hardly an indicator for the year any more than the Gunner's loss was for theirs

&gt;In one year we went from a lackluster squad full of kids and big-money flops to a team that needs only one or two more pieces to make the CL.

We still need those pieces, and we won't get them this year because of the lack of CL football.

&gt;We have a young manager with a clear vision, who has us playing marvelous football and who knows how to spot a talent.

Yes, but we still can't seem to get most of that talent to come here. 

&gt;We have one of the top 5 forwards in the world under contract and back in training.

For now.  Talk to me again in January when the real release clause that was most likely written into this contract takes affect.

&gt;We told Arsenal to fuck off.

Again, January, and Real Madrid.  And we lucked out on contract language.

&gt;We have a young Brazilian CAM who is not only adorable but also a superstar in the making.

Good for future, not for  now.  

&gt;The average age of our starting XI versus Stoke was 26. The average age of our bench was 21.

Again, great for us in 5 years, but if we don't start seeing CL now, how many do you think will still be here?

&gt;Everyone on this team is hungry for success and from everything we've seen the chemistry among these lads couldn't be better.

There are no trophies for ""happiest team""

&gt;We have a very young, very talented team playing the kind of football we've been waiting to see for a long time.

Again, future.

This is going to be a decent year. Nothing more, nothing less.  We'll finish 5th if we are lucky.  Maybe, and I mean *maybe*, 4th if Spurs and Gunners have a rough season, but it will be a test.  We need goals, and right now we still can't get them.

true,nxtm4n,whisperman,Whisperman,"Here's an idea, depending on how large it is. Make the board, say, 15 squares by 5 squares. A move consists of moving both your pawn and your TARDIS (make a little movable square that looks like a TARDIS), and you're trying to get to the other end of the board before the other player does. You can only move one square, forward, left, or right, but *not* back, and you can't move on their TARDIS, although you can move on yours. Some squares would be black, and you'd have to land your TARDIS there to move over them.  
So an example of a few turns would be - I place my TARDIS down on the void space in front of me, and move forward onto it. Now it's the other player's turn. He moves forward and places his TARDIS in front of me. Now it's my turn, but I can't move forward because I can't go onto his TARDIS. I have to go sideways. I do, and now it's his turn. He moves forward, and has gained a space.  
For additionally strategy and to prevent overuse of TARDIS blocking, perhaps make TARDISes take two turns to move - one turn to remove them from the board and a second to place them anywhere on it. Assuming that there are sufficient void squares scattered throughout the board, this might be a relatively balanced game (although I haven't tested it, I'm not sure).

&gt;The source you gave was yet another claim from someone calling the BBC biased

It was an objective study finding the BBC gave more time to pro-war government officials and less time to other voices than any other network.

BBC's anti-gay skew:

http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/27/comment-biased-bbc-skews-the-debate-on-lgbt-issues/

&gt; Arguably the BBC breaks its own standards because of the inflated level of attention it pays to religious opinion in general. It must be noted that organised opposition to marriage equality and LGBT rights is almost entirely religiously motivated. The media, especially the BBC, has given us saturation coverage of clerical positions on gay marriage since the Coalition for Marriage launched their campaign. But why should religious opinion should be treated as significant in the first place? Less than ten per cent of the population attend church every week (and that figure is declining) and the reactionary bishops who use their authority to campaign against gay marriage are themselves out of step with their own congregations. For the majority of people who do not care for religion, the issue of whether gay people should get married or not is nowhere on the radar.

&gt; The decision to treat the debate on marriage equality as a religious affair at all takes a leap of imagination. The proposals apply solely to civil marriage and have no consequences for the arrangements, doctrine or liturgy of any church. Neither does marriage depend on religious belief. Marriage existed long before Abrahamic religion, and today, only 30 per cent of UK marriages are conducted as religious ceremonies anyway.

&gt; But despite all this, the front pages and news bulletins were saturated with clerical fulminations for the best part of a month. No outlet could match the BBC, and religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott above all, whose fawning, unquestioning deference made the broadcaster sound like the Church’s public relations department. And that obsequiousness comes at a cost to LGBT people, who so often are not getting a fair hearing.

&gt; The most blatant example of bias was evident in the reporting of the outburst from Cardinal Keith O’Brien, in which not only gay marriage, but all same-sex relationships were dismissed as “spiritually damaging”. It was bad enough that the BBC reporter gloss this over as merely “outspoken” and “powerful”; but the decision on how to present the story itself was the greater outrage. O’Brien’s attack was directed at all LGBT families, most of who neither have nor want anything to do with the Church, yet the BBC reporter merely presented the story as a difference of religious viewpoints, with airtime given to an opposing view from Changing Attitude, a progressive Christian group. There was not the slightest acknowledgement in any of the BBC’s reports that day, of the obvious distress and hurt that thousands of LGBT families, not to mention children in Catholic schools, must have felt. Amazingly, ordinary gay people, about whose rights this whole debate is focused on, weren’t given right to reply in the day’s news bulletins.

&gt; A week later, we were treated to more presumptuousness, when Catholic leaders issued a letter supporting the ban on same-sex marriage to be read out at 2,500 churches across the country. The same reporter described the Archbishop Vincent Nichol’s letter as an example of the ‘softer spoken’ and ‘moderate’ voices that ‘ministers might be listening to’. What is “moderate” and “soft” about treating a whole section of society as second-class? A huge number of people – by no means only LGBT families – are massively offended that anybody outside church circles are taking these voices seriously at all. Despite the skewed reporting, the overwhelming support for marriage equality on the BBC’s comments section shows the true balance lies.

http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/12/28/comment-bbc-news-was-biased-against-same-sex-marriage-over-christmas/

&gt; Indeed there was no respite – but that was mainly because the anti-equality brigade was given so much air time by the BBC. Of course some religious leaders have been making their discriminatory views clear during the whole of 2012. So why did the BBC, in particular, give so much coverage to them over Christmas, both online and on TV?

&gt; It seems to have begun when the Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury announced, on 23 December, that he intended to use Christmas midnight mass to deliver an attack on government plans to introduce ‘gay marriage’ in England and Wales. This intention was reported next day in the Daily Mail, but received little, if any, coverage on TV.

&gt; The Bishop of Shrewsbury, it turns out, was nothing more than a stalking horse for Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster.

&gt; Come Christmas Day and the main morning and early afternoon news on the BBC was dominated by Vincent Nichols’ attack on marriage equality. ITV also reported the Catholic Church attack, but only in passing. It was relegated to a couple of sentences, and wasn’t ITV’s lead story.

&gt; Then on Boxing Day we heard that High Court judge, Sir Paul Coleridge, thought the government was wasting too much time on a minority issue. The BBC reported what Sir Paul had said to The Times but, once again, seems not to have questioned what the judge was about. Where did Sir Paul’s figure of 0.1% of families come from? Aren’t couples allowed to marry if they don’t want children? Does Sir Paul support marriage equality, or not? If he does support it, why has he chosen to talk out against the government on this issue? The BBC simply failed to ask these questions. Instead they allowed Harry Benson, from Sir Paul’s charity, the Marriage Foundation, to back up his views.

I think we can already make 5th place with our current squad this season. We can make huge marquee signings when we're already in CL.

Just looking at the T-Mobile SIM-only page (http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/sim-only/plans/), you've got a range from £8 a month for 250 minutes, 500 SMS, and 500MB data (which ain't fucking bad, to be honest), all the way up. £16 will probably get you all you'll need (1000 minutes, unlimited SMS, 3G data.

The only thing to remember is that for SIM-only, you obviously need to provide your own device.

1. There are the most minutes to be had on the wings, but Suso's best position isn't on the wing.
2. Suso's best position is in central midfield, literally the only position where Liverpool has multiple world class players, as well as cover for them.

That leaves a situation where if Suso stays with the first team he is either playing out of position, or only playing sparingly. Therefore, for his development, it is best for him to go out on loan where he can win consistent minutes in his strongest position.

Let's not forget that the owners not paying over the odds for every player will mean they will understand why we can't get fourth. They're demonstrating they're in it for the long game with Brendan. The only reason he should be upset is if he got fired for not ""achieving enough"" with our present squad. And I don't see that happening at all. 

The owners know you need to spend to advance, but they're thinking about the big picture. They know fourth is an ask this year, so why not consolidate our gains and make incremental progress. When you try to swing for the fences, you're more likely to strikeout. 

I know fans want to be in Champions League, but the ones who say it because we're a ""big club that deserve to be there"" are touched in the head. We're no more or less than what we are right now. We benefit from our stature in signings and for that we should be happy. Everton finished above us and even with our cash I don't think they'd get the same level of players we can attract. 

And what we are right now is coming off a 7th place finish. Most think we'll be at least a place higher this season. But I think we can push for 5th and even 4th. But there's no reason to get ahead of ourselves.

Take it slow. Brendan benefits from that more than maybe he'll realize. If we were a team consistently finishing 5th the last few years I might understand genuine frustration. But we finished 7th.

 The fact you're an Arsenal fan on this subreddit is the whole problem, I'm satirising something you have no fucking clue about. There is a frequent issue on this subreddit of certain fans fawning players like Torres and, to a lesser extent, Mata, for example, for reasons people have interpreted as being based on their handsome looks. Similarly, Ba, despite being no worse than Torres, is routinely dismissed as 'soon to be sold' and as having no hope in the squad. I've seen some interpret this as favouritism based on looks, and one or two have even called it slightly racist. The fact that Ba, along with Moses and Mikel, are the three players featured so highly in these comments on this topic, led me to make a satirical comment based on the above.

true,therespoutineinmyear,null,null,"You're speculating. I'm speculating. We're both piecing together our own drastically differently narratives from the same set of evidence. I don't outright reject your major points about FSG because they may prove to be completely correct and mine may be miles off when everything comes out in the wash, but right now I believe your opinion is rash and overly pessimistic.

Firstly, I can't abide your comment about budgets. Every club except City, Chelsea, PSG, Monaco, and Madrid has an operating budget and transfers are a part of that. Every successful business on the face of the earth has a budget except the ones whose spending power is so much greater than their competition's that this venture is just a plaything and making a budget would be a waste of time (i.e. the aforementioned clubs). Arsenal even announced their bloody transfer budget to world at the start of this window. To suggest that having a transfer budget is ""a very American approach"" is absurd, it is a common sense approach. Why didn't Hartlepool bid for Falcao and Cavani? More to the point, why didn't Bayern? Or Arsenal? Or Spurs? The simple answer is because it's idiotic and unsustainable to spend money you do not have (see: Hicks, Tom and Gilette, George), hence budgeting your money. It's not just us and some other American-run clubs that operate with a transfer budget. Further, to suggest that we know this budget to be 25mp is yet more absurd. I believe that number has been picked because it is the number around which we landed at the end of last summer. Further yet, we have no clue how flexible that number is even if it were accurate. If Mata became available (as some silly rumours suggest) for 30mp and he wanted to come to Liverpool, do you actually think our owners would pass because of a budget? I genuinely do not. Moneyball is about getting players whose value on the pitch is greater than the price you pay for them. I think they would find Mata a rather good investment. 

Secondly, I guess I wasn't clear about this, but in no way do I believe that transfers are not negotiations. When I'm talking about the committee/advisors assigning a valuation, I mean that this plus a little bit of leeway is the max we would pay. We obviously start negotiations lower than this in hopes that we can get a bargain. However, FSG don't want to pay over the valuation they are given by their football people.

Third, I don't agree with your jigsaw model. It's not unreasonable to read it that way but, as you say, it's unreasonable to implement it and that's why I don't believe FSG does. I believe Brendan identifies the holes in his squad, the transfer committee (Brendan included) identify players they would like to fill those holes, and then someone (not Henry, Werner, and Ayre) puts a monetary value on those players' heads. We make inquiries, as you said, and we pursue the ones that offer the best bang for our buck. We differ in that I believe the owners would happily spend 60mp on a couple of CL-quality players if that was the players' proper value, if they addressed a need in the squad, and if the players wanted to come. I don't think FSG would blink, as they didn't blink when Willian's price was still reasonable. However, Anzhi played silly buggers with us and the rest is history. Unfortunately, our net spend may fall around 25mp again which won't reflect well upon FSG with many fans. [Note: I don't have blind faith in them. If there is proof of a hard budget or they continually stop spending at 25mp or begin selling good players to stay under 25mp, then I'll bite.]

Lastly, to you and /u/Riverboat_Gambler (sorry, didn't want to type another response), I think Shelvey got totally Moneyballed. He was not an important member of Brendan's squad in any way, not for the present and I don't believe he would have been in the future either. Surely, we can agree that he wouldn't have had much power to move us up the table this season. We have better players to do that. In Moneyball terms, his footballing value dropped way below his financial value, so we took the cash. I don't look at it as ""we needed the money to make other transfers"". I look at it as ""the money he would fetch is far more valuable to the club than his services on the pitch (bench) would have been."" We replaced him in the squad with Alberto who is a cheaper and, in my opinion, better option for now and the future. You can't present it as ""with one full season in the Premier League he can get closer to his potential and either become a first team player at Liverpool or become a player who is worth £15-20m on the market."" That's extremely wishful thinking and you know that. If he doesn't kick ass at Swansea this season (with De Guzman a much better option to Jonjo, I don't know that he will), he may be worth far less than 6mp this time next year.",0,1377298999,null,0,false,0,cbu2ews,t3_1kwksr,t1_cbu2ews,t1_cbtlnzo,null,1429721575,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,bcash,null,null,"The counter argument has many points, some more significant than others, I'll start with the most significant:

* Miranda was detained for nine hours under a law designed to stop terrorists, but at no-point did anyone question him or suspect him of engaging in terrorism, planning terrorism, or in anyway aiding terrorism.
* The repeated government and media assertions that it was valid due to vague hand waving about 'stolen' documents, maybe, but the fact remains that that still isn't terrorism.
* This therefore leads to a widening definition of terrorism as 'anything not in the state's interest', which is a dangerously broad definition.  Especially when, in this case, knowing about GCHQ and PRISM is directly in the public interest.
* The seeming injustice of the law that Miranda was stopped under.  Detention and forfeiture of any property, with no right to legal representation, and failure to co-operate is automatically a crime.  Whatever the rights and wrongs of the crime; everyone has the basic human right to legal representation, a fair trial, and protection of his/her personal property.
* Freedom of the press.  There's no legal basis for such freedom, but there's longstanding traditions of responsible journalists not being prosecuted if they receive leaked data.  This is being directly attacked.  The world would be a poorer place if such principals didn't exist.  (And yes, I know, journalists have shat on their own profession with scandals like phone hacking, but that doesn't mean many aren't doing incredibly good work.)
* The wider concerns about the GCHQ surveillance, and the fact that all of the above means the government is quite serious about preventing anyone from even knowing it exists.  Let alone how it works.  And, most importantly of all, whether it's used legally and responsibly.

So yes, you can interpret it as ""stopping someone with state secrets"", or you could interpret it as ""state abusing terror laws to maintain secrecy on pseudo-legal anti-democratic and potentially quite dangerous to the individual rights and liberties of everyone in these lands.""  Hence the outrage.

true,Chazwatti,lfc68,,"Sounds like we've been watching a different player but I guess it's just differing opinions.

Yarmolenko isn't that technical but from watching a fair bit of Dynamo last year he will instantly improve the side, which is what we need. I love how direct he is, which will complement the other players we have who are maybe more technical. He has impressed A LOT for Ukraine too, is great in the air as he's a bit taller and very strong. Most impressive of all is his work ethic and bravery, he really is an extremely determined player, honestly I respect that people view players differently but I am astounded by your judgement of him! His game is far faaar more evolved than simply running with his head down, his movement is great, he cuts inside well and his delivery/shooting are excellent. Anything £20mish would be an abosolute steal! Shevchenko has said he's Ukraine's best talent which is some compliment when you think that Konoplyanka is also in that team and he's outrageously talented!

Comparing him to Jovanovic is very very VERY VERY VEEEEERYYY harsh, they aren't even similar in style. Ljajic is a very very exciting player but we have players like him already. That doesn't mean to say I wouldn't be pleased with his addition but Yarmolenko is built for the Premier league, something different to what we already have and, judging by your assessment, sorely underrated.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"I'm not going to lie. I've thought about the possibility of violence against Parliament for some time. Not as something to do, but something to consider.

We're not like Syria or Egypt. Our military uses immensely capable killing technology, whether the military would fire on civilians is...debatable, but I like to consider all possibilities.

If it came to violent revolution then we'd probably get curb stomped. As a statement, it could be powerful both for us and for the Government. However, I suspect we'd simply be labelled as terrorists by the media, and if we did have a unified message then it'd likely get lost in amongst all the spin and counterspin.

I don't know how we'd begin to get weapons short of buying them from a country like Sweden and ferrying them through the channel tunnel or using the dark web, but both are likely to be time consuming and expensive. Time and money will be things we do not necessarily have in large quantities.

Even if we did take Parliament, what then? Who are we to judge any but the most obviously guilty? Some of the Letters to MPS posted in /r/uk and /r/ukpolitics have shown that some ministers are with us. That alone complicates things massively.

Even then, the country seems to be split down the middle. Most of the people who seem most against all this seem to be younger, elder generations seem more likely to simply tolerate it with the traditional British Stiff Upper Lip.

we also have to consider splinter groups. Would Islamic Extremist preachers try to coerce their congregations into fighting for control of the country? Probably not, but I'd be willing to bet they'd want a piece of the action, especially if they could insert themselves into the chain of command somewhere respectable. Then we have Scotland. In the event of revolution, Scotland might declare independence. This would cut off one source of opposition, but also one source of support. 

These examples are clumsy and probably not that accurate. I have no experience of war or revolution. My point is...there is a part of me that would like to see it, even if its doomed to fail. There is a part of me that would want to be part of it, even if it is doomed to fail. Simply because something must be done, and if death and destruction on a domestic level is what it takes then...so be it.

What is relevant is that he wasn't detained because he was the family member of Greenwald, as Greenwald was so eager to portray him in the hours after the story broke. Incredibly dishonestly since he knew that Miranda was carrying classified material for him.

As for the 9 hours it wouldn't be particularly suspicious if they were verifying the passwords and ensuring there weren't any layered drives that required further passwords to access. It also depends heavily on how far into the process Miranda gave them the passwords.

But all of that is detached from whether they were right and proper to use the Terrorism Act to hold him, which is something I don't think is right.

Players under the age of 20 as of Jan 1, 2013 are considered U20 for the FA. The bigger clusterfuck will happen when choosing the 22-man squad for the Champions' League. In fact, now, with Willian coming in, Jose is gonna have a tough time culling the list. 

**WARNING: Wall of text ahead.** 

Section 18.12 of the [UEFA regulations](http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/94/62/34/1946234_DOWNLOAD.pdf) states that:

&gt; A player may be registered on List B if he is born on or after 1 January 1992 and has been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years since his 15th birthday by the time he is registered with UEFA. Players aged 16 may be registered on List B if they have been  registered with the participating club for the previous two years without interruption.

**""What the fuck does that mean?""**

To register a U21 player under list B for UEFA matches, the player must fulfill TWO conditions:
a. They have to be under the age of 21 this eyar
b. They must have trained with the club for at least TWO years to count as List B (the European competition equivalent) for UEFA competitions.

Thus, **Tomas Kalas** (born in May 93) counts as U20 but not as List B (never stayed for more than a season at Chelsea - has always been loaned out). The same goes for Piazon, Oscar, Lukaku, KDB and MVG as well. 

I'm guessing Chalobah, Joshua and Ake will definitely feature in List B but Lukaku, Oscar, KDB and MVG (or a subset of them) will have to be incorporated into the List A squad, if they are to play for UEFA competitions.

**""Well, we did have a lot of exits this season, I'm sure space has opened up.""**

Alas, no. 

We can only submit a 22-man squad for UEFA, since the 25-man squad allows only 17 'foreign-players' and out of the remaining eight, 4 HAVE to be FA-grown and 4 HAVE to be club-grown. Since only JT qualifies as club-grown, we can only submit a 22-man squad for the Champions' League. Any further additions to the 22 MUST be made out of club-grown players ONLY.

A potential UEFA 22-man squad would probably look like:

1. Cech
1. Schwarzer 
1. Azpi 
1. Brana 
1. Cahill [](//#yellow)
1. JT  [](//#ball)
1. Luiz
1. Bertrand [](//#yellow)
1. Cole [](//#yellow)
1. Mikel 
1. Essien
1. Lamps [](//#yellow)
1. Ramires
1. Oscar
1. Hazard
1. Mata
1. Willian
1. Moses [](//#yellow)
1. Schuerlle
1. Torres
1. Ba
1. Lukaku


If that is still screwing with your brain, check Annex 8 (pp. 86) of the PDF linked above and look at row 26 on pp. 87: 

Sr no. | TOTAL LIST A (potential) | ""FREE"" PLAYERS | CLUB TRAINED | ASSOCIATION TRAINED | TOTAL LIST A (effective) |
---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---
26|25|17|1|4|22 

(\^ This formatting is wonky - no idea how to fix it )

We have 5 ""Association-trained"" (i.e. [](//#yellow) ) players - Lamps, Cole, Cahill, Bertrand and Moses and 1 ""Club-trained"" (i.e. [](//#ball) ) player = JT. 

^(Of course, there's Sam Hutchinson, but not sure what his injury status is. Last I heard, he was still struggling. If he gets included, he gets to be the 23^rd man, since he is club-trained.)

List B:

1. Joshua [](//#ball)
1. Chalobah [](//#ball)
1. Ake [](//#ball)
1. Jamal Blackman [](//#ball)
1. Billy Clifford [](//#ball)
1. George Saville [](//#ball)
1. Nathan Aké [](//#ball)

Notable names left out:

1. de Bruyne
1. van Ginkel
1. Hilario
1. Tomas Kalas

Maybe [National Audit Office](http://www.nao.org.uk/report/high-speed-2-a-review-of-early-programme-preparation/) 

&gt;In an early examination of progress by the Department for Transport in planning for the High Speed 2 rail network, the National Audit Office has expressed reservations about the Department’s business case. In particular, in presenting its case for investment in the project, the Department is said to have poorly articulated the strategic need for a transformation in rail capacity and how High Speed 2 will help generate regional economic growth.

true,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,"&gt;A few points: I would be incredibly surprised if we do not continue to see stories about the NSA and GCHQ's technical capabilities exceeding what you or I think is possible, or that they have circumvented the law while using these powers.

I have no doubt that they have immense technical capabilities but I highly doubt they have the ability to monitor any significant proportion of internet traffic, let alone all of it, given how the internet works. Communications are broken into bite size chunks and then sent, but the chunks aren't guaranteed to take the same path only to end up at the same destination. So they would literally need to monitor absolutely everything for broad surveillance to be in any way effective.

&gt;All evidence to the contrary of his claims tends to rely on statements or redacted documents from actors who are proven to be untrustworthy.

Actually most of the stuff that has convinced me of his misrepresentations are documents he personally has leaked, or Snowden has leaked to other news agencies. Interestingly he doesn't seem to like actually releasing documents to be externally reviewed recently since every time he has he has come under scrutiny for misrepresentations or broad assumptions based on a lack of knowledge.

&gt; I find it bizarre that you equate a journalist who has enabled all of this debate to be just as suspect as those he has exposed

Why do you find that suspect? It is a well known fact that Greenwald doesn't like the conduct of the American government in general. He has been writing heavily critical, and also often incredibly misleading or outright false, articles for years on them. If he is someone who already had an agenda why is it suspect to assume that he would take anything he could get his hands on to further that agenda?

&gt;  I do appreciate you argued all of this in good faith.

I will always try to put my point of view across in good faith. I will only stray from that if the other participant has shown their lack of desire for a good faith discussion.

&gt;I'm sorry I didn't respond on xKeyscore. I don't understand what you were contesting, but the program does appear to exist, and from what I've read it does appear to inevitably collect lots of information from people who are not targets of investigation.

The program does exist. But it wasn't a secret. Two researchers wrote a book that included a description of what it was and what it did in March 2013, so the month before Snowden released anything. It doesn't collect information. It is a database query tool. That is all it is. It doesn't have the capability to retrieve information from anywhere but the database. The database is populated by a multitude of different programs, including PRISM, which have, so far, been shown to require warrants from the FISA court issued on companies to gather the information.",0,1377301409,null,0,false,0,cbu37hy,t3_1kxr72,t1_cbu37hy,t1_cbtxx62,null,1429721205,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Let's allow people who actually know what they're talking about, i.e. scientists and engineers, to design an energy policy that will let us transition to a renewable basis. Let's create a number of nuclear power plants to supply us with energy for the near future until truly renewable technology is mature enough to take over. But unfortunately the people protesting fracking are the exact same people who would and have protested against new nuclear power plant construction. 

I am not some kind of conservative nut who believes AGW is not a thing. The threat is real and we are not doing anything about it. Real renewables cannot provide the same steady load and reliability that fossil fuels can. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and we should be using that as a stop-gap until we have enough nuclear power plants built to supply us with enough energy. 

These plants being nationalised or not is not a major point, personally I agree with you I think the UK government should own them, but I'd much rather we have a solution instead of continuing on the current dangerous path. This could have been avoided if ""environmentalists"" had not been so against nuclear power. Instead they have fucked it up for the rest of us thanks to their scientific ignorance.

true,SensEmilio,num3,,"What are the strengths/weaknesses of Lennon's game?

Lennon is a good dribbler he is quick on his feet and a handful for your average slow left-back, However, up against a good left back he can be cancelled out completely. His main weakness is his final ball, His inability to cross and tendency to cut the ball back when he gets in to a good position is sometime too frustrating to handle. Also his reluctance to shoot when he is in a  clear shooting position reflects the lack of confidence in his shot and that really annoys me too. Negatives aside, I think he works well really with walker, those two have a really good understanding. They work the overlap really well and cut teams up at times but again, I feel that the reason for this is because neither of them have had competition for their starting places in recent years.

What are the strengths/weaknesses of Townsend's game?

Townsend is maturing of late and so far i have been really impressed with him in pre season and esp in the game against Dynamo. We all knew what he was capable of even before he went off to QPR last season, we all knew he could beat his man and wack a ball in. what he proved to us at QPR was that he could score too and perform consistently. having proved this at the top level he came out and said ""if im not in AVB's plans then i want to leave"" and in my opinion rightly so. i think he is slowly becoming a player to be aware of in the premier league. this confidence i think will earn him respect from the manager and i think we could be seeing more of him this season. With devotion to training and the guidance of AVB i think he could be a big player for us in the future and possibly for England as the days of ""Lennons right wing"" come to an end esp with Chadli there too and the possibility of Lamela coming in. Andros is really explosive and if he is given a chance this season (im expecting him to play most Europa games and some of the easy home fixtures) I think his development will most definitely excite us

Who do you believe to be the better player? Explain.

I think Lennon has tons of experience over Townsend and that is obviously a big factor when it come to playing premier league fixtures but Lennons inability to cross and reluctance to shoot at times becomes too frustrating so i think for me its going to be Townsend. i admit that i would not be saying this last season and my decision is definitely based on what i have seen from him lately. if he can keep it up then i think he will be a lot better than Lennon.

Would either player make it into a fully fit 11 at this point? Who/Why?

Right now, without me dreaming about the prospect of Lamela and considering that Bale will leave and that Chadli is going to be playing on the left then i would have to say i would rotate the two on the right side maybe throw Ade in there to see how that works too. i just think a bit of competition for Lennon will definitely benefit us in every way that is possible.

If you had to sell one player, who/why?

it would have to be Lennon, i see too much potential in Townsend to risk losing him. Lennon has been there a long time and is not getting better.",0,1377302376,null,0,false,0,cbu3iqx,t3_1kny2p,t1_cbu3iqx,t3_1kny2p,null,1429721059,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Really, I can't believe Roma are selling him. He seemed like the perfect player to replace Totti and many people thought that was the reason for his purchase. A truly huge honor to have that title. 

If Spurs can play him as an attacking mid, he will do even better than out on the wing. It also means that his lack of tracking back is less important. In my opinion, his vision and passing far outshine his dribbling, which is also amazing.

 I also think his high number of goals this year was flukey. He had a lot of lucky goals, and never had an eye for goal back in Argentina. He only scored occasionally. One could argue that the change in position led to his goal increase, but if you look at the goals, they aren't anything special. A lot of tap ins and rebounds. 

His real talent comes from his vision, passing, and dribbling so I honestly wouldn't expect him to score too often, but rather create an immense number of chances for Soldado. 

I typically don't have a team in the EPL as I just enjoy following my favorite Argentines wherever they go, but I will definitely look forward to Spurs this year.

&gt;There is no moral high ground to be taken in such an industry. Certainly not Tottenham when they are willing to accept an obscene £93 million offer from Real Madrid for Gareth Bale.
There is only signing players, and failing to sign players. There are only winners, and losers. Anything else is irrelevant.
Liverpool felt they had concluded a £27.5m transfer for Willian last weekend before Tottenham planted their financial foot on the landscape. Spurs can hardly turn around in anguish when Chelsea do likewise.

There are other choices, BelgianBeerBoy (Lamela, as everyone keeps mentioning would be superb), that could come in and provide our team with what it needs.  Sure, we need another playmaker---one at a level above both Sig and Holtby's current ability---that can play the hole and has the versatility to play wide. We need someone with killer passes to take advantage of the clever runs of Soldado, but even if we don't sign anyone else, we're still remarkably stronger than last season. 

This might be an unpopular opinion, but when we originally signed Soldado, I immediately imagined the Ade of his loan season. I'm not certain this would work, I know AVB would be unlikely to try it, yet I would love to see putting him alongside/in the hole behind Soldado where the two would rotate, keeping the defense confused and allowing the height and technique of Ade's holding play to bring Soldado into tight games when getting him the ball is proving too difficult. Not a mainstay formation, just one for certain situations.

Sadly the characterisation of the Doctor as being angry and petty didn't sit well with audience either. I myself stopped watching at the time. I would probably have stuck with it through the bad sets, the low production values and even the questionable writing but the sixth Doctor was not an agreeable character to watch. At the time I blamed Colin Baker (wrongly in retrospect). 

In hindsight Colin Baker was an excellent Doctor who worked magic with the material and conditions he was immersed in. Let's hope they don't make the same error with Peter Capaldi. We need a characterisation of the Doctor that the audience can engage with and not some some grumpy, vindictive, disagreeable, know it all.

Martha gets way too much hate IMO. Not only did the Doctor love Rose but the audience did as well.

&gt; ~~You're saying that I am speculating for saying that others aren't 100% reliable?~~ **[rhetorical question and strawman]**

That's everything crossed out so far, and to your questions:


&gt; Let me ask you (and please answer these fully): Do you believe that Greenwald is 100% unbiased, 100% truthful and 100% open and honest in everything?

Unbiased, no there is no such thing as objectivism. I have a bias towards creativity and freedom but away from authoritarianism. Truthful, yes as far as he believes because one falsehood ruins him. Open, no, I'm sure he knows more than is reported so far. It pisses me off that he isn't more open with editorial policy of the Guardian, and he is still a middle man between ""we the people"" and the primary source data—I want to see the methodology, I want to see the meta-journalism. Case in point:

&gt; [Note that the Guardian/NYT partnership applies only to a limited class of Snowden documents](https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/371011752571330561)

It begs the question: what are the classifications and by whom was it decided? I'm ignoring ""and honest"" because it is redundant.
 
&gt; Do you believe that there no remote possible on this planet that he would manipulate what he writes in order to protect or favour himself?

No, but this is what I mean. You are opening the door of baseless speculation for yourself when it suits whilst slamming it shut for others. You will have to expand on your conspiracy theory.
 
&gt; Do you believe that Snowden is the same? A 100% bastion of complete truth and honesty?

It seems you have a penchant for utopianism.
 
&gt; ~~If you say yes, then you are truly stupid. And if you say no, then you're agreeing with exactly what I have been saying since this morning.~~ **[false dichotomy]**

It's significant that you are rubbishing GG and S for dishonesty but you aren't sowing similar amounts of FUD against the establishment—you are actually smoothing over the bumps. This is what I'm calling out.

&gt; ~~Also I didn't ask him to prove a negative.~~ **[lie]**

You demanded Snowden prove he **did not** (there's the negative) leak to the Independent. Back to my previous sentence: you aren't spreading FUD and making the demand that government or the independent prove themselves.

&gt; ~~You keep putting words into my mouth.~~ **[keep? false, rhetoric]**

&gt; ~~I'm just saying that he could be lying and that we have no way of knowing, therefore we should be sceptical.~~ **[FUD, we can verify with antagonists behaviour]**

This highlights my main point: you regularly speculate in the negative but rarely in the positive.

&gt; Are you suggesting that in the absence of ANY evidence, we should just believe him 100%?

You suggested that we should believe that the UK didn't do X because Greenwald has a vendetta, and that's what I called out, but again this highlights your sleazy argumentative style. You are reluctant to be specific with the lies that Greenwald tells or the way that ""he is looking out for himself"" and prefer to cast general dispersions: any one utterance can be false so all must be untrusted. You still haven't retracted the vendetta claims spun by his detractors—what happened to healthy skepticism?

Believe me, the chances of us getting the funding to come out with the next ""The Wire"" are fucking zero.

You aren't allowed to talk about the RPG because it wasn't the reason given to obtain permission for them to kill the journalists and civilians.

The US told reuters that the video didn't exist. If that isn't a coverup you must have some bizarre re-definition of the word to something like ""that which is concealed with a cover"". If the news was already reported, then why did it take Manning's leak for us to be having this conversation?

1. calling the civilians insurgents,

Gotze is definitely gunning for Ozils place in the team and with his move to Bayern will only increase his chances. Ozils father has commented stating he should move as his NT place could be under threat. Mourinho has stated that Ozil does not function well with competition. 

Whether or not Ozil will move is up for debate but what is not is moving to Liverpool. Under no circumstance would he come to this club in its current state and a move here would be a stupid career choice.

true,Lollypopsoldier,num26,,"Whilst a lot of comments are suggesting how unlikely it is that we could sign him, it's not actually that crazy, there a few reasons why I think this could happen. Firstly Mourinho doesn't want Mata in the team, probably because of his size and lack of defensive contribution, Mou's teams are always very sturdy and hard to beat, very hard working teams, Mata doesn't fit that mould. So I could see Mou letting him go. AVB was the manager who signed Mata for Chelsea in the first place, he seemed to enjoy playing under AVB and could go for a second spell. Playing regularly at a team that came 5th is better than being benched for team that came 3rd, he seems like someone who really loves football, and wants to play. He's already base in London and wouldn't have to go through the hassle of moving to Manchester or Spain, he and his family are probably fairly settled in London. We're also a team on the up, we are improving our squad dramatically and he could be a part of that, an intelligent player would want to be a part of it. There are of course 2 issues, would Chelsea sell to us? And are his wages too high? Chelsea probably don't want to sell to us, but I think if they are going to offload him, he's going to stay in league, with us and Utd being the main candidates for his signature, who would you rather improve? Utd, the champions or Spurs the Europa league team, if I were Chealsea I'd sell to us, for enough money I think they would. According the Internet Mata's wages are only £57,500 a week, a number we cannot only match but actually improve on.

true,Nowimnotalurker,flair-norwichcity,"Ruddy marvellous ","Mm, we don't tend to do pre-match threads here, we could start if people wanted?

The starting lineup is a bit fuzzy, but I think it's safe to assume that we will be playing a 4231 formation.

GK: Ruddy
LB: Garrido/Olsson
CB:Turner
CB:Probably bassong, but he has just got back from injury
RB:Martin/Whittaker
CDM:Bradley Johnson
CDM:Tettey/Howson/Fer
CAM:Fer/Hoolahan
LW:Olsson/Redmond 
RW:Pilkington/Redmond (probably Pilkington)
ST: Wolfswinkel

Several positions are really hard to decide. At RB Whittaker scored and assisted last week, and so would, you would think, merit his place this week. Martin played center back last week, but with the return of bassong he will not be first choice for that role - last year he played right back for most of the season, and is our club captain. My money is on Whittaker for RB though.

CDM/CAM is hard, because Fer, who will definitely play can play either role. If he plays CDM alongside Bradley Johnson then Hoolahan will 99% probably play CAM; he's our out and out CAM, and played there last week. If Fer plays CAM, I think howson might start as CDM instead if Tettey - tettey is much more defensive than howson and very useful when Hoolahan is playing who can't defend to save his life, but if fer is CAM he can and will track back, and so Hughton might easily go for the more creative option in howson.

The wingers/LB is also a bit interesting: Olsson can play anywhere down the left, and provides a much more defensive LW role than Redmond, who attacks well but provides no cover defensively. As we're playing away from home Hughton might go with him at LW, which would probably mean garrido at left back, and Redmond or Pilkington at right wing. If Hughton decides hull are not enough of an attacking threat, I literally have no idea who out of Olsson or garrido Hughton will play at left back, but Pilkington and redmond will definately be manning the wings, as snodgrass is still fresh from injury.

That's what I think - anyone else?

true,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Firstly, Snowden is kinda asking us to take his word for it that he didn't leak things to the Independent. I believe him in this case, but nobody knows for sure what has been leaked or who to.

Fair point. Snowdon is asking you to take his word because the government has frequently, willingly and consistently lied to the public at every turn. He's worth listening to for now.

&gt;I also don't think the government would be so stupid to deliberately leak things to the wrong newspaper. I mean, they're dumb and incompetent but not that dumb.

The government (very broadly speaking) has a level of calculated incompetence. It might *appear* to be a stupid move, but they don't run these operations with a bunch of halfwits. They know what they're doing.

&gt;I think it's premature of Greenwald to jump to a conspiracy theory that the UK government leaked it themselves. As I said, we actually don't know who has these documents or what they contain. It's totally premature for him to say it's deliberate.. maybe a security guard at the airport where Miranda was stopped did it, maybe it's the act of one lone agent, maybe Snowden is lying and did give things to the independent, maybe someone from the Guardian gave it to someone at the Indy. It's simply too early to jump to the conspiracy angle.

That sounds reasonable until you get into the details. Fair point we don't know what these specific documents contain, and since neither side will reveal them to us, I'll ask this: If it wasn't politically awkward, why did the government get involved at all?

Miranda was detained for the full 9 hours when the majority of people stopped are held for under 1 hour. He was carrying sensitive information, and I guess they have to use due process. Very interesting to note they used anti-terrorism legislation to achieve it though, weird for someone who is very specifically not a terrorist. Read up on the actual reporting of the incident (both sides).

It's entirely possible someone from the Guardian (Or whomever else he's been working with) leaked it to the independant. However the Independant are not even hinting at revealing their sources - why so shy?

&gt;How can I trust him to write fair and balanced articles now? It's a personal vendetta.

As a journalist, you know you're onto a good story when the authorities start getting rattled. He didn't get into the position he's in by being a whipped, meek kind of person. Also the government *made* it personal by detaining his partner, so they are at fault for escalating this in such a hamfisted way.

&gt;I'm happy in some ways that the information has leaked - it gives us a chance to see what our untrustworthy wankers in government have been up to. 

People involved have not been named really, and for good reason. The people who set up and design these systems basically allow for the political frontmen to 'fall' if they get found out. The leaks have specifically avoided ad hominem attacks so the public are against the *programs and activities* being carried out, not some moon-faced Oxbridge twunt.

The Establishment is in a flap because their conventional meat shield (make it about the person, not the program) has failed and they're actually under pressure to stop being naughty.

&gt;But let's not be naive and pretend that it's somehow wrong for them to try and stop the proliferation of the leaked documents.

How does detaining the partner of a journalist prevent that proliferation, other than by coercion? That's not acceptable in any society with a notionally free press.

For example, imagine if a way to prove your honesty in court was to eat a sausage - Jewish people would be unable to do this, because it violates a tenant of their religion. Simply by having THIS rule and not some other rule we are instituting a rule where religion is important.

It may be that this sausage thing is actually an important step in the process of determining guilt or innocence, in which case we might say the Jews have to just lump it, but if there were some other way of getting the same quality of evidence that was sensitive to their religious needs that would be more in keeping with the general maxim 'Do not cause religion to interfere with the enforcement of rule of law'

So the analogy rests entirely on whether there is some other way to verify the identity of someone who doesn't want to show their face in court.

There is only 1 feasible explanation for that discrepancy because the only people outside of a,b &amp; c who *know* what Snowden has are the government. They have, quite plainly, given the info to the Indie (perhaps via a 3rd party) so they can jump up and down about how this is genuinely harmful and ""life threatening"" information.

Inferno - The third Doctor travels to a paralell earth where they are carrying out experiments to tap the earths core for energy, the Doctor fails to stop them and the entire planet is destroyed.

Genesis of the Daleks - The fourth Doctor is sent back by the Time Lords to prevent the creation of the Daleks. Ultimately he decides that the creation of the Daleks will lead to greater unity in the galaxy and decides not to destroy them, a decision he later regrets.

An unearthly child - When two curious humans discover the Tardis, the Doctor kidnaps them, knowing full well that he can't return the home.
Later in the same story he attempts to cave an unconcious mans skull in with a rock.

The Twin Dilemma - Somewhat disturbed by his regeneration, the Doctor attempts to strangle his companion. He gets better but he never apologises.

The two Doctors - the second Doctor is turned into a cannibalistic monster. He gets better though and becomes vegetarian.

Remembrance of the Daleks - the seventh Doctor tricks Davros into destroying their homeworld.

Also, the seventh Doctor in general, admittedly we don't quite get the full picture in the series (that was planned for season 27 and a lot of it was then written into the books) but he's more of a ""big picture"" kind of guy who doesn't much care for individuals and he just manipulates them, including his companion, Ace.

Earthshock - the fifth Doctors companion, Adric, is killed while trying to save the earth from a giant cyberbomb. His death was pointless as his attempt failed (in fact it had to fail as they were 65 million years in the past ad the explosion killed the dinosaurs) so the Doctor could have saved him had he chosen to violate the laws of time, but he allowed him to remain dead, a decision that haunted him for the rest of that regeneration. His last word word was ""adric""

My wife had no formal qualifications. Did some temporary work at a sign company picking the middles out of vinyl letters for 3 weeks, got taken on fulltime, trained over the years to do everything from sticking letters on bits of plastic to CAD and 12 years later now manages it.

Another friend of mine who is truly illiterate and innumerate has a business repairing laptops to component level and seems to be doing quite well.

Another friend of mine who has no qualifications became a landscape gardener and in the off season now is also a locksmith.

Not everyone is academically gifted. Not everyone is good at exams. However having taught a downs syndrome kid how to fit tyres and then learning he got a job as a tyre fitter I believe everyone is capable of something other than production line work. The trick is finding out what. And to do it you may end up having to start your own business.

Those how end up in manual labour jobs that suck the soul out of them aren't there because they've got no qualifications. They're there because they chose to believe what you say - that they have no career prospects and are only good for manual labour production line work.

What else is interesting in this scene - a human version of Doctor totally agrees with his fate. They don't even discuss it, except  persuading Rose to accept it as well. Which means that both of them see it as the best solution. Maybe the memory of Joan and their imaginary ""happily ever after"" plays a part in it.

I like Martha, I wasn't put off by her neediness, because, IMO, she handled it quite well. Rose and Donna were in superior positions, because their sentiments regarding the Doctor were reciprocated. Martha was in a very problematic position, but she didn't take it out on Doctor or herself, she helped him and let him help her, and she found enough courage to leave him at some point. I was glad to see Martha go because it was good for her. Martha is one of the strongest characters in the series, and I respect her.

Regarding Joan's racism - I think that, as was stated in one of the previous comments, it's an invitation for us to think how blind and prejudiced can we be, even being good people, only because the prejudices are a part of our culture. What could it be? Environmental awareness, of course. Cruelty towards animals. Wars. Torture. We still do lots of nasty things towards each other.

He was one of the few established actors to grace the series from a non-fan perspective, which tends to make such a refusal come off as pretentious and elitist.

starting out at say the 65min mark Dembele allows us to set up an attack and Lennon running at tired legs with Siggy attacking from behind Soldado on counters while still allowing a more defensive position when subbing Sandro for Dembele in the 75min mark.

All that could be seen was the faint, red banners with 'Labour 2015' and 'One Nation' printed upon them. A single spotlight turned on, revealing Ed Milliband in all his glory, about to address his people after his emphatic victory in the general elections. Some of the audience were overtaken by the awe and grandeur, letting out faint squeals of excitement. A round of applause was about to start, but Milliband rose his hand, asking for silence. 

He stood there for what was only a small time, but it felt like aeons due to the anticipation. Milliband placed his palm upon his head, grabbing a handful of neatly combed hair. Murmurs and nervous laughs began in the crowd. Was this a joke, some sort of game? Suddenly Ed gave a tug, his face pealing back. His hand fell, dropping the mask on the floor.

Almost instantly soldiers began streaming in from the side doors, momentarily taking the attention off the man on the stage. Grizzled army men, twice the size of normal folk, lined the walls. Audience members went pale, stricken with fear. The tapping of heavy boots stopped, and the room again went silent. Now the man on the stage had all the attention and, and began to realise. It was *him* all along. He let out a single line:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgnFdJp0XI T.M. Revolution's preserved roses. The music video is weird and shitty, but I love the vibe of his music and this was the theme song of a robot show I watched recently. I especially like how they use the same sound effect as Sonic games use when he jumps on a box.

Richard Cheese amuses me. And I think this is the best cover he does http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlJuTRoZre4 He takes pop songs and covers them in a lunge style. I enjoy it, appeals to my quirky sense of life while being quite listenable.

I might rewatch Cool runnings today, but I think any review that gives it less than 11/10 is unacceptable. Its got pride, its got power and its a badass movie that ain't going to take no 10 stars from any one.

Have you ever seen Carts of Darkness?  One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. About homeless people riding shopping trollies at crazy speeds. Also recently saw one about an author who got addicted to crack to make his book more realistic. Two people try to get him off it and he flips out and shit. Ends up with the guy behind the camera losing his shit completely and just saying fuck it I'm done. I enjoyed it any way.

They can be, but right now this is a very niche market, and actually there are very few people working in this field and very few available systems. I would guess that a single fault tolerant computer costs millions.

Meanwhile, this isn't the way the auto industry is set up - it's far closer to the millions of people doing ad hoc web and app development. All the examples that you mention are either fault tolerant or they attempt to fail as gracefully as possible.

To an extent I'd agree as it's seen a concentration of wealth in the south-east of England, with only a few places up north having benefitted (Leeds,  Edinburgh, Glasgow the main ones) to have benefitted from financial services. But I'd question what choice many politicians had. Our industry and manufacturing not only couldn't compete with the South Koreans, it couldn't compete with the French or the Italians. Of all the major services left, they had to go with something. Now in the boom years a lot of the very richest people, often working in financial services, were paying a large amount of tax. The problem is that this tax was not invested wisely. Instead of private enterprise in former manufacturing areas being encouraged, there is mainly only public sector work there with a few bright spots (nissan, unilever etc.) I don't think you can attribute many faults to neoliberalism by itself, but the problem that many politicians just don't know how to deal with a post-industrial economy.

The same way some forces will suddenly really want to focus on catching burglars at certain times - if feedback from the public is ""I don't like all these kids hanging around my area smoking weed"" then the police may well do something about it. 

It happened where I live - local swing park was the spot for kids to go and smoke weed. Parents didn't like taking their little kids there - so police went and arrested anyone caught smoking weed in that area. Swing park is once again a nice place to take your kids. Community policing in action (!)

Also, how do you react to the police? Do you say 'fuck you officer, it's only a bit of weed?' or are you more polite, and express some regret and remorse? That can also have an effect on police action. Same goes for if you're wanted on another charge - were the black kids ONLY arrested for drugs? Or was it an additional charge?

Yes.  
It may be as large as Europe, but how much of that area can the UK operate a station that has taps into undersea cabling with   

* The knowledge and permission of the hosting government.
* That is stable enough to run such an operation safely.

You end up with a *much* smaller geographical area.  

&gt;This is a man you are accusing of being a puppet for the government. Do you really think that's what he is?

I'm accusing no-one.  
If you've been paying attention to my participation in this thread, you may notice that my very first words were:  
&gt; **If** you are correct, and this was a prepared leak

Emphasis on the ""If"".  
I am simply adding the only reasoning I can conjure for such a speculated ""prepared leak"" **if** it is indeed such a thing.  

It may be that Snowden is simply not the only disaffected person in the global intelligence communities.  
It may be (or probably is) a very real source who simply knows exactly what Snowden already has and is prepared to make their own revelations on the matter, feeling that it will come to light sooner or later anyway.

Since when did Greenwald have sole claim to all the potential whistleblowers? Never.


Edit:  
Look at this map:  
http://www.submarinecablemap.com/

The *only* places safe enough, and with access to *all* the sub cables in the region are Jeddah, Oman or UAE.  
Of these, Oman has access to most cables but spread over 3 locations. Harder to set up a post over 3 distinct spots.  
The UAE is a good option and also stable enough, but do we have enough influence militarily in that area to allow both US and UK access to the data?  
Jeddah is prime. It captures data from all the cables *plus* additional westward bound data from Yemen and other places that the other two hubs would miss.  
KSA is also the only other stable country in the ME with a government friendly to both UK and US services.  
It's not a difficult deduction to make, nor is it an unsafe speculation.

Get into him early enough that your foul isn't a booking, one player slows him and the other takes the ball away. 

The big difference this season is that Benteke's not the lone threat he was last year; Villa have an attack that seems to be functioning well. But all we have to do is treat it the way we treated our away games towards the end of last season, and our strengths will play to their weaknesses.

    Aspas              Coutinho
            Sturridge

That's how we'll line out I think, we need Henderson's energy  and Gerrard in midfield to close down Villa on the counter attack with Lucas sitting behind for protection. Away from home Villa have been taking advantage of teams attacking by hitting them on the counter attack, but now that they are at home it'll be interesting to see what they do

Coutinho is placed out wide, but I was at the Celtic match and kept a close eye on him throughout, and even though his position was on the left he kept wandering into the middle, even without the ball. It was Enrique who was providing the width down the left flank that allowed Coutinho to push in.

Baldé for Celtic, who has a similar build to Benteke, was giving Lucas and the defenders trouble for the 30 mins or so but after the goal they learned how to deal with him and nullified his threat, hopefully they'll take something from that and deal with Benteke (Benteke is a different class I know, but both are physical and use it to their advantage)

Villa are good side but I think we should be able to beat them today, I've a feeling they'll score, Mignolet was a bit shaky last week and got away with it due to the post and Stokes poor finishing, I don't think he'll have the same luck against better forwards but hopefully the penalty save will spur him on a bit and he'll be much more composed. 

Anyways, I predict 2-1 or 3-1 to us, Toure to smash one in with his head from a corner (he's been getting on the end of nearly every corner from the beginning of pre-season so it's about time one went in!)",0,1377354627,null,0,false,0,cbueure,t3_1kzx68,t1_cbueure,t3_1kzx68,null,1429715640,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
