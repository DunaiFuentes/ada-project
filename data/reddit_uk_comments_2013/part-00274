I really always wanted the War Doctor in the middle. [Spoilers if you havent seen the episode](#s ""I painted this before the special aired but knew that from the episode “The Name Of The Doctor” what he did in the time war caused him to stop calling himself the Doctor. I took this a step further, rather than being just an atrocity so horrible he could no longer be the Doctor, he in fact sacrificed his name for the Universe and his other selves. He took an entire regeneration killed it and buried it in his head to save the universe and effectively allowed the others to go on being the Doctor.The title of the episode wasn’t about what the Doctors name was, or who was going to say it. That episode was about the revelation to the audience that his participation in the Time War was not in “The Name of the Doctor”.
Some might argue that committing 2 acts of genocide is hardly a sacrifice, but to a man who values life above all there is no greater, especially when he has to do it for the greater good. Now with the events of the Day of the Doctor, we know that he in fact saved Galifrey. That to me makes the sacrifice of his name, the disavowment of an entire regeneration  and some 400 or more years of regret and guilt all the more powerful."")

I'll start when I was younger, I used to have swimming lessons at the local leisure centre. One day the gypsies moved into the car park. No-one could park because they'd taken *every* space. Now that's dickish, but hey it's not the end of the world. However, it turns out they'd been using the leisure centres showers and broke the changing cubicles. From thenceforth we all had to show ID and membership cards, no to mention all the rubbish they left in the car park afterwards. Oh, this happened yearly until the centre could raise the funds to block the entrances effectively.


I'll move onto a brief incident when I was a bit older. The day that gypsies decided to move into the lay-by near my house. They climbed on a neighbours roof and stole his roof tiles. And his car tyres.

More recently I worked in a small shop. The gypsy children would regularly come in and break things to ask for a discount, if we didn't offer it they'd nick it.

So I've had three run ins with gypsies in my life. All negative. I've heard of plenty worse things from friends and in the news so I truly can't see how these people can ever expect to gain respect from anybody.

This Christmas I will spare a thought for the homeless. It is dark and cold here in the UK and whether there by accident or design, it can't be a pleasant way to spend the months. Some will suffer, some will lose fingers, others will just slip away under our noses without anyone ever knowing.

I will spare a thought for victims of abuse, whether at home by parents, spouses or employers and neighbours, whether sexual, physical or emotional. I hope that they can find help and I spare a thought for anyone who takes that on as a personal burden.

I will spare a thought for neglected animals left outside in the cold or abandoned at rescue centres so the family can ""upgrade"", I spare a thought for the vets who have to destroy perfectly healthy dogs and cats simply for being unwanted.

I will spare a thought for the emergency services, they will be called on more over the Christmas season to deal with our accidents and stupidity. They will be rescuing someone's grandfather from an accidental house fire, and pulling Auntie Jane's arm out from behind the radiator when she thought reaching for the lost Christmas cracker toy was a good idea. And especially to those who couldn't save the lives they fought for, those who arrived too late and have less pleasant things to deal with, and I will spare a thought for the families left behind.

I will spare a thought for people with terminal illnesses who are worried they won't even get to share this Christmas with their loved ones, or perhaps this is the last one. To make plans or not? Play it by ear and hope for the best? or sort my will out finally? I am lucky I am not facing those decisions and I have no idea what I'd do if I did.

I will spare a thought for people without friends and family at all, those who will spend the day alone with nothing but the TV to simulate the social comfort humans crave so much and trick the brain into feeling like it belongs with the imaginary friends on the surface of the warm, glowing box.

I will not spare a thought for people just because their work is getting a bit busy for a couple of weeks. I will be polite, patient, engaging, I will make conversation or make a joke like ""no price? it's free!"" which you've obviously NEVER heard before and you will laugh politely as if that was actually true and you didn't want to smack me in the face with the tinned peaches which refuse to scan. We will smile, part ways and I'm afraid that's where my thoughts for you end and I seek my next engagement. I will not pity you, and I am sorry, but I will not spare much more of a thought.

true,Biokeys,num26,,"If this and the other article are true, I think we get a better sense of what happened.

I get the sense that AVB was somewhat of an unrelenting idealist. To his mind, everyone at the club should be kind of single-minded and focused in the same philosophy and end goal, and any resistance or compromise meant compromising the vision he had of the club to a lesser one. This is the way he worked at Porto with great results.

I also get the sense that he preferred working with people with more of a tactical background rather than former players with little or no experience in that front, whose opinions he held in lower esteem than the former. I can see how this could make him clash with some of the staff and with Levy's brand of strict pragmatism, and how these could have led to intra-club politics that were tiring for all involved. 

I think I understand Levy's perspective better after this. For AVB's vision to work, he would have had to be given a much larger amount of trust and control, which Levy was understandably unwilling to give. It would have meant undermining some of the staff, and the relationships inside the club might have been permanently damaged. This could have set Spurs back quite a bit, especially if AVB's ideas didn't work.

In AVB's perspective, he was made promises that were broken and he was not being backed, even after showing loyalty to the club by rejecting PSG's offer. He was being demanded immediate results and a long term plan for the club while not being given the backing and trust he needed or the players he asked for. He had to to fight not only tactical battles with the other teams and the media, but also inside the club, which should have been his ally.

It is unfortunate that we had to lose such a talented, professional and passionate manager, and one that gave us our best point record in the history in the premier league. I have no doubt he will go on to do great things somewhere more suited to his vision. However, his way of working is incompatible with the previous staff at Spurs and he was perhaps a little too unrelenting and stubborn with his tactics and decisions, and a little too dismissive of some of the staff's opinions. 

At the end, Levy came to believe the problems may not be fixable, and he decided to pull the trigger now instead of waiting for the relationships inside the club to deteriorate further.

TL;DR These articles have given me more perspective on AVB's and especially Levy's positions, and I kind of get why Levy decided to sack AVB at this point in the season, even if I don't necessarily agree the problems couldn't be fixed.

How generous of you to afford your host that choice.

&gt;Kicking someone out for possession of weed is not a social norm for most people - it may be in your world, and if that is the case your a bit like Peter (I would take a long look in the mirror).

Bad news for you here, fuckwit. I've done far more shit than you or Peter Hitchens have dreamt of. I'm guessing you're barely out of your teens, by the looks of your ability to form or understand a cogent argument. If you're older than that, then you've cause for concern. For the record, Hitchens would have me locked up ten times over for my past 'indulgences', shall we call them.

 I don't need to 'look in the mirror' to work that out. I know the difference between what I prefer, and knowing how to respect what other people prefer, especially when it comes to taking it into their homes.

Stick your 'social norm' shit up your fucking arse. You've no idea what the social norm is. What you mean is that your fucking mates don't give a crap. And that's fine. But that doesn't mean you're entitled to trample over the wishes of those who don't share that view when in their home.

Most of the friends I've had over the last 25 years wouldn't give a fuck if I walked in to their home with grass, ecstasy, LSD, cocaine. And I've had a pretty good crack at them all. This isn't about the law or my drug experiences. It isn't about what I personally think is right or wrong or convenient. 

Frankly, you pathetic turd, it's about respecting other people's wishes in their own corner of the world. Something you think only you are entitled to, you spoiled shite.

&gt;Again if you going to do that then unless you do the same for alcohol your not being logical/rational

Don't be a dick. I've known people who are tea total and who don't like alcohol in their home. I respect that even though I fucking love beer (and single Islay malt). They have every right to ask me to not bring that into their homes, and should I disrespect their feelings, they have every right to tell me to fuck off. It isn't about the law, or how I feel the law should be. This is their right in their own home.

&gt;Jailing someone for the possession of weed is not a rational act, that is what Peter wants.

Yeah, Doctor Who is a really tough one, I only started giving it a go when I heard about Capaldi being cast as the next one and was prompted by others to give it a go. It's mostly pretty crap, especially during Russell T. Davies' run (Series 1-4) apart from the odd well-written episode. There is a marked improvement in quality, style, writing and budget in the 5th series with the introduction of the 11th Doctor and Steven Moffat as showrunner, though. So maybe try starting again from there?

You might be getting it confused with Heroes, yes. Although the 2 shows aren't immensely similar... Misfits is definitely worth watching up to the end of Series 2. Then the quality nosedives somewhat... But it ran til Series 5 so clearly some people liked it.

I was actually talking about the first series of Strike Back, which was indeed a British-made show, with Richard Armitage and Andrew Lincoln. I think it's about to finally get a US release this year, as a prequel of sorts. The latter series (paid for by Cinemax, I believe) have indeed been much more ridiculous, but they just have a 'tits 'n' guns' quota to fill; story takes a back seat.

I'd say finish Utopia, then give either This is England, Dead Set or Black Mirror a go.

&gt;&gt;It is? Can you link to the announcement that has it?

&gt;https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2013/sleepwalking-into-censorship[1]

That's not a government announcement. In fact if you actually read it you'll see it says:

&gt; EDIT NOTE: the category examples are based on current mobile configurations and broad indications from ISPs

So if there was a government announcement with a list why would the ORG need to compile an example list from bits of information from ISPs.

Also no where in the article does the ORG imply the government has created a list so I'm not sure where you got that idea.

In fact [smaller ISPs have complained](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/broadband/383176/smaller-isps-refuse-camerons-calls-for-porn-filters) about the **lack** of guidance from the government:

&gt;""For smaller ISPs, introducing a filtering system, either by creating one themselves, or purchasing equipment to carry it out, will be very costly as time and money is diverted from usual priorities,"" said Tim O'Donovan, ICUK director. ""The government must come up with a clearer strategy and support smaller, and indeed, all ISPs if it wants to realistically roll out this programme by October.""

&gt; ""ISPs are being expected to act as judge and jury, though the government has failed to give a clear enough picture of what should be blocked and how,"" he added.

....

&gt; It's a slippery slope 

Ahh, of course a slippery slope. That useful crutch to lean on when you don't have the facts with which to make a rational argument.

&gt; it's obvious they dont give a flying fuck about porn or child abuse they would bolster the police if they did,

How would bolstering the police stop kids looking at porn on the internet? Please enlighten me.

&gt; it's about control they already spy on everything you do on-line ttats not even up for debate any more we know that

And how are they controlling us with a filter you can switch off that uses a list that they don't control?

I also think you have an interesting take on what 'hypocrisy' means. 

If a private school does something wrong, can I make no mention of that at all if I am privately educated? If a newspaper's editor is privately educated, can that paper publish no article critical of private education without being a hypocrite of the highest order? If *I'm* privately educated, but then choose to *send my kids* to a comprehensive school, does the stain of hypocrisy lie forever upon me? If I'm a euro-sceptic, am I banned from taking holidays in France?  
 
According to you and your sources, the answer seems to be yes – if you've benefited from something in some way, however small or tangential, *you lose your right to criticise that thing at any level*.

But if everyone did this, if no government minister spoke out against something one of their comrades had done, if no-one who received a paycheck from Company X ever blew the whistle on them, if everyone stuck with their family even when their family were up to no good, don't you think the result would be a culture of tight-lipped silence where nothing ever got said or done against corruption and immorality? Where giving someone a helping hand effectively buys you their silence on your misdeeds? Who is pure enough to speak? 

I suppose what I'm trying to work out is why, even though elsewhere I've criticised privileged leftists for not being open about their position (ususally on cultural topics like music), and even though that's *kind of* what you're doing here, your sensibility strikes me as so different. 

I don't know your full position, and I won't try to mind-read, but you and your blogs there seem *outraged* that anyone would try to criticise the banks, the tax evaders, and the private schools. They *must* be hypocrites and liars!

Hi!

I'll cover London first before the rest of UK as you might want to use it as your port before travelling Great Britain. We've got some cool Doctor Who stuff here (Not as much as you might think though). 

* [There's the Who Shop](http://thewhoshop.com/) dedicated to Doctor Who merch. Closest tube station is Upton Park, its a little out the way of Central London going toward West London along the District and Metropolitan lines but could be worth the tube ride over. Upton Park is a bit of a shit hole though.

* [Otherwise, I'd highly recommend Forbidden Planet!](https://forbiddenplanet.com/) Much more Central London close to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station, it's a cult mega store with a really great doctor who section and other various Doctor Who books and comics in the comics section downstairs. I was there earlier today and they had some new giant vinyls toys in. Definitely worth a pop in, be on the look out for signings! Its also between Oxford Street and Covent Garden so general sight seeing/shopping opportunities there.

* [There's also Hamley's](http://www.hamleys.com/) thats on Regents Street, closest Tube is Oxford Circus but thats more of a toy shop than a Cult Store (stick to Forbidden Planet)

* [How about an actual Tardis? There's a Blue Police Box by Earls Court Tube Station](http://i1.cdnds.net/13/11/618x370/odd-police-box.jpg) which is always a laugh to go see, it's not far out the way, quick tube ride. (If you're going to be travelling by tube a lot, tube fares rack up so get an all day travel card or something, but walking is sometimes a good option too with only the occasion tube jaunt if needed).

* David Tennant is usually doing a bit of theartre (he's doing something right now) so see if he's doing anything in June and go watch the man behind the 10th Doctor!

* Dotted around London and parts of the country are various museums dedicated to Romans and The 1st and 2nd War, notable settings from Doctor Who stories, I'll get back to you with links to those if I find really good ones.

You could also easily visit various parts of London which have been featured in Doctor Who. I'll recommend the more popular places: 

* Trafalgar Square and The National Gallery which is free to get into from the recent 50th special. Go see where UNIT landed the Tardis and take the steps the Doctor took up to the Gallery.

* A short walk down the road is The Houses of Parliament where the Slitheen crashed a space ship into Big Ben and near by is a statue of Winston Churchill, friend of the Doctor! Across the river is the London Eye (another fun thing to do) where 9 discovered it was the Autons transmitter and The Southbank where 11 and Clara materialised the next morning. 
You'll also pass Downing Street where Harriet Jones governed as Prime Minister! (Pro tip: theres also the Namco Funscape before you reach the London Eye, which is a pretty neat arcade. We used to have a much better one in Piccadilly Circus but it closed down so reward your London trekking with some video games) 

* [Why not check out the Globe Theatre](http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/) where 10 and Shakespeare defeated the Carrionites? That ones close to Southwark, the Tate Modern and the City of London for more sight seeing.

* [And in the City of London you've got The Shard!](http://www.theviewfromtheshard.com/) where 11 drove a Spoonhead up with his Anti-Grav Motorcycle. You can get tickets to go visit the top!

* [And don't forget the Tower of London](http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/) where UNIT are based!

-----------

So since you're not just coming to England, your visas should cover the whole United Kingdom. As a UK citizen, I have no idea what it's like for tourists coming here so just check with your travel agent you are able to freely visit the countries that make up Britain, since you don't want to go to Ireland (I don't blame you, I'm half Irish and even I don't like going over there). 

I imagine typical Visas would cover the whole of UK, so yay! You get to pretend you're the Common Wealth and traverse all the Queens fine land:P

Trains would obviously be the your best mode of transport which is why I said London would be your best place to make base camp as you can catch a train to almost anywhere else from one of our many fine train stations. Buses and coaches would take way too long and you don't want to drive on our shitty roads.

* There's nothing much Doctor Who related that I know of up in Scotland but if you fancied visiting as part of your trip, just bear in mind train tickets can be kinda pricy depending on peak times and it may be worth staying over night and training it back the next morning. You probably don't want a 3 hour train ride at the end of the day. [East Coast Trains to Scotland from Kings Cross](http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/)

* [Stone Henge is also somewhere neat to visit, where 11 and company uncovered the Pandorica, so if you fancied a day trip out of the city to Wiltshire, go see and our awesome history!](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/stonehenge/) Probably coach it to that one I don't know how accessible it is by train.

* Now Cardiff, Wales is what you want if you want an awesome Doctor Who Day surpise outside of London. Filming location for multiple episodes of Doctor Who and Torchwood (see if you can find the Torchwood Hub!) but also home to the [Doctor Who Experience!](http://www.doctorwhoexperience.com/) Definitely book tickets in advance for that one as well as train tickets to [Cardiff!](https://www.thetrainline.com/Train-Times/london-paddington-to-cardiff-central) Those trains are from Paddington, I think. The Doctor Who Experince was in London for a bit but has since moved to Cardiff. This is probably the best thing you could ask for, for awesome Doctor Who fun times so be sure you book all your Experience and Train tickets well in advance!

But yeah, that's all I can think of, hope you guys have a great trip! If you go to either one of Scotland or Wales, you've already travelled more of Britain than I ever have, haha!

They spent more money than they should have building the new West and East stands at the Lane. And then they bought quite a few new players to replenish an aging squad (approaching £10 million).

The chairman was funding matters via property development, and when the market fell through in the late 80s the club had no money left and were £20 million in debt.

That was how.

Next thing:

&gt;**...you should have...given him the players and back-room staff he wanted**

Other than Moutinho, what other players and back-room staff did Villas-Boas want that he couldn't (plausibly) get?

He wanted Baldini and some new medical staff - he got both.

He wanted Lamela and Paulinho - he got them. And he got a striker he was content with in Soldado.

If he's talking about Bale, then that's not a valid point as Bale was either going to leave or was going to sit and mope for a season.

I am fundamentally opposed to giving people power just because of their station in society.

Of course the problem with reforming the lords that way is a) turnouts in all elections are pitiful and declining, b) the political parties will stuff the election lists with hacks as they always do and c) it took Blairs huge mandate in the late 90s just to cut them down to 92 aristocrats.

true,Mr_Jpg,flair5,,"***Team***

Lloris

Walker - Chiriches - Kaboul - Fryers

Capoue - Holtby

Lamela - Dembele - Chadli

Kane

---------------
***Logic***

**Goalkeeper** 

Because Lloris is Lloris.

**Defence** 

Assuming Chiriches and Kaboul are fit (as they appear to be in training) these guys will be good. West Ham do fantastic at playing past the defenders for an attack, so these two should be good to stop that. 

Fryers v Rose, I'm not too sure about. I chose Fryers, but Rose may be better given the speed that West Ham have available on the counter.

**Midfield**

Capoue has been playing outstanding defensively, and whilst it may not be our obvious problem, it's still a problem that will come up even more with a vastly changed team.

Lamela and Chadli were chosen due to their attacking threat, and willingness to defend. Lennon and Townsend don't really do any defending, where as these guys have shown they're willing to get back and help.

Holtby was chosen due to the fact that he doesn't understand the concept of giving up, in a team of players who are most likely upset and unsettled, we need someone who'll put the work in regardless. 

Dembele was chosen as I feel he's the guy you want going up against a strong defence. Sig and Eriksen are good for defence splitting passes and brilliant crosses, but that's not something we can use to our advantage. Dembele however, has the strength and the dribbling to break through a defence and setup/score a good goal.

**Striker**

I really wasn't sure with this one. On his day Defoe is unstoppable, but his ""days"" are becoming scarce. 

Soldado is struggling with both confidence and language, so I didn't feel putting him in after a demoralizing game like that would do him any good.

I have no real idea if Ade is fit or not, so I left him out incase. If he was fit, I'd probably go for him.

I went for Kane in order to fix a problem we're going to have a lot of for a few weeks - motivation. In the cup match against Hull, we had a team of players who didn't look like they gave two shits about what happened. But when Kane came on, he didn't stop trying to make a difference, and that lead to not only the team being motivated because of it, but a goal that lead to a goal and winning a penalty shoot-out.",0,1387312142,null,0,1387313706,0,ce43wco,t3_1t416m,t1_ce43wco,t3_1t416m,null,1428091581,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

We had lots of traveller liaison people from the council visit because they were so close to our house they could see in the windows which we weren't massive fans of. 

When they left, the previously untouched and beautiful country field was in a terrible state, car doors (really!) and bin bags everywhere as well as destroying the trees and hedges which they'd hacked down for no discernible reason.

The council people who came to inspect the site after they went discovered that the travellers also shat in a hole in the ground which wasn't brilliant as we are off mains water (again, isolated) and get our water from an aquifer. Not that the travellers should have known, but it's just a bit unconventional.

* Schurrle has been great, but has made the wrong decision at the most important times. Passes when he can score with his right, shoots with his left from outside the box.

* Willian is so frustrating to watch. Looks world class sometimes, and then misses the easiest ball or dribbles straight into a defender.

&gt;I think all the players in the changing room really wanted things to work out for Andre. From day one that he came to the club, open door policy, very good communication with the players. None of us were happy to see him go.
We still have to continue to have a very good team spirit, which I know we will. We have a lot of quality in the changing room. I'm sure the board are going to be hiring a very good manager to take us forward, who the players will all be behind again, because, at the end of the day, we are employed by Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, not by the manager they're bringing in.

So at the moment all the deals you can see on each main city page are currently active, but they are just displayed in any order at the moment (I believe the order is just in order of when they were added).

What we're working on at the moment is displaying them by how long they have left to run, so if a deal has 10 minutes before it expires and another deal has an hour, then the deal that expires first will be displayed first and that will carry on down the full list.

We're also putting a filter on the site soon so you'll be able to view deals for a certain day or time.  I'm hoping it will become more useful with the filter, if you wanted to see what deals were on Friday at 8pm there's currently no way of doing that unless you view the site at 8pm on Friday - or unless you were going to view each venue and read them all - so the filter will make that easier.

He was a proven PL goal scorer when we sold him, and its Chelsea's fault that they haven't gotten the performance they would have hoped for out of him.

Also, I think if you go back and check JWH's quotes, we were willing to sell Torres for whatever Carroll cost +15M, and it was really a negotiation between Newcastle and Chelsea, with us as the middle man.  If Newcastle would have sold Carroll for 20, we would have sold Torres for 35.

&gt;When did I say that 2 strikers = double the shots on target?

You didn't but I've seen plenty of people saying that they want two up top, like that's the solution to all of our problems. We've had two up front at times early on and it never seemed to work for us. Especially with strikers, you need to have the right combination. 

&gt;You could just as easily make the argument that putting two up top would not only increase our chances of scoring but free up some of the congestion we've had in midfield. Perhaps the lack of service from midfield has to do with not having enough options in the box.

Congestion?  Since when was that an issue?  It resulted in us generally have a decisive possession and passing rate.  This was what AVB wanted, and it's what was put out by the players. If we were slow and unwilling to press the ball forward, that seems to be more a byproduct of how the team was directed to play, not that it was congested.

I personally think that the problem with service was that it was not consistent enough, and we primarily relied on crosses. Very rarely did we ever make quick passes cutting into the box, and when we did we looked very threatening. We relied far too much on controlling possession, spreading the defense horizontally across the pitch and delivering crosses from the flanks. We have the speed, creativity, and passing to be able to continually drive and pry open a defense with consistent, fast-paced attack and we almost never accomplished that this season.

&gt;I'm going to have a nice laugh tomorrow if Sherwood goes with two up top and we score a bunch of goals.

I thought Luiz and Cahill performed well, and Schwarzer did well between the posts - two goals aside. We didn't concede from set pieces, so I guess that's improving.

I thought Schurrle should have shot more when he opted to pass, but what can you do? 

The lack of a number 9 is starting to stick out like a sore thumb now. Games like these are when world class forwards really tip the scales in your favour, and we're coming up short in that department, but I'm not pessimistic about it - I'm confident we can (and continue to) make up for it elsewhere through guys like Hazard, Schurrle, Oscar, Mata, Lampard, and our big defenders on corners.

Sort of lukewarm on De Bruyne. Expected him to show up for the full 90, not just the second half and ET. He showed some of that talent in the latter part, but it wasn't what I think we've all been expecting from him. I expect him to return to riding the pine until we play Derby in the new year.

We have a team full of household name-world class players but in the end they cannot link up to put the ball in the net. I long for the day where we stop resorting to long balls down field. Some positives I thought were:

* Ashley Cole played amazing in my eyes. Much better than I anticipated after such a long spell not playing.
* Essien was one cool cucumber there for awhile. Well played balls and brought in experience. Much better than his last couple performances. Up until that almost penalty foul in extra time.
* Willian is a fuckin machine. Pace for the entire match.

Also can someone explain to me what Cahill was thinking going all the way into the net on that goal? I think even though the ball went through Luiz's legs; if Cahill would have stopped on the line he could have had a chance of keeping it out.

Willian did what he always does, putting in a good shift, running all over the place without doing much in the final third. If we wanted workrate we should have picked a youngster from our reserves, gave him a bumpy wage increase and watch him run till his feet bleed instead of splashing out on Willian. I'm pretty sure KDB created the same amount of chances Willian did and KDB actually had more shots and generally contributed more to the attack than Willian did. Makes me wonder if KDB was running around like Willian if people would still be saying he had a bad game. And this is my point, people are too impressed by his workrate and ignore everything else. 

I don't think Willian had a great game, I think he did well to keep going but nothing outstanding by any means and this is mainly because his attacking play isn't good enough. He's got all the ability in the world to take on the whole team if he wanted but he chooses not to, he does some turns and stepovers, turns and passes the ball sideways or backwards. His final ball needs a lot of work, it's either too heavy or it fails to beat the defender. I appreciate the intent when he played that pass to Schurrle but he put too much on it. Passes like that are a piece of cake to Oscar, Mata, etc. For the majority of the second half he watched the attacking play go pass him and that's because he wasn't in the right places, he spent more time near our half than theirs. I thought we had switched to 3 in midfield or something. 

Speaking of midfield, that's where he should be playing based on his performances so far. If he was a midfielder he would be amazing but he's not, he's an attacking mid and so far he's lacking. He's not shown anything to suggest he's good enough at attacking mid to be taking game time off Schurrle or KDB for that matter.

Also there were some fucking shockingly shite attempts at goal. 

Sunderland weren't even playing well! Gotta hand it to them though.

I think these past matches have gone to show just how much we need a ~~world class~~ top top CM/CDM who can distribute and defend at a high tempo, who (fingers crossed) fits in well with Mikel's/Ramires' playing style, so our attackers can shirk some defensive responsibilities. How are we supposed to bring about successful attacks when our front band of three are trying to play in every fucking position. Every game I watch, they try (in vain) to dribble past a whole team because our midfield offers a pathetically shit amount of support. Why are our attackers trying to play in every position? Because Lampard is playing alongside Mikel. A Lampard - Mikel midfield pivot is absolutely terrible, they do NOT play to each others strengths. Mikel's role is to reinforce and stabilise the midfield tempo but we have no fucking rhythm in the middle of the pitch because Lampard is busy doing his own thing. Why is he doing his own thing? Because he's not a fucking CDM for christ's sake. He's barely even a CM at this stage, and don't even get me started on Essien; he's well and truly past it; far too much of a liability. Ramires is our only hope at this point, and if Ramires gets injured we are well, and truly, royally, fucked. Hopefully the rumours about Fredy Guarin amount to something.

- Wake up at 6am. It's fucking christmas! Wake parents up with this glorious news
- Slink back to bed, dejected and with a slightly larger vocabulary of swear words
- Spot the stocking at the end of the bed. Savage wrapping paper like it's a Zebra in the Serengeti. Spend the next hour munching on chocolate coins and smarties
- 7:30am arrives. Parents abandon any hope of a lie-in and grudgingly go downstairs with me, at this point about to suffer a coronary from excitement 
- Not allowed to touch presents under tree until breakfast of bacon and tea is prepared. This is paramount to torture but remain strong
- Breakfast is inhaled. Dad starts distributing presents
- next hour or so is a euphoric frenzy of paper, half-read gift tags and awesome presents.
- Get to that big box. note smug looks on parents faces
- **MOTHER FUCKING NINTENDO SIXTY FOUR**
- Practically shit self with excitement. 
- Read every manual and leaflet cover to cover while mum returns to the kitchen to shout at dad for the most minor of infractions.
- Start on the pringles
- LUNCH TIME. Turkey, Gammon, pigs-in-blankets, spuds, yorkshires (why the fuck not, its christmas), brussels, stuffing
- body goes into shock from food intake. Adjust paper crown and retire to front room for queens speech. 
- pester relentlessly for help setting up the N64.
- spend the rest of the day and most of the night playing 
- dragged away from console heaven for more food and generic, late night, completely un-Christmas related film. i think it was either Escape from New York or Jaws.
- Collapse back into bed

BONUS ROUND - Nan and Grandad (RIP) come round boxing day with literally bags full of presents.

true,HugePilchard,null,null,"&gt; How long have you had it?

About two and a half years, now.

&gt;    Has the knowledge learned on the course helped your work?

In my case, probably not. I did the course between jobs; I'd previously done a lot of work in a team manager role within PRINCE2 projects, and so I thought it would be a useful thing to have under my belt. As it turned out, I ended up heading into IT service management, and so the ITIL qualification that I'd already got prior to doing PRINCE2 turned out to be a lot more useful.

&gt;    Has having the qualification helped your career?

Scarcely, but that said I'll probably do the recertification in a couple of years time regardless. As long as I see potential benefit in having it on my CV, I'll keep it up to date.

&gt;    In which industry do you work?

When I was actually doing PRINCE2 type stuff, I was in telecoms. Now I'm not using it, I'm in managed IT services.

&gt;    Did you pay for it or did an employer?

An ex-employer paid for it as part of a redundancy package.

&gt;    How long did it take to get?

Five days, in which time I got both Foundation and Practitioner done.

&gt;    In your opinion is it worth doing one of the many advertised 5-day courses?

I think so, but then again I find that's the environment I learn best in.

&gt;    Do you have any recommendations for training providers?

I did mine with the Knowledge Academy; it was alright, but I guess I can't really compare with other providers for PRINCE2. Having done several other courses (but not PRINCE2) with QA, I think I'd rather go with them for most things.

&gt;    What else should I know?

A PRINCE2 qualification does not a project manager make. If you think you're going to walk straight out of your course and into a PM job, think again.",0,1387323527,null,0,false,0,ce492mm,t3_1t2p0l,t1_ce492mm,t3_1t2p0l,null,1428089096,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Large swaths of the Earth's population being murdered around her by demented alien balls.  The Master about to start a war with the Universe.  That is horrific.

She didn't know if her family was dead or alive.  Jack was imprisoned.  No TARDIS.   Just a vortex manipulator and a key with a perception filter.  And her faith in the Doctor.

true,DubiumGuy,null,null,"&gt;can we go back to considering a sensible energy policy now then?

A sensible energy policy has to include massive investment in nuclear, solar and wave energy (wind is too unpredictable to be too heavily relied upon).  However, considering the fact that it may be 20 years or so before any nuclear power stations are built and operational, there needs to be a stop gap energy policy in place to supplement the ever increasing demand on our already overstretched power grid.  With shale gas being a fossil fuel, it may not be an ideal solution, but may also provide the answer for that shortfall.   

I have no other concerns than the increase in green house gasses as the chemicals the Environment agency have approved for Hydraulic fracturing are all harmless except for possibly polyacrylamide which is harmless by itself, but can degrade under very specific conditions into a toxin, but even the tiny 0.04% amount used it poses no threat.  Secondly, the shale gas deposits in the country are of a depth where drinking water contamination is not possible.  It rains enough in this country for the majority of our drinking water supplies from over ground reservoirs, and any aquifers used for used for our water supply are at a depth that's not even remotely close to the vast depths needed to drill for shale gas.",0,1387327794,null,0,false,0,ce4aymk,t3_1t3sxw,t1_ce4aymk,t1_ce42kc2,null,1428088217,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If we get 5-6 points from the next 3 games we go into January at most 6 points of the top having played everybody and the tougher games away. This leaves us in a very unexpected place of actually having a good chance of taking a shot at the league. We also have to look at the possibility of losing our best player in the summer. Finally we don't have as many games to worry about as others.

So this leaves us in a spot where we can capatilise if we invest in January. Think about that, LFC going for the title again. It improves our chances of keeping Suarez, getting new players in and even if we dont get over the finish line leaves us in a great position to make a better push next year.

This is the year to go for it. This is the best opportunity we get. This is our year.

true,blackhole1138,null,null,"I worked Sainsbury's last year and I'm working a (thankfully) Sainsbury's Local this year. Here's a list of a few things that might help if you work there or are planning on shopping there.

* Our delivery comes in overnight. However the couple of days leading up to Christmas, the delivery almost triples in size. We had such a big meat delivery last year that we had to work it straight off the lorry as it wouldn't fit in the chiller. 

* Expect the meat aisle to be absolutely manic. People are going to be swarming over the turkeys and other birds, the sausages, bacon, ready made stuffing and just about anything else they think will be tasty. There will be meat rollers/roll pallets pretty much cutting the aisle in two down the middle, meaning it'll be single file on either side.

* If you want to go down the meat aisle, I suggest leaving your trolley at one end and walking down. Otherwise you'll block the way for the customers and the staff trying to fill the shelves.

* Watch your turkey! They're in such high demand, people aren't above taking them from other people's trolleys. And if that happens, which it did last year, there's nothing I (as an assistant and nothing more) can do about it. You can tell security but if we don't have any more turkeys out the back there's nothing I can do. Please don't yell at me because of some other douche!

* Turkeys absolutely don't get reduced on Christmas Eve. There's no point looking for one reduced because it doesn't happen. Head Office send down memos for Boxing Day if (and that's a very big IF) there are any left. They sell so well there's almost never any.

* No, I don't know what they sell at other supermarkets in the area. I also don't know what time they shut. Sure, you can tell me all about how cheap/better quality you think other stores and their products are, but I'll be so busy it'll be tough for me to actually care.

* If I help you with something, once I've said my farewell, that's it for me. Normally I'd love to stick around and chat but on Christmas Eve, I'll be so busy I just don't have the time. Don't think I'm being rude if I don't want to hear your life story.

* If I'm doing Price Reductions, please don't snatch. Feel free to take the things off the cart once they've gone down in price, but don't rip them from my hands. And no, I'm not allowed to reduce things that you've had in your trolley for the past half an hour. Even when it's Christmas.

* If you want to fight over a product you'll be thrown out and there will be no Christmas shopping for either of the parties involved.

* Using children to guilt trip me for reduced items/customer orders is NOT cool. I'm speaking from experience there. 

* If you're a worker, TAKE YOUR BREAK. I can't stress that enough. Last thing we need is someone collapsing from exhaustion. I don't care if the armies of customers want this and that, if it's lunch time YOU GO TO LUNCH. 

* I HATE the Christmas music playing. I've been working with it for a month and it's fucking dreadful. Don't expect me to be cheery about it or join in for a sing-song. 

* Most of the staff are going to be stressed beyond belief. But the last thing I need is people yelling at me over stupid stuff. It's bad enough when it's not Christmas.

* We had a food ordering service open for 3 months. That's why that certain customer had a turkey given to them from out the back. If you didn't order one, be it on your own head when you come in ten minutes before we shut and we're cleared out. 

* You can't get every product everywhere. They don't stock every single thing at every store. And it's no good telling me that you got it at so-and-so branch. That won't make it appear.

* If you're a customer, STAY OUT OF THE BACK. That's my territory and you're not allowed back there. Period.

* When it gets to the last hour, if it's not on the shelf, we're out of stock. I didn't mean to ruin Christmas, but it's your own damn fault. Don't take it out on my workers!

* When we're closed, WE ARE CLOSED. We all want to go home and enjoy Christmas. You shouldn't have left your shopping so late. 

And finally, don't treat my staff badly. Spare a thought for them, and speak to them how you would want to be spoken to. It's a stressful time of year, but too many people hate Christmas after working retail. Myself included. It's not an easy job. But once it's over there's a whole year again till another Christmas, so love it or not, enjoy it while it lasts.",0,1387330002,null,0,1387374703,0,ce4bxwd,t3_1t2qsb,t1_ce4bxwd,t3_1t2qsb,null,1428087758,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,chuckletrousers,null,null,"Well written and he brings up some valid points, but it seems like he wanted that to conclude that it was a poor decision. There are not many managers for teams of any stature that could suffer defeats in that fashion and not be under very close scrutiny for sacking. The fact that every game has looked more lacklustre than the last doesn't help (which I do think is one of the good points he makes... and then sort of ignores). 

He also says that information is coming out that it was knee-jerk, but almost just as many sources seem to be saying that AVB had alienated much of the staff and senior management. 

He also points out that the losses were so huge because AVB made offensive decisions to chase the game, which is the correct decision. I agree. The author then ignores why Spurs were chasing the game in the first place: poor performances and, again he even acknowledges this, bad tactics where players were forced into doing things they're unsuited for (*cough* Dawson *cough*). 

A good overview but I think the conclusions he makes aren't entirely justified. Sure Spurs had a record points total last year, but that is AVB's doing in so much as Bale becoming the best player in the league has anything to do with him. Some perhaps, but that papered over other issues.

I'm still torn on the issue, but the way I thought about it was: Are Spurs' as a team not playing well and anything AVB did made that more positive? Or is it that the players are good enough that despite some of AVB's odd tactical decisions, games were still being won? At the heart I guess the question would be: If a manager actually just picked the best 11 and said ""play however suits you"" ('Arry) would the team look this bad and been raped this brutally twice? I'm inclined to say ""absolutely not""; I think we're playing worse than the sum of our parts. That *does* come down to the manager.

That being said, I think we all need to remember that we were talking about what good form Torres was on before he got injured most recently. Our defense will correct those mistakes over time. The only thing I see remaining a problem area is the back two of the midfield.

Beyond that, to your point about our poor performances: Spurs have gotten worse as the season had gone on, not better. When we beat then, they were still the ""best"" defense in the league. United have also gotten worse since the beginning of the season. You're right about City's away form, but that doesn't erase our performance.

Used to work for MVC (the Woolworth's version of HMV), and while they had a rule that we'd have to do regular hours New Year's Day no matter what, after the first year, and us getting our first customer at 2pm, five hours after the doors opened, our manager realised it was bullshit, pulling people in to work after the biggest drinking night of the year, especially given that you're generally employing 16-30ish people in these jobs.

We still had to do it, but he'd agree that so long as one of us made it for 9, so he could open the doors and get the tills on and registered so head office saw no problems, the others just had to get in for 10, then at 10, he'd send one of us to McD's to get breakfast for everyone and we'd stick one of the new release DVDs on and watch that til midday.

I think he thought 'fuck it, if head office truly don't give a shit about opening to no customers, I'm not going to run my staff into the ground over it. :)

I figure what's going to happen, they can't fire anyone, MVC went under years ago :)

I used to work in retail and had some of the best years of my life with the people I worked with. I guess my point is that a retail worker complaining they're going to have a busy couple of weeks with a 'Woe, is me' reddit post is really silly. OP is going to have a hectic couple of weeks, while I running a business and taking up a part time job to supplement income is having a quiet time in both; relaxing yes, but it means I can barely afford a Christmas present for my wife!

And I hate that, REALLY hate that! I would rather be busy earning money so I can buy nice things like OP can. But I put things in perspective. I would rather be working than not, but I'd rather be where I am than in any one of the situations above. Sometimes things aren't as bad as they seem. In fact even when I can't afford bills, I'm still better off than way more than half of the world! And that's eye opening, to think of the things people have to deal with and that my petty woes mean nothing.

My secret is that I spent a Christmas homeless and friendless once, the following new years I spent squatting in a cold flat without gas. I had to leave that flat every day early because the owner knew I was there and came round regularly to kill me. I was never in when he did!

I was happy from day one with FSG (even though I'm a Jays fan). These guys gave the soxs what no one else could, and have done it more than once. At the start of this past season no one gave the Sox a chance, yet now another pennant hangs in Fenway. 

Fenway remains! Yankee stadium is gone, but Fenway remains... and we are still in Anfield. I'm not sure if they would come out and say they value history over ticket sales, but it seems they do. 

Baseball is a special game. It takes a long time to build good players. A deep and well planned scouting, training, and management system. You can't rush baseball, it will bite you if you try. Owners that understand that game are the kind of owners I like owning my football club. This is anti-abramovich.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Used sensibly and responsibly a Credit card is a very valuable tool.

I will repeat this: **Set up the card when you take it out so that the WHOLE BALANCE is paid in full at the end of EVERY month - just after pay day.**

When can you use a credit card to your advantage?

* Online Purchases - Fraud protection, plus if it is used for purchases you did not make, then you can dispute these with the bank before the money comes out of your account, and it becomes their problem and not yours

* Warranty - Under the consumer credit act, the credit card provider is jointly liable with the retailer and the good must be fit for purpose. If it breaks, or never turns up in the post, it's their problem not yours and they will refund you.

* Additional purchase protection - see small print, but some cards offer perks such as free insurance on any purchases for a year.

* Large purchases - peace of mind. Say you want a car. You go in and put £1000 deposit on your debit card. The company folds overnight, and you don't get your car. Oh dear, you've lost £1000 and are at the back of a very long queue to get your money back (you never will). But if you'd put that deposit on Credit card, you WILL get your money back, and it will be for the Credit card company to recover their losses from the liquidators. Even better, if you pay £1000 (or less!) on credit card, and the rest however, cash, cheque, transfer... then the Credit card company jointly is liable for the whole amount. Incredible.

* A Short interest free period - For large items, it can be hard to put all the money in one place and have it sitting about ready to make a purchase. Instead, you can buy it on credit card and you will not be charged interest for between 31 and 54 days, generally, depending on the time of the month you make the purchase. This gives you time to shunt money about (and earn a bit more interest on it) and then pay off the bill at your leisure. I've used a credit card in the manner to buy Cars (£6k), Kitchens (£5k) and various other large expenses.

* Foreign travel - Credit cards are often a good choice for foreign transactions. They're widely accepted and can offer preferential rates on purchases.

* Cash back - Depending on card you can earn 0.5%-1% cash back on the amount you spend on it. This can add up.

* Deferring purchases in order to maximise interest. - *Advanced level only!* You get paid on first of Jan. Your wages sit in your account, and you do your shopping on credit card. ON first of Feb, you get paid again. You pay off your credit card balance, paying no interest, and do the same again. Your account balance averages your wage input. Contrast this with living out of your current account: Your balance drops over time, meaning you earn less interest. Note that most current accounts earn paltry interest rates, so you have to get clever doing this.

* Stoozing - *VERY ADVANCED LEVEL CREDIT CARD USE ONLY!* This requires very careful planning to avoid fees, and only you can decide if you have the financial nouse to do it. You get a credit card that offers say 0% interest on balances for 12 months. It has a £2k limit. You take that £2k out of the card, and put it in a high return account (5%). At the end of the year, you have earned £100 interest, and pay off the credit card with the capital you borrowed in the first place. Risky practice, some people get away with it though. Just don't forget or be disorganised or fees will wipe out earnings.

* Emergencies - Sometimes, it's nice to have the security of knowing that if you need to bust out to get a flight, repatriate yourself from a holiday gone horribly wrong or pay a large car repair bill, that you have the means to do so in your pocket, and you can sort out the issues later.

* Business expenses - Work for some douchey company who expect you to pay business expenses out of pocket and then reimburse you? At least if you put them on credit card, you're not actually losing out on your own wages or bank balance whilst this happens.

**Things NEVER to do with your Credit Card**

* Withdraw cash - Never, ever, ever do this. Not only will cash withdrawals attract a  higher interest rate (Often 20% p/a or more) but they are charged from day one, with no grace interest free period.

* Fail to read and understand the terms and conditions - That's how they get ya!

* Spend more than you can afford to pay off that month - (Certain very limited exceptions apply)

* Fail to make a payment - The fees and interest add up and compound.

* Fail to pay off the full balance monthly - The interest stacks up, you think ""ah, sod it, I'll deal with that later,"", your interest adds up, and before you know it your £700 spur of the moment TV purchase has cost you £1500 over 2 years. It is NOT your money, it is NOT yours to spend, you are borrowing it.

* Only make ""minimum payments"". There is a certain amount, usually £5 or 5% of balance, whichever is more, which is termed a ""Minimum payment"". If you pay this each month, they don't add fees, and they leave you alone. You can stick your head in the sand and pretend like you don't have this large debt hanging over you for the sake of £50 a month. The problem is that you are most likely only just covering the interest they charge, and not paying off the borrowed money at all. In some cases, you may not even be paying off the interest in full, so the debt will grow month on month. I believe the regulations have now changed to stop this. Anyway... don't just make minimum payments. It's a guaranteed way to end up in much worse debt than you thought.

* Take out multiple cards (until you know what you're doing with them). You shouldn't carry a balance on your cards, you shouldn't carry more than one credit card unless there is very specific reason to do so. Make do with one until you've got your head around it, and have proven yourself responsible with it.


I'd advocate getting a credit card so long as you have a regular income. They're really useful. I've had one for 11+ years and have never paid a penny in fees or interest. It has saved me a lot of money and a lot of grief over the years in numerous situations from getting money back on faulty products, to overseas spending with no commission and favourable exchange rates, to buying large purchases in one hit.


*Glossary:*

* CCJ - Country court judgement. If you get in debt, and fail to pay it off, and ignore letters, eventually a county court may make a judgement to write off that debt. However, with A CCJ on file, you'll have a very, very hard time getting credit.  Even the pay day lenders won't touch you. Do not do this.

* APR: Annual Percentage rate. I led you £1000 at 10% APR. You have to pay me back £1100 at the end of the year. If you don't pay, and I keep the rate the same, you have to pay me £1210 at year 2. Many credit cards have 12-20% Apr. If you will only ever pay it off monthly in full, it's not important. If you will carry a (negative) balance, it's of vital importance. Like I say, I've never been concerned about APR, I think my card has 17.9% but it's of no consequence. What matters to me is no foreign transaction fees, decent exchange rate, and 0.5% cash back. When Pay day loan companies are forced to disclose a ""1700%"" APR, it's a bit misleading, because they might be lending £200 today with the expectation of you paying back £230 in 3 days time. Yes, the APR is horrific, but it's a very short term loan. Don't ever got to a pay day loan company, BTW.

* Credit ratings? In the UK, it's of little consequence, TBH. So long as you don't fuck things up, you'll be fine. If you have a contract mobile, and pay it, a credit card, and pay it, don't go into debt, don't miss payments if you do get a loan or mortgage, you'll be golden.

You're right. Because whatever measures we as individuals take, you've got 1.3 billion people in China, and a further 1.2 billion people in India who are currently going through effectively the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, and pumping out more smog, toxins and greenhouse gases than the rest of the world combined.

And it's a tough problem to solve. Do we ask those countries not to go through the same progression from 3rd world to 1st world as we have done already? Do we tell them, sorry you can't enjoy the same freedoms as we had, you'll just have to stay at a 1900s level of progress?

Whatever *any* individual does in say UK or the US, it won't make a damn of difference on the grand scale of things. And while you might claim it's just an excuse not to do anything, when doing something is futile anyway what exactly is the point?

&gt; Frankly, a 2-4 degree rise will change all our lives beyond recognition.

These doom and gloom predictions fail to take into account humans (indeed all animals) instinct for survival. A few thousand years ago, the Sahara was a lush green fertile land ... now it's a desert. People relocated to better places, and got on with life.

Myself I experienced Typhoon Ondoy back in 2009 and had to deal with 10 foot of flood water in our old house. Therefore when I built my new house, I raised it up at least 5 feet to hopefully mitigate the effects a future event. People adapt, people move, people don't just raise their hands and cry ""the sky is falling"".

Sure, it'll probably mean hardship, even deaths (but then we've got too many damn people on the planet anyway). But that doesn't mean the human race is ""doomed"" ... it just means it'll be a different world our kids and grandkids live in, and they'll adapt to it just as we've been doing for thousands of years.

&gt; And the attitude you adopt now will determine whether they look back at you in gratitude or with something approaching contempt or disbelief.

Every generation blames their problems on the previous one, why should this be any different?

At the end of the day, you have to be realistic. The world is changing. But it always *has* been changing ... and we're still here, in every greater numbers.",0,1387344081,null,0,false,0,ce4hop9,t3_1t4iza,t1_ce4hop9,t1_ce48ws1,null,1428085007,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If we had seen the characters doing something, firstly, at least one of them almost certainly would have been killed off. Secondly, you would not have gotten any less of a cliffhanger. Where would you have ended? They all get married and settle down and have happy life? No, this was best - you can imagine that they go off and have lots of adventures without ever having to see them do it and get bored of it. 

I think this was the ideal ending - from the first episode of the first series the characters talked about becoming ""proper superheroes"" and they finally decided to actually do it.

true,thomasfk,lfcflame,,"I knew FSG would do well if they were given time. Call me crazy, but I'm a believer in statistics driving decisions in everything (it must be the business person inside of me), so I thought FSG would do well. While I understand its huge limitations in football compared to other sports (especially baseball), it does add value to rating teams and players.

Unlike American sports like baseball, basketball, and american football, statistics in football is still in its infancy. Companies/clubs have only just started collecting data on football matches 6-7 years ago. It would make sense that at first, they wouldn't know how the hell to collect or interpret the data they were looking at. Given time though, this data can be an excellent indicator on the quality of a player.

I think that first summer transfer of 2011 was a real shock to FSG. It basically told them that statistics in football is less useful than it is in baseball (because it is still in its infancy). But mark my words, football statistics will eventually become massive for all clubs in the future once companies/clubs figure out which stats are most important in indicating quality. The intangible, immeasurable qualities of players will never mean that stats will replace scouts, but stats will be much more important in the future.

For all we know, our transfer decisions now could still be being driven by stats and we don't even know it. Perhaps FSG has figured out which stats matter. I'm of the opinion that a company like FSG, who used measurable statistics to drive decisions in a World Series winning team, would not stick around in a sport like football if it was deemed too immeasurable and intangible.

I think the major difference between us and you guys in terms of the Bale/RVP analogy is that Arsenal had a more functional squad than we did when RVP left.  Bale wasn't just our best player, and not just a superlative finisher like RVP.  He WAS our team.  He made chances and scored goals out of nothing, and covered a multitude of sins.

Take RVP out of that one Arsenal season and replace him with a lesser player like Giroud and you still would've done pretty well.  Take Bale out of our team last year and replace him with Lamela or Townsend and there's no way we'd even make Europa League spots.

Bale was much more important to our side than I think many people - Levy and AVB included - realised.  It makes you wonder how Liverpool managed to keep Suarez and we didn't keep Bale.

For the supposed talent Chelsea has, it does not matter much who is up front. They should not be scrapping by wins. It is that simple. This has been happening all year, why are people still surprised by this? 

This squad simply are not playing well together. There is still no consistent form of attack, relying on counter attacks or individual play. How many goals have been scored by a string of passes? 

People talk about AVB being stubborn, where do you think he got that from? It is infuriating to watch players being put in positions they are not comfortable with. The Lampard discussion is just beating a dead horse. While Willian played well, he is not a playmaker. Let's see, Willian is better as a winger, KDB is better centrally, logic would dictate that's where they should be. That did not happen and it was the same situation with Mata. 

Mourinho is a smart man, at times, too smart for his own good.

By respectful I mean that they are powerful, you should respect the power of a car you're driving because it can cause huge damage and so can drugs, they can really fuck with your mind.  It is relatively easy for drugs to be used for the positive, and people usually only abuse them if there's some other underlying cause of unfulfillment in their lives too, but if you use drugs to 'make the pain go away' or to 'make you happy' or to 'help you cope' for any length of time they only make the problem worse.  Exactly the same as booze, yes, and most aren't even as bad as booze.  Also if they were legal a lot of the problems people have with them (badly cut, introduction to shady underworld) wouldn't be there.

If we could talk about drugs more openly that would help too, for example I know more than a couple of people who have been permanently damaged by overuse of Es.  I learned not too long ago that because the serotonin system that Es affect is so delicate, about 3 months is a decent interval to take them so your body can recover.  Seems like a long time but makes sense.  If we'd have known that back in the day, I think some people would be in much better shape now.

I think people should be allowed to explore that side of their existance but I am wary of, mostly, companies capitalising on people's weakness and essentially ""pushing"" drugs on people were they to become legal.  Think of the rise in gambling adverts in UK recently... gambling is another thing that can destroy lives.  It's not my bag really but I wouldn't stop people doing it but I *would* stop most of this advertising if I could.  I feel a similar way about drugs.  I'd love to be able to go into a shop and buy some Es or speed for a party, knowing it was what it said it was and that I wouldn't have to worry about being caught by the authorities but I wouldn't like to see adverts every fucking where encouraging kids to do them left right and centre, or telling us that we would be happier/more beautiful/more succesful if we took their shit.",0,1387349990,null,0,false,0,ce4jh0o,t3_1szgx0,t1_ce4jh0o,t1_ce3szqv,null,1428084173,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

At the beginning of the season, we were creating some chances, but squandering them, and holding steady on defense. Then, despite being probably the deepest team in the league, we suffered a few key injuries, and the manager was unable to cope and our defense got unlocked in obvious fashion -- and we still couldn't score. 

To make an analogy to another sport I follow, Spurs this year remind me a bit of the Denver Nuggets of the NBA last year -- we have a strong, deep group of players, but no true stars to rally around (which the article correctly points out) when the going gets tough against a big-time opponent, and a manager who -- despite probably being a great on-paper coach -- is just not able to take us to that next level. Is firing the manager going to solve the chemistry and lack-of-stars issues? Nope. Is keeping AVB going to solve those issues? Nope.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think this article does a good job of pointing out the difficulties AVB faced, but not the problems of his own making.

1.  Embarrassment IS a problem.  A huge one.  The magnitude of the worst losses we suffered completely stunted our season.  They've turned the club and the players into a laughing stock.  They've knocked the confidence of every man on the pitch.  It heightens the tension and pressure of everyone involved, making it even harder to get creative fluidity happening.

2.  More importantly, those losses weren't just one-offs or bad luck days.  They were the culmination of everything AVB was doing wrong, and all three could've been even worse.  AVB laid out a formation and tactics that simply played into Liverpool's strengths.  Had they won 8-0 (which, given two shots against the post and some good Lloris saves, they easily could've), there's no way any of the fans could complain they were hard done by.

3.  Going for goals when you're already 3-0 to City away from home is stupidity itself.  The article thinks it was brave.  It's not; it's naive.  Thinking we were somehow going to get 3 or 4 goals in a single half against City without conceding when we'd hardly scored all season is silly, especially when it requires us to play even more loosely and leave even more space than we already had.  Keeping it tight and hoping to nick a single goal to create some minor pressure is a much better plan.  Less exciting, but preventative of the total humiliation that we eventually suffered against a definitively better team.

4.  The author cites our early defensive record as being something AVB did right.  I completely disagree.  When the league started, other teams feared us.  Our acquisitions looked good, and we started the season with some confidence.  Opponents were cautious.  As the season progressed, every single team we played quickly figured us out.  Teams let us have all the possession we wanted, knowing we couldn't do jack shit with it.  They swarmed us and hit us on the counter, knowing we panicked like children and played too high a defensive line.  Plus, our goals conceded were artificially kept down by a combination of good luck, good Lloris keeping, and playing top teams who hadn't fully clicked into gear yet (an Ozil-less Arsenal still shaking from the opening day loss, and Chelsea who only got their second half game plan right).  We have looked defensively shabby all season, but it's only now that teams are starting to exploit us.

5.  Ultimately, all of these things are bad, but recoverable from.  The biggest single issue that makes me feel AVB deserved his demise is that he had no answers to any of these.  The mistakes we made against Liverpool are the exact same we made against City.  The lack of goals has plagued us all season and Soldado has never once looked threatening in the league.  We've had no progression, no learnings, no development, and are playing with no greater chemistry now than when at the start of the season when we were all strangers.

I appreciate other points of view and the article is well thought out, but I think the problems were far deeper and more troubling than letting a handful of goals in every now and then.",0,1387353820,null,0,false,0,ce4kczk,t3_1t49b8,t1_ce4kczk,t3_1t49b8,null,1428083759,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

So, the ticket sellers have to add their own mark-up to cover their costs.

Now, it wouldn't be so bad if the venues had their own ticket processing facilities and sold tickets at the retail price so we can choose not to use a ticket-processing company -- but most don't.

Merely saying that shale gas production declines exponentially doesn't really get you anywhere.  You need to use geological and economic arguments to then show that this fact will result in shale gas not being long term viable.

The fact is that few shale gas wells have gone though their entire lifecycle yet, so we're not exactly there on the modelling.  However, in general the price of gas would have to drop obscenely low in order for it not to be profitable.  I've seen estimates that even at half it's current US price it would be viable.  

Plus it's usually entirely possible to drill multiple wells from a single wellhead.  Each well doesn't really suck out gas from a massive volume in the subsurface, so you can add more wells in an area to offset production decline fairly easily.

As an aside, gas drilling in the US declined significantly in 2008 when the price of gas crashed, and there was nowhere near as large a decline in production as you might have expected.

The backend is done in php, using CodeIgniter as the framework (http://ellislab.com/codeigniter). Hoping to move this over to Laravel at some point (http://laravel.com/) in the future.

The frontend is done using Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) which is great for making the site responsive so it looks ok on tablets and mobile without too much extra work.

Unfortunately the design isn't my own! It's a template that has been purchased as it fit what we needed the site to do (not entirely sure of where we purchased it from, but it was probably wrapbootstrap.com). Obviously we'd like to change that in the future and put more of our own stamp on it, but for a first version we thought we'd go with it.

You are trying to pretend it's not as bad as all that by equating the problems brought on by industrial civilisation to phenomena that come about through natural variations.

The problem with Christians in the west having a persecution complex every time their dominant position in western society is even partially challenged is that many people who know that it is bollocks assume that no christians anywhere are being persecuted, which is just not the case.

To quote an article in the [Spectator](http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9041841/the-war-on-christians/) on the subject:

&gt; According to the International Society for Human Rights, a secular observatory based in Frankfurt, Germany, 80 per cent of all acts of religious discrimination in the world today are directed at Christians. According to the Pew Forum, between 2006 and 2010 Christians faced some form of discrimination, either de jure or de facto, in a staggering total of 139 nations, which is almost three-quarters of all the countries on earth. 

&gt; According to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, an average of 100,000 Christians have been killed in what the centre calls a ‘situation of witness’ each year for the past decade. That works out to 11 Christians killed somewhere in the world every hour, seven days a week and 365 days a year, for reasons related to their faith.

This is a serious issue which should be focused on to a much greater extent through diplomacy and soft power. When politicians, diplomats and the media are ignoring the issue, the Prince is entitled to express a view on something which should not be a partisan issue.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"The points you make on the BRIC countries and the developing world generally are valid and well-taken, however, it's also worth bearing in mind both that we (as in the developed world) have historically been the dominant contributors to climate change, and that China and the rest aren't exactly sitting idly now - it's very much in their own self-interests to see the problems addressed since they will likely suffer some of the worst effects.  China's fossil aquifers are seriously depleted, and the mid to long term impact of pollution and climate change on the health, lives and well-being of their citizenry are likely to be severe.  Indeed, [China](http://www.ccchina.gov.cn/WebSite/CCChina/UpFile/File1324.pdf) et al [are acting, both independently and in concert with the West](http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/bfinamore/what_is_chinas_reaction_to_the.html), but it is the West, and particularly the US which is currently dragging its feet and going backwards - both due to concerted political pressure and campaigning by those who stand to gain most from ignoring the threat, and because of a seeming desire to want to make the developing world carry the can again - so that they bear an unfair share of the burden not just on the industrialisation upswing but on the de-industrialisation downslope.

I'm not trying to doomsay, it's highly improbable humanity as a species will die out unless the worst and most improbable predictions play out (continued and exponentially growing planetary abuse, all the most damaging feedbacks occur, etc.).  However, even many in the environmental science community actually attempt to make the message more politically palatable than they should, by using the most optimistic forecasts and climate data they know to be well out-of-date and which underestimates the problem we face and the extent of emissions and change, and projects improbable and even unattainable reductions from policies currently in place.

Let's face it, if we're going to consider political palatability, given the furore surrounding immigration today, how will it be when half of Africa and Southern Europe is on the move?  Or conversely, when those of us in Northern Europe need to move south if the Atlantic conveyor shuts down (unlikely, but theoretically possible).  How much more severe will our housing crisis be when our coastline recedes and heavily populated flood planes begin to become inland lakes?

Not really - Brum's a pretty safe city. Broad Street can get a bit rowdy on weekend nights but that's about it.

Depending on your musical tastes - general club stuff would be Broad Street, and alternative/rock to Eddies &amp; Subside.

I'd recommend the [Wellington](http://www.thewellingtonrealale.co.uk/) and [Post Office Vaults](http://postofficevaults.co.uk/), but then I like my real ales :) [Brewdog Bar](http://www.brewdog.com/bars/birmingham) has gotten quite popular too now.

Nowhere in my comment did I say anything about what I wanted, and you have no idea how I 'carry on'.

What I did comment on was the figure in the report that says 64% acknowledge there is a problem but don't feel motivated to do something about it. I don't defend that but I do understand that is how people, in the real world, will react if the environmental reports all say - 'already too late - we are all going to die'.

The reality is that it probably is too late to keep the world the way it is at present and many people will die (but we are all going to die anyway). The changes will mean that the world will not support such a huge resource hungry population so it will reduce (be reduced) significantly. None of that is easy - but probably inevitable. 

Now, if you want people to do anything about it then you have to give them some practical steps they can take and an achievable result to aim for. Otherwise the majority will, understandably, say 'Yes, I understand there is a problem but there is nothing I can do about it'.

Many/most places will be open on Christmas Eve, but on Christmas Day you can expect almost everything to be closed; one exception that springs to mind is [Edinburgh Zoo](http://www.edinburghzoo.org.uk/) which you can get to easily by bus from the city centre.  Edinburgh's buses are a great way of getting around, see [Lothian Buses](http://lothianbuses.com/) website for details - they do run on Christmas Day albeit with a reduced service. You can obviously also go up places like Arthur's Seat (the extinct volcano just SE of the city centre) anytime too.

In terms of areas to avoid - I don't think there are really any that you'd have a reason to go to, so while I wouldn't particularly recommend going to say Muirhouse or Craigmillar, there's nothing there that would give you a reason to want to go anyway.  City centre is basically all fine, the New Town's one of Edinburgh's more upmarket areas.

In terms of suggestions of things to do, I'd honestly suggest trawling /r/Edinburgh for previous threads as there's a lot of good advice eg [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/1rscdn/fun_and_different_things_to_do_when_visiting/).",0,1387361884,null,0,false,0,ce4lr9b,t3_1t4sk4,t1_ce4lr9b,t3_1t4sk4,null,1428083107,5,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,5

Many ocean and land species are undergoing a net migration northwards, to colder climes - [see this](http://i.imgur.com/AUaDGNo.png)

So what happens when land species reach the northern-most parts of land masses and are unable to go further north?

The wheat belt in the US has moves 173 miles northwards since the 1960s, and the corn belt has moved 100 miles.

As this trend continues, how do people adapt their economies, livelihoods, food supplies when land becomes unsuitable for most crops?

What happens when areas become unsuitable for human habitation? when subsistence crops continually fail? What happens when people cannot leave their country of origin?

What are the costs of adaption? If we defer mitigation, adaption may end up costing us 40% of global GDP, every year. If we mitigate, we will delay or limit some of the worst effects of climate change.

true,nikcub,lfc68,null,"&gt; There will be a release clause, but a ridiculous one at that

Why does everybody think Suarez will have a release clause? Honest question. I've never seen so much talk about a release clause. It seems to have sprung up out of absolutely nowhere (and because of the Arsenal bid on a non-existant release clause). 

Release clauses aren't recognized by the FA or the Premier League. They aren't part of the deals that the players association has approved. You can count the number of players that had a release clause in the Premier League on one hand, and in almost every case something went wrong (edit: I say almost, but it is actually every case).

Further, it is even rarer in large contracts (to the point of being non-existant). Clubs don't reward players with high-wages *and* a release clause. If he insists on it (which he won't, because a) they aren't formal and b) since the transfer system has worked for decades in the UK without release clauses, see Bale etc.) then it just means Liverpool will need to sell. 

I'm puzzled as all hell by every Suarez renewal thread in the past 3 days having 50%+ of comments dedicated to release clauses. This never came up when he renewed before, and it never comes up for any other player.

Most likely scenario is that he gets £200k a week to bring him on par with Aguero, Toure and we will outbid Real Madrid on wages since they don't have the space and don't have an easy way to make it (it was different when he was earning 5M with us and they offered 9M). Part of that is an agreement with the club that if we don't qualify for the Champions League we would listen to offers, but there is near zero chance (i'd say zero) that there would be a release clause.",0,1387366847,null,0,1387368125,0,ce4mhi6,t3_1t4rh7,t1_ce4mhi6,t1_ce4fl54,null,1428082696,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Au contraire, monsieur. I find it vital to any comprehension of the frail nature of human perception to understand that our world-views are always under the influence of myriad cultural and environmental factors. 

I have had a great deal of fun exploring how my doomerish inclinations are routed in a mishmash of Freudian hang ups, cultural paranoia about Hitler, resistance to authority, contempt for institutions, an oppressive father and so on.

There is no 'just'. It's a major issue. You're still in the position of having the equivalent of a lock-up you won't open - and you're ignoring the difference between reasonable suspicion and random targets (it would have to be the latter for this to be a real concern).

The police usually have to have a demonstrable suspicion that there's something in your impenetrable lock-up before they can insist you open it up, but once they do the issue will not end with 'I've lost the keys' - and if they already *know* you've got something dodgy in there, then that's how you'll get prosecuted for not opening it up - so the same now goes for encrypted data. I can't really see how this is such a bad thing - it's not as if people are suddenly being imprisoned in droves for random searches.

You could use the exact same arguments you've been using over letting the police into your house - if they wanted to search houses at random, you'd have an argument, but otherwise you're expected to co-operate to prove they're barking up the wrong tree. This hasn't changed.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Other people have suggested filtering results on websites to omit agency results from your search. You can do this, but then you get next to no results. Only a small handful of companies bother advertising their roles through third party websites. Most are either big enough to attract jobseekers to their own websites, or are too small and lack the time/resources to advertise beyond their own website. Some smaller companies contact agencies to do the recruitment for them, in these instances you have no choice but to go through the recruiter.

It's a complete pain in the arse as a jobseeker knowing that with agencies, you have an extra barrier there who will filter out CVs before they even reach the employer. They're an unnecessary middle man who will waste my time by contacting me for phone interviews etc. only to not forward on my CV because I was 'too much of a risk' (When this happened, I demanded the name of the company and applied directly through their website).

The best way around it I find is to do extra research yourself. Many of the opportunities advertised by agencies are actually sourced directly from company websites or local ads, through research undertaken by the agencies. Search local business directories and websites for business parks/industrial estates for companies and view their websites or contact them by phone to see if they have any vacancies. This is very time consuming work, which is why agencies exist; they make it more convenient to find vacancies.

You can even be a bit sneaky and use the agencies to your advantage. Depending on the industry and the location, you can sometimes find out the company in question from the agency advertisement. This is especially effective if the recruiter has just copy+pasted the job role from the website. You may have to go past the first page on google though, as recruiting sites are usually higher in the listings.

The thing that singles football from american sports [for me] is tribalism, America being a massive country has teams from each state and tribalism is akin to the big European footballing powers rivalry, playing each other is more like playing in the champions league, usually large distances between respective teams, and as such the rivalry between fans just cant be like it would be between Liverpool &amp; United/Everton. There cant be many places in the America where 3 of the countries oldest and most successful teams are all situated within 50 miles or so of each other. its not as intense, but still very much there.

I have obviously been to many a football match in my time, and the atmosphere is a lot different than the american football games i have been to for example (my auntie lives in Wisconsin, so have been to see her a few times n got to see the Green Bay Packers a few times, which was an experience but wasn't close to the intense atmosphere in the English football games).

That aside, i have been more than impressed with FSG, yes they have made some mistakes as i would have expected, but overall they have been fantastic, backed the managers that were in charge (bar Woy), dug their heels in when needed and put out a massive statement to the fans, the opposition but most importantly for me, to the actual players. I think they way they handled Luis Suarez in the summer and the bids from rival teams made a lot of the players believe in the project that is under way.

true,lectricwit,null,null,"West Ham vs Arsenal - 2002

For context, I was born in England but moved to Australia when I was very young so the only exposure I'd really had to professional football and the EPL was through FIFA 2000 and whatever I could find on TV, which was not a lot. With me being about 9 or 10 years old and Arsenal being one of the best teams around at the time I obviously decided to support them, despite my dads support of West Ham. 

Anyway, skip forward to 2002 and my family and I have made the trip back to England because my grandmother was quite sick. During our time back home we went to watch a football match and it just so happened to be West Ham vs Arsenal. This was the first time I'd ever been to a proper football match (not including the shit excuse for a league in Australia at the time) and I was pretty excited. 

I can't recall too much about the match itself apart from the final score and the order of goals, but the feeling of being in the crowd with thousands of people and all the energy in Upton Park will stick with me forever. I'd never experienced anything like it before in my life and the closest I've come to that same feeling since would have been in '05 when Adelaide managed to fill Hindmarsh Stadium's 17 odd thousand seats for their first home match in the A-League. Got nothing on that match in '02 though. Shit was unreal.

That's the only match I've ever attended so there's nothing I can really compare it to unfortunately. It was damn memorable though and certainly when my allegiance started to head towards the Hammers. Now, 11 years later, I don't give a toss about Arsenal and my Sundays usually consist of me being tired and agitated because I've stayed up until the early hours of the morning to watch us draw.

Hopefully one day I can make it back to watch another one from the stands.

Liverpool are preparing to make Luis Suárez the highest-paid player in the club’s history by offering the striker a new contract that would double his wages to about £200,000 a week.

Ian Ayre, the Liverpool managing director, arrived in Spain yesterday to begin negotiations with Pere Guardiola, Suárez’s agent. Ayre has been given the go-ahead by the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group (FSG), to do everything in his power to try to persuade the Uruguay forward to stay. Suárez’s present deal has 2½ years to run, but Liverpool are keen to reward him for his development into one of the most outstanding players in the world.

Suárez, who arrived at Anfield in January 2011, earns about £100,000 per week in a performance-related contract signed in August 2012. It is likely that Liverpool will need to double his salary if they want Suárez to consider extending his stay, particularly with Real Madrid’s continuing interest.

That negotiations are even taking place reflects a significant improvement in Suárez’s relationship with his employer just months after his unsuccessful attempts to force a move to Arsenal. It also highlights Liverpool’s determination to hold on to a player whose response since that acrimonious period in the summer was rewarded with the captaincy in the 5-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.

One outstanding issue that lingers from that time is the contentious clause in Suárez’s contract, which both he and his agent felt allowed him to leave Liverpool in the event of a rival club offering more than £40 million to sign him.

Their interpretation of that agreement was found to be inaccurate when Arsenal had a bid of £40,000,001 turned down and both Suárez and Guardiola will seek greater clarity in any new contract as they attempt to leave the door open for a potential move to Real.

In August, Suárez gave an interview to Marca, the Spanish national newspaper, in which he admitted his long-standing desire to sign for the La Liga club. “Every player aspires to reach the top and Real Madrid is among the most important clubs in the world,” he said. “It would be very difficult to say no to Real Madrid.”

Although Real did not make an offer at the time, largely because of their world-record £85 million outlay on Gareth Bale, they have continued to monitor the form of a player who has scored 17 goals in 11 league appearances already this season and are widely believed to be preparing an offer for next summer.

Despite Real’s interest, Brendan Rodgers continues to maintain that Liverpool is “the perfect place” for Suárez. The Liverpool manager has also ruled out allowing fringe players to leave on loan next month as he considers adding Jordan Rossiter, a 16-year-old midfielder, and Brad Smith, a 19-year-old full back, to his depleted squad.

“At this moment in time we’ve got 19 fit players and that includes young Jordon Ibe and Tiago Ilori,” Rodgers said. “The squad is very thin at the moment so unless we get some of the players back fit then certainly at this moment in time I can’t even consider something like that [players leaving on loan].
“We’ve had Jordan Rossiter training with us. He’s an outstanding young talent. Brad Smith, a left back who I think is another outstanding young player, has been here too. The one thing you’ll get with kids is they’ll run through a brick wall for you so it’s something I’ll look closely at and maybe in the second half of the season they will get a chance.”",0,1387371755,null,0,false,0,ce4ncgd,t3_1t4rh7,t1_ce4ncgd,t1_ce4d7s5,null,1428082295,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

No they didn't, by the time of the Taliban resurgence in the early 90s, funded almost entirely by Pakistan, there were several factions operating in Afghanistan made up of ex-Mujahadeen and led by local warlords.

The most prominent, the Northern Alliance, nominally led by Ahmed Shah Massoud, was formed in direct opposition to the Taliban.  Really a fragile collection of warlords including the likes of Rashid Dostum and Mohammed Mohaqiq it was also a predominantly Tajik organisation, whereas the Taliban are predominantly Pashtun (Tajiks and Pashtuns are the most prominent ethnic groups in Afghanistan).  Some warlords, such as the Haqqanis, didn't join either faction.  In fact the Haqqanis continue to run their own insurgency in North Western Afghanistan with links to the Taliban only when it suits them.

Whilst the mainly Pashtun Mujahadeen groups in the south of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan received US aid (through the Pakistani government) in order to infiltrate fighters into the country, the more northerly groups (Massoud especially) seemingly achieved more success and so attracted plenty of support in their own right, for example it was Hezb-i-Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, that received the first Stinger missiles and used them in operations around Jalalabad.  Hezb-i-Islami was a mainly Pashtun group and formed the basis of the Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin (HiG) an insurgent group which initially allied itself to the Taliban, but which has now started peace negotiations with the Afghan Government.

So it is reasonable to say that the US funded some groups which would go on to form some parts of the Taliban movement – to suggest that the Taliban is an American creation is incredibly simplistic.",0,1387373938,null,0,false,0,ce4ntvd,t3_1t2q5j,t1_ce4ntvd,t1_ce4iues,null,1428082069,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ask and you shall receive.

Individual sectors of business have been impacted quite a lot. Take haulage. It already had rules on driving hours. These were superceded by EU Drivers Hours Regulations in 1992 which reduced the amount of hours a driver could drive per day and per week but increased the daily duty time from 12hrs to a maximum of 15hrs thus actually making things worse. These were again fucked about with three times since, the last alteration being a year ago, and the changes affecting breaks and all being detrimental. 

And then they introduced the working time directive for transport (different to what everyone else has) which introduced a whole load of bureaucracy you wouldn't believe both for drivers and employers alike and in the case of daily periodic rest breaks made the situation unnecessarily complicated by adding additional break requirements that had to be complied with as well as the EU drivers hours ones.

They mandated digital tachographs and then after everyone had paid to have them retrofitted, mandated changes to them. They mandated minimum sizes for mirrors then when it became apparent how much they obscured the view of the driver changed the rules again. They mandated speed limiters EU wide to be set to 85kph/52MPH even though we have a speed limit of 60MPH for trucks in the UK, reducing the amount of distance a truck can travel by 10%. They made it legal for 18 year olds to drive 44 tonne trucks despite nobody wanting it in this country. They made it mandatory to have 35hrs driver training or you couldn't be employed which was good for newbies but the rules allow you to take the same seven hour module five times and it qualify for 35hrs....

And that is for haulage in general before we even start to break down into the individual sectors of it such as hazardous solids, liquids and gases, abnormal load movements etc etc which add even more ""bullshit from Brussels"".

By the time we went into Helmand in 2006 they were back and it was a stated aim of the Helmand plan to eradicate opium production.

&gt; True at the farmer level, not so much at the warlord level as they received direct assistance to secure their fields. We had troops guarding heroin groves for them and there is pretty damning evidence that the warlords are being fed intelligence by us.

The poorest still depend on it as a way of life so when we started destroying crops, it ruined their income and made us even less popular (as if that were possible).  Naturally we feed some intelligence ot some warlords we consider friendly in order to garner their support for the Kabul government.

&gt; In Afghanistan the Northern Alliance are just as bad as the Taliban, one of the first things they did on taking power was to pass a law requiring the stoning of rape victims. 

The Northern alliance have never been ""in power"".  True they controlled Kabul for most of the civil war in the early 90s, but control of Kabul does not constitute control of the country (as well we know).  Also to describe them as ""as bad as the Taliban"" is disingenuous.  Whilst the Taliban had a widespread policy of executions, massacres and ethnic cleansing, human rights abuses by the Northern Alliance varied wildly based on the local commander.  Massoud, for example, has not been accused of any human rights abuses and in fact has been credited with a positively humane approach to governance.  Dostum, on the other hand, allowed his commanders to execute Taliban prisoners and gave them free reign within their petty fiefdoms.

If the evidence is ambiguous, we will hold a retrial. But the simple fact is this:

Pedophiles must be killed. They cannot be cured, they do not show mercy, and their entire lives revolve around one thing: Child Rape. They do not feel any romantic feelings for their victims, they do not feel pity, they may feign such emotions, but in truth it's in the slim chance they might be able to rape again. They see children in the same way a Crocodile sees a piece of meat, except unlike the croc the pedophile enjoys the screams and cries of the children more than the sex itself.

This has been shown again, and again, and again. The death penality will not stop pedophillia just like woodworm treatment doesn't stop woodworm, but it's the best and only way to deal with Pedophillia.

Because of all the bureaucracy (which is not avoidable as every country has to have a former way of sorting things out) new changes are not always good. This is most probably reflected by changes which are done internally by a country. Hasn't UK tried to change something for better and made it actually worse? Look at recent bedroom tax, which has plenty of supporters and opponents and both sides are actually quite right, depending on the situation they look at. It's simply not always easy to change things for better, especially at such complex matters.

Were digital tachographs a bad idea? Probably not. Is it fair to discriminate person (18yr) to do certain job just because of his young age? I bet there are people who are 30 and have same driving experience as 18yo. They made that mandatory 35h driver training but didn't went step forward and removed loopholes (at least yet).

I don't know examples but remember one change, driven by EU, that women drivers in UK should be paying same premiums for car insurance as man. I found that change good but papers were obviously saying ""another stupid EU law"". Why? I pay my car premium now equally, not higher just because I have a sticking thing behind my legs. 

I also think young drivers shouldn't be penalised by way higher premiums just because they are young. Penalise people who make wrong not based on average calculations and basically don't allow some young people into employment because companies employing drivers don't want anybody below 25 (happened to me, although I was and still am a very good driver).

EU makes changes on international level. Not on the level which currently fits current party. UK party may say, in order to gain votes, ""we will help drivers"" and don't do any tachographs and other driving requirements because they won elections and now have to keep to their promises as drivers will be mad at them. EU doesn't care about certain specific groups, they try to care for everybody.

But the plastic substrate – the underlying material to which ink and coating are applied – does not have any intrinsic security features, whereas cotton banknotes have a watermark and security thread. Canada, which has just made the switch, experienced the first forgeries of its polymer notes almost as soon as they were in circulation. In Australia, the Daily Telegraph reported earlier this year: “Sydney has been flooded with counterfeit cash that is of such high quality some banks are struggling to detect it.” Wherever plastic notes have been introduced, from Mexico to Vietnam, the story is the same.

The main thing is that you always tax people.  You tax any benefits they get.  You tax any money people receive.

Charities are taxed already, their VAT status is complex, it often boils down to they pay VAT on everything but expensive computers and promotional literature. http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/vat/intro.htm

Charities of course pay employers NIC on every person they hire, that person has standard income tax liabilities.

Contrary to popular belief, charities also pay Corporation Tax on pretty much anything that isn't a donation.  As lots of charities provide consultancy and such they are often fringe businesses.

Which brings me on to how stupid Corporation Tax is, why someone should be taxed differently from earnings from dividends, than from income.  If we make all income taxed the same, we can abolish CT, which would have the effect of ensuring the rich pay more tax, those who live on income from trusts (ie not working) have it taxed as highly as someone in a job.

He's also one of those breed of young English lads that I particularly dislike.  Head too much into the celebrity, not enough on improving his game.  Spends too long in the Trafford Centre fucking about.

He was sent on loan to Oldham where Dickov was manager now obviously to Donny where Dickov also happens to be manager.

Concerning the latter question there is information available but it is obviously mixed with politics. Any solution that suggests otherwise is bogus. And conclusion that is definitive is also bogus. You could argue the original question of the EU was mired in politics that has led to a failing EU in the first place looking at documents from the Kohl administration of West Germany all those years ago.

Businesses do do that, but they are rarely versed well enough in the work of the charity to do so effectively. Nor do they have an interest in doing so effectively if the tax break is for printing a poster rather than measuring its effectiveness.

As an aside, that was an example of the work of a fundraiser, not a comprehensive list.

You are also vastly underestimating the size of many of these charities. Often comparative to these businesses themselves. You can't donate all your revenue away as much as you might like too.

In 2007, the scout association rented so many marquees for an event that you would have struggled to find one if you lived south of Doncaster. Do you think the entire marquee hire market would have shut down because they asked nicely? (This was for operational reasons)

In 2012, I was involved in running an event for the scout association and and we had the use of a stage donated too us. Until they pulled out at last minute because the Olympics offered them a wad of cash. How can a charity compete?

I should point out, my role with the scout association - and in fact all charities I am involved in is completely voluntary.

Sometimes money has to be spent. I may not know about scientific research, but I do know two things. The biggest fundraising income in the country is with cancer research UK. And scientific research isn't free.

Once you establish that money is required, the question has to be. Where does it come from?

The reason it isn't questioned is because it is demonstrably true. Whether it is because the people that get involved are asked the question ""how did you hear about this..."" 

Or perhaps I could ask you the question. How did you hear about the work these charities you donated to do?

Or perhaps you could tell me any successful charities with zero overheads. That of course includes spending money on things like. Websites and domain names as well as the people most qualified.

Perhaps a few small charities can manage it, but once you reach a certain size, a size that may be required and certainly would be beneficial, it is simply impossible",0,1387379574,null,0,1387398035,0,ce4pgz6,t3_1svw7z,t1_ce4pgz6,t1_ce4o1bt,null,1428081303,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

I have suggested that if you really wanted to use government force to make housing more attainable, then one solution would be to make it illegal to spend more than say 20% of your wage on rent or say three times your salary on a mortgage. The effect would be that housing prices would immediately drop because they would have to.

The match in February was something else, there was a big difference in atmosphere although I might have been lucky with seating. There was obviously people upset when the ball was given away, but for the most part, players were supported, after we left in the first goal, when we were about to kick off, at 1-0 down, the stadium erupted in support, and coming back with 3 goals was amazing to watch. 

This time however for the Norwich game, was still a great experience, happened to be sitting near some guys who were overly critical of the players and would not shut up about it, especially early on, every loose ball and bad decision was bemoaned to the extreme, firing off clichés all over the place, it was like they watched MOTD and just learned all the standard comments and responses. A great run with a bad final pass was the end of the world to these guys. Of course we went on and won 5-1 so by the end they were slightly less critical but it was tough not to tell these guys to sit down and shut up, I can't describe how bad they were, had an awful attitude and there were young fans here for the first time having to listen to them.

The staff as always were friendly and welcoming, the chips across the road were delicious and the taxi drivers should be managing their own teams they know so much ;) good banter though :)

Then in the second half Wigan took another corner from outside the quadrant, and scored again.

Scotty Parker gets the ball just inside the Wigan half, and starts sprinting forward. Then he unleashes a belter on the outside of his boot from 20 yards, which goes in the bottom corner. It capped off the season in which he almost single handedly kept us up

It showed that it's ok to jump up and down and look a bit of a prat, that it helps the atmosphere and encourages it.  Since then, both the Club and groups of the fanbase have made a real effort to improve.

We had a lull in the few years in atmosphere.  When we moved to the Etihad from Maine Road in 2003 it was really hard to generate anything at all.  We'd gone from The Kippax and the North Stand rivalries to nothing.  All stadiums that are new take a while to grow an atmosphere.  Around 06-08 we still had the new stadium problem but had other problems like Stuart Pearce, but the atmosphere was passable at this time.

2008-09 is still what I recall as the best year for atmosphere in the Etihad.  [The Hamburg game](http://www.mcfc.co.uk/citytv/features/2013/june/games-that-shook-the-etihad-city-v-hamburg-2009) in particularly was the best atmosphere that I have still ever seen at our ground.

When we started a title challenge, I thought it negatively effected our atmosphere hugely.  Put simply, the crowd were constantly nervous as showed when we didn't score in the first 20 minutes or the Derby games at the Etihad where you could hear a pin drop.

true,tidder-wave,null,null,"In the ""original"" timeline, the Doctor (Chris Eccleston) initially claimed that he ended the Time War by destroying the Daleks with the Time Lords and Gallifrey as collateral damage. We were led to believe that Gallifrey was destroyed, presumably with a deadly weapon like the Moment.

In the episode when Gallifrey and the Master made an appearance, it turned out that Rassilon was planning the Final Sanction, which would lead to the destruction of the universe, and it seemed that the Time Lords were every bit as horrific as the Daleks, thus necessitating the destruction of both races. This episode was placed as after the War Doctor had stolen the Moment, but presumably before the events of the Day of the Doctor, as the War Council later said that the High Council, chaired by Rassilon, had failed in executing its plan. The fear in Rassilon's Council was that the Doctor was going to destroy Gallifrey with the Moment. The reason that Gallifrey could have been brought back through the portal appeared to be because this was *before* the alleged destruction of Gallifrey by the activation of the Moment.

Ultimately, according to what I've gathered from the fandom, what happened in the original timeline was that Gallifrey was *never* destroyed, but was only put into a pocket universe by the 13 TARDISes, as shown in TDoTD.

Sports that flow continuously (like soccer, basketball, and hockey) will always feature contributions that are very difficult to measure.

My favorite example of this is Bill Russell's (basketball) defense and shot blocking. Obviously shots blocked is a measurable stat, but those who played with and against Russell say that he was so dominant defensively that opposing players were often forced to take lower percentage shots from further out rather than drive towards the basket. That's massively important, but it never showed up (directly, anyway) on Russell's stats.

In a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, we have one dedicated hodling midfielder, usually Sandro or Capoue.  We then have a more box to box type in Paulinho or Mousa, and in my opinion Holtby should be in that list.  Then we have our ten.  By taking out the attacking mid in the center three, you now leave more of the attacking responsibilities on one or both of the two deeper lying players.  They now have to get the ball all the way forward instead of having someone to link with.  That puts added importance on one of the strikers to drop back, almost into a midfield position, to receive the ball.

So if you want to stay defensively responsible in the 4-4-2, you have a striker who's almost playing at the 10 very often.  And if someone is going to be there, why wouldn't it be Eriksen or Sig?  Siggy, by the way, would play very well as a second striker, in my opinion.  I fully believe that either of those two would be more effective paired with a single striker than two of our strikers paired together would be.  

In any case, my lineup is pretty boring:

Lloris

Walker - Chiriches - Capoue - Zeki

Sandro - Holtby

Lamela - Sig - Townsend

Ade

If Sandro isn't fit, I'd honestly say that I have no idea what to do in the midfield.  Capoue might have to cover at CB, but if he doesn't I actually want him at DM over Sandro, who I'd prefer be healthy for this weekend.  Mousa deserves a rest I think, and I want to see Holtby play at CM with the freedom afforded by a dedicated defensive mid beside him.  Siggy up top because, like Sandro, I think we'll need Eriksen fit for Southampton.",0,1387383060,null,0,false,0,ce4qu4w,t3_1t5v8f,t1_ce4qu4w,t3_1t5v8f,null,1428080666,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

It could also be a third party and weaken the early France-German alliance in the ECC. The UK was powerful enough to have an independent approach within the ECC that may not be favourable to France.

He was also afraid of the US influence in the ECC. France foreign policy position was to remain independent of USA and the USSR, in his view that meant that the ECC would naturally follow that position. His belief was a UK ascension would mean the whole thing would be controlled by the Americans through the UK or the UK would propose things like Free-trade agreements with other Anglo nations which would lead to an American domination of the ECC. It all seems silly now, but it was a 
real fear that the European dream of a customs union would become an atlanticist free trade area. 

We would also have fucked up the CAP. France could not compete with the agricultural powers of the commonwealth realms like Canada and Australia (and other nations like Argentina), so they had to keep the UK out the first time before the negotiations for the CAP was over. 

We also went with the US in the Nassau Agreement for getting Polaris missiles for our nuclear warheads. France didnt have fully tested nuclear weapons at the time and they were offered the same agreement. France refused because they would essentially be relying on the Americans and Nato. This was unthinkable for an independent France. They had to go it alone and it took a lot longer for them (apparently we helped them in 1967 when we told them which one of their designs would work, saving them a shitload of time). That agreement was one of the reasons for the first veto, he refused to have an american satellite in the ECC.

Once De Gaulle was gone, a lot of these issues were no longer stumbling blocks. France had left NATO, they had nuclear weapons deterrence capabilities, the CAP was settled and they were more secure in their leadership position. It did help that Edward Heath was part of the original negotiation parties and was personal friends with the french minister of foreign affairs at the time as well, which all lead to the eventual ascension in 1973.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"Yep. He was also known for replacing a defensive right back with a more attacking right back, leading to the right winger being able to play further inside and get into goalscoring positions. Whatever else you might say about Mancini, he was pretty good at that.

I remember the year Newcastle got relegated, in their last Premier League game, they were down 1-0 to Aston Villa. Alan Shearer ended the game with 3 strikers on and basically just lumping the ball forward and hoping, but it failed miserably because all three were just standing around hoping for a lucky bounce or a missed clearance. So most of the game was 10 Villa players versus 7, because Newscastle's strikers didn't contribute at all.

Either way, if we never play 4-4-2 again (with the players we have now), I'll be happy. Adebayor and Soldado maybe could work together, but neither one is particularly creative, and our midfield would be way too open.

I'd rather see a high pressing 4-3-3 (when everyone is fit):

Lloris

Walker Kaboul Jan Rose

Sandro

Eriksen Dembele

Lamela Soldado/Ade Townsend/Chadli

I don't think Ade is better than Soldado, necessarily, but I do think his link-up play is better... and that's something we clearly need.

Lloris

Walker ? ? Rose

But I am interested in hearing other criticisms about why it would be bad idea. I'm not saying it is a good idea. I don't know. I'm just throwing it out there as one suggestion. 

The current solution is to just give me people money and I don't think that works as it just subsidises landlords and causes prices to grow higher. The problem I see is that people willingly spend too much on rent and once some people start doing it, everyone has to follow. That means instead of factoring in money they need to save for retirement  in their budget for example, they are instead willingly giving over too much for rent. 

I don't see the problem as people not having enough money to afford rent, I see the problem as rent being too high. Even if we build more houses, rent will still be too high because people willingly spend too much on it. They don't factor in their other needs.

Yes, definitely.  I actually think the big prices (non-voluntary contributions), profits and pay packs of Scientology set it apart from a ""proper"" religion/social-group.  The whole mess around charities/political/religious/social groups and tax is begging for reform.  The only problem is that there is no simple answer to who should or should not get the tax breaks.  Partly that is because so many private companies pay no proper tax, partly it is because groups like Scientology and arguably private schools (and others) offer no real benefit to wider society but do enjoy the tax benefits.

I imagine there will only be more abuses sadly (like how landlords are ""renting"" their empty commercial properties to charities to avoid rates).  Something will be done eventually but then many proper social groups and useful charities will suffer as a result.

Here is a [report](http://www.ziyameral.com/2013/06/new-report-article-18-orphaned-right.html) published this summer by the All Party Parliamentary Group on International Religious Freedom. It looked at the level of compliance with article 18 of the UN human rights charter around the world. 

Article 18 asserts that 
//Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.// Note that atheism and agnosticism are also protected under this article. 

It's not acceptable to ignore the persecution faced by Christians in MENA countries because 'there's a flip side...' you should care about all forms of persecution where people's basic human rights are being denied, not ignore it because 'they're all as bad as each other' - if we don't speak up for Christians in Saudi Arabia and Muslims in Angola etc then we are worse than useless. 

State sanctioned Religious intolerance and secular totalitarianism go hand-in-hand - this is not just about belief systems, it's about individual freedoms and the survival of pluralistic societies. 

Throughout MENA different groups have lived side by side for generations in many nations, the increasing number of sectarian incidents - not just Christian versus Muslim but Sunni versus Shia, Orthodox Muslim versus Alawite/Ahmadi etc - SHOULD worry us. This is about religion being used as a tool of control and the Christians -- who are convenient targets because they are easy to associate with an 'enemy' West-  are the canaries in the mineshaft. 

Look at the rhetoric coming from the Pakistani clerics - Pakistan is outside of MENA but is heavily influenced by the region. 

First the polytheists were targeted - mainly Hindus, then they started on the Christians, then the non-Orthodox Muslims such as the Ahmadi, and now they are targeting Shia and politically 'liberal' Sunnis. This is not just about religion. It's about whether societies will tolerate differences of opinion. The enforcement of a single religion in a State is as worrying as the enforcement of Single party rule.

Just 1,252 of them own 57% of Scotland. They pay no land tax. Instead every government gives them £2.3 billion a year and the EU gives them a further £2 billion. Each family gets £26,875.

&gt; By contrast, 57.5 million of us pay £10 billion a year in council tax, a land tax, £550 per household. We live in 24 million homes on about four million acres. 65% of homes are privately owned, so 16 million of us own just 2.8 million acres, an average 0.18 acres each.

Lots of people swear by homeopathy or other quack remedies because they tried it once and it apparently cured some ailment - in reality they just happened to use the remedy at the right time, when the condition was about to improve naturally (or because of some other intervention).  For that reason and others, if a drug company wanted to sell a product to help treat an addiction, they would have to produce randomised controlled trials showing it worked - if they just came up with a few anecdotes of people claiming it worked for them, the regulators would laugh in their faces.  Are there any trials demonstrating that religion can help cure addiction, or are we just supposed to believe the anecdotes coming from people who have a strong incentive to promote their religion?

The sentencing report makes one reference to B being manipulated but goes on immediately to say:
&gt;That you were manipulated by Watkins may be obvious. But you were mother. Your infant was only 10 months old. A mother naturally loves, protects, shields, nurtures and cherishes. Your infant would have trusted you implicitly. You totally betrayed that trust.

There is no reference to P being manipulated, although she does have a personality disorder. Neither women received reduced sentences because they were manipulated or coerced in any way.

The women didn't get ""short"" sentences - the suggested range is 11-17 years (you may well think that's too short, but that is what the guidelines say). B got a reduction for an early guilty plea, P (and Watkins) got a very slight reduction for pleading guilty. The guidelines increase sentences where the offender is in a position of trust with the victim.

What happened is the Watkins got a long sentence. Because he is a serial offender, because he is dangerous, and other aggravating factors that if you want that level of detail you can read the report (it's grim).",0,1387390150,null,0,false,0,ce4tzx5,t3_1t6436,t1_ce4tzx5,t1_ce4svpz,null,1428079192,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

If we sell to chelsea after the season that Suarez has had, they would have to come at us with 86+ mil for it to be taken into consideration. Since its Chelsea it'll have to be 90+ for us to sell because with Suarez in our side next season, we are title contenders. 

2. Chelsea would never sell Lukaku. They don't have a good Striker, and Lukaku is probably THE most complete striker to come out in recent times. He understands the game, has the physicality, has good technique, and has a good attitude. Out of all the young strikers coming out nowadays, he has to be near the top.
