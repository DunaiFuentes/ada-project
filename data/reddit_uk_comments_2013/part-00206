true,kopking08,null,null,"I think it's too early to say. Plenty of players jump into a new team and pull off solid performances. I don't think what he's shown so far is something people doubted. It was more likely his physicality and his ability to hold up over a season.

We're also working within the parameters of a budget. I don't think our not signing Eriksen is a sign we don't rate him. It might simply be we don't NEED him. Yes, Coutinho is injured and I believe we need a proper backup. But is Eriksen a proper backup? No. He's potentially a peg below or even equal to Coutinho. Without Europe how could we accommodate both of them? 

Basically I see Eriksen in much the way I saw Willian. They're playmakers. But they aren't goal scorers. At least not regularly. Why we went after Willian instead of Eriksen is due to Willian being mostly a winger. Again, I don't think Willian was a good option at his price. But Eriksen certainly is a CAM and we didn't need him or what he offered. We needed someone to bag goals.

This season we've already proven capable of creating chances. Same as last. What we need is finishers. Now that our striker situation is, at least momentarily, sorted, we can hope to find goals elsewhere. Moses and Aspas should do a bit of that. 

Hopefully if we get Europe or CL we can get someone in the LW position who can bag goals. 

I agree Eriksen looks good but I don't think we made the wrong move for us at that moment. ",0,1380689069,null,0,false,0,ccjcz0h,t3_1nk31a,t1_ccjcz0h,t1_ccjc10f,null,1429274384,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

We must change our conception of Germany. . .The older generation of Germans were our enemies. Must we make enemies of this younger generation too?""

Edit:  And a couple more -

'They have started a clamorous campaign of denunciation against what they call ""Nazi atrocities"" which, as anyone who visits Germany quickly discovers for himself, consists merely of a few isolated acts of violence such as are inevitable among a nation half as big again as ours, but which have been generalized, multiplied and exaggerated to give the impression that Nazi rule is a bloodthirsty tyranny.

The German nation, moreover, was rapidly falling under the control of its alien elements. In the last days of the pre-Hitler regime there were twenty times as many Jewish Government officials in Germany as had existed before the war. Israelites of international attachments were insinuating themselves into key positions in the German administrative machine. Three German Ministers only had direct relations with the Press, but in each case the official responsible for conveying news and interpreting policy to the public was a Jew.'

Every single person requires a different approach, and it's claimed that 10% of people suffer from anxiety or depression and that a quarter of people will face some sort of mental health problem in a year.

There are simply never going to be enough resources to treat everyone, so you have to prioritise, and the level of care has increased so much in the last ten years. We're getting better, but these things take time.

If you have depression and anxiety, go to your GP, and keep going. Eventually they should refer you, a lot of people use their GP as a therapist and that's fine.

You say your friend has tried to commit suicide multiple times; in general, if you fail multiple times, it's just a plea for attention. Sorry to put it bluntly. The crisis team will have a lot of people to deal with, has he / she seen a GP? Have they kept going regularly? If you go once or twice and stop going they will not refer you.

It's all well and good saying we need to do something, rise up and protest or whatever, it won't change anything. Mental illness is also a very new field academically, read a book about Broadmoor in Victorian times if you don't think we've come a long way.

Every year there are new treatments and new conditions, a lot of professionals try to move away from medicine because it can create a dependency, but it's difficult, so sometimes you start them on a mix of therapy and medicine. It's not always easy to judge what will work.

And if you're wondering, the doctors and nurses, they care, they really do. No one does it for the money, and it breaks their heart when someone takes their own life, and then to add to it the police come and start pointing fingers and they have to attend a disciplinary sometimes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I work for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). To be honest, myself and most of my colleagues share your concern and frustration. 

There used to be three full time staff doing my job (a specialist role designed specifically to support kids in crisis and reduce the risk of suicide) but now I'm the only one in my locality and when I go on maternity leave in a few weeks there will be no cover. 

We used to have an ""out of hours team"" of eight Nurses, this has now dwindled to three which leads to increased pressure on A&amp;E. 

Experienced and highly trained staff (Senior Nurses, Psychologists, Psychotherapists) who leave our team are either not replaced at all or are replaced by unqualified support workers who are expected to be involved with high risk and complex cases they simply do not have the skills or training for.

As the number of hospital beds are slashed we are increasingly expected to manage kids in the community who previously would have been urgently admitted to a mental health unit for their own safety. Those ""lucky"" enough to get a bed could find themselves admitted to a unit 200 miles away, making an already traumatic experience even worse for the child and their family. 

The neuro developmental service (supporting kids with Autistic Spectrum disorders) used to have five full time staff but now has just one psychologist. This means that kids with ASD do not get the support they need so they become depressed, end up self-harming/suicidal and a routine referral becomes a crisis situation. 

There are simply not enough of us. Myself and other clinicians within the team have back to back appointments all day every day (most of us have long since given up attempts to to paperwork at work, it comes home with us or it doesn't get done) but ""none-urgent"" cases still have to wait for up to three months to be seen by which time they may well have become urgent. 

Every other week we are summoned to a meeting where we are told about another ""change"" (which always means cut) to our service and when we express concerns (to MP's, commissioners, Trust execs, senior managers) we hear phrases like ""efficiency savings"", ""streamlining"" and ""reallocation of resources"". 

I love my job and will continue to do my best for the children and families in my care but the pressure of being asked to take responsibility for an increasing number of complex cases with ever-dwindling resources means I am often unable to give them the time and attention they deserve.

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"A lot of people think we need to get a backup for Lucas, and honestly, I think we need to replace him, or at least make HIM the backup. He's a good player, but he hasn't been the same since his ACL injury, and then his injury at the beginning of last season. I know that it takes a while to come back from serious injuries, and he's had to shake off the rust and such.

I know he makes a lot of tackles, and that he loves the club and is a major force for unity in keeping the Spanish-speaking players together, but I can't help but feel like we could do better right now. He's not enough of a physical presence, but on the other hand, he picks up cards way too much. Unlike players like Roy Keane or Vieira, he doesn't impose himself on the game enough physically. He's not a player that scares the other team.

At the same time, he's not mobile enough. It seems like we're going to a 3-5-2/3-4-1-2, and if that's the case, then this becomes less of a problem, given the three CBs and the wingbacks, but if we play our 4-3-3, it will always be a question of who to put at the top of the midfield, and it will usually have to be Henderson (or Allen, maybe), because Gerrard+Lucas is too static and will get overrun by good teams. From last season's stats, he led the league in Tackles Per Game and was towards the top in Fouls Per Game as well. However, he was noticeably behind players in a similar position (Schneiderlin, Sandro, Arteta, Delph, etc.) in Interceptions. What this tells me is that he's great at breaking up the opposition's attack, but he does it in a way that can be high in fouls, often in a dangerous area, and he's not as good at cutting out that pass in the final third, which would both be better for our system and would put less pressure on our defense.

I think Lucas has a place in the team, but he certainly shouldn't be an automatic starter, for me. Lucas just seems like this weird hybrid player who doesn't totally fit the system or the role. He's not enough of a bad motherfucker to be this physically dominant, scary player, but he's also not mobile or positionally-aware enough to gracefully cut out the pass and be fluid in all stages of play.",0,1380701282,null,0,false,0,ccjfau9,t3_1nk31a,t1_ccjfau9,t3_1nk31a,null,1429273298,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

The problem is that ""serious credentials"" (as defined by the cheerleaders) is de facto defined by whether you agree with the theory of anthropogenic global warming or not.  Naturally then, all those with ""serious credentials"" find that they are believers.

That being said, if you define ""serious credentials"" to mean experts in statistics, scientists in hard non-climate fields, or expert engineers.  Then there are a lot more doubters.

true,kris_lace,null,null,"I feel we're the ""pretend top 4"". 

The reason I say that is I feel we have the ""bare minimum"" to grab a top4 slot. Where other teams have more chances. Our table position has been in my opinion heavily reliant on a moderately weak foundation.


Weak foundations?:


* Gerrard and Lucas in the middle. Typical of any MF duo, we do well when they play well we do badly when they don't. So far they've been pretty consistent only once or twice falling short of what's needed. But not only are we relying on that continued form, but (especially with Lucas) we are relying on them being fit and uninjured. On paper we have replacements for them. But can those paper replacements perform in practice? We don't have any cup or europa now to test out ""B - teams"".


* New squad, new depth, new formations - no cups or Europe to ""test them out"". These are very important foundations to have down solidly!!


* Suarez, it's not clear if he'll stay past January and the ""foundations"" he's built himself are just about supporting him in terms of his behaviour. Additionally liverpools reliance on him is also a ""weak foundation"" in of itself. However, his ability is fantastic and he's also potentially a great financial asset. Finally, if you believe the clubs press and BR, and see his attitude in the last game, his foundations are strengthening. 


* Ability to beat non-top-4-teams. Drawing with Swansea and losing to Sunderland isn't conclusive in saying we still have trouble against non-top-4-teams but it's not encouraging either. We still potentially have that weakness from last season.


* RB 

But weak foundations are not bad foundations. Because foundations just need to support the structure they don't need to do it ""well"" - and that's the point I'm making. Just because other top4 teams have better potential doesn't mean we can't beat them and comfortably come within the top 4.


Hell, already there's one example of a weak foundation working. We were reliant on a (depth-wise) very weak attack without Suarez yet Sturridge (against the odds) consistently scored. For that period our attack was a weak foundation which we comparably heavily relied on - and that worked out fine.

Here's my experience: I have had anxiety problems since I was a teen. I have them more or less under control now but last year I had a bad anxiety attack which prompted me to ask my GP for help. He arranged a phone interview with a therapist. After a couple of conversations he determined my case was not serious enough to need meds, so instead he sent me a guide (a pdf file, not a booklet) to deal with my issues and also signed me up for a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy class.

Now, here's the kicker: Not only the seminar never happened, I never heard again from them for months. The reason, which they never told me but I read in a newspaper (sorry, I can't find the article now) is that the service was being relocated at that same moment, and they were protesting about their working conditions (I think there had been layouts as well). My therapist literally told me they had forgotten about me.

Let's make it very clear that I don't blame this guy who only wanted to help me, and I support the therapists in their fight for a better service. But looking at my case from the distance the situation was very fucked-up: They could only help me by phone and mail, the only active therapy I was prescribed never happened, and my case was mislaid for months. What if I had been worse than they thought? It's not just funding, something is very wrong with the system.

Week1:  ESA, Careers allowance

Week2:  DLA, Careers allowance

Week3:  Careers allowance

Week4:  ESA, Careers allowance, Housing Benefit paid directly to the local housing association.

Under UC we'll receive:

Week 1: Careers allowance

Week 2: DLA, Careers allowance

Week 3: Careers allowance

Week 4: Careers allowance,

With Universal credit being paid in there somewhere as well.

ESA is around £500 a month, Careers allowance is around £200 and DLA is £300.

So we'll still end up with different payments at different times, with about half the money arriving on various weeks and the other half once a month.  That doesn't make budgeting any easier and in some ways makes it harder, since at the moment I do 3x weekly shops a month and know I need enough food to cover the week without ESA or DLA payments.  So if I use UC for a monthly shops I'd be trying to cram four weeks of food for four people into one freezer and I *still* can't set up direct debits since the money will be paid every four weeks rather than every month which leads to payments slowly slipping every month.  Not to mention trying to figure out if I should be using DLA and CA for shopping and UC for bills or vice versa.  When I was working and getting paid monthly I knew all my money was due on a set date, and that was reasonably simple to budget for, the above however is not.

It's a quote from a climate scientist talking about how to sort out those journal editors who publish papers they don't approve of...

&gt; This introduces a new facet to the publication of science and we should maybe have a panel that ‘reviews the editors’.

Here is [George Monbiot](http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2009/11/23/the-knights-carbonic/) on that very scandal...

&gt; There appears to be evidence here of attempts to prevent scientific data from being released(2,3), and even to destroy material that was subject to a freedom of information request(4).

&gt; Worse still, some of the emails suggest efforts to prevent the publication of work by climate sceptics(5,6), or to keep it out of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(7). I believe that the head of the unit, Phil Jones, should now resign. Some of the data discussed in the emails should be re-analysed.

Although he then goes on to dismiss this evidence as insufficient.

Personally I've stopped keeping track of it; I turned from being very much persuaded, having read the 2001 IPCC report with horror; to being appalled at the lack of scientific rigor on display by climate scientists.  I'm pretty happy therefore that there is nothing to worry about on the current evidence, and you fortunately can't hide from the truth.  The earth will not be a blistering hole in 30 years.

&gt; The other £500-£600 tends to just disappear 


Money doesn't disappear unless you are being robbed regularly :) . Work out what its being spent on and why. Not keeping track of your spending probably explains why you dont think you have enough savings.



&gt;which appears to only have a gross interest rate of 1.25%, I swore it was more...)

Most ISA or fixed 12 months savings account revert to a basic savings account with an awful savings rate after the first 12 months. You should immediately move that to a better account. I cant link because of the spam filter, but moneysavingexpert has a ton of good guides on ISAs and savings accounts.




Pension Wise;

it's really up to you. A pension is the most efficient form of savings you will ever have, but you need a retirement plan of some sort. Some people don't trust pensions, many do. A lot of the publicized issue with pension plans in the last 10-15 years were nothing to do with the type of pension you should have - they were from large companies that ran their own (usually very generous) pension funds and then ran out of money to make the pension payments to their former staff. 

The reason why basically everyone says to start the pension as soon as possible is compound interest - putting £50 a month in now is the same as if you put in £100 a month ten years from now, except you might not be able to afford that in ten years time. The sooner you put in a good amount that can get that interest building up the better. Over 50 years, that £50 you put in now typically will be worth £1500 by the time you retire. If at 31 i could have started saving again, i'd put a lot more into my pension than i have done already. The recommended level is half your age as a percentage of pre-tax salary, ie 12% of your monthly income.

The ultimate goal of any pension is to buy an Annuity. These are basically swapping your cash lump sum for a fixed income until you die. So the more pension pot you have, the better income you can have.

If you really don't trust pensions then you what you could do is put in the maximum that your employer will match to. This gives you the most benefit for least cost. Then you should also start your own regularly savings plan that you don't use for anything else. You'll need to aim to put in enough for a decent retirement pot (which by my reckoning is ~500-750k) - as well as what your pension would give you, so there's a fair bit of sums to be done. There's plenty of pension calculators out there (google) to help you work out how much you need and how much each option should generate. 



In terms of credit;

hmm, then you might not be able to withdraw without penalty - talk to your bank and ask them if you can transfer out with no costs.
edit : the other explanation might be if its a 'regular' saver - those tend to only have around half the advertised rate, due to them only ever being full at the end of the term.

&gt; I don't think I could trust having my own retirement pot so maybe I should aim for a personal pension. I understand what an Annuity is, do people also take out something like 25% when they hit pension age? Also, if I die after say only 2 years of using my pension, does the rest of the money go to next of kin?

it's optional. You are allowed to take up to 25% from the fund as a lump sum. Death depends on the annuity. Its kinda like car insurance in that it depends what options you've paid for - take a look at http://moneyover55.about.com/od/shouldyoubuyanannuity/a/buyannuity_5.htm for some of the various options that are available.

&gt; A Tribute to Steve McIntyre
&gt; ***************************
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry, this is so good that I had to put it in the top post, but apologies if it has already appeared on this blog.
&gt; 
&gt; It was gleaned from “Deltoid” at:
&gt; 
&gt; http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2006/02/nas_panel_deja_vu.php
&gt; 
&gt; and is the following posting by Ken Miles in response to:
&gt; 
&gt; “McIntyre is in fact, an industry shill and has a powerful motive for promulgating the climate change pseudoscience he’s become famous for. If you think otherwise, you’re going to have to do better than this.”
&gt; 
&gt; Ken’s response was spot on:
&gt; 
&gt; “I’ve got to (partially) stick up for McIntyre here. Compared with most (all?) of the clowns who make the ranks of global warming skeptics, McIntyre is far and away the best of them. He does publish in peer reviewed journals (not just Energy &amp; Environment) and he has raised some genuine concerns (such as access to data – I’m staying away from the more technical arguments as I don’t know enough to judge).
&gt; 
&gt; He does tend to overplay his hand a bit, and climateaudit is a cesspool of idiots, but still credit should be given where it’s due.”

true,I_have_secrets,null,null,"By asking these questions it shows you are responsible. Therefore be prepared to look at your situation honestly and consider changing it for the better. 

By having low savings and low credit score does not do favours for you. However, your credit score should already have a positive mark for you if you are paying your Student Loan on time every month, as you are showing you have a regular income and on time loan payments. So, there's a plus side for you. 


In regards to £500-£600 ""just disappears"", this is not acceptable. That is a lot of money a month and works out to £7200pa. You will need to analyse your bank statement and assess what are necessary vs what are unnecessary outgoings. (For example, petrol/travel is essential but a meal out needs to be a meal in to save costs. Also, regular takeaways will cost a fortune so you need to learn to budget yourself accordingly). This will help make a massive difference to your savings. 


In regards to a pension, I personally do not have one and due to my family and friends experiences it seems to be a complete gamble. Who knows what the economy will be like by the time you retire? In an ideal world, you will have a fat juicy payout, but from what I have seen unless you have a pension with an amazing company, you will not receive as much as first though out. (Here's some food for thought, some public sector workers have to pay into a pension until the age of 65. If however, an individual decides to change profession at any time, that pension will be null and void. That's seems fair right?) So, consider yourself fortunate you have a choice in the matter. No one can tell you what the best route to take is in regards to a pension, it all depends on your current financial position and whether you can afford one. 


In regards to the credit card. Get one. Make sure it is 0% interest, cap your limit to about £1k-£2k and ONLY USE IT FOR WHAT YOU USE ANYWAY. I cannot stress this enough, people see credit cards as golden tickets to buy what they like. No. Just no. I personally see the point of a credit card as nothing more than to improve my credit score. I use it for petrol, food shopping and the odd bill, nothing more than what I would already pay for anyway. And for the love of all that is holy, please please please make sure you pay the bill on time otherwise this can be very bad for your credit score. Be responsible, be careful and your credit rating will improve and allow you more options in life.

Good luck friend.

I agree with your first statement, I've pretty much been dropped in to the 'real world' (so kind of a wakeup/shock coming from University) without any kind of guide/information. Most of my friends and the area I come from don't even think about this kind of stuff so I was not sure where to go for advice.

Does money in a pension get interest/invested at all or does it just stay as whatever is put in? I assume, now that I've typed it out, it depends on who/what the pension plan is.

The financial adviser is from an external company (New England finance) , our company pays him to give us financial advice, so I am not sure of his intentions (edit: that sounds more malicious than I mean).

I am also very politically unaware (again, similar to now knowing much about finance, sheltered, bad area, etc), so I currently wouldn't be able to even begin imagining what potential effect on my pension it would have.",0,1380711431,null,0,1380712081,0,ccjgg5y,t3_1nknis,t1_ccjgg5y,t1_ccjgdjn,null,1429272762,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Dismissing the peer-review process as a conspiracy to deny the publication of work that goes against a political agenda is simply nuts.

I'm not dismissing peer-review.  I've worked as a researcher, and possibly know more about it than you do (statistically guessing that most people aren't researchers).  However, there is evidence that perfectly adequate science is being kept from publication on political rather than scientific grounds.

&gt; He also completely agreed with the findings of the Russel Inquiry, which showed that ""there is no evidence of fraud, manipulation or a lack of rigour and honesty on the part of the CRU scientists. The science is sound; the IPCC has not been compromised"".

Yes; well I didn't say he had completely reversed his position.  I was addressing the question about what scandal I was talking about.  I didn't expect him to then say ""well then, all climate science is wrong"".  I even stated that he dismissed it as insufficient, so you're simply telling me what I already said.

&gt; Why do you think that there is nothing to worry about concerning increasing global temperatures, retreating glaciers, rising sea levels, and acidifying oceans? 

Perhaps I wasn't clear: I don't find the evidence that those things are occurring convincing.  Hence I don't worry about them.

Like it or not, not everyone can make something of themselves. Because of their economic or social background, they may not have the same opportunities as those with backgrounds with higher level jobs or education. Our society also *needs* people who don't make something of themselves, so to say. Our society would not function without base level, low qualification jobs. 

However, this 'land of opportunity' ideology pushes the idea that anyone and everyone can make something of themselves, therefore saying that if someone doesn't have something (as in a lot of money or a job they like), it is their own fault, not society in general. In America, this is often used as an argument against things like universal healthcare. 'If you can't afford the insurance bills, it isn't my fault you didn't put more effort in to have more money in the first place. I shouldn't have to pay for you to be a failure', or something along those lines.

They just get on their bicycle and try to get from point A to point B without getting hit by a car, being completely baffled as to why cars and other cyclists seem to stop arbitrarily at a crossroads when there doesn't seem to be anyone coming. I'm also pretty sure they only cycle on the left-hand side of the road when there are cars around, as they can just about fathom they are less likely to get hit if they travel in the same direction as traffic.

In this case, the woman was wondering why there was some kind of red and white barrier blocking half the road next to the long-bits-of-metal-in-the-ground, so she did what any zombie trying to get from A to B would do: go around it.

and most english people don't live in London. 

If I were welsh, I'd pay £3600 a year for the course I currently pay  £9000 a year for. That means over the course of my Bs I'm going to pay £16,200 more than someone born 20 miles west of me, even though I'm not any more well off than most welsh people. If the council back in england want to build a sport's centre, they're paying for it out of their own (and by extension, english peoples') pockets, whereas here you apply for an EU grant, get handed half the money, and have no obligation to pay it back. Who do you think pays into the EU to fund that grant? you bet, english people. 

Being welsh or scottish means your life is subsidised by english people, amd to a lesser extent european people too.

When I had pretty rubbish credit (not from mistakes, just not ever having credit before, like yourself!) I got myself a student credit card, from BOS, which has an interest rate of something like 27%. I've not paid a penny on it, because as soon as I activated the card I set up a standing order to pay it off in full before the due date. I use it much like a debit card, and pay for fuel and groceries every month, and then it gets automatically paid off before I have to pay interest on it. 

The only thing you have to be careful about with this, is that you'll be paying for things the month after you've bought them. This means you could well look at your account and go 'oh, I've not bought anything this month, and I've still got £200 in there, I'm going to treat myself to x,y,z' and then not have enough to pay off the credit card.

One way around this is to have automatic payments coming out of a different account from your main current account, and after every single purchase on your credit card, go online and transfer money from your current account to the account that will pay off your card. 

If you're only looking to build up credit then I'd recommend just buying your monthly travel pass or petrol money, or some other mostly fixed cost every month on your credit card, and within a year (as long as you don't do anything crazy) you should be seeing a big difference to your credit.",0,1380723247,null,0,false,0,ccjitmc,t3_1nknis,t1_ccjitmc,t1_ccjgh91,null,1429271564,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I see no reason why Liverpool shouldn't be considered a title contender this year.  Every team has weaknesses (Chelsea has no striker, ManU/City has coaching issues, Arsenal has no depth)...in fact, Tottenham appears to have come out with the fewest weak points.  Arsenal at this point appears to have the most ""complete"" first team, but they are also one or two injuries away from disaster.

I believe that this year, of all years, is the most wide open at the top of the league and I think any of the top 6 teams is fully capable of winning it.  I think that any given week, everyone is in danger of dropping points.  I also think that since last January, we have been goal for goal with every team (except Arsenal who has been beastly over the last half year...basically if they stay in current form they would score over 100 points in league).

We are currently in 2nd place, we have arguably the best strike partnership in the league, we have one of the best young creative midfielders, we have Gerrard (at the twilight of his career, which means he is intensely motivated for one last push), a very strong back line that is still working to gel, and one of the best shot stoppers in the league.

One option is to ignore the pension entirely till you've paid off the house, however, I did the maths in various previous threads on here, and basically. the rule is this. **if, after paying off your house, you are prepared to dump between 1-2k a month into a pension every month till you retire, then you get approximately the same effect as having saved a pension over the same period of time**

I don't personally believe that most people are capable of doing that though.



So, your plan is to wait 3 years and put how much in ? The problem is that the longer you leave your pension the more you need to put in to make up for the years you haven't. 

Lets say you put all of that £350 a month in from 28-70. After inflation that gives you a monthly retirement income of ~ £930.


If you want to retire at 60, you would only get £463 a month. 

So really you need to think about two questions 1) what age you want to retire at 2) how much income will be enough when you do retire.

From that, you can work out how much you need to save and for how long

You don't imagine that the climategate stuff was all there was?  We just got a glimpse of what's going on behind the scenes.  We cannot know what's in emails that have never been made public; but behaviour like the above will not be isolated, nor is it even remotely acceptable from scientists.  Whichever side of the debate you fall on, surely you feel a little creeped out by the behaviour of these scientists?

&gt; We are talking about evidence. Ultimately, that's what determines whether our actions are legitimate or not.

Okay; if you insist.  I'm pretty sure I explained what I meant; but you've jumped on my introductory phrase.  You're obviously not happy with my position, nor with my position that I'm happy to leave everyone else to their own positions.  It's an especially strange thing to attack, since you're the one who used it to ask whether I thought others were okay to differ with me -- and I responded in the affirmative.  I'm really not sure what we're getting from this now; other than you disagree with me and are not happy about that.

As to evidence: the problem is that the ""evidence"" is the output of computer simulations.  Simulations are encoded hypotheses, not evidence.  Vast quantities of studies all just run different simulations on the same underlying datasets.  Those datasets often turn out to be not as solid as they are purported -- I recall one case where they'd even flipped one of the time series upside down completely in order to show temperature increasing with time (I think accidentally).  The ""adjustments"" that get applied in the name of correcting for UHI are dreadful, and the cherry picking of particular series to get the desired result is just bad science.

&gt; If you want to ignore evidence that your actions are causing harm, then you will need to deal with any legal consequences that may follow.

Will do; thanks for the legal advice.

Would you say the same though?  If there turned out to be no global warming; and yet in its name fuel taxes had been increased, and then some percentage of old people who couldn't afford that bill subsequently died -- would you say that that deserved legal consequences?  When millions of poor people are plunged further into poverty because of green taxes -- will you take responsibility for them?  I certainly don't want you to, but we should be clear that there are bad side effects to both sides actions or inactions, so let's not pretend that the sceptics are just a bunch of evil oil industry shills who only care about money and mincing up the developing world.  Personally I just want the truth; and I don't see it from the climate scientists.

true,Lozzy1256,null,null,"The best way, if you can trust yourself, is to sign up to Experians 30 day free trial. I've done it a few times, and as long as you remember to cancel it's ok. You need to search Experian Credit Score, and then you have to put in your details and set up a payment, but you get the first 30 days free. You'll get a letter in the post after about a week, with a special key to put in, which will give you full access to your credit score. Just remember to CANCEL!!!!

The score they give you is out of 999. The higher it is, the better it is. It will show you all the financial information they have on you, for example, any credit cards, store accounts, and who you're tied to financially (if you and your fiance have a joint account then this will come up in this section - my credit took a hit when my fiance and I got our first account together!) 

At the top there will be a graph, showing where you are, with some points. Green points are good, they'll say things like 'high credit limit' or 'credit lines have been open for a long time', orange points are things which they're flagging as something which could be an issue, and red points are bad things like 'credit line only recently opened', 'at risk of revolving credit' (i.e. opening many credit cards and only using them for a month or two then closing them again).

People in the high 900 are the sorts of people who are approved for low mortgage rates (obviously, they take into account other things like existing debt and income!), low interest (or no-interest) credit cards, and also credit cards with good cashback/reward schemes.(Although, recently the big supermarkets seem to be offering cashback schemes with REALLY high interest rates to anyone).

People in the mid-scores are the sorts of people who would be approved for some sort of credit card. People with low scores, or who do not have much of a history (we fall into this category because we're young and haven't built up a reputation for ourselves yet) generally have to get 'starter' credit cards, in order to build up our score. A good way of doing this is through a student account, although you're now past that. If you had a student account at uni, and transferred that to a graduate account (not sure how many banks do that, though) you might be able to apply for a graduate card, which could very well have better rates and maybe some perks, than other starter cards. 

Generally starter cards have very high interest rates and no perks, like cashback. They're a stop-gap, to prove that you can be trusted. They'll probably also have a pretty low limit. Mine started at £250, went up to £500, and then recently was increased again to £1000, all in just less than a year, so if you're careful it doesn't take TOO long to go from an otherwise empty credit report to a very strong looking one. 

Just be careful not to pay interest, remember to keep saving, and CANCEL your free trial before the 30 days are up. 

Oh, and when you cancel you'll be asked if you want to keep paying something like £5 a month to keep the insurance side of Experian. You don't.

While we're talking about saving, you really should be setting up an ISA. See if you can find one with a good rate, but remember that that rate will only last for a year, so next year you'll have to change it. The tax year runs from April to April, and throughout that year any interest you earn on the money in your ISA will be tax free. You can save up to £5500 (I think) both in a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA. I'd recommend your plain old boring cash ISA to start with, and set up a direct debit to automatically put some money into your ISA as soon as you get paid. I've been putting £40 away every month, for a few years now, and it does add up quickly. I also move any money that I have left over at the end of the month (after paying bills, ISA money, regular savings, and credit card, plus whatever I spend on food and luxuries that month) into my ISA as well. I don't miss that £40 because I never see it, and the money from the end of the month isn't going to get spent anyway, but it's good to have some savings.

He plays a role for us but so often looks off the pace of the game when the opposition raise their tempo.

1) Government says they will help.

3) House prices go up, mean while people still buy. 

4) All of a sudden...pop! Bubble bursts and prices start crumbling down. Those without a fixed rate mortgage start seeing interest rates creep up.

5) Lots of people try to panic sell, getting rid of these houses they don't fully own which leaves the government responsible for buying them back. 

6) The economy starts to really tremble under the pressure and taxes start to rapidly increase due to the speed in which the government are buying back these houses, with money they still don't have. Maybe we will see some more money being printed. 

7) Recession 2019. When everyone was meant to happily sell or remortgage and pay off the government, things have taken a complete turn for the worst with banks failing once again.

Imo, I'd prefer to have Silva on the right instead of Navas, esp. in the second half and here's my reasoning:

Expect Bayern to have more possession with Schweiny dictating play. Yaya's role is to eliminate Schweiny and I've already kinda explained why playing Navas gives Yaya space to run into where playing Silva doesn't.

You're already thinking it's better to give Yaya space to run into, but that leaves space behind him for Schweiny to exploit. Keeping Yaya deeper to outmuscle Schweiny and play a DLP role works better with creative forces like Nasri-Aguero-Silva infront, and Yaya is right footed, so if Silva creates space on Yaya's right side, that puts Schweiny on his back foot to defend and Yaya can then play through that way.

The double pivot is needed when up against Gotze and Schweiny, it's how Chelsea did it with Lampard, mind you the players are different, but the roles are the same.

true,Lozzy1256,null,null,"Generally it doesn't look bad to have a lot of different accounts, as long as they're not all overdrawn. The biggest problem is if you look like you're 'churning' for rewards (i.e. opening an account to get the £100 for opening, then closing it, then opening one at another banks for the £100). You won't look like you're churning if you have a current account, a credit card, and a few savings options. The older you get the more complicated it will get anyway. When my dad died and we had to sort through all his banking stuff... wow that was a hassle! It was perfectly organised, but oh my word he had a lot of accounts!

ISA's can be transferred. So, for example, if this year you had opened an ISA with Halifax on the 5th of April, and saved the full £5500 before next April (because that's when the year changes), at their introductory rate of, say 3%. For 12 months you will receive 3% interest on this. After next April your interest rate will likely drop down to basic rate, which is probably something around 0.5%. At this point you want to transfer your ISA to a better deal. Say the Nationwide starts offering  3.25% interest rate for 12 months, you'll want to transfer there. What you need to do is go into the Nationwide and ask for the form (I cannot for the life of me remember what it's called, but they'll know what you mean if you go in and tell them you want to transfer as existing ISA to them.) They will then take your £5500 (or whatever you did manage to save up) and put it into your new account, and that continues to be your limit for the previous year. You now have £5500 from last year earning 3.25%, AND you have another allowance for this year of £5500 (or whatever they set it as) also at 3.25%. The year after, maybe Nationwide drops their rate as well, and you want to move to Lloyds. Lloyds are only offering 2%, but it's still better than the 0.5% that Nationwide has dropped you to. You need to go to Lloyds and ask for the transfer form. Now you've got two years worth of £5500 (or, whatever you saved in the previous years) PLUS a limit of £5500 to save up over that year, all at 2%.

ISA's were originally brought in to help encourage people who wouldn't otherwise save at all, to set up long term savings. It can be hassle to change your ISA every year, (my nice rates always run out at exam time!), but it is just once a year, and is really good for getting going. 

If you've not set up a good emergency fund yet, then set up an ACCESS cash ISA. This means that you're able to access the money any time, so if there's some sort of emergency (you need to travel to see sick relatives, the washing machine breaks, etc) you can get a hold of the money if you need to. However, after the first year, move that into a normal savings account and keep that as your emergency fund, and then start putting your money into fixed term ISAs which last for either 1 or 3 years. These tend to have better interest rates, because you can't access your money that easily without suffering a penalty or some kind. These are a really good deal, but you MUST have a good emergency fund set up before you go down that route, so stick to a cash ISA for the first few years to build up a good emergency fund.

EDIT: With regards to having more than one account - make sure you set up online banking for them all. Honestly it's a lifesaver to just be able to move money around instantly at any time of the day or night, and it's super easy to sort out automatic payments (whether for rent or to 'pay yourself' with savings)",0,1380728859,null,0,false,0,ccjksl4,t3_1nknis,t1_ccjksl4,t1_ccjkg50,null,1429270611,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,JRugman,null,null,"&gt; ""I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out somehow - even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is !""

The papers that that quote refers to are by McKitrick and Michaels, one from 2003 and another from 2004. Both had already been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and both were included in the IPCC AR4 report.

The other two quotes show that the people involved were clearly interested in rejecting the papers based on perceived scientific inadequacies.

&gt; As to evidence: the problem is that the ""evidence"" is the output of computer simulations.

Absolutely not true. The evidence supporting the consensus on climate change is gathered from many different areas, and the fact that they are all in general agreement is what provides the high degree of certainty behind the IPCCs conclusions.

For example, measurements of the incoming and outgoing radiation at the top of the atmopshere distinctly show that more energy is being absorbed in the infrared spectrums associated with key greenhouse gases. This matches with modeled estimates of the climate's energy balance, and shows that the warming over recent decades has had a strong anthropogenic component.

Some of the impacts of the warming climate can already be observed - rising sea levels, shrinking arctic ice, receding glaciers, increasing heatwaves and precipitation events, and migrating ecological habitats.  

None of the probles you have with the evidence are enough to overturn the consensus on climate change. Some of the research that has been donemay not have been perfect, but in the case you mentioned other paleoclimate reconstructions have been carried out by other teams that have supported the original findings.

Why do you think that the adjustments made to temperature data sets to take the Urban Heat Island effect into accout are dreadful?

The reason why I'm asking you to explain your position in more detail is because the people who are going to suffer harm from climate change are probably not going to be the ones responsible for causing it. Where is the moral justification for continuing to enjoy a high-carbon lifestyle when the true costs are going to be paid by those who saw no benefit from it?

If tackling carbon emissions means raising the cost of carbon-intensive energy by taxation, then why shouldn't the revenue raised be used to mitigate energy poverty until lower-carbon energy alternatives become more widely available?

Other newspapers publish apologies and retractions and clarifications when they get something wrong or over step the mark. Freedom of the press does not mean journalists get to ignore common decency. This is nothing to do with legality, there's no legal case being presented by Miliband, this is to do with whether the DM wants to be a paper that is responsible and bases its political reporting on facts or whether it wants to peddle hate fuelled lies and scaremongering.  

When David Cameron, Nick Clegg and the Telegraph all say the DM went too far then it's safe to say it went to far, this is not a party political issue, this is about the fact that we don't conduct politics by screeching 'unbritish!' accusations at people, we're not America, we don't do the pledge of allegiance thing, we don't have 'loyalty' tests, we regard anyone who obeys the laws and pays their taxes and muddles through honestly as doing enough to be trusted as a citizen, whether they support monarchy or republicanism or communism or capitalism or atheism or Islam. By saying that as a Marxist Ralph Miliaband 'hated Britain' the DM is saying that loyalty to this country is tied to a person's politics, irrespective of their actions, it's appointing itself as the national thought police and that is far more troubling than a demand for a frankly deserved apology.

So many new build properties that is currently not the greatest area. What will happen in the next decade is all the 'roughness' to it will be pushed out as prices in the area start increasing. People will be forced to move and it will become the next 'new' place to be. Such is the way.

And Miliband has spoken out for his convictions and stood up to powerful press elites before - he supports independent (non governmental) press regulation which Murdoch and Dacre absolutely oppose, they of course want to keep the existing system where the press pretends to regulate itself. It was Miliband who demanded a public inquiry in the HoC when the hacking revelations came about - hence Leveson. 

Murdoch and Dacre are *really* powerful in British politics, I have great respect for Ed as a politician who needs to win over the centre voters who read their papers being prepared to publicly criticise them. Blair and Brown would not have dared. 

Add to this his clause four type confrontation with trade unions over how they were allegedly collecting membership fees in Falkirk (although the matter was dropped by the police and internal investigators so it looks like there may have been misinformation at work there) - being prepared to forgo a major source of campaign funding to stick to moral principles is not the actions of a career politician. Even though the specific Falkirk case has been dropped he's still pressed ahead with reforms requiring opt-in donations instead of opt-out ones etc. Compare that with the smoke screen around big Tory party donors.

It's really not clear to me that they are being taught it that way, though.

I doubt if there are any English teachers that don't show the class a movie adaptation as part of studying a play.

Movie adaptations of Shakespeare have for years been messing with more modern tropes - there's the version of *Romeo &amp; Juliet* in which DiCaprio portrays Romeo packing a '45, and I'm sure there was a version of *Macbeth* (although I can't find the details now) done in the 90s with a WWII / nazi theme, in which the king was portrayed as a powerful dictator. 

Is it wrong for English teachers show these modern movie adaptations to pupils who are studying the play?

I don't for sure what exactly Johns is referring to, but it certainly looks like he means that Royal Shakespeare Company's 2009 film adaptation, and I don't see why any teacher would not show that to students. I think that race has nothing to do with it. 

It really looks like they're criticising this one movie they've vaguely heard of, because they don't like it, and criticising the teachers that study. How actors and film-directors want to interpret Shakespeare is apparently not worthy of study, if Mr Gove doesn't approve of the adaptation's soundtrack.

true,SaradaV,lfc68,,"This isn't technically correct I don't think. Suarez was given a greater than three game ban because his bite was deemed an 'extraordinary incident', for which the FA can take action even if the event is seen and noted by the officials at the time. This was bought in after Ben Thatcher's elbow on Pedro Mendes for which he was booked but still received an eight game ban from the FA. So even if the referee had seen the Suarez incident, and even if he had booked him for it, the FA could still have banned him for ten games.

The reason the FA ""can't"" take any action against Torres is because an official claims to have seen the incident, and unlike the Suarez case it hasn't been deemed an 'extraordinary incident' worth more than a three game ban by the FA. 

As for Defoe, that incident occurred after the Ben Thatcher incident so the FA could have taken action against Defoe if they'd deemed the incident as an 'extraordinary incident' and worthy of greater than a three game ban (it was misreported by several national newspapers that the Defoe incident occurred before the Thatcher incident). The FA didn't deem Defoe's bite as an 'extraordinary incident' presumably because the footballing community wasn't frothing at the gash for Defoe to be harshly punished in the same way that it was following the Suarez bite.

- Navas (while losing the ball often) is attacking Bayern. We're too one-sided in that regard, but he is getting the ball up. If we could overlap, we might have something.

- Bayern respects Yaya, which is why they're pressing him. If he can build a one-two type scheme with Ferna, he can get the ball up.

 Another issue for me seems to have been the sheer amount of cables and pipes they had to move.  It seemed every time a hole was dug, new services were found that had to be moved (I lived on the route when this was done and it was a total never ending pain)

I think the council really lost control of the project, and then the council were let down at times.

As far as I can tell, the arbitrary notion that people should work eight hours per day doesn't make them any more productive. They just have to be in the office and appear to be doing some work for a set period of time each day, regardless of how long it actually takes to do the real work. 

In fact, employing people for set hours just discourages working hard - you're paid for being there, not for doing anything. By contrast, if you give somebody a target of achieving a certain amount of stuff each day, they're likely to work a damn sight harder if it means they can leave two hours earlier. 

Obviously achievement is not an easy thing to measure, so implementing such a scheme is difficult. However, I don't think - considering its massive implications for everyone's quality of life - that it has been pursued anywhere near enough.

The other reason I stopped paying is the way they report Scotland. The BBC is not fair, nor are they balanced about Scotland. On the recent newsnight with the SNP, they invited UKIP and George fucking Galloway (neither of which have any support in Scotland) onto the show but noone from the other Scottish parties who support a yes vote.

As such, supporters were unabashedly pro-labour and in the 80's (when I grew up in Liverpool) to proclaim yourself a conservative on the Kop would be akin to showing up in an Everton strip. This is not to say that capitalism was not a part of Liverpool's dominance, it certainly was, but football clubs (and sporting teams in general, I suppose) function as symbols in proxy wars and LFC certainly represented an ethos of socialism, both on and off the pitch.

Few people under 25 actually turn up and vote (although I would argue that in many cases this is a structural problem with our electoral register - particularly for students who tend to be registered where their parents live but reside on the other side of the country.) 

In addition though the majority of the conservative voter-base is over 30. Their research will have shown them that those people under 30 who vote conservative probably do so for deeply ideological reasons and are likely to continue to support them - not just in spite of this new move but **because** of it.

I have mixed feelings about it. On the one hand it now seems to be ""ageist"" to even question whether people over 65 should retire or downsize homes... whilst simultaneously saying people under 25 have less social worth and shouldn't be entitled to help from the state. On the flip side the conservatives do have a point that to some extent the welfare state is self-perpetuating. It **is** far to easy to resign yourself to a life on the state at a young age. Removing that help would be a serious shock to the system for a lot of youngsters... but you have to be careful not to create a monster... ultimately a young generation that grows up in a sort of ""help yourself or die because nobody else will"" environment might not be very socially minded when it comes to paying for their grandparents care in later life. 

The real question though is what will happen to those youngsters that cannot find work or education... particularly those without family support.

Some areas have better developed care pathways than others, even in the area I study in with some very well developed pathways there is virtually ***nothing*** aimed at mental health. Mental health patients will be taken to hospital, and put in a room with soft furnishings, and often locked  in if they are 'Proper mental health' as some people refer to it.

The mental health policies in place are laughable: They rely on the staff having the training to identify one mental health condition from the other, how to recognise an episode of a current condition. This is training many many staff have not had, and is lacking on university educated staff as well. If you do feel confident enough to, say, work with a diagnosis of a depressive episode; all that is required is a tick box form about meaningless metrics with no real relevance to the situation at hand.

This leaves ambulance crews with one option for *almost* all mental health patients: Take them in, have them sit in a room for a while, and make sure to fax a form to social services. (If that trust even has similar policies) This is the same path for a patient who is on the extreme; cutting their throat and running around in the street whilst stabbing himself to a little old lady who's depressed and stopped medicating. 

Although the ambulance service and NHS hospitals really good work together now, mental health really lets everyone down.

true,Kousetsu,eng-lincolnshire,Humberside motherfucker!,"Not everyone, but some of my best friends. After leaving uni, 3 of my friends set up a business - it hasn't turned out well. I have been homeless, one of my friends (who started the business) has only *just* (as of yesterday) been homed. I myself have been made redundant twice in the last year, and a lot of the jobs I have had haven't been viable for a number of reasons (beyond my control.)  
My boyfriend is also disabled and suffers from depression etc, so he would be pretty fucked too. I'm already worried about the re-examination he will be having next year. My main worry is probably the stress it will cause, and him having a rare condition will make this even more stressful.    
It may seem hard to believe, but doing things like this will effect *a lot* of good people, who could really benefit this society eventually. They just need the help to be able to get there - and this is what we are doing at the moment by being on benefits. Believe me - they aren't fun to live on. And having your money (read as: life) decided by a ratty civil servant once a week isn't my idea of the high-life.  

This policy is ridiculous for everyone I know and our situations. Myself, I don't have parents I can just get support from, because they both have mental illnesses. My homeless friend - he can't go live with his parents because he is gay and his dad basically hates him for it. My other friends parents are poor - they rely on the state to care for him right now because how can his single-mum look after a 23 year old on a part-time cleaners wage? This policy is just going to hurt people - not help them at all. Infact, I can't help but feel that it must be made specifically to hurt people. I cannot believe that Cameron is in so much of a dream-world that he would think this would be beneficial - or even viable - for the majority of families this would effect.   
Middle-class kids with families that could/would support them aren't putting themselves through the weekly hell that is the Job Centre. So I don't see how this policy will actually work. Noone is there if they can help it - trust me. It isn't a nice place.

I think the only way to make a shorter day not imply unpaid overtime is to make it the norm. People working six hours today might be expected to work a couple more to make it up to a 9-5, just because that's what tradition says it's 'supposed' to be. When you factor into account the unpaid overtime that a lot of people already work - probably often taking their working hours up to 9/10 per day, you can see that even this would be an improvement. 

Another thing that I think is important is transport. A *lot* of people commute into large cities. On average, this probably takes an hour to three hours out of their day (for me, it's probably three and a half). In many ways, they're effectively 'working' in this time - it's necessary for them to get to the place where they can work. However, this isn't recognised or paid for by employers or the public.

true,Vaneshi,cnty-england,Midlander trapped in Hampshite,"&gt; It looks like your saying majority of DWP employees will look after their buddies who are all long term dole recipients

No.  However you are correct.  I remember hearing two DWP workers chatting about a 3rd who was being suspended.  He was not only working for the DWP but signing on 5 times.  The two women agreed that 3 times was the acceptable maximum and 5 was really taking the piss.   That was in 'Portsmouth 2' upper office, the one with the entrance near the arcade for those wondering.   I've heard similar conversations from other DWP employees as well. 

&gt; advantage of new ""shell shocked"" claimants (apparently loosing your job makes you shell shocked?)

You've just lost your job, your savings and assets are all gone (if they weren't you wouldn't be there signing because they wouldn't let you).  Most people wind up stunned/shell shocked about how they are being treated, they wanted the scroungers punished... now they're a scrounger and being treated as such.

&gt; ""cause and effect"",

Cause:  You ask a question.
Effect:  Someone provides an honest answer but not the one that you happen to agree with, so you call them a... dickhead was it?

And you now seem horribly confused about what is actually in reference to what post forming a misshapen gestalt who's mess it seems, yet again, I have to deal with. 

&gt; you sound like a troll.

Seeing as how you can't keep a straight thought in your head.  I would return such sentiment in spades.

I dunno. I think people are generally capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's not so hard to carry the two ideas in your head at the same time: the responsibility of the government's policy and that of the individual making misguided choices.

But posters were merely commenting here that people like tezmo666's friends who took ""dodgy pills off scummy dealers at festivals etc"" should at least ""bear some responsibility"" - some, not all. [And that's the point where you came in and called that victim-blaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1nfnj5/man_dies_after_taking_bad_ecstasy_at_warehouse/cci598o). 

You seem to be arguing that acknowledging any responsibility whatsoever for the individual - even those buying ""dodgy pills off scummy dealers at festivals etc"" - would ruin the argument that the government policy is bad. I think most people are smarter than that; many will be able to see that it can both be true. Especially here, where obviously the great majority is already in favour of some form of legalization.

Ahhh, Keegan and Toshack, a pair who's understanding was believed to be telepathic. 

Really.

A TV crew brought them to have their 'psychic powers' tested, as part of a light-hearted feature on the two. In a studio, one concentrated on a card the other couldn't see, the other had to guess the card. This would disprove any 'psychic link'! 

Except, after a brief, shaky start they got a card correct. Then the next. And the next. And all the rest. Without fail, they correctly guessed all the remaining cards. The odds against this being a coincidence were astronomic. The TV crew left, slack-jawed, apparently with 'proof' of the Liverpool front line's paranormal advantage.

Of course they weren't psychic. 

One of them noticed you were able to see a reflection of the cards in a glass partition in the studio, and when they swapped places the little secret was passed on.

Mind you, this didn't come out until some while later. It was felt it was better to let the rest of the league wonder was it true, and then worry how on earth to defend against an apparently psychic strikeforce!

true,strolls,null,null,"It may not be as ""evil"" as the title makes out, but I think he does show himself to be out of touch.

He talks about vegetables being rejected because they're ""funny shaped"" and that they should be sold cheaper ""in local shops"" - I just think this is a bit simplistic.

I mean, for a starters, are supermarkets supposed to sabotage their own business by having other local shops sell it cheaper?

I already buy the cheapest carrots in the store (not the prettiest) and they're already ridiculously cheap. What he seems to be implying is that I should buy them from somewhere else and Tesco should deprive themselves of the profit. 

The tory magic of the market says that, actually, as people get poorer, they won't be able to afford nice-shaped carrots any more, and Tesco will be glad to sell them the ugly ones for a cheaper price. 

I just don't think there's any sense to what he says - I suspect his political speciality is something quite outside this field. At least I hope so.

I think these ""ugly"" carrots are thrown out because we produce more food than we need in this country. And I'm inclined to think that's actually kinda a good thing - that every government worldwide wants to produce more than they need, so that a lean year doesn't leave us short. I think that's why we have farm subsidies (although I could be wrong).

Finally, there's the logistics of this. I mean, 1.5kg of the cheapest carrots in Tesco already cost only 59p - I don't know how they could be transported for less, frankly. 

He also mentions local shops, but the very nature of supermarkets and modern food retail in general is that local stores can't and don't want to meet all our needs. I can't imagine the corner shop wanting to give shelf space to something as large as 1.5kg of carrots, that offers - what? - only 10p profit. They can make as much profit on a freakin' Freddo, these days!

So am I to carry twice as many carrots home on the bus from Tesco? And store them? Because 1.5kg of carrots already takes up quite a bit of space in the fridge. I think they might go off, if I'm to buy a month's worth at a time.

It all comes back to, if it were viable to sell carrots for half price, Tesco would be doing it already, ""ugly"" ones or not. I don't think the bloke knows what he's on about.

This MP might actually be well intentioned, but he seems to be saying that people shouldn't rely on food banks because it's immoral for us to allow them not to work. That bloody well *is* Dickensian.

When people are in negative equity, for example, they can't afford to move house and this contributes to a stagnant housing market.

I don't know what the score has been with negative equity in the last couple of years, but I certainly knew people who were in that situation following the 2008 crash. Their own fault? Sure, but the current help-to-buy scheme will get them out of negative equity, at the cost of inflating away your savings.

The evidence is that herds of people in large numbers will do stupid things.

Anyone who reads /r/marketing will tell you that you can improve sales by measurable percentages just by changing the colour of a ""buy now"" button, or making it larger, or by reducing the number of clicks to the checkout. 

So what's going to happen when you deregulate the banks and the credit card companies, and let them loose on 60 million people? Well, some of those people are going to be dumb enough to get into debt.

And their fault or not, not only does that affect the economy, but those jerks vote, too, so they might just vote for politicians who will use your taxes to bail them out.

If you and /u/DevilishRogue are such responsible savers, I don't see why it should bother you if it's harder to get a loan, get a second mortgage on a house or acquire consumer credit in general. Yes, that would be ""protecting stupid people"", but the only ones who profited from the deregulations were the banks and the credit card companies.

I mean, I don't mind the banks and the credit card companies making a profit, but I don't mind them being regulated, either.

I kinda think the world is a more pleasant place without marketing executives trying to find more ways to get ""buy now, pay later"" advertising through my letterbox and in front of my eyeballs.

true,MiniPenguino,lfc99,,"Rodgers has been lucky as shit this season and with our current form. I see no reason why the hell we should be winning these games. It's not like we are creating great chances and making the opposition make clear mistakes. Rodgers has relied on Coutinho for so much of his attack and didn't have a clear back-up when he got injured. 

We're playing a fucking 3-4-1-2. Who the fuck does that? It's a crazy system that is molded in order to fit our plethora of CBs in the game while eliminating the full-backs who are either injured or completely out of form. He's pushing Suarez and Sturridge together up top similarly to how Dalglish pushed Carroll and Suarez together. While it seems like it's working right now, I don't think that it is actually going to in the near future. 

Also, Moses? Really? This transfer actually confused me. We don't have an option to buy. We have spent 1m + wages on this man who will probably never play for the club again after the season. While he has proven to be a decent player, I just don't agree that we should have had him on loan. I hate the fact that he is just going to return to Chelsea after the season. 

Also, I truly believe in Aspas. I really do. Everybody else hates him for some reason, but I think that he is going to become a decent player. He was the Sturridge for Celta. He was incisive and he got the goals. He needs time to adjust. Players that can come in and instantly produce are special cases.

1. They ring the doorbell, interrupting your telly and requiring you to put on pants, an hour after you've got in from work, when you've collapsed on the sofa.       
If you refuse to engage with them - that is to say not only refuse to let them in, but refuse to respond to their letters - then they're liable to keep coming back, every 6 months, regular as clockwork.       
At least this was my experience with them a few years ago.

2. It only takes one bad TV license inspector to go around falsely claiming they have the right to enter people's homes, harassing the homeowner or whatever, and the TV licensing authority has made an enemy for life - that homeowner is never going to forget it.         
Even if you can find 100 videos on YouTube of people giving grief to the TV license inspectors, that's a tiny proportion of UK homeowners. Heck, even if you found 25,000 videos, that would still represent only 0.01% of homes.

Some 24 yr olds have solid financial support from parents. Many like myself do not. Why should people in that position be penalised? Even 13 years ago, I found myself in a position where I had a choice. I was evicted by my mother and had to make my own way.

1) Sign onto JSA (welfare) to help me into accommodation and keep me alive until I found a job

OR 

2) Continue with my school studies in which I was doing really well (1st or 2nd in top class consistently, continue into my planned cybernetics course in uni where I had provisional acceptance but live on the streets with no help for living or eating arrangements.

I was forced to give up my life in favour of employment...

People with loving parents but no money are often forced into the same situation.

If you're stupid and rich, you get the good life. But no matter how smart you are, if you and your parents can't find it, you can't have it.

So no, I don't agree with this in the slightest. Why is the current government consistently picking on people and suggesting they deserve less help than anyone else? Does an unemployed 24 yr old eat less than an unemployed 26 yr old? Do they need a smaller home? Do they travel less? Need less paper for cvs? a slower Internet connection for job hunting? Fewer papers for the classifieds? Or is a 24 year old entitled to the same support, advice, food and rent as a 26 year old?

Lloris;

Walker, Chiriches, Dawson (c), Naughton;

Sandro, Paulinho;

Lamela, Holtby, Chadli

This side rests players for what'll be a typical derby day against the hammers (physical) and still presents a genuine threat and a side that should knock over Anzhi. I think Vertonghen just needs a rest, he played Cardiff, Villa and Chelsea, I also think it'll be good for chadli to get a start.

If we as the people in the stands and across the idiot box feel this way, are we saying the 4 guys in front of him on the pitch don't feel the same way?

The first goal from Ribery should have been stopped! That goal changed the whole dynamic. Do you remember, before that goal we were pressing high and were making inroads.

The effect of that goal was, the back 4 stopped pressing and the gaps between the back four and mid 2 allowed the 3-4 players that Munich had pressing run riot.

Dzeko...thats another rant for another time. Do we want to be a team, where a person stands up front and waits for balls to be pitched his way? Any backtracking possible Sir? Can you stop fucking up every other pass that comes your way?

He absolutely lost me here- which is worrying because it's the first line. Work is virtuous, you should look after yourself, you have responsibilities to feed and clothe yourself and you should meet those responsbilities. Work ethic is incredibly important and to write it off is just bizarre. 


Having said that, the point he makes of the tories trying to co-opt ""Hard-workers"" is fair. It's this twisted view where the tories are trying to say that they represent all working people- well that's bloody lucky for a political party because that just happens to give them the largest group of people. They then try and leverage this and re-inforce it by moaning and pointing at people not in work. This divisiveness and agression towards people is what makes the tory party pernicious.

To me, The Gambia are using this as shock tactics as the Commonwealth is anything but a neo-colonial institution (I have read many a British Cabinet paper/Commonwealth Prime Minister Meeting/Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM) on the matter of India and South African membership). By the time South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 Britain's influence within it had declined considerably. In fact, one could argue that Canada had become the most influential member. It would be very hard for Britain to try to exert its influence over member when it would be out-voted by the number of African members in it and it's former Dominions.

This is of course the main reason that Thatcher went after the unions, the Tories don't seem to have got past the whole Victorian robber baron concept, the idea of being the top hatted and waistcoated uber boss with serfs and peons working to their every whim is like catnip to them. 

Same thing applied to trickle-down economics, Reaganomics if you will, which amounts to the same thing, the boss gets all the wealth, and the workers have to subsist off the left overs. You can understand that being the boss under those circumstances is lovely, but being the employee would pretty much suck.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; Yes, it is a Russian state-funded, Kremlin-run propaganda mouthpiece. Both the BBC and CNN are independent.

Ha!  The BBC is State-funded, albeit at arm's length via control of the licence fee, and the arm has been shorter under the current regime than it has been for a good while.  In any event, if you imagine corporate-owned and/or corporate-funded somehow means ""impartial"", you're deluded.  It is, after all, more the case that the State works for corporations than it is that it works for ""the people"".  Even in democracies, popular control over the actions of the State is weak at best, and far weaker than corporate control, since the holder of the purse-strings calls the tune, and politicians do so love to dance for cash.  Additionally, I conceded at the outset that RT is biased when it comes to matters concerning Russian interests, and that it is always pursuing their agenda, but do you - honestly - believe the BBC, say, isn't pursuing British ones, or that CNN isn't pursuing American corporate ones?

&gt;Anyone can offer a third party perspective if that perspective requires no perspective, facts or reality to be involved.

So, critique the message, don't solely critique the messenger.  Of course, looking for bias is a key part of critical analysis, but it's not the only part.  Is there any Russian interest in this, beyond their general competition with and arguably hostility to the UK?

&gt;Saying RT is a breath of fresh air is like saying that if a far-right neo-Nazi nutjob started a blog it would be a worthy third party perspective.

[Also Funding has increased year on year by 4.8%](http://www.nhshistory.net/parlymoney.pdf)

&gt;Expenditure on the NHS has risen rapidly and consistently since it was established on 5th July 1948. In the first full year of its operation, the Government spent £11.4bn on health in the UK. In 2010/11, the figure was over ten times that amount: £121bn. Growth in health expenditure has far outpaced the rise in both GDP and total public expenditure: each increased by a factor of around 4.8 over this period.

Zaba:  A bit smarter than Richards on the field, I believe he would have been more suited to tracking Ribery than Richards was.

Negredo: Looked more prepared to chase and press than Dzeko did, and his hold-/ball retention play was better also. 

Milner: Always gives 100% and would have been the defensive outlet that Clichy needed against Robben, as Nasri wasn't tracking back.

Silva: Would have been the extra man that we needed in midfield to close down Lahm and keep the ball in the opposition half.

There is an over-reliance on the vague phrase ""careless driving"" by the CPS. They could push for a conviction down any one of several legal avenues - dangerous driving, anyone? - some deliberate impacts can be more or less GBH with a motorised weapon, even attempted murder - but again and again and again, they only charge ""driving without due care and attention/careless driving"".

Somebody died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time while this driver decided to execute a blind-bend overtake. That's more than 'careless'. If an oncoming car had been there, she would have had a head-on collision.  
I have no desire to see interference in this case specifically - you are right, that is scary. But it's part of a wider trend that needs to stop. Even if you only use the roads as a driver, dangerous drivers are a hazard to us all - quite literally getting away with murder in some cases. Do we allow that to continue in this country?

&gt; it seems like the cyclist might have fallen over into the path of the driver? It says she made contact with her boyfriend's wheel then fell into the lane and was struck by the car. 

The car was on the wrong side of the road. The fact that the oncoming rider panicked is what anyone in any vehicle would do - the original car that crossed the median is still responsible for the collision. As I say, had that been another car, a serious crash would have been likely.

&gt;a lot of people seem to be ignoring the realities on the ground. The UK has streets which are hundreds of years old, they're small, tight, and wind around buildings. If you added a cycle lane you'd have to turn it into a one lane street which just isn't viable in the majority of situations. Either that or literally knock down almost whole cities and rebuild them on a grid pattern. 

The Dutch did it, starting only in the fifties iirc. It's not that hard - minor, narrow streets don't need much changing. Rural roads like this one could maybe do with lower speed limits. 

(It's the urban dual carriageways that are shit-scary, and road narrowing those makes the town feel more like a town and less like a service station forecourt. Pedestrians and cyclists don't deserve to be marginalised any longer.)

TFL are currently running a trial scheme in Reading encouraging safer cycling on the roads, among many other things. They're testing it out on members of the public to see what works and what doesn't. Some roads may have to be redesigned, yes, but that doesn't mean knocking everything down.

Laws should also be more strictly enforced. The amount of times I've seen cars driving in the cycle lanes, creeping forward into the cycle lane before traffic lights - both times whilst cyclists have been using them. 

Another thing they could do to help cyclists and many other vulnerable road users is to change the way the current driving and theory tests are laid out. I find it absolutely astounding that a person is allowed to be in control of nearly a ton of metal, petrol and glass and yet they aren't expected to know how to give first aid in the event of a collision. Quite often the ten minutes between the initial collision and the arrival of an ambulance can be the difference between life and death. The driving and theory tests make no effort to emphasise the importance of checking your mirrors *because there might be a cyclist behind you*. Most of the rules that you are required to follow are never given an explanation so people simply forget to check their left mirror before they turn and end up taking out a cyclist because they also failed to indicate.

&gt; You have a lot of people who aren't very good road cyclists

This one I will grant you and I think there should be more education on safe road cycling in schools. The Cycling Proficiency scheme is carried out for older primary school children - but it stops there. There is little education about the highway code, how to be safe and be seen and I see no reason why this couldn't be practiced in schools to a higher level than Cycling Proficiency. 

In terms of people not wearing helmets, high visibility clothing etc etc I think there should be laws on this as well - cyclists should be required by law to wear a helmet, sufficient lights and sufficient high visibility clothing in just the same way that drivers are required to wear seatbelts and use headlights. Most modern cars now have daytime running lights which make them much more visible.



I will agree that in terms of adapting the roads and cycle lanes there is a lot to be achieved and it is both expensive and difficult to roll out the schemes across the country, but this does not mean that we shouldn't even try or that it's not going to be economical to carry out these changes.",0,1380802081,null,0,false,0,cck5s3p,t3_1nnatb,t1_cck5s3p,t1_cck5ijp,null,1429260603,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

We don't knock down anything or change the street at all. Most of the small streets are within town centres. Removal of cars is what would be best.

I can tell you from experience that when it comes to being in a town centre a bike is far more effective than a car. Just look at parking. I always bike in to town if I can simply because I can park my bike in many more convenient places than I can my car.  
Parking isn't the only reason, of course, because it's usually quicker too. I usually find it's only worthwhile to drive if you have more than 10 miles to go.

Of course, removal of cars is a very radical idea to a lot of people, and especially politicians for some reason. There are many benefits to this, though; cleaner air, quieter environment, healthier population, to name a few of the obvious ecological benefits. But a car is a very ""safe"" and easy feeling notion. I get in my box, push a pedal down, and go.

Add some segregation of bikes and cars and you've got a safe environment. You don't need helmets because there's nothing happening fast enough to require it.  
Just look at the Dutch, to reuse an old notion. Not one of them wear a helmet. But then none of them are sporting high performance road bikes on roads with cars, they're all comfortable bikes to commute on. If you've ever been to somewhere like Amsterdam you can see the difference it's made. It's quiet, clean, and the population is pretty damn sexy.

I guess what I'm trying to say with this wall of text is that a good idea is to keep larger journeys to cars and local to bikes. Park and ride a bike? Keep cars out of the town and city centres and save it for public transport, bicycles and pedestrians.

I totally agree with this and could not have put it better myself. I've also seen shocking behaviour from cyclists and in my last post I mentioned taking new measures such as making it legally required for cyclists to wear helmets, wear high vis clothing, use lights etc etc in the same way you're legally required to wear a seatbelt and use lights in a car.

I also think there needs to be more education in schools which is more complex than the current Cycling Proficiency scheme which is run for older primary school children. I see no reason why this couldn't be extended for older children and students, allowing them access to a proper education on being safe and being seen on the roads. I completely agree that it's not *entirely* up to drivers to make sure that vulnerable road users are safe but I do think they have a certain amount of responsibility. However, current attitudes towards cyclists on the roads really need to change and I really think the way forward is not just adapting the roads to make them safer for everyone but also education. In schools there is little to no education about the highway code and how to be safe when using the roads and I simply don't understand why that isn't part of the current curriculum. Everybody uses the roads at some point, be it in a car, on foot or on a bike, and I find it simply astounding that the only proper education I had was either from my parents or a driving instructor.",0,1380802844,null,0,false,0,cck5x48,t3_1nnatb,t1_cck5x48,t1_cck5t7b,null,1429260539,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I wonder though - would drivers (who lets say killed someone when speeding) feel their best interests would be served if a jury was all cyclists.

The cap is £500 per week of benefits for a household or £350 a week for a single person. For context, those numbers are equivalent to a pre-tax salary of £34,000 and £23,000 respectively.

From what I understand, this cap does NOT include any disability allowances, and rightfully so. It is based on JSA and housing benefit.

The eventual number of families affected will be around 40,000 once the rollout is complete.

The majority (77%) are facing a reduction of £100 per week or less.

Overall I think this is a decent idea, though I'm not sure how much point there is implementing it. On principle, it's insane that an unemployed family can have an equivalent income of £34,000 per year, but it seems like there aren't very many of those families around so I wonder how much money this actually saves. Especially when the article says that families hit by the cap will receive extra support from job centres.

That said, this bit pisses me off:

&gt;On Wednesday, three families challenged the government in court in an attempt to find the benefits cap unlawful.

&gt;Two High Court judges are being asked to rule that the payment limit breaches the human rights of unemployed parents.

My assumption would be: being part of the CW would allow easier access to meetings with more developed nations such as the UK, Australia, Canada, as well as larger African nations, such as South Africa and neighbouring Tanzania, which could only serve the economy of Rwanda better due to its relatively small size.

When you have 34% possession you don't blame your striker in a one striker formation. You have 5 midfielders that are getting outclassed and you have to take out a striker and put in a midfielder as well as take out selfish midfielders and put on unselfish ones. 

A striker should not press back just as much as a defender shouldn't push forward, players have to play their roles in the game and how they are instructed by their managers. If you saw the game you would've seen Aguero getting eaten up by the pressure in the midfield, Nasri too and they were playing MIDFIELD, not doing their job. You are yelling at Dzeko for not doing another persons' job? Cool. It's not his job to go get balls at the mid line just as much as it's not Harts job to get balls at the mid line, etc.

Students don't actually benefit that much from cheaper living at times, it depends on the area.

The thing about the human rights issue isn't just the amount of money being handed out, it's what it's being handed out for. One of the families in the test case is getting more than £500p/w, but of that, £395 is for rent to a private landlord (for a fairly small property it seems, not some kind of luxurious mansion), so they'd be stuck with £105 for everything else. 

I know it could be argued that they could move somewhere cheaper, but from what I hear/read it's not so easy to find rented accommodation at a reasonable rate in London.

Despite being a utter leftie, I'm not knee-jerking about this cap thing.

true,cengic,logo4,,"It's not a ""blind"" defense of Dzeko as it is a ""hey everyone had a shitty game, why is Dzeko taking all the heat."" Now before you say Negredo scored ask yourself this question: How was Negredo doing with the unit that serviced Dzeko during that game? The answer is obviously, poorly. 

Negredo did nothing with Aguero and Nasri on the field and even with them off the field the argument that he got more involved is wrong as well. Dzeko and Negredo had about the same touches per minute on the field, both of them sitting around .3 touches per minute. In terms of offensive involvement they were equally involved. 

In terms of defense Negredo was actually less involved. Sure he might have pressed defenders but at the end of the day he came out of there with no tackles, didn't win the ball off a single defender, Dzeko, on the other hand, did on one occasion. 

Ultimately Negredo played better because he took a shot **while not looking at the goal and it went off the post and in** while this goal was great and all it really had no meaning because at the rate Negredo was going he was never going to score 3+ goals in this game, nor anyone on this team was going to save us from Bayern who dominated our MIDFIELD and left our strikers crippled. Negredo stuck out because of the great service he got from Silva and because of the no-look ricochet off the post he scored. You can't play a 4-5-1 against a 4-6-0, you have to play their midfield game.
