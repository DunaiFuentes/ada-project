true,anomoly,eccleston,Eccleston,"While recently watching the series again I finally think I pinned down the reason that I loathe her. To me she comes across as a high maintenance girlfriend type. I know she doesn't have the ""I love the Doctor soooo much"" stigma and that's why a lot of people like her. I just can't get over all the ""I want X!"", ""now that I have X I don't want it anymore!"".

The first example that comes to mind is Partners in Crime. She turns down The Doctor at the end of Runaway Bride, then decides she wants to travel with him. They meet up during the investigation of Adipose and she's thrilled to be back with him. Later in the episode when she's hanging from the cable she says ""This all your fault! I should have stayed home!"". Of course by the end of the episode she's thrilled again and wants to travel with The Doctor.


I started noticing more and more things like that as I went through the episodes and the high maintenance, hard to please, mood swing prone girlfriend analogy was the closest I could come to explaining why I disliked her.


[All that being said](I thought Doctor Donna was awesome and was sad when she had to go because I actually enjoyed the modified character)

Sometimes cars jump red lights, but other drivers don't defend them for it. And it also doesn't tend to happen right in the middle of the red.

true,TheShader,mcgann,Defeated Cpt. Kirk,"You're right, he did have a whole talk with Rose. However it was all about how he's going to change, and look different. Even in the small snippet you put he says 'Not with this daft old face'. And before that he goes on a rant about how he'll change, and will just look different. He even goes on a rant about how he'll take Rose to Barcelona, and after regenerating he says something along the lines of 'Ok, where was I? Right, Barcelona!' and continues going on about Barcelona like he was before he regenerated. They made it very seemless, and honestly that last 'You were fantastic, and so was I' was very fourth walled, in my opinion. With both regenerations you could see that RTD to use a Doctor's last words as a sort of farewell to the actor as well, and it worked with Eccleston because it didn't overpower the scene. Before giving his 'goodbye' as Eccleston, he talks about how he's going to change his appearance, but still be himself. It's all very seamless, and they do a great job convincing the audience that Tennant is still Eccleston, but with a facelift.

That all, though, was tossed out the window in a flaming mess with The End of Time. All the time in the history of Doctor Who that was built up around the idea that we've been following this same character for ~45 years, but with different faces, was just rewritten as The Doctor talks about how regeneration is like dying, and how he doesn't 'want to go'. And this doesn't upset me so much in the 'This is ruining canon' or 'The Doctor wouldn't say that' so much as it bothers me that RTD, whether he intended to or not, succeeded in alienating Tennant from every other actor that has played the role, including Matt Smith.

And they're all supposed to be different interpretations of the same character. I'd be just as upset if any other franchise tried to do the same thing, and alienate their version as 'altogether different' than any other interpretation. As though now their version is the only 'right' version, because none of the other actors portrays the same character. If Daniel Craig's last movie has some heart wrenching scene where Daniel is dying and says something like 'It looks like it's time for my death. I hope the person who is passed on the title of James Bond, along with the 007 license, lives up to everything I've done!' and then dies as we cut to the next actor to play James Bond, I'd be furious and rage quit the theater.",0,1358923953,null,0,false,0,c81zf8a,t3_173e2j,t1_c81zf8a,t1_c81z7p2,null,1431051320,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

It just gets me to no end. I think people just like to SAY the word sketch. Like Hobbes likes to say ""smock,"" and I react the same way as Calvin does when people call their drawings a ""sketch.""

http://dontknockmysmock.com/images/calvin_hobbes_dont_knock_smock_2.gif

A sketch is a 1-2 minute artistic jerk off session for practice or to get a rough idea out on paper really fast. Did you spend more than 10-20 minutes on this piece? Then it isn't a sketch. I think people do this so they can fall back on ""it's only a sketch"" if someone thinks it's ass. Stop that. Own your work, and call it what it is. YOUR WORK. Your drawing. No safety net, get out there and work, and to heck with whoever doesn't like it.

Maybe not all the reason, but I thought maybe that was part of it...

Now, I may be wrong in this (I've tried to forget about the Angel episodes), but I seem to recall it being established that the Angels could only move when no one is looking at them. However, at the end of ""Blink"", while the Tardis is being shaken and the lights are flickering, the Angels solidify whenever the light comes on. If the audience isn't supposed to be there, then why do the Angels turn to stone when no one is watching? That irks me more than anything else, and while I can't remember it right now, I believe they did it in other Angel episodes. One last thing that annoyed me about them is how often they were brought back. Oddly enough, I don't find the frequency of the Daleks being annoying in the slightest.

true,Celdurant,smith,Smith,"I think it's a superficial similarity that arises whenever you start to strip out the details of any two stories. Many fiction, or science fiction, stories employ basic tropes, so basic similarities like that do pop up here and there, but I wouldn't say that Series 5 and Kingdom Hearts have very similar plots.

There are many key things that are too dissimilar between the two, such as the function of the keyholes and the cracks in time as how they relate to the plot. Sora sealed the Keyholes to prevent the Heartless from using it to consume each world. The Doctor didn't seek out the cracks and close them, in fact most went unnoticed. They were simply a marker for the event that caused them, namely the TARDIS explosion. The Keyholes in and of themselves were not a marker for the Heartless' invasion, merely the means they were using to consume each world.

The manner of their return to their worlds also differ. The Doctor is brought back into the rebooted universe by Amy's memories of him. His memories aren't modified in any way, he simply didn't exist, and then was brought back into existence (timey wimey). Meanwhile, Sora, who was more or less at The End of the World after defeating Ansem, had his memories tampered with by Naminee and Organization XIII when he entered Castle Oblivion in search of King Mickey. That event is unrelated to Sora defeating Ansem and restoring the worlds that were consumed by the Heartless. Essentially, the act that saves the universe in Doctor Who, (Pandorica + TARDIS explosion) is directly linked to the Doctor being erased from existence. Sora defeated Ansem and sealing the door to Kingdom Hearts is what restores the worlds consumed by Ansem, however that act by itself didn't cause him to lose him memories/cease to exist. That bit was intentionally done by Organization XIII when he entered Castle Oblivion.

Overall, I'd say that the inclusion of familiar constructs, such as modified memories, multiple worlds visited by a traveler and his companions, travel between space through portals, etc, is what prompted the similarities, as opposed to any specific progression of plot.",0,1358929689,null,0,false,0,c820evn,t3_173zpk,t1_c820evn,t3_173zpk,null,1431051777,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

The internet is the greatest information sharing product humanity has ever created. Anonymity and ubiquity make it the purest, fairest, easiest to access form of free speech we've ever had by a long way.

Taking one of those components away would be like banning books during the enlightenment, and for what? So some people don't get offended. That's giving up a great deal of potential for something that's quite easily avoided by other means.

Sure we should make it easier to filter and block the information you chose to receive but the internet is a public place and you do not have the right to only be spoken to nicely. Pure freedom of speech is more important than any persons desire not to be called names.

The onus is on the person to see the world for what it is, not on the world to censor itself for each persons sensibilities. 

Lastly even *if* curbing anonymity was a decent solution, it's impossible. The technology is fundamentally incapable of being controlled. Part of what makes it great is that it cannot have a hard ruleset defined. For the very same reason fighting piracy is a pointless waste of time we would spending lots of time and effort on system that can be wholly ignored quite easily.

The fundamental truth of the digital age is that we've given up any semblance of control of information. It's over. Any rules you make can be unmade. Any walls you build can be routed around. None of it exists. Computers don't think, they don't recognise authority. They simply follow orders and anyone can order them to do any thing. That's why *that's the way it is*.

Currently it's pretty clear that the EU has no interest in giving the UK any more special treatment. 

So what is Cameron really offering? Firstly we really have *two* referendums here, the one that is hidden behind the general election that will let them seek a new settlement and then we get to vote in or out on *that* which is not only a loaded question but will likely come with Cameron being able to say ""well we did *try* but they don't want to budge"" which makes it even more loaded.

My boss and I are quite geeky, so we were having a chat about it coming back on TV (a few episodes had been on by then) and what we thought about it. I said I enjoyed it but it grated a bit how many times he said ""Fantastic!"" every episode.

In the next office along there was a girl employed to answer the phones, she was, well, a bit 'chavvy' (let me know if I need to clarify the term but 'white-trash' for the Americans should cover it.) She was nice enough, but we never really spoke as she mostly talked about going out getting drunk the following weekend or what the previous weekend was like. Anyway, I digress...

So I was complaining about his use of fantastic and we heard the girl from the next office shout, *""WELL!! HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT SAY THAT IN REAL LIFE EH!?!""* - so my boss and I looked at each other, and he shouted to her *""I never knew you were a Doctor Who fan Becky! How do you know if he does?""* and she bounced into the room shouting *""DURRRH, it's obvious!!!! My name's Becky Eccleston, Christopher Eccleston's my Uncle!!""* - It was then I realised she actually looked like a female version of him, and I'd never picked up on it. She went onto say (which shows we're poles apart) *""I'm actually in the latest OK magazine, we had a family wedding and I'm in the photos.""* - so I said *""Yeah, so what about that.... Your Uncle is the DOCTOR!!!!""*

Turns out her Dad and her Uncle look very much alike and he gets stopped in the street a lot, thinking he's the famous brother. I asked about the use of 'fantastic' and she said it's a family thing and they all say it like that. He worked it in himself because it's a natural thing for him to say.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;purposefully be awkward and get in the way by being in the middle of the road rather than to the side etc.

its comments like this that prove that more education is needed...I had exactly the same opinion prior to me cycling so I'm not looking to pick fights, but this is such a typical comment it really needs addressing..

1 - cycling in the middle of the lane is a safety measure, that the highway code allows and several motoring/cycling groups actively recommend. Among other things stops dangerous overtaking, it takes you outside the ""door zone"" and  takes the bike out of the gutter, where glass/other crap/drains can be ridiculously dangerous.

It also means that if cyclist finds themselves in danger, the have space too avoid it.

On another note - im yet to meet a cyclists who goes out looking for a fight/confrontation with a car. What tends too happen (and Iv done this) is when you have a raised heartbeat, blood pumping and a car literally puts your life in danger you do tend to loose it. 

&gt;Again I just wait and when the roads clear get past them.

I wish everyone did that I think id be much happier cycling about  :)

true,Got_Wilk,flair4,,"&gt;Gary Hooper is essentially Jermain Defoe lite...he's a poacher...If all three of our strikers were healthy and in form, the order would be Ade/Defoe/Hooper. Spending 10 million on someone that would be a third choice striker is not something Levy tends to do.

In my opinion Ade is our best striker and I think Defoe blows hot and cold. I'd feel more comfortable with Ade and Hooper/ Defoe than I would with Ade/ Benteke and Defoe. 

&gt;""he looks impressive in patches but we need someone who is a proven goal scorer."" Not sure why this is true. Plenty of people here want Damiao (not me), and he's far from proven in any sense of the word. Also, as far as Benteke specifically, Levy loves to buy young talent that could have a big sell on, and Benteke fits that perfectly.

Damiao (according to wikipedia) has 74 goals from 129 games for Inter an impressive return. However I've seen little of him so I couldn't really say if he's worth it, it seems irrelevant because he doesn't seem interested in us.

Honestly Llorente was the striker I really wanted but that ship has sailed and hijacking that deal would be impossible.

&gt;I don't see why another half a season would prove anything if Wilk is saying the first half didn't prove anything. He also doesn't need to keep them up with his goals to prove anything, because his team is shit.

The first half of the season showed he can score goals when no one knows who he is or see him as a particular threat. The second half of the season will show he's the real deal if he can still produce against defenses who have had a chance to work him out. Just think of the strikers who have come up from the Championship and been electric till Christmas and don't score again in the New Year. It also shows an ability to score consistently in difficult situations under pressure.

Waiting till July to buy may put the price up £5-8m but my biggest fear is he doesn't turn out to be all he's cracked up to be and we're left holding the baby. 

Anyway thanks for disagreeing and actually saying why instead of the mindless downvoting you get on /r/soccer. It's why I love this place.

true,mettyc,lfc99,,"I think its excellent that we're looking into improving our players' mental well-being as well as their physical health. All too often players fail to perform to their ability due to specific mental shortcomings, and we just sigh and say that they don't have the mental fortitude to see out a match, or the desire to win, or the confidence to perform and cast them aside. But with someone working to make sure that their minds are as healthy as their bodies, then I think it will make an excellent difference, not only to those under performing, but to the whole team.

I mean, look at Michael Johnson: what a fantastic player he was, and what potential he had. Yet when he wastes it, we all say that he has only himself to blame. I don't believe that. I blame city for not giving him the proper mental support that he clearly needed. Disclaimer; maybe they did mentally support him, but too late or some such. Still, I don't think its a stretch to say that with some actual mental and psychological support, Michael Johnson might actually be ripping up the prem in City's midfield. Or Torres.

And the reason why Cameron wants to negotiate the looser relationship first, is that he does not want the UK out of EU. He wants the looser relationship at the most. And he wagers that if the people gets only the choice between a mostly single market relationship with EU and going it alone, the British people will decide to stay in the EU. And once the referendum is over, he hopes that he can put some of the divide within the Conservative Party over EU behind them.

I think a lot of the problem people have with Matt Smith is that he's coming after David Tennant - who I think was the best Doctor in the history of the show when it comes to showing the Doctor's darker side. 

In Smiths earlier series he was rubbish at doing the darker side of the Doctor, particularly when he tried to do righteous anger. As he's got on a bit with the role, I think everyone involved with the show has realised this, and now when they want to do more serious stuff, they tend to focus on the Doctor being world weary, rather than angry.

As well, I think it's a tonal shift in the show: where in RTD's era, the Doctor was very much an angry God figure - who took on and defeated the bad guys on his own; I think Moffat prefers to view him as a Trickster, who relies more on his allies.",0,1358945005,null,0,false,0,c8226sy,t3_172qcx,t1_c8226sy,t1_c81ul2x,null,1431052630,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

* Supermarkets promote ready meals and snacks far over healthy options

* Mum &amp; Dad's from poorer families IMO probably want the convenience of sticking something in the microwave or oven than cooking from fresh ingredients which would be much healthier

* The whole family shops for a week (because you have to drive to the supermarket and fuel isn't cheap) so you end up with a house full of snack foods which becomes comfort food you eat throughout the day

* I can imagine that these families unconsciously aim to buy the cheapest and get the ""most out of their money"" 2-for-1's on crap foods when actually slightly more expensive healthier foods and buying less would actually be a much better option

* The kids don't exercise (IMO a huge problem), preferring to sit infront of the TV or computer because at least that way they're safe from the millions of pedo's around every street corner (thanks scare-media)

* People simply don't realise how many calories they consume a day, you'd be surprised how easily you can snack your way to 2000+ calories by way of soft-drinks, crisps and the like

* Kids today have mothers and fathers who grew up on sugar and don't know the first thing about cooking properly from scratch, the kids growing bodies are setup from their early years to try and process all this crap and you wonder why after the age of 5 they look like they've been over-inflated.. by then it has become a problem their body will struggle with probably for the rest of their lives

* Mum &amp; Dad can't expect the kids to eat fresh because they don't (and don't want to)

The car industry would move over time, you'd still have the high marques but say goodbye to Nissan, GM and Honda because they won't stick around with the 4% tariff on car equipment sales. So that's gone.

Sure the city will do well to begin with, free from any EU restrictions but it would fall off over time. Why would banks or investment companies want to be based in a country of 60m when they could be based in Paris or Frankfurt where they have a possible market of 500m.

Airbus would move out because of the need for a simplified supply chain and wish to avoid customs barriers. Rolls Royce would suffer a similar problem.

As I said previously, I merely believe that common sense will win out in the end. I think those that argue otherwise have failed to specify a reason and a method by which Scotland could be removed from the EU and only base their opinion on one interpretation of EU Law which was never designed to handle such a circumstance.

The process of removal is far from trivial. There would need to be discussions and negotiations. I can not see Scotland being forced to hold such talks if it did not wish to.

true,Zedseayou,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"From my perspective in the natural sciences, splitting the course into AS and A2 has just two benefits: universities have a more recent set of grades to look at than GCSEs and students don't have to commit to an A2 until the end of Y12. The former is rarely an issue anyway since linear Pre-U qualifications have been accepted for some years now.

On the other hand, a linear course means that a ton of teaching time is saved in the summer - with ASes stretching out over several weeks that is a great deal of study leave. Many A2 exams are synoptic anyway so you will need to do that revision again the next year. In chemistry and physics, the way that the AS and A2 exams are structured means that AS consists of half-topics, not half the topics. This just means that at A2 you have to build on tiny fragments of material from the year before that all got taught disparately, instead of learning an entire chunk at once (e.g you could do all of organic chemistry, then all of equilibria, then all of kinetics etc... instead of splitting each topic up). I think it should mean that you are able to learn more, and do it better.

For the student, it also means you have fewer modular exams. Look at maths: you are taking at least 6 90 minute exams when that much really isn't necessary.

true,confusedpublic,null,null,"&gt;well I think it's fair to say that privatisation has caused the increase in passenger numbers, as they were certainly not on an upward trajectory pre 1994/5 privatisation. Though correlation does not imply causation in this case it probably does.

I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to completely reject that without any analysis. The cause of the increase in passenger numbers is going to be far more complex that to be attributable to one single cause, something one can realise just by thinking of influences for a moment as ninj3 has.

Plus there seems to be something off with large increases in passengers and large increases in rail fare. Sure, an increase in demand will lead to an increase in price in some instances, but it's not clear to me that it should be the case for something like public transport. If you've more people traveling you have less empty carriages, meaning your cost per carriage should go down. Obviously there'll be a tipping point where you have to put on *more* carriages, but this is something that needs analysis, rather than off hand comments about privatisation leading to more customers and that this justified the increases in prices somehow (or whatever way the causal chain goes).",0,1358951040,null,0,false,0,c823bc5,t3_1720pg,t1_c823bc5,t1_c81k3az,null,1431053189,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There's a real danger, when taking ""informal statistics"" and anecdata, of reinforcing perceived stereotypes.

For example: just because we find that 95% of obese people fall into a certain demographic, that doesn't mean that a majority of that demographic is obese.       
It could be obesity affects only a tiny minority in all demographics, which could indicate that demographically is quite the wrong way to look at things.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Most of the dancing around comes from the fact we know for certain the old educational system isn't correct. The far east is running systems along those lines and we slaughter them for high end academic output. They have much better 12 year old mathematical prodigies and completely uncompetitive professors and graduates. Which is why most of them send their kids to the US or UK. Missing that the problem is in their secondary schools rather than their universities.

The west has been trying to move towards flexible education as opposed to education by rote. We've had some success* but it isn't something that is easy to pin down with a strict metric at a young age. If you are trying to teach somebody to think rather than to memorise they will get worse results in all measures but the ones that matter. Once you get to the stage where rote methods are completely useless (i.e. university) people educated along modern lines are much better prepared.

The tension comes because we always lose to the by rote nations on measures of secondary education. What people have failed to grasp is that, while secondary education is important, the results are nearly irrelevant. It really doesn't matter at all if China or Japan wins international 14 year old maths tournaments. What matters is how that translates into later life. Being able to memorise times tables in no way prepares you to deal with complex subjects.

Where is the dishonesty? They sold it for one price, then they sold it for another price.    

The issue seems to be more with perception than reality. The perception is that people got ""ripped off"" since it was cheaper elsewhere when sold at the RRP, the reality is that that is the price the manufacturer wants people to resell it at, the supermarket tried and discovered it was a no-go (plus was being under-cut). So they then lowered it.    

I think some of the things supermarkets used to do were highly immoral (e.g. raising the price for one hour then lowing it and calling it a ""sale""). Many of them now no longer exist or are outright illegal.

To be blunt about it - do you really need to conduct a survey of a high street full of people in cheap clothing surrounded by low quality housing and shops specialising in cheap products to know that the demographic of the local area is hardly going to mirror that of Kensington High Street?

The calling for statistics to support the obvious is frankly a straw-man argument used by people who try to shout down an issue that is otherwise obvious but doesn't fit their political bias.

&gt; For example: just because we find that 95% of obese people fall into a certain demographic, that doesn't mean that a majority of that demographic is obese.

I wasn't aware that anyone had made that claim. I know I certainly didn't.

&gt; I think that if our tory masters say that ""poor people tend to suffer from obesity"" then it becomes easier for them to say ""it's their fault, we shouldn't be supporting them"". 

Again, you seem to be ignoring the point I have already made that this is not an issue of pointing at the fatties and blaming them - but pointing out that poor people are nutritionally deprived by their poverty and that we should do something to support people who have little alternative to eating low quality foods.

It's not the fat that's the issue, its the poverty. The obesity is a symptom of that, and to try and pretend that we shouldn't seek to fix the underlying causes because it might offend people seems to be the strange position that some people on this thread have taken.",0,1358953616,null,0,false,0,c823z8w,t3_1741z1,t1_c823z8w,t1_c823brz,null,1431053506,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think that's why I love McCoy too.

In some ways it is beyond the poverty of yesteryear, despite everyone being materially better of (I mean the slum dwellers trying to make it in the 19th century city or the post-war ""respectable"" working class towns with their own subculture).

Material needs are met by the state, but the poverty and unemployment itself is institutionalised and fixed. No one dreams of full employment any more, and the whole thing is just soul crushing. To paraphrase that over-rated American cop show: ""you get like you can't breath.""

I acknowledge car drivers can be wankers and encourage the idea of the law dealing with them.

In a single video you cannot prove the entire innocence of the cycling population. Nor do you seem to be claiming it.

I am not arguing who does what.

Tell me what you think drivers do, I am happy to say they should be taken off the road. People on the phone while driving? Ban them for a year. Running red lights? Ban them for a year. Taingating? Ban for a year. Not indicating? Ban for a year Drink driving? Ban them for 10 years. (I nay be a bit draconian with driving, but I am also of the opinion that 90% of drivers should be off the road)

There may be road laws I disagree with, none that I can think of at the moment, but I am willing to defend my position if there are... 

But I am not that driver you saw give you less than a foots space, I am not the one that throws things at you, I am not the one that honks because you are going to slow for them, and I am not the driver that puts their foot down to the cut straight across you to go into a junction. And I will fully support any prosecution that happens to those that are.

If you are a good cyclist, who obeys the laws of the road, then we should be on the same side, encouraging others, whether driver or cyclist, to do the same.

I am not asking you to complete some insane task to do this, to expose your genitals in such a way that even of you accidentally sat on a cucumber once you must be guilty. 

Nor am I asking you to declare the innocence of drivers.

Why is it so hard to say that people who cycle through red lights should stop doing so?

There are plenty of very nice pubs/restaurants in Warwick itself and you can always venture out into the countryside or to Leamington or Kenilworth for even more selection. There are some great country pubs around here.

There is a monthly Farmers Market in Leamington (3 miles from Warwick) and many of the villages around here do them from time to time.

If you like thatch houses there are plenty in the villages around here and [Stratford Upon Avon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Hathaway_Cottage.jpg) (Lots of historic, touristy stuff here due to old Billy Shakespeare) is about 9 miles away.

National trust properties such as [Charlecote Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlecote_Park) and [Baddesley Clinton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddesley_Clinton) are very close too.

Warwick itself is quite a small town and has no clubs etc so is nice and quite but if you do fancy something a little more lively it's just a stones throw away. It's full of historic architecture and so are many of the surrounding villages/towns. There are plenty of hotels catering to a range of budgets. And all this just 1hr45 mins away!

As for your note about the European Parliament, I don't really understand your trepidation. There are huge benefits to remaining in the EU, and these are worth compromises in law. If these compromises begin to overcome the benefits, we leave, like many of us are planning to do with the UK. Unlike the UK, though, the European Parliament will determine *some* of our laws - unlike the UK, which determines *most* of our laws.

Plus, the European Parliament's parliamentary group system mean we're not speaking out alone in parliament, but as part of a greater force that represents our interests as well as those of other countries. This means that we're not just going to have twelve lone MEPs - which, as I've said, is still more than the six we have today - but we're going to have twelve MEPs in a sea of many more arguing for the same thing.",0,1358958749,null,0,false,0,c825j1r,t3_17341n,t1_c825j1r,t1_c825aj9,null,1431054206,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You can get other protein sources for better value than the Value Mince like Tesco whole chickens are lower cost per kg of meat, even if you want to quibble about the weight of bones (with which you can make soup in any case).

true,loudribs,eng-yorkshire,2 'E's and some 'LSD',"Ok, I'll give this a shot...

**Pros:**
There are plenty of legitimate beefs with the EU, the most compelling of which is sovereignty. The two main points are that a) European law can trump UK law and b) the institutions that make those laws aren't exactly a picture of democracy in that the executive branch are distanced from the electorate. When you vote in European elections, you're voting for an MEP, a person who sits in the European Parliament. These guys are the legislature, so they act as a check on the executive but they don't actually make the laws. That role (the role with the real power) is done by the European Commission who are appointed (by yet another body called the European Council which is gathering of the various heads of state and others), not directly elected. Ok, so you can argue that because the Council is composed mainly of elected heads-of-state that there is a democratic link back to the member states, but it's tenuous and convoluted. Basically, you never get a chance to put an 'X' by the name of the person giving the orders.

Another widely aired grievance is bureaucracy, and again, it's not a hollow argument. That last paragraph you just read? It was full of complicated sounding institutions that sit in different locations and communicate in many different languages. Not only that, but the overall political structure of the EU is not one that's particularly streamlined and full of legal thickets. That means that it's a lumbering beast of a machine that can be ponderous, complicated and occasionally absurd. In contrast, the British political system - despite it's apparent fustiness - is capable of moving at great speed and is much better at doing things 'on the fly'. To some, Europe's tendency to gum up our indigenous decision making process is not just infuriating, it's also economically and politically harmful.

Then we come to the real touchstones of the anti-EU argument: Cost and migration. Now, both of these are very fraught, sometimes because of emotion, sometimes because it's hard to find accurate information. With cost, it's seemingly straight forward: We pay in a lot, we don't seem to get that much out *in cash terms*. However, there are many other benefits that can't be quantified in terms of money in/money out but will get to them in the Cons section. With immigration, it's true that the EU means that our borders are much more open to member states and for some people, they are too open. Again, this is a difficult one to tackle as the tone is so shrill and the upsides/downsides extend way beyond 'they all just come here for the benefits'. However, it is true to say that the main beneficiaries of EU immigration have been big businesses whilst the losers have been those who have to compete with immigrants for jobs/services.

**Cons:**
Trade is the obvious place to start. Our trade with Europe is massive, partly because of our proximity but also because of the Common Market. This is the part of the EU that makes it easy for member states to trade with each other and ensures that everyone is singing off the same hymn sheet. It gives us preferencial access (over non-EU members) to one of the largest markets in the world and is vital to the economic wellbeing of the nation. Some argue that we could drop out of the political union but still retain the Single Market  (like Norway) or adopt other trade treaties (like Switzerland). The problem is that a) if you leave the political union, you lose your say and b) Switzerland and Norway are very different to the UK (one has built up a complex web of trade arrangements over centuries while the other floats on a shit-ton of oil). Make no mistake, if we left the EU, trade would get problematic.

Secondly, there's the geo-politics. We're in a period of history where the world is multi-polar and no matter which you cut it , the UK isn't one of those poles. China, the US, the EU and to some extent the BRIC's are the only game in town and if we left the EU, we'd lose an awful lot of international leverage. 'Ah-ha!' say the pro-leaving camp, 'What about The Special Relationship!?' Well, the bad news is that the US has made it clear that a Britain out of the EU is a much lesser-Britain, so there goes that one.

Finally - and oft overlooked - is the matter of why the EU came in to being in the first place. To cut a long story short, Europe couldn't trust itself without the EU and would regularly engage in cataclysmic war just to reiterate the point. Part of the reason behind the EU was to finally bring that cycle of fragmentation and destruction to an end and it's largely succeed in that respect. That's a big deal and one that we shouldn't forget because it could happen again. 1939 may seem like a long time ago but in the general scheme of things, it's not.

&gt;Why now?
&gt;Nearly one billion people go to bed hungry every night and two million children die from malnutrition every year. We've made progress in other areas, but hunger is still the great scandal of our age. All around the world, even in the UK, people are struggling to feed their families.

&gt;In 2013, the government has promised to provide 0.7% of national income for aid and to host a Hunger Summit. We must make sure they keep these promises. In June, the world’s most powerful leaders will meet in the UK at the G8.

&gt;This is our best opportunity to tackle hunger. We must make IF happen.

 

&gt;What’s happening in 2013?
You can find a timeline of the key moments in the Enough Food For Everyone IF campaign in our Get Involved section.

 

&gt;What do we want?
We want our leaders to act on the four big issues that mean so many people do not get enough food. 

&gt;Aid

&gt;Enough Food For Everyone IF we give enough aid to stop children dying from hunger and help the poorest families feed themselves.

&gt;Tax

&gt;Enough Food For Everyone IF governments stop big companies dodging tax in poor countries.

&gt;Land

&gt;Enough Food For Everyone IF we stop poor farmers being forced off their land and grow crops to feed people, not fuel cars.

&gt;Transparency

&gt;Enough Food For Everyone IF governments and big companies are honest and open about their actions that stop people getting enough food.

&gt;Together, we can make IF happen.

&gt;The more of us who get involved, then the greater pressure there will be on world leaders to tackle global hunger in 2013.

I had forgotten that Rose had mentioned that!

I think that actually makes my point that Donna's push-back is a necessary characteristic for her companion.

Pros:

- Brussels will no longer have a say in what laws and legislation the UK enacts. (However this depends on if we totally leave, or stay in the EFTA or other EU organisations, I can't remember which exactly)

- Able to stop unlimited free movement of people from poorer eastern European countries who can apply for UK benefits as soon as they get here (I'm not sure why the government doesn't just make it so that you have to work here for 2-5 years before receiving any benefits to be honest).

- UK can now have unlimited trade deals with whoever they want, with many people thinking we should have closer ties to commonwealth countries (India, Canada and the like).

- Saves a shit load of money that gets paid into the EU each year to keep it running, as well as not having to give any more bailouts.

Cons:

- Most of our trade is done within Europe, and leaving the EU could affect this (although I believe we do have a trade surplus).

- Many think we will end up as just a small fish in a big pond with no influence in world politics (not necessarily a bad thing for I don't think)

- Lack of free movement will affect many working in and out of the UK.

- No more ECHR (though this is a contentious point that some would see as a pro, I'm not sure myself)

For example, while we don't put an 'X' by the name of the Prime Minister, everyone know how the game works: You're technically voting for a local representative but we all know that you're actually voting for the party you want to see in power and by extension, the Prime Minister. This is because we have a Parliamentary system where the executive and the legislature overlap. Similarly, in presidential systems, you are directly asked 'who do you want to be in charge' by means of ballot for the position of President. 

That never happens in Europe as the only choice you have is for who sits in the legislature and you simply have to take it on blind faith that the Council will appoint someone with a vague mandate. So in that respect, it's taking the worst aspects of the parliamentary system (an executive without direct, participatory elections) and transplanting it into a Presidential template by missing out the 'directly elected' bit. 

I take the point that a lot of legislation is done by civil servants and that's fine.

The A-road I cycle along is a death trap, at least once a cycle someone will come flying past leaving only a couple of cm spare. Squeaky bum time! I cycle 10km out of my way on the route home to avoid that road.

I'm hoping for a few tangible changes from this report :-

* A major investment in dedicated cycle lanes for the commuting routes between major towns and cities across the country. If you build it, they will come. This is the big one, and the most needed, it's frankly embarrassing for our country to be so backward in this area compared to the rest of Europe.
* Mandatory safety instruction as part of driving lessons / test. New drivers should be taught to give cyclists ample passing room whilst overtaking and not make risky overtakes. Just because you CAN squeeze through a gap, doesn't mean you should.
* A cycling (and motorbike) safety awareness campaign. Places like New Zealand have excellent roadside reminders of overtaking space etc. These are cheap and very effective.

An awful lot of emphasis is placed on university and the academic side of that, when perhaps that doesn't suit a lot of people.

(You can't claim back VAT that's paid in another EC country, but if your supplier writes ""subject to the reverse charge"" on the invoice, they don't need to charge you it in the first place).

Ditch the EU, and suddenly we need alternate agreements in place to deal with this.

We've got a pretty bastardised version of that in place. Under our laws your employer can claim - in most cases - that you work in one of the industries applicable. 

For instance I have a key-fob to my building, so I could be considered a ""security staff"" and my boss would only need to hire a decent lawyer to get away with hiring me for out-of-the-ordinary working hours. They could also argue that my job requires 24 hours working patterns, which voids the whole thing.  If you tried to sue a supermarket over this for work done over Xmas they would just get away with it.

Also it's worked out over the average of the maximum amount of weeks (17) in the UK, so they can work you 100 hours/week for 8 weeks, and so long as they give you time off after that they get away with it.

Also, our terraforming looks to be turning the Earth back into a chemical sludge, which is not the healthiest state for it to be in. Unless your vision of the future for humanity is us all stuck in high rise flats away from the chemical despoilation.

Maybe you should be hoping for a breakthrough in sanitation, such as the realisation in the 19th century that pouring shit in the streets and rivers was unsanitary, or the realisation in the last 20 years that we don't need to pump lead out of car exhausts and poison everything - ourselves included.

You have a weird outlook on life. Are people who commit suicide also winners, because they beat life and make their own choices? Also, there are many things that can ""take us out"" - bacteria, for example.

1. The syntax of the way a lot of Welsh people speak, foregrounding for example: ""Tired, I am"" or ""Naughty, he is"" is influenced from the syntax of the Welsh language 

2. The subject pronoun often left out in Welsh has influened Welsh English, so when we say ""I saw 'im do it"", this may be influenced by the omission of subject pronouns in Welsh. (I remember learning about treiglad and treigled meddal etc but it's been too long to remember the ins and outs)

3. The use of the word *there* rather than *how* in exclamations (""There's strange he is!"") comes from a direct translation of the word *dyna* which would be used in Welsh (""dyna odd yndyfe!""). Other examples of this come in the form of using ""Look you"" or ""mind you"" at the beginning of sentences.

4. *Flannel* is likely derived from the Welsh *gwlanen*. *penguin* is likely derived from *pen*(head) *gwyn*(white). *Corgi* comes from *cor*(dwarf) and *ci*(dog)",0,1358964346,null,0,false,0,c827efm,t3_172pgo,t1_c827efm,t3_172pgo,null,1431055099,4,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,4

Its current problems are well known but this is simply an expression of much deeper flaws. It was creates for political rather than economic reasons and so will periodically destabilise the Eurozone economy.
A single currency area can only work if one or more of three conditions are met:
1) Fiscal transfers within the union. Effectively means Germany subsidising whichever countries economy is in trouble at any particular time. This would require a central government with fiscal powers, a move which still seems unlikely but is closer than it was a few years ago.
2) Increasing symmetry between the economies. Making sure all the countries respond to economic shocks in the same way. The sheer size and historical diversity of the Eurozone makes this unlikely.
3) Free movement of labour. This was what was tried under the Schnegen agreement. When there are shocks that affect different countries differently then unemployed labour will simply move to she there is work. This is difficult enough in one country, regional unemployment is much higher in the north of England for example. But over an area containing dozens of climates, languages and cultures this would be near impossible. When Poland etc joined and the effects of this were felt governments realised this was not a popular policy and have cut back immigration to this end.

None of these look likely and so tying our own economy to this mess does not seem like a good idea even if we don't join the Euro.",0,1358965480,null,0,false,0,c827sm6,t3_174h2i,t1_c827sm6,t3_174h2i,null,1431055300,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,InsufferableTwat,null,null,"I'd like to give people a slightly unusual viewpoint on cycling:

I know full well that the UK is a highly urbanised place; a lot of people cycle in towns. These people have some serious problems arising from the attitudes and aptitude of some drivers, the lack of provision for cyclists by town planners. I'll support any campaign to improve conditions for cyclists in towns, because using bikes to commute is really important for many reasons. 

But it's not like that at all here. I ride a road bike in rural Wales. To quote OP, it is ""fucking brilliant"". I had reservations when I switched from a MTB a few years ago, but I've had zero altercations with drivers, and only a handful have ever got a bit too close. I live in an area with networks of rural lanes; if I pick a route carefully I can ride for hours and encounter five or six cars. Most people give me room. Farmers in tractors are considerate, let me overtake on downhills. a cheerful wave is normally exchanged. And on the narrow lanes (my routes of choice) I'll stop &amp; lean into the verge to let oncoming cars get past if necessary. Bit of give and take, it's easier and safer for me to get out of their way, sometimes, than the other way round. 

My only complaint is that some of the road surfaces are so buggered that after thirty miles it feels like I have been. 

Rural road cycling can still be great. Just thought someone ought to mention it. If you live somewhere rustic, don't be deterred from cycling by its (very real) problems in other areas.

I've seen huge billboard adverts for sex shops, which was unthinkable - they used to have blacked-out windows and be hidden away, literally not spoken about. That might be one of the biggest changes - adults now discuss porn in public, and it has a large cheerleading body. Its normalisation is a massive change, as well - maybe a good change, but it is certainly not just the way things have always been in Britain.

You can now freely access porn, which was never even remotely easy in the past. Porn videos were very hard to find even if you were over 18, nigh-on impossible for under 18s. Porn mags were unbelievably tame in comparison to what is available now.

If you are not talking about internet porn, just TV, then even the imagery on TV is incredibly more explicit than it was. It really is. You say that daytime TV is pretty tame - have a look at old TV schedules and see what daytime TV programmes used to be like - they weren't even tame, there was no possibility of anything remotely sexual getting on TV. 'Pretty tame' says a lot when previously it was 'none at all.'

I agree that kids are expected to grow up too much too soon, but not that sex education creates curiosity in kids. Life does that, I think you need teachers to help people prepare to deal with what is coming up for them - that's the role of a teacher. I was curious about sex as a kid, wanting to know what girls had under their clothes, for example, and I had no sex education at all. So, I've got to disagree with you on that.

true,nunnible,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Yes, I stand by that original comment, in a discussion on cycling it is relevant (and I am fairly certain it wasn't a top level comment either). There is the important part of ""when they behave like twats"" that is an essential qualifier.

I do not see a cyclist on the road and suddenly get annoyed (Some people do, they're wankers). When (and anecdotal example alert, I am still not saying this is all cyclists) one is cycling straight at me, on my side of the road, in the middle of the lane, and talking to some guy on the pavement without looking in my direction, I reserve the right to be pissed off (I also rarely see that - and don't want a conversation with you about it, though I wouldn't mind one with the guy who was on the bike).

If this was a thread about BMW drivers not indicating I would be ranting and raving too. Tailgating is the thing I hate more than anything on the road. Not only is it dangerous, it is an attempt at bullying as well...

I haven't dragged the debate in that direction. We can discuss which is the worse act, which is more common, and what suitable punishments would be if you want. However previous commenters made the point about red lights and you replied by asking whether he would rather it was a car. The conversation was there when I arrived.

I have not started anything about these accusations, but something that you demonstrated and that really annoys me about the cycling community.

You seem to have a really bad level of PR, it seems pretty basic stuff as well. By replying like that you are letting them control the conversation. The reply I suggested earlier (Some do, I don't, they should be dealt with however what matters is....) acknowledges some do (you can even mention confirmation bias if you like though that would likely lead into an argument about the numbers) because that is undeniable, it dissasociates yourself from them, and can hopefully bring the debate back on track.

Another example of bad PR I notice was when I was driving somewhere in Sheffield, I was running late for a meeting (which in my speak means I will only arrive 5 minutes early, not 15), and a cycling protest group decided to have 200 of them just circling a roundabout I needed to use but couldn't - suddenly I am annoyed. I do not understand how this was a good idea, why demonstrating how annoying cyclists can be will make people more sympathetic? Yes it gets their attention, but not in a good way. 

I do not know of the improved option on this, it is not my job to, I am not a cyclist. And I cannot speak for the cycling community. I cannot say ""as a cyclist I would never do such a thing"" because I am not a cyclist, but when drivers complain about cyclists, and are met with what feels like a defense of their actions, they are going to start thinking that the cycling community think its okay.

And I am not entirely innocent, I have fucked up on the road, shit happens (Especially when you near a thousand miles a week). But **I** was in the wrong on those occasions, and wouldn't present any defence if it had come to it other than ""Sorry, it was a mistake, won't happen again - I will accept your punishments""",0,1358968799,null,0,false,0,c828yys,t3_171tlw,t1_c828yys,t1_c827fs0,null,1431055826,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The few times where Rose is rude to people the Doctor pays attention to are because they are trying to play up that romantic tension.  

&gt;Take her whining in The Christmas Invasion (you know, when an alien race is threatening invasion and she's just been attacked by a killer Christmas tree and saved by the Doctor) ""The Doctor wouldn't do this. The old Doctor, the proper Doctor, he'd wake up. He'd save us.""

I'm not quite sure what your issue is with this part because she has her foundation ripped out from under her. Why wouldn't she be in denial about how the Doctor isn't fixing the situation, that's all she has ever known since joining him so when the Doctor is out cold she can't cope with it.

Kissing the clone Doctor in front of the Time Lord Doctor does seem like an ill timed event. They could have waited until he left and then embraced but regardless, DT had just accepted that he could never be with Rose, the person for that job was with her now.

Oh, and Mickey...he was a terrible boy friend. I don't feel bad for anything that happened to him.

Before 1977 it wouldn't have been breaking the law to take it. Just like alcohol WAS illegal in the US in the 30s. Drug and alcohol laws are arbitrary and hypocritical as long as some harmful drugs are legal (caffeine, tobacco products and alcohol) while other recreational drugs that are proven much much less harmful (weed, shrooms, MDMA) are illegal. 

Personally I'm only interested in smoking weed, despite having tried a few other drugs when I was younger, but it's completely retarded to let people die from contaminated drugs. People are going to take them anyway, may as well make sure they are not contaminated like we do with alcohol.

The rest had to be earned by analysing unseen sources and formulating an argument. 

And yes, you're able to ask more of students examination-wise after two years than after only one, but it would be simple to alter the AS/A2 markscheme to give greater weight to the more demanding A2 exams. And yes, some students and institutions take advantage of resits to game the system. Maybe you could reform that by having a module mark be an average of all the exams you've sat for it, instead of taking the best one - would discourage 'might as well' resitters as they might actually see their mark go down, but would be useful for students who genuinely had a bad day and can do significantly better.

And while we're at it - do you know the fundamental problem with exams? They have only two or so hours to test months and months of work, an incredibly narrow window.

If you say that we shouldn't disaprove of ideas that we think are daft because the wider debate is more important then how would you react if a campaign was set up to solve climate change by moving the planet earth further away from the sun?

Would you rightly laugh at such a daft idea and downvote the proposal - or would you say that the issue of climate change is so important that even the most dangerously stupid solutions should be supported?

Imagine cycling 15 miles to work, and 15 miles back home 5 days a week.

Admittedly car insurance is pricey, but mine isn't that bad and I don't mind paying a luxury tax to avoid this.

Imagine being a working parent spending an extra 15 - 30 mins walking or cycling with their children to school that could be accomplished in a 5 min drive in a car which is heated and has many safety features.

I agree that healthy activities should be promoted along with healthy eating and I done my cycling proficiency at school thanks to Salford council and cycled a lot when I was in primary and secondary school.... but it's very impractical without a car. 

I didn't get a car until my mid 20s... being 'car-less' was very shit when your friends were 2 45min bus journeys away and you had to use the system one weekly as that's all you could afford out of the small budget you had.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Sorry, I've been and still am on holiday so not a lot of down time on the laptop haha. Anyway, EC is the dream ticket because it's a short walk to Stamford Bridge, has much better transport links and the possibility exists/existed to take some bare land and shape it as desired. There really isn't any available space of the size required anywhere nearby, now that Battersea is gone. The remaining option is Old Oak Common, which would be a lot less palatable to most fans, myself included. I kind of see the board's side of things, people were upset that there wasn't enough transparency pre-Battersea discussion but if the club announces to it's fans that it is going all out for one particular site then you lose all bargaining power

I'm tired of debating people who are on the 'SayNO' side of things, those who think Stamford Bridge can be expanded up to 55,000. It can't, it won't happen and was never a realistic possibility. Adding anything to Stamford Bridge would be a futile exercise once cost, logistics and added income are taken in to account, so clearly we have to move at some point. Sadly we are also in the most congested area so any move won't come easy

It's not just fan numbers where we're playing catch up, United and Arsenal have phenomenal corporate facilities and hospitality seating, each 'bum filled seat' there is worth several regular fans and both those clubs have invested heavily in attracting higher-worth fans. Arsenal earn more on a fan-by-fan basis, I think United's Salford Suite seating is as little as £125 a match when bought on a seasonal basis whereas Arsenal have regular non-hospitality tickets more expensive than that. Regarding our situation, ticket prices could come down for certain sections if we can sell more hospitality seats, or at the very least stay constant. Unlike other teams we have a flagship asset that is Stamford Bridge which would contribute almost all of the cost of a new stadium, assuming the club's CPO purchase option goes through which is dependent on information being available about the 'new home'.

I'm trying to cut down on my work lunch spend. Right now that's by a combination of cooking meals at home when possible and eating soup for lunch, so I'm not in the situation of mackduck.

That said, with hazarding a descent in to meat eater/vegetarian arguments, I'm sure it's possible to live for a while on vegetables and canned food. I've not tried myself but pretty much every food group is cannable in some way or another.

For acquiring relatively fresh meat for cheap, you should look at the reduction timetables of your local supermarkets. Due to quotas and the fact it costs more to dispose of food than sell it at a cut price you will sometimes see some pretty sweet reductions.

I understand the baggage, but just think its needs to be dealt with alternatively.

As for that video, the poster said it himself ""It's not drivers, it's dangerous idiots."" just like its not cyclists its dangerous idiots.

Can I ask a question as an aside. In my personal experience, cycling improves towards city centres. Where (generally, don't need a street name/house number) do you live?

I live in a chavvy shithole, which is where I work and do most of my driving. No one seems capable of cycling properly there. In Sheffield where I went to Uni, cyclist are far better behaved.

Many 'pro' cycling people indicate that it would be better if people used public transport to lower the number of vehicles on the road or ditch the car and use bikes instead.

I live in West Manchester, and a lot of my work is in either Cheshire (roughthly 16 miles) or Manchester City centre (about 9 miles according to google maps)

I can get to the city centre, and park up in about 20 mins. Taking the shortest and safest cycling roue (according to google maps is 46 mins). On the bus its rougthly 45 - 60 mins.

To chesire it takes me around 30 mins if i got on the motorway, the safest journey I can take on a bike according to google is around 1 hour and 20 mins. On public transport i would have to use a bus 45 mins to the city centre, then the metrolink (20 mins), then another bus (25 mins).

The reality is that I cant ditch my car.

I agree that cycling is beneficial and has its merits but it only works if the commute is short enough to begin with or you enjoy cycling so much that you are willing to do that commute longer distances daily.

My commute isnt that bad, but if i had a child i had to drop off at school, then goto work i'd drive unless the distance can be walked in within 15 mins",0,1358977569,null,0,false,0,c82c7kh,t3_174f5r,t1_c82c7kh,t1_c82ab3g,null,1431057418,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

It's easier to snag new customers with dancing elephants than it is to keep existing ones. It's better value to spend money on TV adverts than it is to actually provide a decent broadband service.

So the lesson is that if you want a good ISP, then avoid the ones you see on TV. This is a general rule, and there may be exceptions.

I used to do private tech support for home users and small business - £45 an hour for coming over to fix your PC problems. I can't tell you how much I hate BT, TalkTalk and Tiscali, although it's been a while; those three might have improved a bit, and I also can't tell you absolutely who's the best and the worst right now.

What I can tell you is that a single recommendation from your mate, ""yeah, they do me great, pal"" is not sufficient for choosing an ISP. Make the effort to look at adslguide.org.uk (now ThinkBroadband), their forums and google for UK ISP awards. Don't take anyone's word for it based on just this reddit thread - find an ISP for whom you find multiple and solid recommendations.

Personally, I've been with Eclipse for their ADSL (fibre next week) for over a decade (11 years any time now). I don't know that they're any longer the best, but if I phone them up I'll get through to someone competent straight away and I'll get help. I can chat to them about the problem and they'll make useful suggestions and I'll try that. They'll commit within minutes or a couple of hours to send out a BT engineer if necessary.

My experiences calling BT, TalkTalk, Wanadoo / Orange and Tiscali on behalf of my customers - I have found it painful. Like I say, they may have improved - there's probably less outsourcing to India, these days, than there was 5 or 6 years ago. I have easily spent hours at a time on the phone to these guys - wasting 45 minutes rebooting the laptop at their insistence, clearing the browser cache and making sure to use a different browser. Finally they get me to look at the router and I'm thinking ""this is what I tried to tell you in the first place - we didn't need to do that other stuff"". I promise you, Eclipse won't mess me about like that.

Plus.net are very highly recommended these days. My mother was with Homecall, who were bought out by Tiscali, because they were cheap, and she had such problems with her line. I opened calls with them a couple of times, spent 45 minutes or an hour on the phone each time, but nothing came of it. I just didn't have the heart to try and get a serious result with them, and told her ""get a real ISP and I'll help you get your internet fixed"". She signed up with Plus.net, I logged a call (there was some delay because I wasn't there to do followup tests the next day) and before you know it they had BT digging up the road outside. I swear, I've never seen it before, they had guys digging up pavement, laying down 20 yards of copper wire between the green cabinet and her house, drilling a hole in the wall so she got new wires all the way. 

Theoretically, Tiscali could have got my mum that service. It was the same phone line, it was the same problem - ADSL dropping every few minutes at certain times of day, staying dropped for a few hours a week. The difference is that you can trust a decent ISP to pursue the problem properly, and call out BT as quickly as necessary. Theoretically, Tiscali could have called out BT to have them sort this line problem for us, but they were happy just closing the call when they phoned back and my mum said ""well, it's working at this minute, but that's the problem - it's intermittent"". 

As a generalisation: ISPs like Tiscali are happy working off a script; with someone like Plus.net you're more likely to get through to someone who's experienced at broadband tech support, who'll sort you our proper quick.

Be Unlimited are well recommended last time I checked. So were O2. AAISP.co.uk will always be awesome, but you pay a significant premium, it's probably not worth it for many people.

Finally, have you tried phone Virgin up and saying ""any chance of getting it going a bit faster?"" Sometimes that will work surprisingly well.",0,1358978033,null,0,false,0,c82ce15,t3_1758d4,t1_c82ce15,t3_1758d4,null,1431057509,27,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,27

After that woeful first half, he should've made a change straight away.  Just do SOMETHING to try and swing the game.  I don't know what that is, as I say I'm not a professional manager, but it's plain as day whatever he set us out there to do wasn't working.

The advisory council only ever deal with evidence, that's their whole point. They are not decision makers. 

The government, on the other hand, has not always taken the council's advice on board, and actually sought out advice from different sources when it hasn't got the answer it expected or wanted. 

Members of the council have been fired by the government for publicly stating their evidence led opinions which might go against the party line. 

Members of the council have also very publicly resigned when the government has ignored advice from the council. 

In this instance the government has asked the council to research Khat. They found it not to be harmful. This probably isn't the answer the government wanted, hence a new (government led) study will be commissioned. 

The council is there to inform and advise the government so it can make an educated decision on policy. Unfortunately, government makes a decision on policy and *then* asks the council to provide evidence to back it up, which (being scientists) the council is sometimes unable to provide.

Nobody seems to be asking teachers what should be happening with A levels, why? No, seriously why? 

&gt;Teenagers will be tested at the end of two years – with no exams in the first 12 months – to stop courses being broken down into bite-sized chunks that encourage a “formulaic approach” to education.

To get to the article. Why do people think making A levels artificially harder will do anything? The content being taught won't get changed, it's just that it gets more spread out and then you have to cram like mad at the end of 2 years to decide what happens with the rest of your life.

&gt;AS-levels, which are currently taken in the first year of the sixth-form, will become standalone qualifications, with marks no longer counting towards final A-level grades.

It currently works **like** that already. All schools look very closely at AS results and, you know what? So does UCAS, in fact when applying to Uni, on UCAS when you fill out your qualifications there's a bit just for AS results. Whether making them formally a separate qualification or not I can't see that making any difference.

&gt;Ministers hope it will allow many students in England to take three full A-levels and supplement them with at least one shorter AS qualification in a separate subject.

Almost everyone I know either already does that or even does 4 full A Levels (A2s). The traditional route at my school is that in year 12 you do 4 subjects and then drop one when moving to year 13, but that's of course if you want to.

&gt;It comes amid claims that current A-levels fail to prepare students for the demands of higher education, with many universities complaining that school-leavers lack subject knowledge and basic skills.

Because going from a generalised field such as Maths or Physics at A level to a inherently more specialised field at Uni is easy. Maths A level to Discrete Maths ant Uni. Physics at A level to Quantum Physics at Uni. These fields are too large to cover everything and unless you start making more specialised A levels the you're not going to get anywhere.

&gt;Ministers have already accepted proposals – set out in the consultation – to place strict curbs on the number of exam resits, scrap January exams and cut down on the number of modules taken as part of each A-level course.

I just miss out on this, as no January exams comes into play in 2014 and I'm so happy. It's clear that no one at the government has been to a state school recently and had a look at an A level syllabus. 

Having read lots about all this in the news and on the internet recently it's become quite apparent that most people talking about haven't been to school in awhile and haven't sat an exam recently.",0,1358980571,null,0,false,0,c82dayd,t3_1746oy,t1_c82dayd,t3_1746oy,null,1431058031,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I disagree. What have we seen from Oscar in say the last 20 games that would convince us he works well with Mata and Hazard? Maybe a few games here and there, but overall its been shit. For that much on-the-ball talent, it's been shit. All we need is Mata to set up the plays, play some wingers to stretch the defense so that Mata and the other CMs can work their magic.

Who to blame? Our transfer policy and the board. Firing RDM was clearly pointless, we're having literally the same problem since he left. The waiter hasn't got a clue about changing the pace of a game, point to me a single game where he made a tactical change to inspire victory.

Yes, specifically with [**BeThere**](https://www.bethere.co.uk/web/beportal/homepage) and [**BT Infinity**](http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband/infinity).

In the beginning BeThere were very good, and I was getting 24 down and 7 up. But towards the end, their service became over subscribed and I was seeing almost monthly downtime. And they really lagged behind on offering fibre products.

So I jumped ship to BT Infinity, I had my concerns because before BeThere I had the really old BT ADSL service and that was, well shit. But my concerns were unwarranted. Because BT Infinity is fantastic, I've had very little downtime (like two major ones), the speed is fantastic (72/20). I've never been throttled and I download a fair amount.

Seriously, give BT Infinity a check, BT get a bad rep, purely because they are BT.

 Maybe we need to enforce a law saying bikes should have mirrors and horns as well as lights... and actually enforce it. If a person on a bike could actually see what's coming behind him without turning his head I wonder how many people could avoid danger even if they are in the right?

I'm sorry if this seems rude but I just cant get how the idea to make the roads safer is to just further scrutinise the driver who has already done a full test and has regular safety checks (MOT) and is under watch from the police with heavy fines and jail time while a guy on a bike only needs lights at night. Nothing else is needed under law or enforced. Maybe if helmets, hi vis jackets, horns and mirrors were needed (basically all the stuff needed to put a motor cyclist on the road) were made into law how many people just would not be in danger because they were aware of what's going on all around them and could deal with it before a car/truck is right behind them.

true,strolls,null,null,"I had a customer move from Eclipse (who I've written about in another comment) to Infinity.

Disclaimer: this is just one anecdote.

The lines in my town are shit, my customer was certainly getting less than 5meg on Eclipse, probably less than 3meg, but he was cautious and he didn't want to be without broadband for a few days if there were any problems, so he ordered a second line for his Infinity ""just in case"", before cancelling the old service.

So the BT engineer comes over, sets up his Infinity for him and tests his line. All good, he gets 40meg from the speedtest site.

My customer connects his laptop to the HomeHub's wifi and loads up his favourite webpage - it seems a bit slow. So he clicks on the wifi icon next to the clock, switches back to his old Eclipse ADSL connection and reloads the page - it's much faster.

Download speed isn't just about megs-per-hour, it's also about latency - ""acceleration"" if we follow a car metaphor. 

In this case my customer could consistently get 40meg through the BT Infinity connection, but his favourite website (some big sportsbet horse racing site or something) loaded faster on his ""1/10^th the speed"" ADSL connection. This page loading was also consistent - he checked it a few times over the course of a day or two, at different times of day. His homepage always loaded visibly and noticeably faster over this ADSL connection than it did over the new ""10x faster"" Infinity. 

He phoned me up to talk about this, and pretty much all I could tell him was ""you should have got a fibre service from Eclipse"". (I sound like I'm shilling for them here, but as I've said elsewhere, Plus.net and others may be even better). A fibre service from any other ISP will use just the same fibre optic cable magic as BT's Infinity, but they're able to add value elsewhere if they want to.

I suppose, benefit of hindsight, that it's possible BT's DNS were shitty - whether it was that or something else, it was could have improved by now.

To make the now scary, you have to go a bit all out, and that could mean the Prime Minister fucking a pig.

In the third one, the scene with the main couple having sex, fully clothed with their eyes glazed over is quite a terrifying sight because it looks like something we value (a good, rough, passionate, intimate shag) has been devalued in the future.

2. In 2010 our gross contribution to the EU budget will be £14 billion. To put this figure in context, all the reductions announced by George Osborne at the Conservative Party Conference would, collectively, save £7 billion a year across the whole of government spending.

3. On the European Commission’s own figures, the annual costs of EU regulation outweigh the advantages of the single market by €600 to €180 billion.

4. The Common Agricultural Policy costs every family £1200 a year in higher food bills.

5. Outside the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain could reassert control over its waters out to 200 miles or the median line, which would take in around 65 per cent of North Sea stocks.

6. Successive British governments have refused to say what proportion of domestic laws come from Brussels, but a thorough analysis by the German Federal Justice Ministry showed that 84 per cent of the legislation in that country came from the EU.

7. Outside the EU, Britain would be free to negotiate much more liberal trade agreements with third countries than is possible under the Common External Tariff.

8. The countries with the highest GDP per capita in Europe are Norway and Switzerland. Both export more, proportionately, to the EU, than Britain does.

9. Outside the EU, Britain could be a deregulated, competitive, offshore haven.

10. Oh, and we’d be a democracy again.

The EU only benefits the lesser well off countries. But it hurts more then helps.

In countries where they introduced helmet compulsion the cycling uptake dropped by upto 40%. Essentially over night cycling was deemed a dangerous activity. Among other things parents stopped buying bikes for their kids because of this new ""danger""

The knock on effect was massive - less cyclists on the road meant that drivers where less sure around them, which actually resulted in more accidents. It also resulted in a less healthy/active society which some/many infact have estimated will cause countless premature deaths than the lives saved...it also encouraged car use which has its own knock on effects.

But the long and the short of it was cycling road deaths stayed the same, but the actual health benefits of cycling where lost to 1000s of people.

It's for these particular reasons why in so many counties helmet compulsion is always dismissed as crazy talk. As is totally counter productive.

And of course....while cycling helmets can potentially save your life they are in no way regulated and tested in the same manor as motorbike helmets, seat bets etc. I believe cycle helmets are designed to withstands a hit of 12 Mph....not much help if a car hits you.

Recently upgraded to their Fibre and it's pretty amazing, 70mb down and 15mb up stable at any time of day, unlimited and with no throttles and I think the fair usage is only in extreme circumstances.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;law saying bikes should have mirrors and horns as well as lights

Mirrors not needed, horns - at the point a cyclist has to use one he would be better of just getting out the way. Lights are required by law

&gt;see what's coming behind him without turning his head

A cyclist is not contained in a sound proofed vehicle and can see and hear his surroundings much better than you can in your car. Seeing behind takes a fraction of a second.

&gt;make the roads safer is to just further scrutinise the driver who has already done a full test

Pointless comment - you have to have a test because its a car...it's a potently dangerous peace of machinery that kills upwards of 2000 per year. Bikes kill no one. The severity of the test is a representation of the danger you potentially pose. Likewise....it's a more stringent test to pass your hgv license.

&gt;watch from the police with heavy fines and jail time while a guy on a bike only needs lights at night

See above comment...cyclists don't kill people..the punishment needs to fit the crime.  In addition to this, cyclists are not above the law. 

&gt;Maybe if helmets, hi vis jackets, horns and mirrors were needed (basically all the stuff needed to put a motor cyclist on the road) were made into law how many people just would not be in danger because they were aware of what's going on all around them and could deal with it before a car/truck is right behind them

""Right behind them"".... Maybe....if car driver remembered the bit in the Highway Code that says cyclist and other venerable road users should be given additional space you might have a point. But anyway...cars that are right behind me I know about because I have ears and preferable vision.

As for high vis...happy too when all dark and black cars are removed from the road. Helmets... 50% of all car deaths are as a result of head trauma, I propose that we all have to wear helmets :) 


You do seem to have fallen on to the common mistake of assuming all the things that cars have/need/require should also be applied to cycling - they are two vastly different things.

You talked about every school child cycling from their front door to school in perfect safety. This would mean thousands of school children cycling in towns and cities to their various schools at THE SAME TIME on the SAME ROADS. This would be at the same time that business traffic opens up - commuters may cycle yes, but you'll still have hgvs, vans, trucks, construction vehicles etc. So the idea that if one child fell off or lost control, a crash like the one depicted in that picture is not a stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, there aren't many pictures of normal cyclists crashing in groups in cities because no one tends to be taking pictures at the time. 

So to say that this system involves, and I quote from you ""perfect safety from front door to school"", is simply naive. 

I didn't suggest cycling isn't safe and therefore this idea is crap.

The EU's lawmaking process is lengthy and complex, but it so because it allows for consultation from all member states at numerous points in the process. Every member state has a say in both the European council and the parliament. Yes, Britain sometimes has to accept laws it doesn't like, but on the whole silly things can be push out through good negotiation and influencing other states.

Taking the example of cars, say France wants to introduce a measure that says all car seats must be made with brie (stranger regulations have happened). France would first have to convince the commission that such a law is needed (it usually would not be convinced). Britain would lobby hard and meet with the commission to convince them brie car seats are an awful idea.

Lets say, the commissioners are all high on this day, and agree to the french proposal. A draft with lots of spelling mistakes and dick jokes is written and sent to the next two phases: Parliament and Council.

Council consists of representatives from each government, and they will all argue over the measure, negotiate and try to flesh out an agreement. In order for anything to be adopted, a 67% majority is needed. [Play around with this calculator](http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/European-policy/majority-calculator.html) to see how it works. (all 3 boxes must be green for a law to pass council). 

Whilst all this negotiation is happening, the law goes through parliament. British MEP's would be fighting tooth and nail against the proposals within their political group, and across the parliament. Without the support of one major group, the proposal would fail to pass parliament.

When both the council and the parliament have agreed on their amendments, and only then, the proposal becomes law.

Leave and you only get access to the consultation process at the beginning. You can't formally have a say at council or in the parliament. That would be really devastating for British businesses and businesses that want to locate here, as they would only have one chance to influence the law: whilst the draft is being written, and no say in the ammendment process.

Considering the role France played in the past history of the United States, I would have to agree with their assessment.  The US probably could not have won their independence had they not had the support of the French.  

&gt;After the American capture of the British invasion army at Saratoga in 1777, and after the French navy had been built up, France was ready. In 1778 France recognized the United States of America as a sovereign nation, signed a military alliance, went to war with Britain, built coalitions with the Netherlands and Spain that kept Britain without a significant ally of its own, provided the Americans with grants, arms and loans, sent a combat army to serve under George Washington, and sent a navy that prevented the second British army from escaping from Yorktown in 1781. In all, the French spent about 1.3 billion livres (in modern currency, approximately thirteen billion U.S. dollars) to support the Americans directly, not including the money it spent fighting Britain on land and sea outside the U.S.

There's lots of things I really love about the EU and its associated bodies; the ability to negotiate as a bloc, the cultural exchange, the shared human rights laws, freedom of movement etc. But I do not love federalisation, I do not love larger nations drowning out the voices of smaller nations. I certainly do not love politicians from France, Germany and the Benelux countries forgetting that the U.K, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia are just as 'European' as them. I do not love federalists claiming a monopoly on the future of Europe. I want the U.K in the thick of it fighting for an EU that is based on intensive co-operation between sovereign and equal states, not one in which the largest economies get to force through their agendas. I find it very annoying that foreign politicians are criticising the British gov. for proposing a referendum. Angela Merkel and Francis Hollande have no business telling me whether I should have a say in the constitutional status of MY country. I agree with the points made by politicians here that the timing is unfortunate as the EU is in flux, but then again, the EU is always in flux, there's always something happening and if we don't get a say now, then when will we? We haven't voted on this since the 70s I believe and there are millions of adults who've never been given a choice. I am willing to accept the risk that the British public may vote to leave the EU in order to gain for it the basic democratic mandate that it requires to be seen as legitimate. We don't have the long established ties of history and culture with the EU that binds us to our own indigenous institutions and for this reason I feel it is necessary, every generation or so, to reaffirm our commitment to the grand project of European co-operation by giving the public a real choice. My dear hope is that this referendum will put the matter of membership to rest for a while and we can then get on with the business of helping to make the EU better by electing better MEPs and holding them more accountable. 

PS - I also want it to remain a geographic entity, I would consider Turkish membership if they conformed to EU laws. I am opposed to any talk of membership for 'culturally European' countries outside of Europe. If the Goddess Europa doesn't call it 'home' it has no business being considered for EU membership. We have plenty of organisations of wider inclusion, including the commonwealth and the G7 etc. The EU is about neighbours working together and our commonality should not be based on culture, religion, language or race but on simple geography.

What's interesting though...even if you fall of your bike at those speeds you are probably only going to hit the floor at around 12mph...from there you will skid along the floor at a much greater forward speed. But the actual body to Tarmac collision would be 12ish mph which is what the helmet is designed to protect your head against,

Sorry fella, I didn't mean to imply you were.

Yup, I used to frequent ADSL Guide quite a bit before they changed into Think Broadband, haven't been there in ages though.

&gt;You just sounded really positive about Infinity in your previous comment, and I wanted to share my customer's experience for balance. The cause of his problems could have been the router (homehub?) that they were giving at the time, because this was fairly shortly after Infinity rolled out.

It was probably hardware related. The HomeHub is kind of crap, and the OpenReach modem is less than stellar. I've been looking at replacing both of them with a DrayTek Vigor (27xx) or something similar.

&gt; But I think there's a tendency to associate fibre with BT's Infinity™ service, and there are lots of other ISP out there offering the same thing (but maybe even better).

I guess, but I haven't looked into alternatives. Because at the moment I'm happy. Should that ever change, I'll probably look at Plus.net a bit more closely.",0,1358989566,null,0,false,0,c82gae4,t3_1758d4,t1_c82gae4,t1_c82fhlj,null,1431059340,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think lower league teams in this country are probably wary of loaning a player who might not be up to it physically, and on the flip side we'll be wary of sending a player somewhere where he's not going to play regularly. 

At the end of the day it's got to be the right loan for the player.  We've seen in recent years how brilliantly the system can work with players like Walker and Caulker getting loan moves at just the right stages in their development.  Caulker was especially great as he progressed steadily through season long loans at league 1, championship and then premiership level but then he's always been a great athlete so you can see why teams would want to take him on.  

I've started rambling here but I reckon any loan's a good loan for a player as long as they're happy, willing to work hard and they can get in the team every week.

&gt;Liverpool remain in ninth position in the Money League, and despite their absence from European competition for the first time since season 1999/00, recorded a £5.1m (3%) increase in revenues to £188.7m (€233.2m).

&gt;Matchday revenue increased by £4.3m (11%) to £45.2m (€55.9m), with the loss of European matchday revenue offset by two successful domestic cup runs and an increase in season ticket revenue. Although Liverpool played three fewer home matches in 2011/12 than in 2010/11 (24 compared with 27), average home league match attendances rose by 3%, and average revenue per match increased from £1.5m to £1.9m.

&gt;The £2.8m (4%) growth in commercial revenue to £80.2m (€99.1m) is driven largely by the impact of the new six-year kit sponsorship deal with Warrior Sports, worth a reported £25m per year and among the most lucrative in world football. Along with the shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered, the Warrior deal underlines Liverpool’s commercial potential, although Manchester City’s agreement with Etihad has helped them overtake Liverpool as the second highest earning English club from commercial sources, behind Manchester United. Several new global commercial partnerships were announced in the summer of 2012, including Chevrolet, Paddy Power and Garuda Indonesia, as the club’s American owners continued their attempts to fully leverage Liverpool’s global brand.

&gt;Whilst the club will benefit from uplifts in the Premier League’s broadcast contracts from 2013/14, a turnaround in on-pitch fortunes is still required for Liverpool to begin climbing back up the Money League. Qualification for the Champions League remains a key short-term objective that would provide a significant boost to revenue, whilst the redevelopment of Anfield will help increase matchday revenue in the medium to longer term and complement the club’s undoubted commercial potential.

The list of games I have played has soared over the last year. I now get to play, and often highly enjoy games that I would have never taken the risk of buying, even at a low price. 

The dispatch is really quick. You can often send a game off on Monday, and have a new disk buy the end of the week. Usually by Wednesday or Thursday.  

I use it for xbox, and as far as I can tell almost every retail title is available to rent, often including game of the year additions, and DLC disks. If you like to play popular games as soon as they are released, then you might be disappointed. You might have a new COD or Assassins creed title sitting on your priority list for a couple of weeks before you receive it. Of course this is just the nature of the beast. Sometimes this can be a good thing. A few times I have added a few random titles in lieu of new games and I have really enjoyed them. Mirrors edge and just cause 2 come to mind.

The system has helped me to avoid some stinkers too. There are several games that I have been looking forward too for a while, but have sharply ended up in the post (Dead island, Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions, Dead rising). I probably would have wasted £100+ buying those games, only to leave them to gather dust on my self. £100 gets 6 months of rentals. Assuming you rent 3 a month, that's 18 games for what I would have wasted on buying three bad games.  

There is a reserve game function too, which adds the game to your priority list automatically on release, and increases your chance of receiving it first.

I'm less sympathetic to those who are merely stubborn or desire to be spiteful/hurtful.

The fact that message board garbage of this sort is a common ""social phenomenon"" [ftfy] is the whole point of the matter.

And she's done more than promote herself. The site that she wrote about has withered under scrutiny and decided to shut down.

Sigurdsson's being kept out of Spurs' #10 spot by guys like Dembele &amp; Dempsey; over the first half of our season, he certainly would have been a better option than Shelvey &amp; Henderson, both of whom have only impressed temporarily (hopefully with Henderson it continues from here).

So yeah, my point in general is that at some stage, you have to actually sign someone, even if you pay 1-2m extra; it's the same as how us standing our ground over paying for Dempsey was OK in isolation, but when it meant we had no other targets for that window, it became a clusterfuck. There isn't the same urgency now, but it'll be a disappointment if we end the window with a smaller squad than when we started, especially given how overplayed some guys have been already (Sterling, Allen, arguably Gerrard)",0,1359007447,null,0,false,0,c82m1k3,t3_175ibd,t1_c82m1k3,t1_c82lvxl,null,1431062156,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

true,[deleted],null,null,"You are correct as Allen being moved to DM can hardly be called 'picking up where he left off'. 

I think the problems with Allen are more than what I'm about to list, but IMO they are the main issues he has.

- He has been overplayed and losing form after tough first half is so common some teams have them every season. As Rodgers noted he has just become a father, we can't possibly imagine the kind of state his mind must be after moving to Liverpool and then becoming a father within short time.
- Some players are better for the system in different position than their 'true' position. It might be better for the team if Downing is moved to LB and Enrique to LW/LF in some games, even though it's not where they play. Gerrard is more effective for us in CM than attacking midfield etc. And so maybe Allens pressure and moving the ball from the defense up to the midfield was more useful to us than him moving the ball from the midfield to Suarez. I really liked how he used to open up and receive passes from Skagger and Reina and effortlessly move the ball to the midfield, it's something we lacked when we were pressured in our defense. But Lucas can do it to a degree and he has better defensive ability, so he will have to play higher up.
- Which brings us to our main problem: He just isn't used to playing with the forwards. It takes time to get in chemistry, sometimes a minute is enough other times months. Sadly for Allen he was moved to DM and his chemistry is more aligned with Skagger and Reina than it is with Suarez and Sterling. There has been very little interaction between him and the players he is supposed to provide for. He has mostly interacted with the defense/keeper and used Gerrard as outlet to move the ball forward. Now he is supposed to be moving the ball forward and become outlet for Gerrard and Lucas. Obviously he will get better, specially if it's true that the above are causing him most of his problems. With less game time he can focus on resting. With more training sessions and cameos as AM he can get the chemistry down and hopefully in couple of weeks he will have had time to work on his game and challenge for starting position.",0,1359008856,null,0,false,0,c82me70,t3_174z0p,t1_c82me70,t1_c82k26q,null,1431062284,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

true,Mondoshawan,null,null,"Definitely, however there would still be a considerable amount of per-install work to be done. I can only speak of what I saw myself when they installed it about 20 years where I was living, but I think they have conduit running down the street with an access point outside each address. In order to upgrade the last stretch to fibre they'd need to pull a new wire for the property and re-run it from the pavement to the home. There was no conduit for this last bit, they used a tool to push the cable into the earth &amp; had to lift paving slabs etc. Switching to fibre would need to replicate this, provided the junction box has fibre to it, on that I have no clue. 

Coax is as good as fibre though in many ways. With fibre you can go wild by using different lasers carrying different colours down the same wire, theoretical maximum bandwidth is only limited by how fine-grained you can produce and filter out the colours. Very cool. With coax you use different frequencies to modulate the data in what is essentially the same thing. The more accurately you can (digitally) tune a frequency, the more data you can shift in parallel. At the risk of repeating Bill Gate's famous memory quote, coax has more than enough bandwidth for our needs for quite some time. It's probably cheaper/easier to give everyone fancy hi-speed multi-channel cable modems &amp; upgrade the distribution to talk to them than to alternatively re-run the last mile of cabling. 

You can already do this multiple-channel stuff BTW, multiple modems can share the same line, Virgin policy just won't allow more than one modem per account. Someone sharing accommodation could get their own account and I've seen people talk about [bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_bonding) them together to double the available bandwidth.

I'm inclined to agree with Arrantz on this, except on the Ince part. I'd like for him to join at the right price, but I wouldn't be too bummed if we missed out on him. Granted I've only seen him while he was at Inter and not Espanyol, I've read that's where he played his most impressive professional football, which is somewhat contrary to what Arrantz said. It's obvious that he has a ton talent and potential though, but he has some flaws that could really hinder his development. He's pretty lightweight(on par with Sterling), struggles to produce an end product at times, and often tries to do too much when there was a much better and simpler option available(probably due to him pressing to try and gain more playing time).

Leading by example is all well and good, but we have people in the team that can do that. Teams need to be able to communicate and I guarentee that teams with 1 or 2 ""shouters"" (Keane/Viera/Terry/Mascherano) are more effective than teams that rely purely on ""lead by example"" types. 

This is true in all sports, and I think we have a few people on our squad that a) fill this role (Gerrard, Carra) and b) could fill this role in the future (Agger/Hendo)

All of the above have problems associated with this though, besides Gerrard, Carra is too old to consistently play, Agger has still not conclusively proved he can step that leadership role forward, Hendo is still ""green"" to the team and so should hopefully grow into the role. 

I think we would benefit massively from selling Skrtel and bringing in a CB of a similar age/talent who has been involved in teams long enough to know the score and who isn't afraid to tell the people around him what's what. 

My three recommendations? 

Ashley Williams from Swansea, Michael Dawson from Tottenham and the lad from Stoke whose name has completely slipped my mind

Notice allhave been playing football and leading sides for a number of years. Both are english speaking, capable centrebacks who know the english game (and refs) well enough to know what he needs to drag out of his team. Combine them with the more lead by example Agger and you have the makings of a world class CB pairing. 

I would also look for a new keeper, I feel your keeper MUST be confident and vocal at all times, and as much as I love Reina I feel he has lost both of those aspects of his game over the past 18 months.

Seriously, the bucolic view of England is, in many ways, a fallacy. HE Bates novels aren't really a model, any more, for how it all works. If owning land and running a small farm is an ambition of yours, I'd imagine you'd have an easier time of it by doing it in the US. 

But, exactly as in the US, there are plenty of very pleasant small towns and villages around the UK. Living in one brings all the benefits you'd expect from living in a small community: people are friendlier, know each other better, and so on. 

As regards the comment about people that have never met their neighbours: yes, of course this is true. I've lived in London all my life. I've recently moved to the outskirts as I've started a family, and I'm surprised at how friendly and welcoming my neighbours are. I'm equally surprised at how willing I am to meet and talk with them I am. It's probably an age thing. At 25, I didn't care who I lived next door to as long as they didn't have bloc parties at 4am on a Tuesday. At 37, I can appreciate the value of knowing my neighbours, offering them help with things and accepting it in return. 

Come over, spend a few weeks, travel around and see what you think. Stay with friends if you possibly can, as you'll learn much more about areas and get a better chance to understand how it is to live here.

Regional accents are not some relic of a bygone era, they add richness and texture to a vibrant language and are a part of the present for as long as people take pride in their place in the world. Try telling a Scot you think their accent is ""quaint"" and ""you're amazed people still talk like that in the modern age"" and you'll be spitting teeth soon enough...
The trend towards a standardisation in American English and the negative portrayal of regional American dialect in US media serves only to stifle the evolution of the language, limiting the way in which people express themselves. It's also a cheap and predictable way to demean and patronise whichever regional or socio-economic group you consider beneath yourself. Not everyone who speaks with a Kentucky accent is married to his sister no matter how much it may amuse you to think.
The post-war trend towards the horrible and artificial Received Pronunciation or ""BBC English"" was thankfully reversed some time ago here in the UK and it's those who adhere to RP who are considered something from a bygone era and not those who cherish their regional identity.
I'm not a Geordie, I'm from Durham which is only 20 miles south of Newcastle yet has an accent and dialect of its own, as does Sunderland, 15 miles to the east, and Middlesbrough which is 25 miles further south. These variations are repeated in every town and city in the UK. 
In Britain, a regional accent helps to define and demonstrate who we are and where we're from. It may be used by others to pass judgement on your social and economic status. These people are arseholes.

The way a cable internet connection works means that if your upload becomes maxed out then your download speed really suffers, this is because the cable modem rate capping impacts upon TCP acknowledgements (ACKs), upsetting the TCP flow-control algorithms.

My point is saying everyone should look at their children's activity might leave less of a leeway for those who need it as an outlet.

Maybe you should educate your children not spy on them.

&gt;Possession of Blades/Points

&gt;Section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 prohibits having with you, in a public place of any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed, (including a folding pocket knife if the cutting edge of its blade exceeds 7.62cm/3 inches) (Archbold 24-125).

&gt;Section 139A of the 1988 Act extends the geographical scope of both of the above offences to school premises.

&gt;**For the purposes of sections 139 and 139A of the Act:

&gt;* a butterknife, with no cutting edge and no point is a bladed article; (Booker v DPP 169J.P. 368, DC);

&gt;* a screwdriver is not a bladed article; (R v Davis [1998] Crim L.R. 564 CA);

&gt;* a ""lock knife"" does not come into the category of ""folding pocket knife"" because it is not immediately foldable at all times; (R v Deegan [1998] 2 Cr. App. R. 121 CA).  

So it turns out you can't buy butter knives until you're 18. Gutted.

EDIT: I quoted the wrong bit, like a numpty. The relevant section is 141A.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I get that same issue with Talk Talk, but they did their best to help me.

I'm on ADSL2, roughly 4MB/512K, I'm also fairly far from the exchange.

Months ago my sync started to drop out ... sometimes for a few minutes but sometimes for hours. Then it would come back up again. The line speed would move all over the place, but usually the uplink speed would drop to something like 64K (down from 512K). That was the typical symptom of my problem.

I simply *tweeted* my frustration and within minutes I had a tweet conversation with tech support. This went on and off for a few months. But it was a weird problem that would come and go, eventually the ADSL would stay up for ages and I'd forget about it.

Eventually it happened again but stayed offline for longer so they got me to do an isolation test (connect my MODEM straight to the main socket). I did this, and still reported problems.

So they escalated it, gave me an email address, and they mailed me a brand new, and different, ADSL router. No charge.

I tried it, and still got some problems.

Then they got me to change my connection type on the router to ""always on"". I think this helped for some of the dropouts, but I still reported they were happening.

So they changed my line modulation to a different type, and now I can connect at 6MB/1MB - faster. I've had less dropouts, but the dropouts still happen occasionally.

I know that ADSL is a tough gig, and so much can go wrong between my wall socket and the exchange. Most likely it's a problem with the DSLAM in the exchange, but that costs them a lot to send someone out and diagnose, so they try everything before escalating to that point.

I pay on average £10/month (pre-paid, year in advance) for 6MB/1MB unlimited downloads + phone line and some calls. In Australia I was paying $90/month (£60/month) for the same service. I'm happy.

**TL;DR**: Use Twitter for customer support. It works really well.

eg. ""Crappy #talktalk ADSL dropouts, hate this service, AVOID""

That will get their attention, and you'll have someone right on your case.

In essence, Norway gets a message from the EU and they implement the laws (without any say). On top of that Norway has to pay into the EU budget, and with the UK rebate it's likely we might pay a similar amount to what we're paying now should we leave.

It's important to note that by leaving the EU we have to negotiate a free trade agreement which will almost certainly be a poorer deal than what we have now. The EU has already made it quite clear I believe that they would not be up for giving the UK an unreasonably fair deal if they left in such uncertain times. 

Plus the social impacts of not being influenced by european legislations might be catastrophic and lead us on an accelerated path to becoming the same as the US! (hyperbole, but you get the idea). 

Another argument thrown around is the UK's culture is being eroded, but in my opinion the EU has been the single best way of spreading anglo-saxon culture since the empire. In europe english is almost the linga franca in many countries, and more than a  million british people live all across europe. 

If you want a weaker, less important, poorer, less socially developed country then I think leaving the EU is a good idea. Plus, the idea of the EU, a united europe, is a beautiful idea, and one we should endeavour to complete someday.

Equally, I suspect that the mere fact the UK has been ""civilised"" and ""free"" for so comparatively long also makes gun ownership less necessary/desirable.

When pressed, Americans typically point to the 2nd Amendment (well, technically a *specific interpretation of* the 2nd Amendment, but let's not split hairs) which argues that a well-armed populace is necessary to keep the government in line - the idea being that if the population has guns then it can more easily stage an armed uprising, the fear of which should keep the government in line more effectively than otherwise.

Now, populations *can* stage sufficiently popular uprisings even without firearms (witness Gandhi getting rid of us British from India, etc), but for sufficiently intransigent governments (think China, Burma or N. Korea)... let's just say guns make it *more easy to be taken seriously*.  They're basically a force and credibility multiplier.

This also avoids the usual overly simplistic and black-and-white objection to this 2nd Amendment argument - ""what, so you think a bunch of yokels with handguns are going to win against the US Army with stealth bombers and nukes?!? LOLURDumb!"".  The point is not that the population would win in a stand-up fight - it's that a well-armed populace can *more easily* wage a civil war, or even just stage a sufficiently effective insurgency that a sane government would balk at the idea of inciting it.  (Remember, with a reasonable enough government even *nonviolent* resistance can carry the day.)

It's a question of degree and proportion, not (as the objection usually presupposes) a schoolboy ""Who would win in a fight of X vs. Y?"".

Now, the rub there is *a reasonable enough government*.  In the UK we have the advantage of a thousand years of relative freedom and civilisation, and that tradition informs the attitudes of the public and government officials at a very basic, subconscious level.  As such, any government trying to radically infringe on human rights or civil liberties not only has to win the vote in Parliament - they also have to make the case to their own MPs and an inherently-sceptical public as to why it's so vitally important to overturn as much as *hundreds of years* of expectation and precedent on the issue.

(Edit: [Forgot to include](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/176jug/across_the_whole_of_the_uk_there_were_39_deaths/c82wtfu?context=1):)

Conversely, while the USA has less of a tradition of genial reasonableness in its laws, it does a much better job of clearly enumerating and enunciating the limits placed upon its laws and elected officials, which reduces ambiguity and makes it harder to weasel around them or rely on creeping normalcy to weaken long-standing protections and prohibitions against excessive governmental power.

(End edit)

Notice how much of the fallout of torture revelations in the USA seems to have been met with arguments that it's unconstitutional, whereas in the UK it seems to be a much more visceral ""but... but... we're *British* - we just *don't do* that sort of thing..."".

This doesn't always work, but it does mean that in British politics often more can be achieved by a few pointed newspaper articles, a handful of open letters and a lot of raised eyebrows than can be achieved in the USA even by a concerted media campaign or a fortified compound full of guns and tins of beans.

Conversely, the USA is a very young nation, with next to nothing in the way of what we'd recognise as significant precedent or tradition.  It's also an immigrant, melting-pot culture formed from tens or hundreds of different nationalities, and as such it's even more ideologically heterogeneous than the UK.  This is its strength, but also means there's less in the way of automatic public consensus on many issues, and very little cultural inertia due to an instinctive respect for tradition.

This means there's a lot less of an automatic brake on social change, which in turn means that they tend to prefer their laws explicit and written down so everyone can rely on them, rather than the vague, hand-wavy, ""well, we all know what it really *means*, don't we?"" approach that characterises much of UK legal precedent.

Similarly, I suspect it's why they feel more need for physical, tangible safeguards like firearms, whereas in the UK we're more happy to rely on staring daggers at our leaders and tutting pointedly over the rims of our tea-cups.",0,1359029645,null,0,1359058466,0,c82p4y2,t3_176jug,t1_c82p4y2,t1_c82ouy7,null,1431063747,574,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,574

However there have been some interesting developments recently with 3D printing.  In the not-so-distant future, owning a 3D printer that is capable of printing a functional gun is going to be relatively common.  When we reach that point, gun control laws are going to be about as effective as copyright laws - not very.

We have a limited timeframe in which to improve society to the point where the problems caused by guns is mitigated by the rarity of violent crime.  If we miss that window, we have to deal with the same problems the USA is facing right now.

That means showing your children you trust them, if they think you are snooping not only will they lose respect for you, but they will not feel they can trust you, or can talk to you openly about things. 

Kids do not have sponges for brains, if your younger pre-teen children are on the internet then monitor what they are looking and, and put parental filter on if need be. But above that, they need to be respected as young adults ( even if the really don't have any clue yet). Be open about it, bring up stories from the news like this and ask them how they feel about it. Seriously if you cannot have a  general chat like that with your teenage kids then you need to work on on the family cohesion.

&gt;Personally I think the US gun laws should be similar to the UK whereby you have to prove you have a reasonable reason to own a gun, as in you own a farm, etc.

It would probably cut down on gun deaths, but it's chance of happening is simply not realistic - at this present time at least. 

At one time outlawing slavery in the US was deemed unthinkable. It only too a civil war to change that.

You said it yourself here:

&gt;and merely showing that she has backbone enough to stand up for herself in the face of some truly shabby treatment.

That's great. She's gone up a notch on my brave scale! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; -  I just think she misunderstands the nature of the ""truly shabby treatment"". Or that's how it comes across to me in her blog post.

I understand that it's vile, shameless, barbaric and all the rest of it - most people are doing it for attention, some just fucking wierd, some with varying degrees of mental problems - probably. If it's not for her own publicity, I just don't understand her endgame here or point she's trying to make...  does she think this type of thing will stop because she spoke out? 

One site got shut down? Will the people behind the posts suddenly cease to exist online? I see that as a defeat for freedom of speech albeit a victory in - lets face it - this small and insignificant instance.
Sites in the future will think 'in order to continue existing, we'll need strict controls about what people can post!'. There will be unintended consequences here for the detriment of freedom online. 

Her speaking out about this is only going to - at best have no effect (at worse - increase the problem) or strengthen the growing lobby for internet regulation. (aka less freedom). Which, would be incredibly destructive to the internet at large to implement.

I do see it as a rebuke to the pathological shamelessness on the internet, I just see it as an incredibly, incredibly futile one - and in some sense dangerous with possibly unintended consequences.

true,ZeroSumHappiness,null,null,"So just to make sure no one freaks out, I was referred to this post by /r/guns and I feel I can clear up some misconceptions.  Warning: This will be a long post but I request that you stick through until the end.

1. Automatic weapons are highly regulated in the United States since the National Firearms Act of 1934.  Since then two crimes have been committed with a legally owned automatic weapon, one of which was committed by a police officer.  Illegal automatic weapons are almost entirely unused by criminals excepting Mexican drug cartels at the border who use Mexican military weapons.  (That is, the fully automatic weapons they use are Mexican military.  They will also conduct illegal purchases of semi-automatic weapons in the US and use those.)

2. ""Assault weapons"" are used in fewer than 2% of all crimes committed with a firearm, contributing at a maximum 3% of all murders.  (The number is actually much lower, but I don't want to go drag out the exact statistic.)  Assault weapons, additionally, are not substantially different from other detachable magazine fed semi-automatic rifles and the legal definition focuses almost entirely on ergonomic improvements rather than any function that would increase lethality.

3. An assault weapon is not an assault rifle.  An assault rifle is an intermediate cartridge, shoulder fired weapon with selective fire (and as such, it is legally impossible for an assault rifle to be an assault weapon in the US).  Just as I don't call a renter a homeowner I wouldn't call an assault rifle an assault weapon.  They are simply different.

Furthermore, assault weapons are actually quite well suited for home defense, even more so than handguns or shotguns for a number of reasons.  I'll just pull out a copy-paste of something I wrote earlier.  A lot of it pertains to particular points of law in the US and I have a longer list sitting around somewhere, but this hits most of the reasons why a semi-automatic rifle outperforms other weapons for home defense:

Why would anyone need an assault weapon for self defense instead of a handgun or shotgun?  A handgun is excellent for daily carry outside of the home.  It is light, concealable and when holstered is both safe and accessible.  If I wanted to carry a shotgun or rifle daily I'd need to have it in my hands because it's too much of a target slung over my back.  A good holster can prevent unauthorized access while still allowing convenience to the carrier.  However, contrary to popular belief, a shotgun is not the ideal home defense weapon.  They are usually of rather limited capacity, tend to lack detachable magazines, and are usually quite large.  A short barrel rifle with a pistol grip, standard capacity detachable box magazine, sound suppressor (or at least flash suppressor) and folding stock would actually be the ideal home defense weapon:

0. Rifle ammunition is effective at causing tissue damage but also quickly loses energy when it hits drywall, more-so than shotgun or handgun ammunition.  This is ideal for preventing over-penetration while retaining lethality.

1. Semi-automatic means there is less of a chance of a failure to feed ammunition during a crisis situation.  A pump action shotgun is prone to what is known as ""short-stroking"" where the pump action is not cycled far enough to feed a new shell.  Also, it is not uncommon for a stressed defender to continually cycle the action, ejecting ammunition unnecessarily.  A semi-automatic bypasses these requirements.

2. Pistol grips are comfortable.  They bring a more natural point of aim allowing for better accuracy.  This reduces the chance of a miss or errant shot.

3. Short barrel means it's not unwieldy in your home.  You can go around corners and aim quickly.  The reduced length will not substantially affect accuracy at such short distances.

4. Standard (30 round in an AR-15) capacity detachable box magazine means you can leave the rifle unloaded and still have fast access to the necessary volume of fire to defend yourself.  Because it's not reduced capacity means you don't have to strap on a magazine carrier to bring enough bullets to the fight, you just pop in the magazine and go.  (On the contrary side, the side of the attacker, he can just bring an ammo carrier and a number of 10-round magazines.  He has the benefit of planning for the attack.)  Again, you can leave it unloaded (but with the magazine easily accessible.  This reduces the chances of a negligent discharge (though doesn't eliminate them.))

5. A suppressor is perfect if you don't want to blow out your eardrums but still want to be able to hear the criminal slinking about your house.  A suppressor does not make a gun silent but it can bring down the noise to a level that does not cause instant, irreparable hearing loss.

6. A flash suppressor is vital for home defense because it prevents the user from being blinded.  It doesn't make the gun invisible when fired.  Not being blinded is a good thing when you hear a bump in the night.  A criminal can make a flash suppressor out of a tin can if he really wanted one, so why make it illegal for a law-abiding citizen to own?

7. A folding stock is great for storage.  Being able to fire the weapon with the stock folded means that you can use it when turning to the right (if right handed) around a corner more easily.  It doesn't turn your 26-inch long weapon into a 5-inch long one.  It doesn't let you hide it under your coat easily.  But it does make it more maneuverable in tight spaces, like your hallway.

With carving knifes and spanners,

We taught the Millwall how to fight,

So I'll never be a Gunner,

Cus every cunts a runner,

Reproductive success is defined as a measurement of quantity of offspring which are then able to reproduce themselves.

UK gun control is not going to be possible in the US. First off we still have a large population of people in rural areas that police response time 20-45 minutes. Also if they effectively banned guns the only ones turning their firearms in are the people that don't want to go to jail(myself included). The people committing robberies and drug crimes aren't going to turn their stuff in because a new law is passed. Next take a look at the city of Detroit. It's gotten so bad there that people have been hiring private security because the police is so underfunded. If you can't afford the security you need to arm yourself. How would you go tell them to turn their guns in.

&gt;The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, nor a week nor even a month, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to **acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia,** would be a real grievance to the people and a serious public inconvenience and loss. - Federalist papers 29

Note the usage here indicates capable, proficient.

&gt;Resolved , That this appointment be conferred on experienced and vigilant general officers, who are acquainted with whatever relates to the general economy, manoeuvres and **discipline of a well regulated army.** - Journals of the Continental Congress

Again.

&gt;hat the strength of the Wabash Indians who were principally the object of the resolve of the 21st of July 1787, and the strength of the Creek Indians is very different. That the said Creeks are not only greatly superior in numbers but are more united, better regulated, and headed by a man whose talents appear to have fixed him in their confidence. That from the view of the object your Secretary has been able to take he conceives that the only effectual mode of acting against the said Creeks in case they should persist in their hostilities would be by making an invasion of their country with a powerful body of **well regulated troops** always ready to combat and able to defeat any combination of force the said Creeks could oppose and to destroy their towns and provisions. - Journals of the Continental Congress

But I suppose Congress was referring to how much better governed the Creek Indians were, not that they were a better and more capable fighting force?

&gt;I am unacquainted with the extent of your works, and consequently ignorant of the number or men necessary to man them. If your present numbers should be insufficient for that purpose, I would then by all means advise your **making up the deficiency out of the best regulated militia that can be got.** - George Washington, journal.

Again, he's advocating gathering the most capable militiamen possible.

&gt;One of the Seamen that had formerly made a Greenland Voyage for Whale-Fishing, told us that in that country he had seen very great Troops of those Sea-Horses ranging upon Land, sometimes three or four hundred in a Troop: Their great desire, he says, is to roost themselves on Land in the Warm Sun; and Whilst they sleep, they apppoint one to stand Centinel, and watch a certain time; and when that time's expir'd, another takes his place of Watching, and the first Centinel goes to sleep, &amp;c. **observing the strict Discipline, as a Body of Well-regulated Troops** - Letters from New England, 1686

true,Ragekitty,US,usa,"I feel like our problem is true depth. I was very excited to see our summer signings make debuts in pre-season matches because I thought we FINALLY have some roster depth. We turn around and loan half of them out?

Look at our attacking midfielders: Oscar, Hazard, Mata, and Moses. Of those three, only Moses has the physicality to stand up to less-skilled / more physical midfielders and defenders. Mata has a golden touch and is keen to distribute. Oscar likes to play around with the ball a lot, but can't fend off strong 1v1 challenges. Hazard is a little wizard but has suffered immensely from not having a target more forward than him (until Ba joined, of course).

Now let's look at our defensive midfielders: Lampard, Mikel, Ramires, and Romeu. Lamps is a genius, no doubt. Mikel is more defense-minded which isn't bad but we need a guy who can distribute from deep. Ramires is more offensive-minded but tends to lose possession far too frequently. And Romeu was looking promising but got injured.

Our defense has good days and has bad days. The back four are largely stable and reliable. We actually have decent depth for them. Luiz, Bertrand, Terry, Ivanovic, Cahill, Azpilicueta, and Cole -- that's six men competing for four spots. That's good.


Who do we have for a replacement for Hazard/Oscar/Mata? Marin? He's promising but still rough around the edges. Moses? I love seeing this guy play. I can't wait for him to return from the ACON and play with Mata/Ba/Hazard. Who else? We have 5 midfield positions but only 2-3 potential substitutes. The difference between the starting midfielders and the subs is a HUGE quality gap.

In terms of violence and things like that, I think there's somebody else in the thread who has explained that what constitutes 'violence' in the USA is different to the British definition. There are also discrepancies within the EU, which could account for the numbers. Still, statistics are unreliable and without a good understanding of how the data is collected, it's hard to draw any conclusions from that sort of thing.

You're right though. It makes no sense to compare the US to places like the UK where every aspect of gun culture is different. The UK has a system its rather fond of, despite the idiosyncrasies, and I guess the USA feels it needs to work on its own attitude to guns. Is that the case though?

Teams playing Swansea have tended just to stick to their own game and not worry about the opposition too much - we certainly did this under Kenny and it cost us.

Liverpool are a team that people take more seriously; opposition will look at how to stop Liverpool developing attacks, and the obvious tactic is to pressure the playmaker. When Allen plays in the more forward position, look how quickly opposing midfielders get on to him to stop him having time to pick his pass. If he looked like Iniesta at times playing for Swansea, he's going to have to actually be as good as Iniesta to look the same playing for Liverpool because he will be targeted like Iniesta.

Secondly, Liverpool work better with a midfield of ""2 and 1"" rather than the ""1 and 2"" that suits Allen better. Allen is not our best choice at the apex of the midfield; Henderson's energy suits the role better: I would rate Suso's skill as ideal for the job and Brendan seems to like Shelvey's whatever it is Shelvey has.

Until we sort out our defensive tactics enough to play 1-and-2 in the midfield, Allen's going to struggle. He's not a good enough defender to shield the back four, and not a #10 either.

If we get our transition play right and learn to shorten the front-to-back distance, Allen will be able to get his old box-to-box role back; until then he's not the best in any position.

If a guy points a gun at you and demands your wallet, or enters your house and points a gun at you, the following happens if you try and defend yourself with a gun:

A. You whip it out and in the process bad guy panics and shoots you.
B. You whip it out and the bad guy doesn't have an operable gun or doesn't want to shoot you - you now shoot him, and suddenly you've acted with disproportionate force (and I'd say unlawfully given you know by the time you've got it out he hasn't shot you) which isn't really defense.

And if you're calling defense pointing a gun at someone as they walk near your house to tell them to get away, well that's mostly paranoid threat of assault, and even if they do have bad intent either they have a gun and the above happens (they'd be ready first) or they don't and you're again using disproportionate force.

All having a gun means means is criminals know they themselves are at risk and are more likely to use their weapons.

 The only guy to ever cure me, was a Chinese herbalist.  He ran me through a series of tests (can you stop me pushing your arm down if your holding these vials, etc etc).  I was totally skeptical, and was on the lookout for any bullshit.  

 After 15 minutes, he went into his backroom, cooked me up a personalised medicine from natural (read; not synthetic) ingredients.  I had one drop of this 'medicine' every day, and never suffered again.

 I must reiterate, I did not go out on the hottest summer days for years because I could not stand to be outside, my allergies were totally disabling.  For years I took numerous pills etc etc, and nothing felt like a *cure*, they were all just patches.  They all felt like I was applying foundation to a birthmark.  No system ever felt like the *cause* was being addressed.     

 Ever since then, I have had a much greater respect for alternative ideas.  Sure, many are batshit insane and completely ridiculous - but not all.  Western medical science is phenomenal, but it is not infallible, and rarely perfect.  For example, western medical science has come a fucking long way in one-hundred years, and I expect people in one-hundred years will look back at today's medical treatment in horror and disbelief, and contemplate how we could ever be so foolish to believe that that crap actually worked.

true,wrigley2345,eng-dorset,Dorset (Living in USA),"Here I am, EX-pat NRA member living in Pennsylvania. 

Since moving over to the US a year ago, I have come to realise the true meaning of gun rights here. It is not about ""huurrr durr freedum 'Murca"", although there is always going to be a minority that think that way. There are a plethora of sane, good reasons for gun ownership. The one that stands out to me is just how different the culture is over here. There are many places in the US where you actually have to worry about armed robbery, or just general gun violence, where in the UK I don't think those thoughts cross any of our minds. Maybe it is slightly dodgy in some of our cities, but guns are never on the table. The US is far more dangerous than the UK, and if you take away the ablility for people to defend themselves the criminals are just going to have a boost of confidence. They are criminals, they aren't going to suddenly say 'oh, its illegal for us to have guns. Lets get rid of them'. The guns they have now are probably illegal, due to background checks not allowing ex-cons to own them. Take Chicago as a good, anti-gun control example. It is the city in the US with the strictest gun control laws, yet [more Chicago Police Officers were killed by gunfire this year than any other police agency in the nation, and the city also boasts one of the highest violent crime rates in the country, with 1 in 89 residents being victims of violent crime last year.](http://www.greeleygazette.com/press/?p=7101)

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say most of you have probably never fired a firearm. That was one of the first things I did after moving here. As soon as you fire off the first round, you realise the massive responsibility it is to have one. It changes your way of thinking, and any thought of using it for wrongdoing doesn't even come into the equation. The people you meet at firing ranges are some of the most safety conscious, well rounded people you could meet. I have read in numerous locations the the population of concealed carry permit holders has a lower overall crime rate than than anyone else, (but don't take my word for it because I can't find the source). It's something that is hard to explain to people who haven't shot before, so I encourage you to maybe go to a clay pigeon shoot somewhere in the UK to try and get a feel for it, if you are so inclined.

I also want to say that I am totally pro-gun control in the UK. For the most part it has worked, and giving police officers guns would result in a ton of unnecessary deaths. But you can't use the UK as tool to show Americans how it actually works. Like I said, the whole culture of the country is different, and the same laws passed in the US would result in turmoil. 

Also, I am, and so are most pro-gun people over here welcoming most of the gun laws suggested by Obama and Crew. Most of them being based on more extensive background and security checks, which will not affect the majority of law-abiding gun owners, but will try to limit guns being in households with crazies like Adam Lanza (and I can go into the whole assault weapon/mag capacity ban/sandy hook shooting in another comment if there is any interest.)",0,1359041530,null,0,false,0,c82reed,t3_176jug,t1_c82reed,t1_c82osde,null,1435639122,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Germany may not want the jobs/money (and I actually doubt this statement) but it would make more sense for BMW to move such jobs to a cheaper EU country than a non-EU UK. And with the state of most EU countries right now, I guarantee they will put together a deal package that would be in BMW's interest.  

Yes, Range Rover is nice. But still a bit of a luxury item. The UK has no native owned companies and would have to rely on foreign countries to continue producing in the UK. Plus we drive on the left, when Europe drives on the right. This could either mean a number of companies shut down production in the UK and start shipping cars to us (again more expensive regardless of how good a trade deal we have). However, it could be that we become a useful country in which to build right hand drive cars for export outside of the EU (more so than currently).

I don't think you are allowed to tell someone what they can and can't possess unless it can have an affect on someone's health or property. I'm not saying the potential to have an affect, I mean an actual affect. 

We have this weird mentality here in the States. People like to say that when there are a lot of guns in circulation, everyone is just going to go around shooting each other. That isn't the case at all, considering when you look at Switzerland where gun ownership is ridiculously high. People don't go around murdering each other in other countries because they don't feel like they have to. Here a lot of people feel like to either get ahead, or prove themselves, they have to end another person's life. It is such a ridiculous mindset. 

For example, I had a buddy who was having problems with his roommate, and his roommate basically abandoned him, and came back a few weeks later to pick up his belongings. My friend told me ""he is lucky there wasn't a gun in the house or I would have shot him."" That is the mentality you are dealing with in the States. People don't want to solve problems by talking, they just want to shoot other people. He may have been joking, he may not have been. But that is the mentality here. It is so ridiculous. 

I don't blame it on the media. I think it is alright to have violence in media as it is supposed to be for entertainment. I've been playing video games since I was two years old, and I've never thought about killing someone. I've never even been in a fight! I believe a lot of the mentality comes from our authority figures. Our cops carry guns around, and are not afraid to use them whenever. The cops here shoot dogs all the time, just because the dog is barking. There have been multiple black kids this past year shot in the head while wearing handcuffs, and the cops say it is a suicide. Please, who are you fooling. 

This isn't a gun issue, this is an issue with society and the mentality of people. There is so much animosity and hate in this country, and for petty things! Things like sexuality, religion, race, the area of the country you are from, etc. It is absurd how much hate there is in this country, for no reason. That is why we see so much violence here.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Anyway - I'll say no more, I know you're all dying to pretend my experiences don't count - for whatever reason.

Final year chemistry student here (specialising in natural product research). No other group of scientists disapproves of homeopathy as much as us. What I do is I take organisms from the environment (I'm currently studying some mushrooms), extract all of the interesting compounds from them, and then work out what those compounds are, whether they're likely to be active, what the precise structure is. Then the compounds can go off and be tested to see if they're any good at things like killing cancer cells, or inhibiting bacterial growth, etc. If they are, then some other types of chemists start to develop those compounds into drugs.

So, understand clearly, I know full well that the majority of our drugs come from plants and fungi within our environment, and that Chinese medicine has been, given the near complete scientific ignorance they suffer from, surprisingly successful at finding plants and fungi with interesting properties. That's not to say most of the stuff a herbalist will prescribe isn't placebo, it is. But there are some things that have been used to cure x which have actually have been found to have an active ingredient in them.

I'm glad you're feeling better by the way, that's great! Your experience absolutely does count, you were ill and now you're not, and whatever the reason for that, it happened and that matters. No scientist or doctor out there is trying to tell you that your pain or trauma or allergies are fake or unreal just because the cure may have been placebo. It doesn't invalidate your illness, because even if the cure is fake, the placebo effect is real, and very powerful.

Now, here's the thing. You said herbalist so it's possible you may have been being given medicinally active quantities of whatever this man gave you. If this is the case, there is a possibility that he did give you something which cured your allergies. I'm sceptical, sure, but I accept that this is a possibility :)

It's also possible that you experienced the placebo effect and that that is why you are better. Me saying that in no way invalidates the fact that you were genuinely suffering from allergies, and regardless of what the cause or cure was, that won't change.

But understand this, homeopathy not just *doesn't* work. Homeopathy **can't** work. It's not possible.

The man who made up homeopathy advocated that the dose of active ingredient to solution (sugar water) should be 1x10^-60. That is, for every 1 part of sugar water solution, you have 1 x 10^-60 parts active ingredient.  If that doesn't sound like much it's not. In fact, with an average homoeopathic pill weighing less than a gram, what that actually means is, given the number of molecules in the pill, the chances of there being a molecule of the ""active ingredient"" are for all intents and purposes zero. I would stake all the money I have and ever will have on the fact that you will never consume a single molecule of active ingredient if you take 10^-60 dilution homoeopathic remedies.

So how do homoeopaths deal with this? I mean, they themselves have to admit that there isn't actually any of the ""active ingredient"" in their pills. Here's where it gets really wacky: They deal with this, by claiming, against all modern physical and chemical evidence, that water has a memory. This water memory they say, remembers that the water had the active ingredient in it, and causes its effect from this memory. This is false. Molecules do not do this. Furthermore, if they did, your pill would have a very strong memory of poo. I've never managed to get a homoeopath to address this particular point.

So, you're getting a pill which even homoeopathic supporters acknowledge has nothing in it but sugar and water, and which they claim remembers that it had some Valerian root or arnica, but doesn't remember all the poo and chlorine and arsenic and other nasty things which have been through it. It's both inconsistent, as well as scientifically impossible.

Finally, even if *all* this weren't the case, the man who made up homoeopathy decided (without evidence, as you do) that the way to cure any illness is to take a substance which illicits similar symptoms in active doses, and then administer that in non-doses. This is not only false, pre-scientific, and ridiculous, but also would be extremely dangerous if homoeopaths actually *gave* you any of the ""active ingredient"" they claim to be using (which, thankfully, they don't).

So, do some treatments in traditional medical systems work? Yes, but western medicine can purify those, improve them, make them safer, and cheaper. There's a *reason* we're so rigerous and seemingly slow to bring products to markets. We have *standards* which herbalists and alternative medicine doesn't adhere to. We make sure at every turn that we're being ethical, we do everything we can do minimise side effects, to ensure that people won't be harmed by what we're doing, and that the medicines we produce as as safe as physically possible for the widest variety of people. This takes years, tens of thousands or even millions of man hours, and the hard work and dedication of huge numbers of people. By contrast, alternative medicinal practitioners give you a chunk of root they heard might be good for you and hope it cures you. I hope you can see where the danger might lie there.

tl:dr: Does homoeopathy work? No. It has never. It will never. It doesn't. It can not.

Looks at last year in all of our big games, who stepped up and won the games for us? The veterans, the guys who have been on the team for a long time, and have had plenty of experience playing in the big games.

Give it a season or two for all of these young guys like Hazard, Oscar, Moses, and Azpi and I think we will start to show some steel and strength to win.

We do need some size on the pitch though, both literally and figuratively. A big midfielder with good strength on the ball to hold up play as well as a guy who can command the pitch. We seem like we've been missing this lately. When Terry is on I always see him motivating, praising, commanding our players on the field.

Honestly, I'm not worried. I believe our team is great, we just need some more big games to prove ourselves in for all the young guys as well as some strength on the pitch.

That's not just a locked room - most police forces will want to see a metal cabinet, secured to a load-bearing interior wall of your house, before they even give you a shotgun licence (which is much less demanding than a firearms certificate for rifles etc).

true,HeartyBeast,cnty-uk,London,"There are a lot of people like that, and to be honest many years ago, I had one of those phantom illnesses - absolutely horrible, I would get a numbness down one side of my body, a feeling that reality was slightly removed from me and sudden intense fatigue - I'd be talking to someone and they would day 'blimey, you've just gone white' - and I'd have to lie down for an hour or so.

This went on for about 8 months during which I was prodded, prescribed beta blockers, etc. each of these were in the standard 4 minute GP consultation. 

The worst thing was - no-one knew what was wrong with me.

One weekend I really thought I was going to die, I felt so odd. A locum doctor came to the house and spend 30 minutes on a thorough examination and talking about my symptoms. At the end he sat back and said 'you have exactly what I had when I left medical school - I was hospitalised with it - it's stress.  And what you're mainly stressing about (like me) is why you're feeling so ill. Try not to drink too much coffee, give yourself time, now you know what it is, the symptoms will gradually diminish'.

Within a week, I was right as rain.

The point of this story? I have absolutely no doubt of the kind of physical anguish that primarily mental conditions can cause and i have no doubt that a prolonged, caring consultation can effect a cure. 

However, ethically, the NHS has decided that simply providing placebos is unethical, and to me homeopathy provision seems a backdoor to get around that decision.

The fact that homeopathy 'works' for some people suggests to me that GPs should be given a bit of extra time with some patients to sort themselves out - and a bit of training - not just write TEETH* on their notes.

I know that I'm at odds with most British people here, Britons place a lot more trust in the police and in the state than in other countries. That is probably a fairly good thing, a symptom that Britain has experienced less corruption and more discipline in its police force than other countries. 

However, even if things may be fine at the moment, the political landscape in any nation can change very drastically very quickly.

true,tremens,null,null,"I'm assuming you're asking ""What's"" the law? Person-to-person transfers within two residents of the same state are not subject to Federal restriction; the Federal government gains its power on regulating firearms sales due to the Commerce Clause, a clause that is probably nearly as controversial as the Second Amendment itself, that states that Congress has the power to regulate *interstate* commerce. It does not have the power to regulate *intrastate* commerce, however. The interpretation of what constitutes ""intrastate"" is what is usually so controversial about it, because they basically say that the manufacture or production of goods is automatically interstate commerce, even if it's never sold outside of the state, because otherwise those goods would have to be produced elsewhere and shipped into the state, a stance many people and states disagree with.

Anyways, the individual states are who have the authority to regulate person-to-person transactions, and they can Constitutionally mandate things like background checks or permits, but they typically don't, or do so in weird ways.

In my state, for instance, shotgun and rifle transactions are completely unregulated. For handguns, however, the purchaser/recipient is required to go the Sheriff's office and acquire a Pistol Purchase Permit. The Sheriff basically runs the same background check as the Federal NCIS database, approves or denies the purchase, and charges a $5 fee. The seller is required by law to maintain a copy of that Pistol Purchase Permit after the transaction for the rest of their lives, but it's a law that is rarely enforced very well. Technically, it's a Class B Misdemeanor subject to up to 6 months imprisonment and a $500 fine to fail to acquire or maintain a copy of the permit, but I have honestly never heard of anyone actually being charged (I'm sure it happens, just not commonly, it's more one of those things they *can* charge you with if they think you're a dick, but won't if they think you meant well and just didn't know.)

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; I don't think you are allowed to tell someone what they can and can't possess unless it can have an affect on someone's health or property.

Guns can have a major effect on someone's health. Unless you mean an ill effect on the person who holds it (so you can't have, let's say, uranium, because of the radiation effects), but even then it is a slippery slope is what is or isn't allowed going by these rules.

&gt;That isn't the case at all, considering when you look at Switzerland where gun ownership is ridiculously high.

Switzerland is a special case, just like the USA is a special case. From what I understand (someone else can probably give a much better explanation), as Switzerland have a small standing army, lots of men are trained in shooting and given guns, so while there is a very large amount of guns, everyone (more or less) who has them are well trained in shooting, both in how to shoot and, more importantly, *when* to shoot. 

This is completely different to America, where people have guns for entirely different reasons, mainly to use against criminals, and, in the event of rebellion, the government. People don't need as high training to get a gun, and therefore you have a completely different situation.

&gt;I've been playing video games since I was two years old, and I've never thought about killing someone.

This is purely anecdotal. While I do agree with the sentiment personally, I still agree with the US government testing the idea that 'Violent Media/Video Games provoke real life violence', just to get a final proof, and stop the media harping on about Video Games causing violence.

&gt;This isn't a gun issue, this is an issue with society and the mentality of people.

I do somewhat agree with this. The reason we see so many guns in America is linked with this Second Amendment 'guns=freedom' mentality. However, that doesn't mean limiting the amount of guns, expecially things like assult weapons, in circulation. Like many issues, there are many contributing factors, and you can't just pin it on one thing (like many have with mental health, or guns).",0,1359044255,null,0,false,0,c82s7ux,t3_176jug,t1_c82s7ux,t1_c82rpx5,null,1431065211,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Even tipping (which is another US-vs-UK argument for another day!) seems to serve as a vehicle for some people to punish a perceived wrong, rather than the other way around.

I'm probably making spurious allegations on the basis of very little understanding or experience, and maybe it's just the mild-mannered Englishman in me which can't understand the USA's assertive ways. But it's interesting that you mention the hate, and the mentality, and the aggression. It can't be a very pleasant atmosphere...

I do like America, and please don't think I'm just another European taking pot-shots at the Yanks. It's just a minor observation which seems to correlate with your own experience.",0,1359044521,null,0,false,0,c82sawe,t3_176jug,t1_c82sawe,t1_c82rpx5,null,1431065224,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Unless you mean an ill effect on the person who holds it (so you can't have, let's say, uranium, because of the radiation effects), but even then it is a slippery slope is what is or isn't allowed going by these rules.

I can agree with this to some extent. But you do have to understand that a lot of people in America have weapons not to go on mass murdering sprees, but to protect themselves from home intrusions or random violence that happens on the street. Once again, this goes back to not a gun issue, but the type of society we live in. Things like income disparity, lack of jobs, and also the idea of the ""American dream"" distorts reality for a lot of people, especially the mentally unstable. 

I've done a bit of reading with Switzerland's gun laws, and from what I've gathered, young adults have to do military service for a few years when they turn 18 or 19. I can't remember which one. After their service is complete a lot of Swiss citizens will continue to own the gun they used during their training. The Swiss government doesn't mandate that citizens fire a weapon every year to stay familiar with their weapons, but the recommend it. Shooting for sport is very popular in Switzerland with a lot of citizens going to the shooting range on the weekend. The reason I brought up Switzerland is a lot of anti-gun folk think a lot of guns in circulation equals people just walking around shooting each other, which is not the case. 

Yes, it is a different situation. I was trying to make the point that a lot of guns doesn't mean more crime. We need to change the mentality of folk who believe their only answer to their problems is murder. 

A good case to look at with trying gun control in America is Chicago. Chicago has very strict gun laws, yet it has one of the highest murder rates with a firearm in the country. So when people are out there saying ""we need more gun control to stop murders"" it is just an ignorant statement. We have first hand evidence of gun control in America and it doesn't work. Criminals don't care where they get their guns from, as long as they have it to use for their gang fights and robberies. New York City is the same. Strict gun laws, yet there are firearm related incidents all the time. Like I said, this isn't a gun issue, it goes deeper than that. Banning guns is like putting a band-aid on a tumor.

271 UK homicides by knife crime is 0.4 in 100,000.

So about 8 times as many people die from being shot in America than from being stabbed in the UK.

But this doesn't show that much, since I would suspect you are a lot more likely to die from being shot than being stabbed, or rather, a doctor is probably has a better chance of saving your life if you have a stab wound rather than a gunshot wound. So it would be better to work out the amount of shootings vs the amount of stabbings.

I cant find the data for how many people are shot in the US per year. Can anyone else find it anywhere?

--------------

OK, found it. I think. [This place says 43.77 firearm assaults per 100,000.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdGhycDRPQlN1dTBoMzJWOTk0Uk9DRVE&amp;hl=en#gid=10)

UK says [14,000 knife crimes per year](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/14000-knife-victims-a-year-860857.html). Which is 22.34 per 100,000.

So it looks like about twice as many people are shot in the US than stabbed in the UK.

So yes, the argument looks weak. It looks like without easy access to guns, people will kill each other a lot less, and attempt to kill each other less too. But there of course could be lots of other cultural factors involved that make Americans more likely to kill one another aside from access to guns. But the argument that ""In the UK, they may not shoot one another as much, but all those potential gunmen just stab their victims instead"" doesn't seem to have much statistical backing.",0,1359045391,null,0,1359047288,0,c82skrc,t3_176jug,t1_c82skrc,t1_c82rax9,null,1431065347,72,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,72

Your experience absolutely does count, you were ill and now you're not, and whatever the reason for that, it happened and that matters. No scientist or doctor out there is trying to tell you that your pain or trauma or allergies are fake or unreal just because the cure may have been placebo. It doesn't invalidate your illness, because even if the cure is fake, the placebo effect is real, and very powerful.

 Skillfully implying my remedy was a placebo.  To that I would ask; why would I not get the placebo effect from the drugs I was prescribed previously that are understood to actually *do* something as well?  A double whammy of effectiveness, you could say.  I *believed* they would work *and* they had active ingredients that *actually* worked.  Why would this not cure me, where as something that was 100% placebo would?

 Nobody was disputing the 'realness' of my illness, only the realness of the cure that worked for me - so there's no need to convince me that everyone believes I was ill to begin with either.  If you require proof of my allergy, I could remind you that I received prescriptions of practicing Doctors of western medicine... an authority I believe you would find it hard to argue against.  

 Also, thanks for the pat on the head.  Means worlds.

 Secondly;   

 &gt;Chinese medicine has been, given the near complete scientific ignorance they suffer from, surprisingly successful at finding plants and fungi with interesting properties.

 I don't want to draw battle lines here, but the assumption you make when claiming things like this is; '*a thing is true once modern scientific method has decided it to be true*' - as if it was invalid knowledge before science anointed it to validity with it's blessing.  I should not say it is surprising at all that successful medicine's were discovered before modern western medical science.  Any effective medicine was only ever found by a scientific process of trial and error.  That's all science is - it is, in reality, a very rudimentary process.  

 &gt;They deal with this, by claiming, against all modern physical and chemical evidence, that water has a memory. This water memory they say, remembers that the water had the active ingredient in it, and causes its effect from this memory. This is false. Molecules do not do this. Furthermore, if they did, your pill would have a very strong memory of poo. I've never managed to get a homeopath to address this particular point.

 OK - fair enough, this is nuts.  There is however, no need to decry homeopathy this much, we both know and have already agreed a lot of it is batshit crazy.

 &gt;Yes, but western medicine can purify those, improve them, make them safer, and cheaper.

 I believe you're right.  Western Medicine *can* do this.  But it doesn't, and it won't.  Especially with the creeping growth of the privatised medical industry.


 All in all, this is a pretty textbook response to what I said - exactly the sort of answer I would expect from someone still deeply involved with study.  It's great that you're enjoying what you do, and I'm really glad your having fun (*my patronising riposte*).  

 The reason I thought I would pipe up, is because a lot of people *(specifically on reddit)* do not seem to recognise the conceptual reflections between fanatic Christians shouting down science, and fanatic scientists shouting down religion.  Fanatic believers of western medical science, and fanatic believers of herbalism/homeopathy ganging up a ridiculing one another (these are not fantastic distinctions granted, but if you understand what I'm talking about you can see that the specifics here are irrelevant).  The real truth is *nobody* knows exactly what's going on, and as you said - what's important is that *something works* - due to active ingredients, or an active mind.  It just makes me very uncomfortable that people are so willing to berate something - just because they know numbers are on their side.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt;but to protect themselves from home intrusions or random violence that happens on the street.

But this is where the downward cycle begins. 

1. We can't ban guns because the majority use them to protect themselves from other criminal gun users.

1. As guns aren't banned, they are still in circulation, so criminals get more of them.

1. Criminals have more guns, so any talk of guns getting banned gets nullified by the 'We can't ban guns because the majority use them to protect themselves from other criminal gun users' arguament.

There needs to be some sort of intervention in order to stop the cycle. 

&gt; Chicago has very strict gun laws, yet it has one of the highest murder rates with a firearm in the country.

That's hardly a good experiment though. Let's say I'm a criminal, and want to buy a gun. I will likely not go to the gun shop and buy one, I'll buy a clean gun, which has likely been stolen from someone who brought and uses the gun legally. As long as there is somewhere in the US where a person can easily obtain guns, no amount of strict gun laws in isolated areas will help.

&gt;Banning guns is like putting a band-aid on a tumor. 

Is it though? Do people really need assult rifles? I honestly don't see a situation where it is necessary. Nobody is calling for a complete ban, just resticting high power/large magazined weapons. There isn't a total gun ban in the UK even.

I believe it also has something to do with the mentality ""I am the best, nobody can tell me differently, I am the greatest."" You bring up the tipping point, which we see a lot of on reddit where it will be something like ""the waitress did this, so I DID THIS!"" kind of thing. In reality, maybe the waitress was having a shit day, with loads of shit customers, and was ready to get out of there. Sure, tipping isn't mandatory, but when a server is LEGALLY making $2.15 a hour, they need tips to survive.

true,brandonw00,null,null,"&gt;That's hardly a good experiment though. Let's say I'm a criminal, and want to buy a gun. I will likely not go to the gun shop and buy one, I'll buy a clean gun, which has likely been stolen from someone who brought and uses the gun legally. As long as there is somewhere in the US where a person can easily obtain guns, no amount of strict gun laws in isolated areas will help.

If someone has their guns stolen, then they are not responsible gun owners. When you are not carrying a gun on yourself, it should be locked in a safe. No two questions about it. 

&gt;Is it though? Do people really need assult rifles? I honestly don't see a situation where it is necessary. Nobody is calling for a complete ban, just resticting high power/large magazined weapons.

You may ask farmers who use high powered rifles to keep wild animals off their land that they can't take down with a pistol. Maybe a shotgun, but that requires the farmer to get close a wild boar that is terrorizing his crops or animals. And yes, this is a real thing in America. Hunters also like to use high powered rifles to hunt larger animals. Nobody is hunting with a fully automatic machine gun though. Also they have a very broad definition of what an assault weapon is, so nobody really knows what will be banned if it becomes law again.

Different countries have different laws, different judicial systems, as well as varying effectiveness of law enforcement.

There was a news report where a Swedish lawyer explained that if, say a woman comes to the office and says she has been raped 4 times by someone, then each rape case is put forward as a separate case, instead of just one. 

Also, if you look at America 30+ years ago, it's quite well known that many white police officers didn't report violent crimes against black people.  It's well known that hate crimes against the LGBT community weren't properly and fully reported.  Now that's not to say that no police officer in the UK has ever been corrupt, but it gives you an image of how inconsistent and incomparable rates like that might be.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Skillfully implying my remedy was a placebo.

I'm saying that I think on balance it is more likely than not that it was a placebo, yes. I am also saying I am open to the possibility that it was not a placebo.

&gt;To that I would ask; why would I not get the placebo effect from the drugs I was prescribed previously that are understood to actually do something as well?

I do not know, placebo is a very complicated effect. It's not my field to study, and from what I have studied I've learned that it is a very complicated effect, varying not just by the belief of which drug is being taken but even by region, which is just *weird*. Definitely not soup I want to stick my spoon into.

&gt;I believed they would work and they had active ingredients that actually worked.

Except you claim that they didn't work, no?

&gt;Nobody was disputing the 'realness' of my illness, only the realness of the cure that worked for me - so there's no need to convince me that everyone believes I was ill to begin with either.

Ok. I certainly wasn't, however it's just that in my experience often when you tell people that they were probably cured by placebo they take that as the implication that their illness was ""all in their head"" - which isn't necessarily the case (not that this would be any less valid if it were).

&gt;I don't want to draw battle lines here, but the assumption you make when claiming things like this is; 'a thing is true once modern scientific method has decided it to be true' - as if it was invalid knowledge before science anointed it to validity with it's blessing.

No, that's not the case at all. I'm simply saying that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have had a historical absence of scientific method or knowledge. There's an important difference between invalidity, and insufficient proof.

&gt;I should not say it is surprising at all that successful medicine's were discovered before modern western medical science.

That some were discovered? No, not surprising. That the number which TCM has managed to discover? Actually that *is* quite surprising. You have to understand, the number of plant or fungi compounds we check out which lead to functioning drugs is basically one in a million. That's not an exaggeration, it's a commonly cited number in natural products. So to come up with 10 cures we'll probably go through 10,000,000 different types of compound. The odds are not on the side of anyone, but for people with no ability to properly purify, isolate, elucidate? To have discovered even a handful of cures as they have is impressive.

&gt;I believe you're right. Western Medicine can do this. But it doesn't, and it won't. Especially with the creeping growth of the privatised medical industry.

Umm, I'm sorry what? Did you read the first paragraph of my post? This is exactly what chemists in my field do all day every day.

&gt;The real truth is nobody knows exactly what's going on

No, sorry, but this is just wrong. *Scientists* know what is going on whenever they release a drug. A drug can't be released *without* us knowing what is going on. If we don't know what's going on, we work at it until we can. This is the scientific process. Homoeopaths do not do this, herbalists do not do this.

&gt;It just makes me very uncomfortable that people are so willing to berate something - just because they know numbers are on their side.

This is not about numbers, it's about rigour, about people who're completely ignorant about a method of action prescribing herbs or roots or plants based on hearsay and rumour.

&gt;I do not believe my cure was a placebo (I'm just not that sort of chap, and my ailment really was quite aggressive).

The fact that you seem to consider that it would be a personal failing if you *were* the sort of person to be affected by placebo (which, by the way, you are, we all are) shows your own personal barrier to acceptance of the effect in this case. But overall, you believe whatever you want buddy, I don't care what you believe. I care what my instruments tell me, and the guys further down the line care what the bioassays tell them. Science doesn't work on feelings or beliefs or hopes, it works on knowledge. On the certain. You are free to accept or reject that as you please.

true,PriorOSI,null,null,"Realize, countries dont measure their crimes in the same manner.  I prefer using the CIA World Factbook, and looking at death rate by country to get an idea of how ""safe"" they are comparatively.

So, while UK only had 39 reported deaths due to firearms, in 2009 (the most current CIA facts I could find in my brief search), UK had a death rate of 10.02, rating 60 out of 192 measured countries.  The US rated 8.38, a 93 out of 192.

Now as with everything, flat statistics still rely on accurate information and interpretation.  Gaza strip has a 3.44 death rate, Syria 4.61, Egypt 5.08.  Most likely due to inaccurate information.  Australia had a nice 6.74, for a 129 out of 192.

Now dont get me wrong.  UK clearly had an extremely low gun death rate, but overall, had more deaths per 1,000 than the US.  Which does make it interesting, that Australia with its incredibly dangerous wildlife and fauna, has a lower death rate.

But, as others have pointed out, a low number of deaths due to firearms should be compared with the total population.  In addition, I believe the total number of deaths within the country should be considered as well.  Otherwise, countries such as Iran and North Korea look so so safe with their lack of gun deaths.  (neither report gun deaths, and its highly likely their death rates / homicides are not reported ""accurately"").  Hell, Afghanistan has a ridiculously low homicide rate.

An additional point would be to look at Yemen.  2nd most armed civilian population, with 54.8 guns per 100 people (compared to 88.8 with the US, or 6.2 for England/Wales (They dont have a combined UK number)).  Yet, they are at 7.61 death rate, for a 108 out of 192.  So, they have WAY more guns than the UK, yet their reported homicides and deaths place them as safer than the UK...

Lastly, yes I realize the world doesnt revolve around the US.  But, lets all admit, when comparing gun deaths / crimes, we are all talking about the current gun debates and the US's stance on guns.  Otherwise, stating ""only 39 deaths due to firearms"" has no value, as its not compared to anything.  And to compare, would require the same/accurate information.  Altho, let me state, 39 deaths due to firearms is damn impressive.  Clearly the UK is very safe with their firearms, but overall death rate is average.  An argument could be made to worry less about guns, and focus on resolving some of these other issues.  Korea, Japan, need to focus on reducing suicides....which while not a gun related death, is still obscenely high.  (Japan is a 9.54 death rate, 66 out of 192, yet 1/3rd the rate of firearms deaths compared to UK) 

In conclusion.  Yes, a low gun death rate is fantastic.  I am sure the automobile death rate in North Korea is also fantastic.  Second hand smoke killed 46,000 in the US alone last year.  Cancer, such as prostate, breast, and pancreas is a main killer (altho usually older populations, altho if you consider life precious, why are we placing younger lives over older lives...and at what age is your life less valuable?)  The U.S. needs to focus on reducing gun deaths, that is just a fact.  But, overall, the country is safer in many ways than other countries.  If the US reduced the gun deaths, it would have some pretty damn impressive safety records (compared to similar countries who report accurate information)

What I am saying is education about guns needs to be better. With guns being a big part of American culture, they are not going anywhere, for a while. We need people to understand how a gun works and how to properly own one instead of just making people scared of them.

&gt;But there is a difference between a high calibre bolt action/slow firing rifle, and an assult weapon. I didn't think anyone was calling for hunting rifles to be banned, but assult weapons which have large magazines and fire fast.

But this is where incorrect information can change public opinion. One of the main assault weapons that is getting a lot of attention now is the AR-15, which looks like a M16 used by the military. The AR-15 is a semiautomatic rifle that shoots a 5.56mm bullet. It only shoots as fast as the the operator can squeeze the trigger. They don't fire any faster than the user operating the gun, much like a pistol. While fully automatic firearms are legal in the United States, they are HEAVILY regulated, and quite difficult to purchase. And what does banning large magazines do? Instead of firing 15 bullets with one magazine, you can only fire 10. Nobody is walking around with ridiculously large magazines. If they are, they are either SWAT or with the military.

 You have absolutely no information about my ailment other than what I have told you on reddit, yet 'on balance' you seem to know more about it than I do.  Science.

 &gt;Except you claim that they didn't work, no?

 I claimed they did work - for a time, until my body built resistance to the medicine, at which point I would switch pills, and receive (something close to) the desired effect again.

 &gt;That the number which TCM has managed to discover? Actually that is quite surprising.

 It's almost as if they had a method that was different to yours, yet was still effective and phenomenally valid.  Weird.

 &gt; Umm, I'm sorry what? Did you read the first paragraph of my post? This is exactly what chemists in my field do all day every day.

 You originally said ""*but western medicine can purify those, improve them, make them safer, and cheaper.*""  This is incorrect.  Western medicine can purify, improve (perhaps), make them safer (perhaps) - but it has absolutely nothing to do with making them cheaper.  Medicine is a different field to economics.

 &gt;No, sorry, but this is just wrong. Scientists know what is going on whenever they release a drug. A drug can't be released without us knowing what is going on. If we don't know what's going on, we work at it until we can. This is the scientific process. Homoeopaths do not do this, herbalists do not do this.

 Drugs of suspect effects are released to the buyers market regularly.  My friend got a prescription for a pain she had been having in her toe - the pills turned out to be (among other things) anti-depressants.  Now I'm not going too pull any wildcards about opening up medical experimentation on the unsuspecting populous, but what the fuck?  Brain chemical altering pills - because her toe hurts?

 Let's not forget that modern western medicine took a *giant* leap forwards during WWII, when the most intensive and accurate scientific experiments were completed.  The scientific process could be put into 'all-systems-go' due to the incredible number of spare Jews that were lying around - perfect subjects to push science forward.  This is of course not to say these experiments were bad - scientifically they allowed for one of the greatest scientific leaps in history - the results were excellent - shame about the Jews.  ""*Scientists know what's going on*"" is a perfect example of why people in that field are potentially very dangerous - nobody *knows*, not for certain.  Also, Thalidomide anyone?  ""*A drug can't be released without us knowing what is going on*"".  OK, OK, so stuff has changed since then, we learnt our lessons, and NOW... NOW we have a perfect system.  Infallible.  NOW we know everything.  NOW we're perfect.  Right?  

&gt;The fact that you seem to consider that it would be a personal failing if you were the sort of person to be affected by placebo (which, by the way, you are, we all are) shows your own personal barrier to acceptance of the effect in this case.

 I must be a fusty old bigot if I don't agree with you.  if I simply *do not* believe that it was placebo, then you are instantly more intelligent than me.
