Exactly, unfortunately some people took those frustrations out on Rafa. And from a footballing standpoint, who the heck else were they supposed to hire in November?

&gt;I personally don't get why a lot of fans get pissed off by the comments he made at Liverpool - I can see why, but I can't get annoyed at them myself. Any rival manager is going to try and do that to fire up his side for the big games.

Absolutely spot on. People are hypocrites though. When Sir Alex does it's ""mind games"" or he's ""earned that right"". With Mourinho it's ""tactical arrogance"" or something like that.

First of all, though you have a long, impressive list, I can throw out
&gt;Master as lame CGI slime snake thing. Eric Roberts as terrible lame master. Seriously is he playing the Master or T1000? Motorcycle cop in and out of the TARDIS door gag. The Eye of Harmony moving from Gallifrey to inside the Doctor's TARDIS

and 

&gt; FOX producing the movie. Bringing back Sylvester McCoy and not Ace. Why is it set in America? (Oh right, FOX) The new TARDIS control room. The stupid rom/com pacing/scripting. Acid spitting, reptile eyed Master. Lame American action style car chase. The musical score. Lame camera work.

since none of that answers my question ""What do you not like about Eight?""  I'm not here to defend the movie, it's tacky and awful.  I'm here to defend the Doctor, MY Doctor.  You completely disregard all of the ""extra,"" canonically questionable material (which, again, totally fine; My headcanon is different than yours, I take it.  As far as I'm concerned, Big Finish is all completely canon) and tear apart the direction of the movie .  How is any of the the Eighth Doctor's fault?  I'm not even asking about Paul Mcgann, I mean specifically the character.  

Granted, I will give you that he doesn't do much in the movie, but that's more due to it being a failed TV pilot.  Understand, they needed the new companions to ""prove"" themselves to an audience already mildly familiar with the character of the Doctor (which would be why they included McCoy in the film, bridging the gap between old and new).  The episode Rose acts in fairly the same way.


I'm not going to change your mind about the Eighth Doctor.  That wasn't my goal.  I was merely defending his honor.  His Doctor brought a lot of life and charisma to an otherwise crummy film.  His audio stories, especially the four seasons of EDAs, are regarded by many who listen to them as some of the best stories in the history of the show(citation needed, of course.  over at /r/gallifrey I rarely hear a bad thing about them) .  You can go on pretending he doesn't exist for all I care.  Why should I care? But he does exist.  He regenerated after a botched surgery (the only companion to kill the Doctor, I like to joke).  He saved the world from the Master.  He fought in the Time War, and presumably ended it.  He regenerated (speculatively) hours before saving London from the Nestene Consciousness.

Season One takes a while to find its feet but its well worth the effort. 

Season Two is excellent TV and the final episode will be big on the feels. 

Season Three may be the best five hours of TV you ever watch.

Season Four (Miracle Day) - could do better. Its not great TV, much of it is set in US (loosing some of its English charm) and there are issues with the cast (I can't say more without getting into spoiler territory). The pacing seems a little off and too much time is wasted on exposition. That being said once you are hooked you need to watch it. Its not great standalone television and its really just for the fans.

Wrong - in fact selling more houses in an affordable market is better than selling fewer homes in an expensive market.

What you have to realise is that the builder makes (on average) the same profit per property if prices are high as they would if prices are low -- because the underlying cost of the land is the main factor.

When house prices are high, so is the cost of land -- and the opposite when house prices are more in tune with wages.

In fact, a housing boom with more homes being sold because prices are more affordable by a wider percentage of the population is the best thing ever as far as builders are concerned.

Take Wembley as an example. When they knocked down the Twin Towers, they had a perfectly reasonable opportunity to build a national stadium somewhere more central. Somewhere, perhaps, people from the North East didn't have to spend 6 hours getting to. 

I'm a Londoner, I've always lived here and I love living here. But the extent to which it takes - as well as gives - is ridiculous. And it's a circular argument: it's the biggest, so it gets the most funding, making it bigger, and so on.

true,EJR94,lfcflame,,"I'll just throw in what I reckon we should do.


Firstly, sell Carroll, Coates, Skrtel, Spearing and Pacheco. I reckon we'll get around 35-40m in. (Carroll at 15, Skrtel for 12, Coates for 5, Spearing for 3m, Pacheco for free-0.5m)

Next, we would need to fill the following positions:

CB

Reserve CB

Reserve Goalkeeper 

Reserve LB

And a Reserve CDM


So if I was looking for players, this would be my plan of action

For the starting CB role, I'd look to bring in Benedikt Howedes from Schalke. He's their captain and it would be difficult to take him due to his love for Schalke but he's the best defensive leader we're able to get. What he'll do is fill the Carragher role which is vital. He won't be cheap, we're looking at around 10-15m or possibly even more but I believe he's worth every penny.

As for reserves, these are what I'd suggest

CB : Douglas, plays for FC Twente and his contract runs out in the summer I believe? He's a good solid CB who can fill in if we have injuries or replace Agger in cup games. I don't believe loads of clubs are in for him so I think this could be quite likely. We also have Kelly and Wisdom who could play CB too.

Goalkeeper : Bernd Leno, plays for Leverkusen. He's a young keeper who will become a top quality keeper in a few years, that way if Reina leaves in a couple of years we'll already have a quality replacement. I can see him costing between 2 and 5m. The issue is it would be a waste for him to just sit on the bench and goalkeepers need consistent minutes.

Left back: Emiliano Insua (yes the one that used to play for us). He's still relatively young and has improved vastly since he's left (as expected, it was only a matter of time). He's a quality LB who could put serious pressure on Enrique for his position. He's not that fast compared to Enrique but he's a bit more defensively solid. He'd cost 3-7m and could be a great player for us.

Centre Defensive Midfielder: Diame/Wanyama, either of these would be decent as a back up. Wanyama would cost more but he's also better. Diame, on his day, is like Yaya Toure. Strong, quick, great passing and shooting. Sadly Diame is kind of inconsistent. Wanyama would be a great player to bring in but there's some competition in buying him. Diame would set us back around 5m, Wanyama could be closer to 10m.

So that's 35-40m in and 20-37m out. This might indicate that we're a selling club but o think that our squad would improve with these signings. And who knows, FSG might throw in some money for another quality player!",0,1368174056,null,0,false,0,c9w1o4o,t3_1e109a,t1_c9w1o4o,t3_1e109a,null,1431240438,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Sorry, but it doesn't mean you should at least *try*.

Weight training right from the outset will help, and will moisturising and drinking enough water. I've also found that having one week out of six where I increase my calorific intake to 2000, rather than my usual 1400 means I don't lose weight that week, which gives my skin a chance to catch up.

Losing weight is an all over thing, and so long as you take it seriously and aren't stupid about it, then any excess skin will be kept to an utter minimum.

Also worth bearing in mind, the longer you spend fat, the worse it will be.


I've heard this one from a lot of fat people and it always, always sounds like an excuse. As they say, ""proper planning prevents piss poor performance"".

Take a look at /r/loseit - there are plenty of people on there who have lost sometimes hundreds of pounds, and they don't have sheets of excess skin draped off them.


EDIT: Oh, and weight loss isn't just about cutting calories either. You have to exercise to burn off the stored fat.

I can't understand why people have such an aversion to this - cutting calories on its own will NOT lead to long-term weight loss. You have to sweat to lose weight. Maybe that's why so many fatties stay fat? The thought of a bit of hard work is too much for them perhaps?

true,tramliner,null,null,"A friend asked me the other day what it was like being at Cambridge, and I'm going to paraphrase here.  

I don't know where you're living, or what kind of a school you're at, but it's not 'safe' for people at a-level to be keen on what they are studying.  It's not a good idea to show interest in it, or to discuss it outside of lessons.  Heck, I was at a fantastic and quite academic secondary school, and even then I was considered weird for my enthusiasm.  

Now, imagine that enthusiasm that you have for science.  Imagine you are surrounded by lots of people who also love their subject and want to learn about it.  All of a sudden I could really, truly nerd out about stuff I'd just learnt, and ask my friends ""What exactly is a black hole?"" (Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist!) and talk about this.  Importantly, we also talked a lot about which Metal Gear Solid was better, watched Dr Who together, and had holidays where we didn't do much but eat and build sandcastles.  I didn't have to mask my excitement about what I'd learnt any more, and could have similar conversations with almost anyone I met around the university.  

Having said that, it's tough.  You do a lot of work.  It is entirely possible to have a great time too, but you need to be organised and have great time management.  There is a lot of pressure, and you will spend a lot more time preparing for lectures/supervisions and attending them than anywhere else.  I was an artist and in my final year still had 20 hours of contact time a week.  You will however be more likely to succeed if you are balanced and still having fun. 

The people who have the worst time are those who lose passion for their subject, or who feel the pressure so much that the become ivory tower hermits.  The fact that you've considered it carefully is really positive, and a good sign for maintaining that balance in your life.  No, it's not something that should be instantly accepted and you would be perfectly within your rights to turn it down if you wanted to.

Lack of anonymity isn't some new thing brought in my those nasty Orwellian politicians as you seem to think in other comments, it's been the norm for a long time because it's long been considered the better option. Part of this is that it probably really makes no difference practically all the time, you only ever hear about really extreme cases. On the other hand, it confers advantages like (yes) an improved ability to publicise evidence and ask for witnesses etc. In the extreme case, there's a jolly good reason that the right to a public trial is considered a human right.

&gt; spate of celebrities from the 70's that appear to have gone beyond your socially acceptable sexual fetishes:

Are you so hell bent on promoting your agenda that you'll distort child rape as being a crime only because it's a 'fetish'? It's a crime because of the impact on the victim, not because the perpetrator is considered a bit weird. This isn't particularly controversial, if you think it's obvious you'll have to do quite a bit of justification.

&gt; Let's be very clear here; while any sexual crime is deplorable

I think sexual crimes (specifically, the small subset that are heavily publicised) are really at the root of your complaint, although you're generalising wildly to all other situations. I'd say the real problem isn't the concept of the system, but that for this small subset of crimes the media has recently failed massively to *respect* the understanding of innocent-until-proven-guilty, as have any of the public falling into the same trap with all the biased coverage. Maybe this does necessitate a change, but even then its an incredibly small subset of crimes...you don't even hear about the vast majority of rape accusations. I think your intuition is leading you astray about the wider effect of the policy.

Again, I'm not saying there shouldn't be discussion, or that lack of anonymity has no problems, but that your arguments seem sensationalist and emotional and don't obviously even apply to most cases.

&gt; One woman in question in the audience pointed out that protecting the anonymity of the accused isn't nearly as important, as doing so would discourage other people coming forward with further allegations - that has a smack of ""guilty until proven"" innocent to me

Again, this comes down to the fact that historically this has been a big benefit with not much of a downside, whereas your condemnation is based mostly on a small number of high profile cases. This *might* deserve different treatment due to the modern media dynamic, but I'd argue that just as much attention must be given to general attitudes and how to change the way media distorts things.

**tl;dr**: Maybe there should be some discussion about the few high profile cases that are the basis for your argument, but it is *not* simple or obvious to generalise to the entire system. Even for the cases you're actually arguing about, what are the actual facts and statistics?

North moor is more varied with features closer together (more interesting, but more time going up and down). South moor is more open, gradual and spaced out. For an easy stretch to relax on, hunt out the discussed railway tracks. With 5 days you'll be able to give each area a try.

Kitty tor to Dinger tor is a memorable leg for people that have spent time on the moor a lot. Just remember to account for contors in your route plan.

Most of the pubs with camp sites will look after your car for a couple of quid/ an evenings custom while your out on the moor. The Plume and Feathers in Princetown is the classic central moor one with roaring fires, good food, good beer and welcoming of muddy boots. The Fox and Hounds on the main road between Tavistock and Okehampton has a soft spot in my heart for regularly piling more food onto a plate than should be feasible.

Just plan a route before you go, tell someone and have fun. You can always get signal on top of tors so you can change the plan if need be.

Of course, *I* could be wrong, but I'm not going to be convinced by you pointing to a couple of high profile cases and declaring that the system fails the majority of the time. If you want to convince me (and anyone else of similar opinions), present some general statistics supporting your case. If you want to just rabble rouse...carry on, I guess.

Underneath that childish outer coating is a Doctor who is more self-honest, less arrogant and far more interesting than his immediate predecessor.  Ten played at being a pacifist but reality he was far more violent than Eleven.  Eleven will talk and trick his enemies into standing down.  Ten would often serve as the catalyst to getting the fight going and once it was, he really wouldn't do much to stop it.  

Eleven isn't perfect and he doesn't pretend to be.  Ten did.  He had this whole messiah thing going which, combined with his intolerance of anyone who didn't act in a Ten-approved manner was nothing short of hypocritical.  Only Donna could get through to him and even she had a hard time doing so.   Eleven is far more receptive to other people's opinions and criticisms.

In the end though they are both products of their past.  Ten swore off guns because he realized just how bloody minded he had become. Eleven is more tolerant because Davros and Adelaide forced him to face the consequences of his arrogance.   Right now Eleven is treating the universe like his personal playpen / arcade and its only a matter of time before this too comes back to bite him.

So the cost-overruns are as much the fault of UK-owned companies (BAE SYSTEMS and Rolls-Royce) as the US-owned companies (Lockheed Martin).

And anyway, it's senseless to blame ""industry"" for the problems, as this is all politically driven. Take Cameron's 2010 decision to go Conventional instead of V/STOL. This was an excellent practical idea, not because of the cost but because of the ""system effects"" we could have gained by having CATOBAR equipment on the Carriers - we wouldn't be restricted to only operating V/STOL aircraft, we could have supported conventional aircraft too. Not just fighters (F-18, Rafale being the obvious alternative examples) but the infrastructure - E-2C Hawkeye AWACS, even C-2 Greyhound cargo aircraft. Makes the carrier far more versatile.

But then you get someone saying ""putting CATOBAR costs X, but means we could save money by buying F-18/Rafale instead of F-35"", and all of a sudden the Politics leaps in to play: LM, BAE, RR have their future on the line and a *lot* of ability to ""connect"" with They Who Make Decisions.

Gove makes it sound like 15/16 year olds are learning about Nazism in the form of Mr Men stories.

[The actual exercise] (http://www.activehistory.co.uk/Miscellaneous/menus/GCSE/mr_men.php) is for those pupils to split into teams, each write what they have learned in the form of a Mr Men story, then share it with groups of younger pupils. These younger pupils then have to answer questions on the topic to get points, giving an idea of which group of older pupils best explained the material.

It is *not* an exercise in learning material. It is an exercise in communicating material to an uniformed audience, simplifying it whilst retaining the most important information. These are actually useful skills to learn, in a form that I think is quite interesting and possibly fun.

Yes, it's not strictly necessary to be able to communicate your information in a simple way - you can be a great historian and only write dry, detailed and difficult passages. However, it is a useful skill (across many different fields) to be able to communicate to those outside of your field.

Currently the majority of our elected representatives are pro EU and it's their job to be informed on such things for the rest of us. If the nation was actually serious about leaving the EU we'd see that properly reflected in the next parliament and we can then start talking about a referendum when it's clear the house we elected reflects a nation that is asking one. 

As it is they are framing this as ""give the people a choice"" and anyone who doesn't want to do that as being anti democratic  because for them to see any change they need to drive the debate out of the commons, where currently it's won, and in to the public domain as a do over. 

The *only* reason not to be happy to wait on a referendum for the next parliament is that they are afraid that by the time of the elections they will lose any semblance of mandate if they lose power to over all pro EU parties. They are using the rise of UKIP as an excuse now because they feel UKIP won't actually win many if any seats in the next election. 

For now our only democratic measure of if we require a referendum says we don't need one. Which is totally different to what's happened in Scotland where the leader of their parliament is a member of the party who's been seeking a mandate for independence. 

We have half a party of half a government who didn't make leaving the EU a major platform of the election in which they didn't win a outright majority using the rise of a currently fring party who has no MPs as an excuse to redo a debate that is otherwise currently settle in the commons in a public setting.

Just ask yourself why now? I think it's simply because they don't think they will be in a better place to circumvent the need for an actual mandate to restart a debate they've currently lost.

I'm a secularist too. 

&gt; The Jews had been promised this land, and are just 'redeeming' it, in their eyes.

In the eyes of the ultra-religious Jews, maybe. You are being disingenuous if you think the state of Israel represents a religious campaign. There are a multitude of secular arguments in favour of Israel, and indeed zionism itself (and hence Israel as we know it) exists because of Theodor Herzl, a committed atheist. 

so no, Israel v Palestine is not very much a religious conflict. It's very much a complicated political, racial and economic conflict with religious contributors; not least of which is the radical Islam so popular in the palestinian territories - which you apparently failed to mention. 

&gt; If I wanted to be particularly nit-picky (which for the sake of argument, I will be), the 'church' (as you know it) is represented by the American Christian Right who support the Jews in this conflict.

many christians do see a religious implication in Israel, but to imply this represents any kind of tangible involvement in the middle east conflict is tenuous at best. As above, America supports Israel for a myriad of political and economic reasons, entirely separate from any 'religious' motivations.

&gt; Why do they do this? Because they believe that Jews returning to their promised land will usher in a cataclysmic rapture event.

well this was realised in 1948, so your argument makes no sense. they have no need to continue being interested in Israel.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"Money isn't ""lost"" to avoidance.  In fact, money isn't really ""lost"" to evasion.  However, avoided taxes are completely legitimate, so the state has no claim on that money whatsoever.

To think of it as ""lost"" means that you think all money in the country is the government's and they let you have some of it.

Then you have to factor in the cost-of-collection.  There will _always_ be some evasion because at some point the money you will collect will be worth less than the cost of the enforcement agency to collect it.  Treating evaded taxes as if they are 100% collectible if only we push the right button ignores the real economics of the situation.

Further, one might reasonably argue that the tax rates are set iteratively, which means they factor in the evaded taxes.  The government revenue in that sense will be exactly what it would be in the absence of all evasion; with the only difference being the tax rate the non-evading part of the population pays.  There would therefore not be any extra money from collecting the currently-evaded taxes, there would be lower tax rates (but given the size of tax revenues versus evaded taxes... not very much lower).

Don't get me wrong -- I'm not in favour of people evading tax, after all, I have to pay more because of them.

I'm fairly broke right now, both in terms of sterling and BTC, but I'll try and have enough to buy something, sure I can find things worth having at the market. Alternatively, I wouldn't mind helping out with things like talking to stall holders, explaining Bitcoin to people etc. Also, I have a VPS with spare capacity, so if you need somewhere to host a website, I can provide it (got 300GB monthly bandwidth of which I normally only use 3-5.)

I don't know if I'd go so far as to call myself ""media savvy"", but I have given interviews on camera and on radio before, and don't mind doing so again.

Below I've added some thoughts on what else might need to be done, or problems I think we would need to solve. This is off the top of my head, by the time I've finished typing all this, some people may already have come up with answers.

----
##Infrastructure:
I think we will need to put some thought, and possibly money, into how the POS infrastructure is going to work. Lots of the merchants will be relatively un-tech-savvy, so we need to make accepting BTC as easy as possible for them. I'm sure many will have smartphones or tablets, but am I right in thinking there is still no bitcoin app on Apple devices?

It would be a good idea to provide a free wireless hotspot (not sure if one already exists in Spitalfields), and maybe connect a full-node bitcoin client to it (perhaps even a miner?), so that transactions get relayed quickly and easily - both merchants and purchasers would be connected to the same local node, so both would see the transaction straight away.

The major issue I see is the same one that always comes up with bitcoin POS transactions in the real world: confirmation time. Since this is going to be a well-publicised event, the possibility of someone attempting a double-spend should not be ignored, and it would be irresponsible to advise merchants to adopt a zero-conf policy. On the other hand, we surely don't want people standing around for up to ten minutes waiting for their transaction to be confirmed; that would just make bitcoin look less convenient than cash or plastic.

###LocalBitcoins
It might be a good idea to contact some of the larger, regular buyers/sellers on LocalBitcoins.com - if they came to the event with an ""I buy/sell bitcoin"" sign, they would probably be able to do good business, and make it easier for people to get bitcoins to purchase with.

-----

##Type of bitcoin client?
Should we be getting merchants to actually install a ""real"" bitcoin client on their smartphone/tablet/laptop, or should they just set up an online wallet with blockchain.info or similar? Bitpay seem like they might be a good option, but a bank deposit needs to be at least £100 - do we imagine that an individual merchant would take £100 in bitcoin sales on a single day? Would it be at all feasible to consolidate multiple merchants into a single bitpay account?

-----

##Going forward
I think we ought to look at this day as not just a PR stunt, but a demonstration of how it could work in the future. We should look at infrastructure and workflows that could be used day-in, day-out, not just for today. If the ""pilot day"" is a success, perhaps Spitalfields could become a ""pilot area"" for POS bitcoin sales. The main thing would be convincing merchants that it is in their interests to accept BTC. This means demonstrating a) that people will buy things in BTC given the change and b) the cost to merchants will be less than that of handling credit cards....

###TX Fees
...So we should find out, during T-7, how much they currently pay their clearing house - I imagine something like 2.5%. By contrast, bitpay charge 0.99% (or free, if you just use a deposit address and no payment gateway tools) and the transaction fee is around 3.5p (0.0005 BTC). Bitstamp charges 0.50% per trade, plus €0.90 for each SEPA withdrawal (although not sure how much the BTC-&gt;USD-&gt;EUR-&gt;GBP currency conversion ends up costing!)",0,1368184504,null,0,false,0,c9w2w38,t3_1dzwz5,t1_c9w2w38,t3_1dzwz5,null,1431239855,2,false,BitcoinUK,t5_2wq3q,2

If a criminal comes to the UK from an EU country we can arrest and deport them straight away. In fact UKIP want to get rid of it for some reason. 

If your talking about the Abu Qatada thing then that has to do with the Council of Europe and the Convention of Human Rights and nothing to do with the EU, the EU has had no input whatsoever into the Qatata case. We can't deport people to countries where they are likely to be tried unfairly or tortured. If you think it's OK to send people, immigrants or British people, to be tried for a crime in a foreign country for which little reliable evidence can be produced or somewhere he will be tortured then say. It would make it much easier for us to judge your character.

Also immigrants are not draining our resources, you've been misled. If you read research on the topic rather than the shitty tabloids maybe you'd have a more accurate view. University College London [did a study](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0907/09072302) and found that

Not only that but [EU immigrants make up only about 1/3 of immigration](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jun/26/non-eu-immigration-uk-statistics) and in most cases it's for work not benefits.

To answer /discuss randomly some of your points:

Double spend: Yes this is an issue. For this, I would hope that we could indemnify merchants against this up to a certain amount (20 quid or something) and also, let's not forget, it would pretty ballsy for someone to do this IRL with cameras around etc etc. Not that it is technically ""illegal"" (ie there are no laws against it) but I would press for fraud which can cover stuff like this. Either way - it will help identify the size of the double spend issue and if it really is a problem for. Also, I would envisage that the majority of the merchants cash out their btc position at the end of the day - they are not obliged to do so (and in fact it would be great for them to be on board after the event too).

Spitfields has very good 3g coverage and is perhaps covered by a few wifi places. If there are enough people voluteering then perhaps some could help out with a wifi network - but that's a ""nice to have"" right now.

The rate for buying /selling btc and tx fees - well - that's just something that will have to be decided nearer the day. There can't be too much markup or why on earth would people bother changing from btc -&gt; gbp ?? This is not trying to be a profiteering exercise (although I am sure there are some who will do).

The localbitcoins thing is a good idea - but I find it very hit and miss. Also - physical security may be an issue if there are people with ""large"" amounts of cash walking around. Thankfully though, there are several banks nearby if people want to deposit, withdraw etc etc. If resources allow, then we can assist with a few money checking pens and UV lights.

no problem, sorry if I was a bit harsh. sometimes I feel on the defensive right off the bat when /r/atheists are around. 

&gt; I would like to ask a question of you, with genuine curiosity: if the Jew's divine right to land had never existed, what would the conflict look like?

well assuming you don't believe that there actually is an all powerful being who delivered a rock solid promise to the Hebrews that they would dwell in the land of Israel forever, I assume you are asking me wether the Jews would be in Israel *without* the biblical narrative.

It's a hard thing to separate out; because Jews have lived in Israel for about as long as we have records for. They have certainly not always been in control of the land, or even been significant majorities, but the Jewish presence in what we now call 'israel' is undeniable. 

Before the state of Israel was established in '48, the land was not lacking Jews. Many had been moving in for decades previous, and even before zionism developed as a coherent political movement there were established Jewish communities in Israel, just as there were arab/muslim ones and christian ones too. 

So basically I think that even without any religious motivation, there are good grounds for assuming the state of Israel would have been established as a Jewish homeland. Herzl was not religious, he was a cultural Jew. He was able to distinguish between the religion of the Jews, and the rights of the Jews as a cultural and ethnic group. The holocaust played a major part in softening international opinion to his views, and making people recognise that the Jews, like other ethnic minorities, had a right to self determination and a homeland.

Palestine was the perfect candidate; history supports Jewish presence there, there already was a big Jewish presence there. You need have no religious motivation to put all that together and conclude Israel is where the solution lies. 

I think a more interesting question to ask is; If radical Islam didn't exist, what would the conflict look like? Some of these groups have a religious motivation to kill Jews and wipe out Israel.

Having the division suddenly happen at high school separates peer groups in a somewhat artificial way.

Moreover, would it be simpler? A high school which previously had 7 year groups to deal with, now has *14* to organise. It has to ensure sufficient class sizes, and make sure they can set appropriately by ability. 

You would often be faced with only having enough kids to create two sets for an entire year, leaving the teacher with a nightmarish task in terms of differentiation. My school had only five sets in large core subjects like English. In Geography they had only a couple. Dividing the year group would have removed the option to group by ability substantially or entirely.

Nor would it be appropriate for every child: there are plenty of children born late in the year who can advance perfectly well with the slightly older peer group, and would not benefit from being heldback  in this way.",0,1368188019,null,0,false,0,c9w3f5w,t3_1e276h,t1_c9w3f5w,t1_c9w3cck,null,1431239593,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Some people take it too far, people repost popular stuff endlessly, make up fake stories ect and that kind of attention whoring is a massive pain for the site because it doesn't add something. If a girl enjoys the attention and is courting it based on posting more pictures of tits that's actually original content that people want. 

Also making the generalization that posting in GW is automatically about getting attention rather than a response to it is unfair. Some people are exabishionsit and maybe posting to GW because they like the thrill/idea of it, if what they post gain attention why would it then be whoring to respond to that attention with more posts? If an artist or a musician posts something to reddit and finds an audience for it would you then say that if they post more stuff it's predicated on continued receiving of attention or the response to it?

I'm not saying there are not likely to be people on GW that explicitly ask for attention and use the promise of posting more stuff to get it but to generalize the whole place as those people just seem wrong and I don't think there is actually even anything inherently wrong in what those people are doing.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"Before 1993, players started a game numbered 1–11, and if your regular #7 wasn't playing, his replacement would wear 7. You only ""owned"" a shirt number to the extent that you were the first choice player in that position.

Originally, the numbering strictly correlated with position in the 2-3-5 formation, but obviously those rules had to bend as that formation went out of fashion. Liverpool was, I believe, one of the first places where this correlation broke down even further as star players kept their shirt numbers whilst playing in different positions.

Liddell played outside left so he would have worn 11. 

Ian Callaghan started his Liverpool career in the right winger's #7 shirt, but as he moved around the pitch he wore a number of different, er, numbers. Also, during his time at the club, the correspondence between shirt number and position was breaking down, so he found himself playing on the right in #11 with Keegan wearing the #7 shirt as a forward. Unthinkable, just a few years earlier.

Despite Callaghan's years in the shirt, it was Keegan who made the 7 shirt iconic (perhaps, in part, on account of him wearing the shirt out of position - one of the first cases of ""squad numbering"", I think) and yes, King Kenny went on to cement that number's status, also wearing the 7 shirt out of position.

That's why I highlighted ""7"" as being a heavy shirt specifically at Liverpool, where Keegan and Dalglish, two of the club's most iconic players, have caused it to become associated with a particular, non-traditional role. At other clubs, ""7"" usually just means ""right winger"", and they may have the same reverence for the 10 that we have for 7.

Ironically, Manchester United also make a big deal out of the 7 shirt: Robson wore it out of position, and in retrospect people note that Best wore it, but it was really Cantona sticking to the number he wore at Leeds in the first days of squad numbering.

true,DEADB33F,null,null,"I went to the shop as it's more personal and harder to say no to someone in person than it is over the phone. I also went near the end of the month when the sales staff are chasing bonuses for getting the most contracts signed (I don't actually know if this was a case, I just felt that it couldn't hurt).

Just go in and say something like...

""I'm currently getting my service from X but am considering switching to Y or yourselves. I see you do this deal for £Z. Is there anything you could add to the existing deal to convince me to go with yourselves rather than Y?""

Phone companies are pretty flexible when it comes to changing your plan in order to get you to switch from a competitor.

With T-Mobile they said they'd give me an extra 'bolt-on' which I can swap &amp; change whenever I like. The unlimited Internet option is one of those but I can swap it for another if I wanted to. Eg. when I go on holiday I'll swap it for an international calling bolt-on (discounted international roaming) for the month my holiday is booked in.

They currently have a 12mo SIM only contract for £8, but your internet costs extra. At the time I got my deal it cost £10.50 but included internet, they then dropped it to £8 when they introduced their new pricing structure and I renewed my 12 month contract for the second year rather than leaving to go somewhere else (although I still get the unlimited internet from my previous plan).

Next time I renew I'll probably try and push them for some extra minutes (not that I need them, but I always like to try and push for the best deal I can get)

---

Oh yeah, another tip is that if you know someone in person who's on a 'special plan' that they've negotiated with the provider you're looking to switch to, have them go with you to the shop when you sign up. 

Say ""I'm switching from provider X and want to be on the same plan my mate is on"".

Have them produce a bill listing the specifics of their plan and the sales rep will have a precedent that the plan is something that they can do and have already done for someone else.

I'm not certain if it would have been cheaper then developing three separate aircraft, but it’s plain it hasn't worked, and three very different aircraft have evolved.

The other bad idea was that to save money, the testing and development phases could be merged together. They figured that with modern computer modelling, most of the issues could be resolved at the design stage. The reality is that the growing complexity of fighter design has kept pace with improvements in computer modelling, and the program developed just as many issues as historical programs. Fixing all these issues in aircraft which had already been manufactured was very expensive.

true,SteveD88,cnty-england,Northamptonshire,"&gt;Personally, I'm a good deal more amazed at the cost of changing the carriers which were initially specced to be modular...

Carriers were designed with a catapult conversion in mind, but a *steam* catapult conversion.

The F35's are being developed in parallel with a new magnetic catapult the US are fitting to their new Ford class of aircraft carrier; no one knew its installation requirements back when the QEC designs were drawn up, so they could only work on the assumption that it would take up similar space, etc. 

When they were asked to look at it again for the conversion (cramming 18 months’ work  into roughly 6 months at a cost of £100million), it turns out it is utterly different and all the assumptions were junk. On top of that its not even the same system the Americans are using; they are having it configured in a quad system; we’d only want a pair, and they weren’t offering a very small figure to re-design it (we announced we were going to use it before we’d entered into negotiations with them).

Getting back to the top of the prem will take time since we don't have the ridiculous funding that City and Chelsea enjoy. Liverpool will have to build from the ground up. 

I also think you're unfair in saying that we've gotten worse. If you look at how we played last year the difference is significant. Last year the team ran around the pitch aimlessly.

To the extent that you delete a such file or content from the public portions of our site, the license you grant to Imgur pursuant to the preceding sentence will automatically terminate, but will not be revoked with respect to any file or content Imgur has already copied and sublicensed or designated for sublicense. Also, of course, anything you post to a public portion of our site may be used by the public pursuant to the following paragraph even after you delete it. 

&gt;**By downloading a file or other content from the Imgur site, you agree that you will not use such file or other content except for personal, non-commercial purposes, and you may not claim any rights to such file or other content, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided in writing.**

The long and short of it is that copyright of the images remains to whoever took the image (uploader is agreeing that they are the creator or have been assigned the rights to upload) but Imgur has the right to display the image. Now the DM may have a case for *fair dealings* over using the images in terms of it being ""news"" (I personally actually highly doubt it) but that's something someone would have to look into before crying copyright infringement. What's clear however is that the use of images, if they are pulled from Imgur actually violates Imgur's ToS.

So the people who took the photos the DM are using *may* have a right to have the DM take them down (and even sue) depending on fair use but the DM is breaking Imgur ToS... maybe we can get them banned.

I don't think the fact that he'll be playing in the Champions League would stop him joining us but I reckon it would be with Reina leaving in the future which would tempt us to buy him. I don't see the point in us buying Wanyama because he'd start elsewhere and would cost above 10m, which is too much to spend on back up players. Also kind of the same with Diame but he'd probably join a lesser club (or stay where he is) as long as he's playing regularly.

Re: Jozy, no, don't want him at Spurs at all. To be frank, he doesn't have near the class to make any impact with Tottenham. For a club just on the fringe of making Champions League football, we need a world-class striker. Our strikeforce (or lack thereof) is the single biggest reason why Spurs are currently on the outside of the UCL and Jozy isn't the player to rectify this.

Rumors will abound this summer, but we are always linked w/ Leandro Damiao. Who knows if that will finally happen this offseason but other strikers I could see us signing include Benteke, Loic Remy or even a possible transfer for a slightly aging David Villa.

Jozy has had a fine season in the Eredevise, but taking the step up to the Premier League, and for a top-5 team at that, is a step too large. I'd like to see Jozy come over to a mid-table EPL team and prove himself in the Prem first.

Clint has had an up-and-down season for Spurs (he's scored some truly important goals) but overall, if I'm being honest, he's probably the 11th or 12th best player on the whole squad.

February/March is actually how the cutoff works in Scotland (assuming I am reading what you are saying right). It means you avoid the situation where the youngest kids have only just turned four when they start school. 

This helps, but it doesn't get rid of the problem of there being almost a years difference between the oldest and youngest in a year, it just smooths it out, and means the youngest haven't only just had their birthday at the start of the each year.

&gt;also, if someone is bright enough, might as well let them just advance, no need for rigid structures with no exceptions.

Realistically, once you accept this the problem is solved entirely. There's no reason to arbitralily insist that kids MUST be stuck with a peer group that is only their peer group on a technicality. 

Universities in this country have no problem with repeating periods of study, or suspending a year, or having people of any age whatsoever in any year. Private schools are flexible on the subject as well. 

Drop the fixation on arbitrary age cutoffs and you're sorted. It will only affect a minority of pupils: those who BOTH are at the fringes of the year, AND experience relevant academic consequences.

It might seem stretched to compare food with drugs, but food (esp sugar and carbs) is mood altering. When you eat certain foods they are a key for the brain to release endorphines. So with both food, drugs, drinking, its not the substance that gives the high, its the chemicals that they enable the brain to release. This is what gives the pleasure. For some this can be a great source of comfort and they use it to mask depression or other ailments. What happens then is an ingrained addiction gets a hold of them and brains chemical balance goes even further astray (tolerance builds and they need more to gain the same comfort level they achieved before).

I personally don;t think Reina will go and I'm more than happy with him being our number 1 for several more years. I'd rather we got someone who's just a bit better than Jones to give him a little more competition. If he does go, THIS summer has anyone given any consideration to Julio Cesar as a short term, quality option. He has been incredible at QPR considering the defence he's playing in front of and would likely cost peanuts, then maybe, if things go right, we might be able to lure a higher standard of young player (e.g. Leno) to the club if we can get back into the CL. He isn't worth anything like £15m yet but Leverkusen have a position of power so could easily ask that much.

Diame for me is perfect but thing is he's got a good thing going on at West Ham, they are only going to improve, especially if they can prize Andy away from us.

I'm all for the young players though dude, Brendan seems to strongly favour it and so far his transfers, especially Coutinho, have proven this to be quite effective.

People blow themselves up or commit murder or do whatever else in the name of all sorts the world over. Islam is just one source of justification that these people try to use for their actions. Christianity is another one. For example, Anders Breivik, the man who murdered 77 people and injured almost double that in Norway in 2011, proclaimed himself as a ""Christian crusader"". 

My point isn't to say that only Christians commit atrocities because obviously that isn't true. My point is that people do these things for a wide range of religious and/or political reasons and attaching the 'terrorism' label to a whole religion because of the acts of a few is ridiculous.

The reason Shankly should be remembered with even greater reverence than Bob is because he took us on as a total mess and turned us into (in his words) ""A bastion of invincibility"". The trophy count doesn't outweigh that for me.

Much as I dislike SAF's personality, media baiting and mind games, he did the same for ManU. He turned a distinctly average side into a dominant force, then hung around to collect all the trophies that Shanks undoubtedly would have if he had been able to. Of course he's the greatest ManU have ever had and, painful as it is for me to say it, he eclipsed Shanks and Paisley by combining the achievements of both.

true,Axius,null,null,"Well, first, did you complete your second year or not? That is an important factor.

Second, is it an absolute must that you get into this other University?

I dropped out halfway in my second year due to depression due to family issues. I was told I had to repay what I had been paid for the term I dropped out for, but the important decider in terms of funding was centered around whether or not I had finished the year. You get two 'shots' at completing a year but once a year has been finished, getting funding for that year is, as far as I know aside from exceptional circumstances, pretty much impossible.

If you can go back to your old University, or rather, if you're willing to consider that as an option, go see your admissions tutor for the course you left. Take your documentation with you proving everything. Talk to them and tell them what was going on at the time and make sure that they understand your reasoning behind wanting to return. As you completed your first year there already you could try push for either a minor entry exam or entry straight into the second year and you would circumvent most funding issues.

If there is some time to wait before you can start, I would strongly advise you get in touch with the Student Loans company and see what you may owe them and come to a repayment arrangement. I was informed that I owed them money but as I had been making regular repayments that there would be no trouble claiming funding to continue my studies for years I have not completed. You essentially want to build a 'positive' credit experience with them. This may not be necessary but it helped in my experience.

Just be absolutely certain you want to go back and you're going for the right reasons right now.

As for the other outstanding debt; just make minor repayments until a point in the future you can afford to seriously pay it off. If you informed them that your funding options were under review for previous medical reasons, I think they would be understanding. 

I believe your funding issue revolves around the fact that you completed your first year but left during your second year due to problems. More specifically, your second year was the one that your existing paperwork demonstrates you struggled with due to personal issues, and I believe you should work at it from that perspective.

Best advice I've got for you is to just start talking to admissions tutors. Take any existing paperwork proving what modules you've completed and grades and push for a second year entry. Don't submit any paperwork after finding a place until you talk to the Student Loans Company and explain what year you want to enter and previous circumstance. If you have been repaying what you owe and you have proof you left previously for medical reasons, then you should, imo, be okay.

The wood grain the original artist did was the part that bothered me about it; I didn't ask for that. I didn't even realize he was doing it as I was talking to my husband and the strangers watching me get tattooed, and then it was like 'Whoa, what's what?!' 

Did some research, went to the #1 rated shop in town, talked to a really nice artist and brought him example photos of other tattoos. Had it coloured in on Tuesday, and he and I are planning to re-evaluate it on the 22nd when husband goes to him for his next tattoo and see how it looks once its healed. We both know there'll probably be a few minor touch ups, but quite frankly I was a huge baby about getting it filled in (SO much swearing, all my other tattoos are simple linework so I didn't realize how bad this would hurt) so I don't mind spreading it over two visits.",0,1368205230,null,0,false,0,c9w8hq2,t3_1d0pxb,t1_c9w8hq2,t1_c9my775,null,1431237091,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Clasie is a beast, I think for sure he would be able to grow into one of the next big dutch stars like VDV etc.

Criscito is damn good, he would fit, too. I think the two departments we need to break the bank in is 1) A proven striker with potential, Aubemeyang, Son, Benteke etc and 2) Jozy Altidore, back up type strikers on the cheap, we need a striker rotation to be honest, just 1 simply won't do if we want to be a consistant team. Example, Cisse and Ba combo, one was hot, then the other was cold and vice versa.

And a LB, we need to shell out the cash, it is our biggest liability. We need a LB better than BAE ( who's trash) and Naughton. Buy a big name LB from a forgein market ( Russia, Portugal, Holland, Belgium) on the cheap - mid rang who is still young- mid aged, also use Zeki Fryers as the back up LB next season, or Rose.

For some poor people, there might be a sort of subconscious reaction to it, to do with the idea of nice things being a finite resource. If other people have nice things, that means the first person/people have fewer nice things.

Or maybe there's a hierarchical aspect to it. Maybe some poor people think that, well, at least they're still better (or better off) than gay people. In which case, seeing gay people having fulfilling relationships and not having to be ashamed... that could be awkward for them.

I think I remember reading about a correlation between income and education, so one could make a case for poor people being more ignorant as a result, but that wouldn't say much about people who used to have more income or came from a more well-off family.

the main problem with religious seats is who chooses who is appointed to them, if lets say we are having a Muslim seat, there is no body that represents all Muslims (there are plenty that claim to do so, and that is without going iinto Shia/Sunni Islam), because the religion is not organised as rigidly as the Anglican or catholic church. same really with Methodists, baptists, Hindus etc. and if the alternative is just let al Muslims decide, then who decides who is a muslim/methodist/jedi (after all they were number 5 or so in the 2001 census). and its certainly not fair having members of other groups deciding who represents you.

I really don't want to sign a new striker. We need to give Lukaku a shot at the role.  He has scored 14 in 31 appearances (many of which were sub appearances) thus far this season in the premier league.  If we are to expect him to progress as a player (as we should) that puts him in the 20-25 range based on getting more time on the pitch as well as better service from the players behind him.  How is this not good enough?  If we sign Lewandowski, Falcao, Cavani, etc., how much more than that can we really expect? 30-35 goals if they make the transition to the league well.

2) LB: Criscito--a bit bigger than Benny, also a safer option. I think Rose is a good prospect and having him and Benny fight over the spot could be good for next year. Criscito's wages are also pretty high so unless we're moving Benny on (a move I'm not entirely comfortable with), then I say we let this transfer pass. If Benny leaves though, bring in Domenico!

3) DM: Strootman. He would be on the expensive/luxury side a bit. Very young, great vision, strong passing. He's highly sought after though so this is less likely. Seeing him and Sandro rotate for that DM spot in the 4-3-3 would be amazing. In front of them would be Demebele (where Strootman could also play) and then HoltbySiggy in the CAM role.

I do, which I suppose is one of the reasons I disagree with you.  

&gt; undemocratic

This is a word which I (again, massively different perspectives) feel is unfair when applied to the HoL, because I feel that the entire purpose of that chamber is not to be democratic and to complain that it is undemocratic completely misses the point that (like the monarchy) it's not a democratic institution.  Its purpose is to provide expertise (and potentially minority views) from people who probably wouldn't make good politicians but can still be extremely helpful to the government and the legislature generally.  Someone like the former head of MI5 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliza_Manningham-Buller,_Baroness_Manningham-Buller) could probably have some fantastic insights into certain bills, but might make an abysmal case for election into the House of Commons.  

I like the fact that you can have religious leaders in the Lords because it means they can hold the government to account on issues of religious significance.  I don't mind if 'Lords Spiritual' ceases to be an official thing so long as there are still voters of conscience in the Lords, because it's a position with much more influence and ability than a typical pressure group.

true,cardgrad09,present,Juan Mata,"to me its this kind of thinking as to where we got into this situation now.  We need a deeper squad, emphasis on squad.  Lampard can still play at top levels, but he, nor any other player should be playing 3 games in 7 days.  It's too much and its where you see let downs, both mentally.  Imagine, this upcoming week for example.

I know we are going to CL security and need the win, but winning the EL should be high on the list as well, as it's still a trophy.  I would love to see players like Ake and de Bruyne start next to Lampard and Moses while Mata sits and Hazard only plays 60 minutes. 

Two things happen from this situation.  First, some of your key first team players get a much needed rest.  Second, players that want to fight for more playing time are given the chance to shine.  We all know that Moses isn't going to be the top RW, but he has proven his worth and continues to impress me in the majority of the games he plays.  Imagine if de Bruyne or Lukaku were given these types of chances.  Not only would we get rested players for bigger games, we would also have players more excited to play in them as well, even though they may not be ""first choice"".

First of all, frames do sometimes break. Especially old ones. If the frames were actually worn or damaged when you sent them off, then their offer seems actually quite generous and I'd take it if I were you, ask for the frame to be returned and see if you can get it repaired by a professional, ideally the place you originally bought it or a dealer of whatever it is.

If you honestly believe that Glasses Direct broke your glasses (you aren't the first person I've heard allege this), then you do have a couple of options, but not many. The law (Supply of Goods and Services Act I think, but worth checking before you quote it to them) states that services should be carried out with ""reasonable skill and care"", so you have to consider whether another unqualified glasses seller would have broken the frame if they had carried out the same work. I would email GD, explain that their position is not acceptable to you and you do not accept the work they have done, and ask them:

1. To return the frame to you with the original lenses to have it independently assessed for existing damage/wear, and damaged caused through their actions. 

2. To explain why the wear or damaged was not spotted/noted and why you were not told about the wear/damage prior to them commencing any work. 

3. Set out what you feel reasonable compensation for the damage, e.g., replace the frame with an identical model or model of equal value (for instance a designer frame with another designer frame), or refund you what you feel the spectacles are worth (bear in mind depreciation on over the last 2 years or wear). 

Unfortunately if GD do not or cannot meet your requirements your only other option in this case would be to contact trading standards or to take them to court, depending on whether you think it is worth the time/money/effort. 

If you've already paid them more than £100 on a credit card, you can look into claiming that back through your credit card company, but I believe you can only claim back what you have already paid. 

As GD are not an actual Opticians and not registered with the General Optical Council, you have no other options as far as I'm aware.

Note that you must have attempted to get GD to sort the problem satisfactorily before you contact trading standards or the courts.

Last year I landed a job in May but I met this girl but that's a whole 'nother story. Anyway I lost that job at the end of September last year and I've been looking ever since.

A good website to use in case you were unware of it already is: www.indeed.co.uk - its essentially a job search engine which will take jobs from every job website and put it onto a webpage for you for easy browsing.

I'm not going to lie to you man, if you want to work its not easy. My CV now is pretty alright and I've got a few nice covering letters that I send out. In the last month I've had 3 interviews, one for telephone sales which I got but I didn't want to be on commission pay nor would I be able to get home from the office location because of the finishing time being later than the time the buses run. My other interviews went well and they were for an admin position and a secretarial position but I haven't heard from either yet. 

I only tell you this to prove to you that there is work out there, it might not be what you want (I too am a computer scientist, more technical support though and I cannot find ANYTHING ANYWHERE in that role for entry level) but there are jobs out there. I look at over 200 jobs a day, probably apply for about 4-8 a day*. I get short listed regularly but that's about it.

It is soul destroying, but just try to enjoy your free time because if you do get into full time work it'll go, and you'll miss it eventually. So while your current situation sucks, if you choose the work route - don't over-stress yourself. Something will turn up.

If you go back to University then the best of luck to you my friend.

true,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,"From [this article](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/117797/HO-Firearms-Guidance.pdf) explaining firearms law:


&gt;""Firearm” means a lethal barrelled
weapon of any description from which
any shot, bullet or other missile can be
discharged, and includes any prohibited
weapon, whether it is such a lethal weapon
or not, any component part (see paragraphs
13.69 and 13.70) of such a lethal or
prohibited weapon, and any accessory to
any such weapon designed or adapted to
diminish the noise or flash caused by
firing the weapon

What that establishes is that component parts are similarly illegal as firearms, and so long as it has the capability of firing a bullet it counts as a gun (even if it falls apart after a few shots, which a plastic gun generally would). Possession of a prohibited firearm is minimum 5 years.

The law [seems to group together manufacturing, possession, purchasing and transferring](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27), so if you were making it for personal use, probably just a possession charge. Making it for a friend to shoot and there'd be another charge thrown in.

On my phone so being a bit lazy with looking up more than the numbers, but I know 3 of those lost were Sea Harriers and resulted in the loss of their pilots. 2 of those were from a mission at night or during bad weather, believed to have been lost on a mid air collision near the task force, neither pilots or their aircraft were found as far as I know. The third was lost during a large raid on the Argentine held airfield. From what I remember the aircraft had been with BAE for weapon trials and the radar warning recurve had been removed. During the attack Smythe sea harrier was targeted by a SAM, released its chaff while turning and accidentally made the other the target. With no warning receiver the pilot did not know and was hit and killed by the missile. 

There was at least one RAF harrier shot down as I remember seeing pictures of the wreckage on one of the Falkland islands, but I don't know the circumstances.

As I see it any time a government can decide on the grounds of a secret 'interpretation' of law that it isn't accountable to judicial oversight or international treaties there are no longer any checks on that government's power.  Which admits at least the possibility that such a government will need to be overthrown.

You U.K. people can be naive about governments, it must be easy when you have one that can't even throw Abu Qatada out of the country.  Your security rests in the knowledge that other countries would hold you responsible for breaking your commitments-- if tomorrow Theresa May became PM and decided to hang Qatada there would be serious repercussions.  The U.S. government is the global hegemon and can do pretty much whatever the fuck it wants, so it makes sense to be fearful of it.

EDIT: Speaking of whatever the fuck it wants, here in the U.S. we have a law that says the President gets to send troops to do whatever he wants for up to 90 days, at which point he needs to get Congress's permission for war.  A little while back Obama sent them to Libya, and when that 90 day limit blew by, and Congress had done nothing, the administration decided that under its interpretation a military operation to overthrow a foreign head of state was not war, it was a 'kinetic action,' so they didn't need to follow the laws.

In the United States you can make imitation or real firearms privately without doing anything wrong, notwithstanding local state laws.

A lot of regulation in the United States is based around commerce... so for example, the infamous Kinder egg embarrassment is because it has been deemed irresponsible and illegal to hide toys in food (choking hazard). That's also where the orange tip comes into play. [edit: to take this a step further... you could make your own home-made kinder eggs legally as well. Just because there are bans on the import/sales of them doesn't make it illegal to make your own... it's a commerce issue]

Likewise you can build your own gun, or parts of a gun (including imitations without orange tips).

...Of course when MOD called that option in, lo and behold it turned out not to be *quite* as simple as the glossy brochure said it'd be. Actually there's a fishy story somewhere behind that because even the Americans couldn't believe it was going to cost *that* much to fit the EMALS gear, and went as far as offering HMG a max-cost guarantee. But still no dice. I really wonder what went on with all that and who stuffed up big time - MOD in the original contract, or BAE SYSTEMS for promising something they couldn't manage. Ah well, we'll never know.

Anyway, the rest of your stuff is *mostly* correct but a bit of a Strawman: by the time we have any fixed-wing naval aviation back (of any sort) we'll be so out of practice the institutional knowledge will be retiring or sat behind a desk, so there's less effective difference between re-starting either V/STOL or conventional deck operations again - both are going to be disturbingly close to ""from scratch"" after a break approaching a decade. To be fair the institutions know this which is why there is a small but continuous rotation of personnel on exchange with our US Cousins to keep at least a kernel of knowledge alive. 

And it's not so much that we'd buy C-2 or E-2s (but we'd be idiots not to get a couple of second hand E-2C's if we could operate 'em), but that the decks are opened up to operate *anything*, within reason, over the lifetime of the carriers which is, what, 20-30 years one hopes?",0,1368211781,null,0,false,0,c9wavpk,t3_1e216r,t1_c9wavpk,t1_c9w3ayt,null,1431235955,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Personally, I'd go with the one you'd trust most. 

Could Asia mate double up as best man? Fly over for the wedding?

Alternatively how about using a wildcard. Rather than using one of your mates as best man, ask someone in future MrsHBK's family: her brother, an uncle you get on with, hell, even her father. In return you could mix things up by only having bridesmaid from YOUR family instead of hers. And she could get her MUM to give her away. 

Nobody says that there have to be hard and fast rules about these sorts of things these days, so don't be afraid to mix things up. Frankly, if you stick with tradition, someone's going to be bloody upset anyway. 

Finally, stag do, Asia? Your mates can really afford that and they're not going to resent it/drop out at the last minute? I've seen lots of mates in their late 20s/early 30s complain about constant overseas stag/hen parties and the costs involved.

I've chatted here and home with former and off duty police and firearms are one thing I ask them about often (usually just so I have ammunition to piss off Americans who think the only reason we have such strict gun control is becuase we're all serfs).

The common thread is that it's something that's safe pursue with vigor as by and large the UK public supports our gun laws, that they will pursue it due to the fact that becuase of our culture it's normally safe to assume that anyone owning a gun isn't doing so out of 'home protection' (at least not in the sense the Americans use the term), that it is in a strogn way making the streets safer, and that basically as they're not armed themselves it's a matter of preemptive self preservation (that usually only comes out after a drink or five). 

The final reason is that it also sends a clear message to organized crime groups. In the UK they often do carry firearms but are loathe to use them (this I can confirm from other drinking buddies- alcohol is the great equalizer). Essentially the 'no quarter given' approach means gangs are less likely to fire off (haha), and thus less likely to endanger the public.

The running joke is that this is why we can't expect a new GTA London any time soon, as fire one shot from a .22 pistol and you've got an instant 5 stars :P

Oddly enough I've never spoken to an officer who wanted to carry a gun themselves. They all seemed to be hell bent on maintaining the status quo with regards to our gun culture, but none of them wanted to actually carry. From what I understand that's the majority opinion. 

Seriously though, I'd read up on our gun culture and firearms laws in the context of the rest of the world.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"As an aside (kind of off topic), from my basic knowledge of revolutionary America (which consists of one small-ish essay but quite a bit more reading) it seems to me the 2nd amendment is a historical anachronism and a remnant of Jefferson's vision of the US which never really materialised. He though the US would become a libertarian's wet dream where there would be little need for central control, each family would be subsistence farmers and they would defend their land from us Brits and possibly the government with their guns they had a right to have. There would be no standing army or powerful leader to tyrannise the people. Of course such a model was beaten fair and square by Hamilton's industrial capitalist model and thus an army was created and owning a gun became a freedom but not a necessity. Any feeling of responsibility for being the 'well regulated militia' that stood between British Canada and Washington vanished but people bought and had guns anyway. As weapons became more deadly and less helpful to have widely available there was no corresponding policy change because it was in the constitution and not of lesser legal status. As such there was not any real possibility of change and we have the situation today however you see that situation. 

I'm not saying there should be no right to bear arms necessarily but merely that I don't think any weight can be given to the content second amendment just because it's in the constitution. It's there because people disagreed about the future of the country and the utility of a strong state not because of it's intrinsic value as a principle. It would have been discarded by now had it been less difficult and politically unpopular to amend the constitution. 

That's what I got from it anyway.

Of course if it is incapable of firing and not readily convertible to a state of readiness to accept and fire live ammunition then that is OK.  In fact you can buy a multitude of real guns that have been deactivated by a professional gunsmith fairly readily. Usually the barrels are plugged, the ejector welded shut and the working parts removed (so the firing pin and the hammer or striker and their mechanism).   

edit; In terms of it being rendered unable to fire (ie deactivated) it would have to be a long way from being able to fire and I'm not sure how far away you could really get from it being ready to fire.

I don't see anyone banning 3d printers in the united states at least... and the information is not illegal to possess, but due to ITAR it's illegal to distribute to other countries ([check this out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Zimmermann) for more interesting applications of it)

Personally, again, as an American, I would like to see a 3d printer ban attempted especially this early on, because it would be annihilated by our legal process. I want to see these things go to the supreme court (including this particular application of ITAR) so that we can have our first amendment rights asserted and defended... before something big and crazy happens in 30 years and emotions drive the discussion.

This is a great opportunity for more pressures against the government overstepping its boundaries in the U.S.

In any event... it's better we have this ground tested and covered early in the game rather than late, is my thinking :) My feeling is that knowledge and information should flow freely... and 3d printers aren't going away, no freaking way.

With the pin, if you are over 18. Five years (Section 1(1) of the above act). 

If you just printed the parts and left them around (and happened to have something that could work as a firing pin in you home) the CPS would have to prove that is was a readily convertible imitation but if they did then it would fall into the scope of the above act, so again five years.
In the case of the latter you could try to state that you didn't know but i don't think that will fly in court.

true,ThePhlogist,eng-GreaterLondon,Londinium,"It's black and white for a criminal who has access to guns. Either you get a gun or you risk being overpowered. If normal people have guns you can't afford not to have a gun as a criminal, your 'profession' revolves around being more powerful than the person your attacking. Thus if they can criminals will always have guns. The only 2 options for a law abiding citizen is to have gun yourself or risk being held at gun point. This is one of those rare cases where it actually is black and white because the difference in power a gun gives you is so dramatic. 

&gt; especially when nothing involves criminals carrying guns whilst the law abiding don't

But that's the thing isn't it. Gun crime is so low in this country because it's so hard to get guns. The ban on handguns means criminals don't have guns and so law abiding citizen's don't have them either. Criminals don't carry guns in this country. A criminal doesn't need it to do what he wants to do. A handgun ban won't end crime and maybe it won't even reduce it by all that much but the end result will be a higher survivability when attacked by a twitchy, desperate criminal. Crime is inevitable but being dead is not.

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt;It's a fair point about Muslim authorities, although the main Christian groups are relatively clearly delineated.

well the COE and Catholic church have fairly organised structures (and thus a pool of appropriate candidates can be easily drawn), but with baptist, Methodist, Gospel and the various other denominations, the churches don't usually have such clear and defined leadership.

&gt;I do, which I suppose is one of the reasons I disagree with you.

nothing wrong with that, and many religious leaders are taken to authority, the Archbishop of York for example, but i disagree that to most people a religious post or title is seen to give the authority that it did when the lords spiritual were last changed (i.e. by King Henry VIII).

&gt;This is a word which I (again, massively different perspectives) feel is unfair when applied to the HoL...

I suppose this just boils down do my opinions on the house of lords and how it works, its not a terrible institution, but i believe it would be an improvement to have more democratic elements to it.

realistically, i think there are more pressing problems with how our government works, especially as the COE is so politically (self) restrained, but if bishops ever got like the ones in the states, I think it would be genuinely frightening.

&gt;I don't mind if 'Lords Spiritual' ceases to be an official thing so long as there are still voters of conscience in the Lords

With regards to crime there are a lot of conflicting arguments, the main ones in America in my opinion could do with a greater appreciation of the causes of particular crimes. As often quoted by gun rights advocates the majority of gun violence is related to gangs. Now gang violence would continue if every gun in America vanished tomorrow it'd just be people stabbing or beating each other up instead, the causes of gang violence have been pretty well understood for a while it relates more to poverty and lack of opportunity or community breakdown than gun laws. 

Drops in overall crime need to be seen as part of wider trends and take into account other causes like those given above, so overall yeah I'd say it's pretty murky.

There's a lot of stuff that's been said about this but there's no denying that BR never really gave him a shot. he basically ear-marked him for sale and scarcely played him, even in the friendlies. And considering BR's knack for really getting players to say Andy can't be reigned in as well.

The re-emergence of Downing is also something to consider. While he was set to leave, we'd be without a single conventional winger and keeping Carroll would make little sense under those circumstances, as we wouldn't be able to take advantage of his heading but now that Downing has planted him self in the XI, Andy's inclusion should be re-evaluated as well.

The bottom line however is he is expendable and if the right offer comes (above 15m imo) he probably will go, but anything beyond that surely shouldn't be concerned.

The obvious gonners are Marin and benyaoun (spellcheck)... Both have suffered on the pitch for Chelsea and quite frankly we have ten times better at there position. 

I kind of think if we sign a big striker we might shop Torres. Because if Jose comes up, I don't think Lukaku will be going on loan anywhere. And rumor has it he wants Rooney.... That's 4 strikers. No thanks.

From what I can tell there are various offences;

* Carrying a firearm (or imitation) with [intent to commit an indictable offence](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/18), resist arrest etc. carries a maximum life sentence,
* possession of a firearm with [intent to endanger life or cause serious property damage](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/16) carries a maximum life sentence,
* possession with [intent to cause fear of violence](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/16A) is probably the one you were thinking of, with a maximum 10-year sentence,
* carrying [certain firearms and/or ammunition in public](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/19) (or an imitation) has a maximum of 7 years,
* [trespassing with a firearm](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/20) (or an imitation) has a maximum of 7 years or 3 months (depending on whether it was in a building or just land).

Sentences are listed in [the Schedules](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/schedule/6/part/I). And these are just the first few I found.

There are also offences relating to the possession, manufacture, sale, acquisition, transfer etc. of [certain firearms](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/5), which I think would include this printed gun.

(Suarez for example, was on £35k when he signed).",0,1368225539,null,0,false,0,c9wfin7,t3_1e2glr,t1_c9wfin7,t1_c9wfgyg,null,1431233666,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,R4tb3lly,lfc68,,"I can understand where you are coming from but I just don't agree. Suarez came to LFC on the back of a 55 goal haul at Ajax that season. Suarez has shown his strengths. And those strengths are why I think Sturridge will never match his level.

First of all.

1. Suarez is far better on his feet with the ball, he has a feather touch, and a mean first touch. He is a player that plays the messi style of football. Sturridge however does not have that natural dribbling ability which separates the men from the boys. I think even if he did get better with the ball at his feet I don't think he would be able to match the fluidity and grace that Suarez has.

2. Suarez has a hunger for the game that I think surpasses any player today. It's so intense, as we have seen, it's gotten him in quite hot water. This is something you can't be taught or given. He's a player that goes 110 until he is in that tunnel. Sturridge, while not questioning his drive, has no where near the work ethic or intensity Luis does.

3. Suarez creates space in a class where only Thomas Mueller could possible join him. This is one of the most important aspects of why I don't think Sturridge will ever compare. His speed, low center of gravity, and vision all combine to make him, IMO , the best in the game at creating space. So not only is Suarez creating chances with the ball at his feet, whether it be a teammate, or solo. But he is creating chances for himself and his teammates without the ball. Say he does not have the ball and finds a space and he is free, a defender sees that and charges towards that space. Now in this moment Suarez has created either a chance for himself, to have the ball passed to him, he has created a chance for the player on the ball to either shoot or pass. As well as a possible chance for another teammate. The importance of finding and creating space is extremely important.

Now this is just my opinion and I have tried to give a few points as to why I think that. You could be entirely right and he could turn out to be the next Torres for us, but it's of my opinion that he lacks some of the natural talent as well as work ethic to contend with the elites like Suarez, Cavani, Lewandoski, Zlatan, etc. 

And just to clarify, because it's hard to interpret ""tone"" on the internet, I am not attacking or angry. I just am having a civil discussion.

You have any idea how easy it is to make a gun like the liberator (crude, and not as good looking)? You would really just need $50 worth of supplies. 

&gt; The fact some people are considering printing an actual gun is absolutely mental.

Oh come one, you make no effort to understand why people like guns, when I have little doubt that you've never fired one in your life. Saying it's mental doesn't write off the numerous good points they've made that government can't easily prohibit materials and pieces of machinery from the public like it used to. The point is to take away power from the government and to show that really, government is losing more and more power each day. In America, they don't trust their government nearly as much as you brits do. They view the state as something that has the ability to pass anything and take total control over your life; which it most certainly can. A distrust of government is completely healthy. I don't trust my government, and you shouldn't either.

In the midfield, essien can sub for Rami, Luiz for Mikel, and KDB for Oscar (as a deep lying playmaker, which I've been led to believe Oscar is being 'groomed' for). Rami for the box to box mid, Mikel as the DM.
Mata as the AM, with Hazard playing as a rotation to offer something different to the attack. Basically, giving the option to pick how you want to play: pass through= Mata, dribbles=Hazard.

Torres because he seems to be developing into a more supporting forward, and having another forward with Luka hopefully will lessen the shock of starting for a top level club.

I get the sentiment and you want your opinion to be heard, but it just gets soooooo repetitive, especially because people don't bother to use the search function to find previous posts that answer, point by point, why Andy Carroll isn't going to be a LFC player anymore. Unless we're unable to find a club that wants to take him.

The main reason is that we can't afford to have our 3rd choice striker, he's 4th choice behind Borini IMO, or ""Plan B"" on 80k a week wages. We're trying to trim the wage bill and change the structure towards a performance based wage structure. Do you really think Carroll has earned his 80k wages? 

The other reasons are basically that he doesn't fit our system. He's great as a target man in a direct system and his performances at Newcastle and now, at West Ham, prove that. But the things that he excels at in those systems, are things that we aren't going to be doing often. We're not going to hoof it out of the back, we're not going to rely crossing and wing play^even ^though ^we ^do ^that ^too ^much ^already ^IMO, and we're not going to play a direct style. This is nitpicking a little bit, but he also creates an easy out for his teammates to do those things because he's such an easy target when they're in trouble.

Even last year when we spread the ball out wide and repeatedly crossed the ball, he only scored 4 times and that was mainly because he didn't try to attack enough crosses. Too many would he drop deep for the ball, help find an outlet pass, and then he would jog up the pitch while watching the play develop in front of him, refusing to get in the box and attack the cross. That's why you see Nolan, Diame, or Vaz Te scoring most of West Ham's fast break opportunities. To further prove my point, 5 of his 7 goals for West Ham are off set pieces.

His movement is pretty bad also. He's far too predictable. Every time he expects the ball to crossed/played to back post, where he'll try to out jump the defender, when a near post run would have been so much more effective. He also never makes back shoulder runs, like Sturridge or even Suarez sometimes. 

Also he was awful the 1st half of last season, appearing irregularly, and only started to find form when he was featured every game and you want him to be an option off of the bench? Doesn't make sense for us or Big Andy, unless he wants to make the occasionally appearance while collecting his pay check.

He doesn't have to, if your country decides to go all nanny state and regulate the internet because of this; I suggest you take a look back at all you've allowed your government to do, and try to change it.

&gt; How has this damaged 3d printing? Last week nobody was talking about banning 3d printers and this week I get the feeling that there are people giving regulation some thought.

That's their problem. The thing is, I don't know about the U.K., but the one thing I can trust the republicans on is being rational when it comes to gun laws. They would never allow for such a thing to pass. This was to make the government and nanny-staters realize that the government can't simply prohibit materials or pieces of machinery. Things are getting more and more out of the control of government every day. If nanny-state senators choose to react with more restrictions on the people, then the most we can do is vote them out of office.

&gt; As for internet freedom, the US government took down the site hosting the files and they've now moved to the pirate bay.

No matter what you do, the file will remain on the internet. The agency realizes this. It simply had to act due to the media attention. 

&gt; Everyone now has another reason to hate on p2p and TPB has happily painted a big target on their foreheads.

I have not heard of any rap TPB is getting from this. And I think it's great that I can go on TPB and print the gun out on my 3d printer.

&gt; He said the roundabout was already “near capacity”.

&gt; The Scottish Government is yet to commit to building a flyover or underpass at Sheriffhall. A spokesman said any improvements would be designed to limit conflict between vehicles using major arterial roads like the Edinburgh Bypass and local traffic.

If memory serves, the reason Sheriffhall isn't a proper grade separated junction as it is is due to the presence of old mine workings in the area, which is why the much cheaper roundabout was put in place.

Am somewhat struggling to imagine ScotGov enthusiasm for pouring another few hundred million (guessing wildly with the sort of cost overruns we've seen of late...) into Edinburgh's transport network in the near future...

As for schedule congestion, there is a rotation to be made with Ba coming on for either Torres or Luka, then whoever went off replacing the other. As for our midfield, attacking midfielders is our talent, which has shown to leave our back four vulnerable because only Mikel really suits a double pivot system. Rami is good at tracking back, but his defensive talents are lack. Luiz has shown that he lacks the stamina to play consistently in the midfield for a full ninety, and he also has shown lapses in concentration leading to more defensive problems. Oscar, while showing good raw talent in possibly being able to neutralize single threats (Pirlo), I dont believe has the special awareness to play in the pivot. Lamps is clearly no DM. I wanted to shore up defense: Mikel playing the major role in this, with Rami and Oscar in a supporting role (where any lacking defensive ability wouldn't be as easily exploited). Then, on the counter, those two could push up. Also, as for strikers, if we lack the quality to play a two striker system, we clearly couldn't play a lone one as evidenced by this season.

true,MagmaSuperstar,somerset,Wurzel County UK,"The stabbing trap situation sounds like a very specific one, there would be particular motivations involved people don't just trap and stab people for fun. In which case chances are the person would be out numbered, or surprised so a gun wouldn't necessarily help anyway, honestly it sounds like a weirdly specialised hypothetical to be an argument for anything. Listing off crimes and hypothetical situations is just a useless argument anyway, you name situations where it would help I name ones where it would make things worse and it goes round and round in circles.

The good guy argument is true in SOME situations, often in terms of law enforcement when the person is out numbered or the situation is fairly slow building. The good guy vs bad guy argument as I said before totally ignores the emotions involved and the fact that most people with a gun for self defence aren't trained to handle stressful situations when armed which involves a very particular mind set and specialised skills, even professionals can get it wrong in the case of a shootout and hit the wrong person in the heat of the moment. There's also possibilities of accidently shooting somebody because you thought they were an intruder, or in cases where the criminal isn't violent but merely relying on threats out of desperation such as in cases of mugging or robberies. Pull a gun and they freak out and the chances of it ending in violence jump significantly, it's better to hand over the wallet than try to go all tough guy/gal spoiling for a fight on them that's not self defence.

Either way it's never going to be as simple as the childish, overly simplistic slogan good guy vs bad guy crap because people, crime, or life for that matter is not that simple. It's not crazy for people to be able to defend themselves alone, it is crazy to suggest people are safer if the second they're in a dangerous situation they pull a gun. Stress + gun + panicked or threatened people usually leads to bad things for everyone involved, options to calmly leave a situation narrow considerably the second somebody pulls a gun.

true,Boonery_Cufoonery,null,null,"That's the thing; all debt for the mid second year had to be paid back by me, since Student Finance didn't send them any money, due to me finishing before the end of the first semester of that year. I had to pay the outstanding tuition (which was fortunately still on the lower rates) to get the letter from the therapists from that University which I had to use as my evidence as to why I left and started afresh. The only debt that was outstanding were the payments that were made for my first year, which they are waiting for through my future wages.

When I got wind that my evidence was insufficient for funding, I went straight to the admissions office to see what could be done, I said I have would happily paid it in £650 instalments per month while I was attending, sadly due to already being enrolled they said the finance department couldn't permit it (and we got in contact with them to make sure).

While working on the cover letter for my evidence, I did write it to the perspective of ""If I stay for a second year, it wouldn't be good for me, here is the proof to show this"". Sadly it wasn't enough and I understand why; while I did get a signed and headed letter from the in-house therapist, I was too shook up to see a Doctor, a more credible(?) source of evidence.

The reason I want to go back is still the same reason I wanted to almost two years ago: to get my degree in something I enjoy and want to excel in, both personally and academically. I'm not much of a ""uni life"" guy, sure I make friends and socialise, but I want to be there for myself.

Thanks for the advice though and I'll see what I can do, there is nothing saying I can't hand in the same evidence twice, so I could always try re-writing the cover letter, explaining why and when the evidence comes into play. But due to all of this mess I would have to resit this (first) year at this current University as it's currently suspended due to not paying the tuition fee, which made them suspend some of my services (no access to the system, cannot hand in assignments) this would mean I would have to request tuition for the first year *twice*.

A Tv show is paid for and the actors are paid when it is created, nobody gets royalties, well apart from those that are in the inner circle. I wont support theft from creators i wont pay middlemen that have stolen from artists and make it more difficult for us all to get the entertainment we want when we want at a reasonable price, they have their release windows so they can play games with their power over us, but they know that power has been lost. 

I will pay to the station that has developed and paid for the shows i want to watch, the likes of HBO who have spent a small fortune but got it all back in one contract. I refuse to pay for content until copyright laws are changed and those that deserve the billions made from content get paid a substantial amount more than they are being paid now. When a movie makes a billion dollars and is still call a loss and does not pay those that deserve royalties is not something i will ever pay for.

A bit like Chelsea to be honest.
If he turned down Man.U then that means he cares less for the prestige of the position and more about the control over the team and ability to mold a team to his liking without major influence.

At Man.U you'd have the board and the owners combing over the finance of every purchase, and their 'intended' policy of developing youth over glamour purchases.  Also you'd still have fergie hanging around the club, throwing his shadow everywhere.

At Chelsea he ultimately only has Roman to persuade in terms of purchases (okay, the board as well but as if they're going to say no to the big fish) and WAY more influence over molding the roster.

true,umilmi81,null,null,"Jefferson, and all the founding fathers, feared a state military.  Afterall, they just fought and won their independence against a state military.

Look carefully at the text of the second amendment:

&gt;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

The position of the commas makes the meaning such that the founding fathers knew that a state militia is necessary so people need to be armed to defend themselves from the state militias.

If we set aside the notion that a democracy can become tyrannical (which we really shouldn't do because Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-Sung, Fidel Castro, etc all rose to power through popular support) there is still the matter of self defense.

If you deprive a person of the means of self defense you have effectively denied his right to self defense.  Imagine if a defendant in the justice system were not allowed to use modern technology in their defense.  They could only use pen and paper to communicate, and audio and video recordings were banned for use in their defense, but technology was still allowed by the government.  Would they be able to make a fair defense for themselves in court?

Imagine if the first amendment only applied to print newspapers.  Would freedom of speech really still exist?

I think that a good team should be flexible and be able to adapt to beat the opposition.

Our plan A is sort of weak is terms of it's coherency and our plan B doesn't really exist. We rely mostly on moments of individual brilliance which I think the article points out at as well. 

It's also one of the reasons I dislike Benitez. I don't really get his football. I'm not totally sure what he's going for or what he's all about. People say he hasn't had enough time with the squad but I don't buy that. I understand that because of the lack of time the squad won't be so well drilled but we should be able to see what the philosophy is, and I don't really. I see him shouting the word 'compact' a lot but that's about it. We also aren't very flexible. We just sort of grind away until someone pops up with a stellar bit of skill or a set-piece.

We tend to expect things to be easier than they are, then put in a small amount of effort before concluding that it's way too hard and moving on.

We're also are embarrassed when we have to try really hard at something, which is a silly value system to have. If you have to try harder than someone else to do the same thing, you've learned it better, you've done something harder, and you've improved yourself much more than they have.

Incidentally, it's worth noting that the Coop Bank is also a capitalist business, not truly a socialist/mutualist one, in the sense that whilst it is mutually/worker _owned_, it is not mutually/worker _controlled_.

Thing is that the US is fairly far to the Right, politically. We're not left wing, it's just that the typical US-ian idea of where the ""centre"" in politics is, isn't where many other people think it is.

It's not just the UK, most countries have some sort of a positive experience with moderate socialism, or at the least centre politics that seem left-wing to some.

Some other places are even more left-wing. In Russia, the second most popular party is still the Communist Party, who are also popular in the Czech Republic and I daresay many other former Soviet countries.

In India some very left wing regional governments have done rather well - in particular Kerala which did a lot to raise levels of adult literacy and reduce poverty.

In Germany the Green Party have a very respectable level of support. In Scandinavia some countries default mode is moderate socialism. In France, the state controls some major industries.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; UK politics are not left-wing, they tend towards centre-right

Absolutely not true. Only a Brit that has never travelled could imagine his country is centre-right.

The UK *is*, indeed, extremely left-wing. If you take a walk through London you'll see the poorest of the poor given free but expensive accommodation next door to the richest areas - while the middle class have been banished outside the M25.

Racism is such a politically hot topic that being accused of racism in the workplace (whether true or not) is enough to see you fired and blacklisted - what's another offence that is equivalently so powerful: paedophilia. How a country can equate discrimination with sexual interference of children is beyond my mental comprehension.

There's a general arrogance in all the people that they ""have rights"" regardless of whether they contribute to the country or better themselves.

Some aggressive cyclists have absolutely no interest in the general purpose of transport - and think they are entitled to ride wherever, whenever, regardless of the extremely negative impact this has to journey times for the rest of the public.

Adults walking in London don't believe they should look both ways before crossing the road! If you argue this point with them they'll admit they have a driving licence - but think cars should stop for them. No responsibility. No care.

A left-leaning society is one that has no regard for other people - no need for responsibility - because of ""entitlement"". And you cannot possibly argue that the British are the most self-entitled people in the world!

I see everyone accusing the author of being from the USA because, they imagine, the guy posting this thread *must* be a right wing extremist because you all believe the UK to be centre-right (thereby justifying everything that's ever done as ""normal""). However I'm not from the USA - which is more right than most nations - but that's nothing to do with the fact that the UK is so far left it doesn't know what centre is anymore. I'd call UKIP a left-of-centre party.

How can anybody explain Labour's ""tattle-tale"" culture of naming and shaming everybody that ever opposed immigration? The jailing for ""word crimes""?

true,dave8001,null,null,"Fair enough; i understand the point you are trying to make.... It's basically more intelligent people who have developed the deductive reasoning to be able to utilise the transferable skills needed to work out how to pirate; therefore making the intellectual shows have fewer audience figures and seem less universal.  

I am going to put a much simpler argument to you:  Shows that require greater thought to watch them are; by definition; already less universal.  Don't get me wrong I love watching programmes like Sherlock; Doctor Who; The Wire and Luther which all require a long attention span and an ability to follow an intricate story (sometimes over a number of weeks).  But I also like watching programmes like The Big Bang Theory; Two and a Half Men and The Simpsons. Shows that don't require to have too much previous knowledge from within the show to appreciate and run; fully; with the story.  They are; by definition; easier to watch and therefore more universal.  

The more universal a show is; and the easier to understand; the greater audience numbers will be when watching the show because MORE people can understand it.  

Now; I love Doctor Who. I own every episode that is available since 2005; and a fair whack of the classic series.  These have been legally purchased; and watched on numerous occasions.  However; just because I own them does NOT mean I didn't watch the episode the night it originally aired; or within the week during syndication on television.  Subsequently; I'd imagine people who've pirated programmes have done much the same thing; watched the episode on TV; then at the first possible time downloaded it.  

The audience figures you quoted relate to the two eventualities I explained regarding the way I watch Doctor Who; so would only be marginally affected by people downloading; or waiting until DVD release of the show.  The margin would also be proportional to that of shows like The Big Bang Theory and Glee; shows that are more universal and easier for more people to watch; and therefore no real consequence to the overall figures of either type of show. 

To round up my argument:  Yes; piracy is bad, but it is not responsible for the lower viewing figures on more niche shows. The smaller viewing figures are as a result of them being niche and not universal. More bums can fit in a bus than a taxi.

Britain is generally a free-market state with strong individual rights, backed up by a comprehensive social safety net and some restrictive laws. To me that makes it pretty centrist.

Overweight people are cast as lazy, stupid, ignorant about their health or termed as leeches on the NHS. It doesn't seem to occur to people that if it was that easy, no one would be fat. I don't have any sympathy for those who try and blame others for the size they are, other people can be a contributing factor but overall you are the only one in charge of what goes in your mouth. 
Society in general is still misunderstanding of mental health, or just plain ignorant. That is changing, slowly, but it is not anywhere quick enough IMO.

Towns, cities and villages tend to be much closer together in the UK though, sometimes with barely a few fields between them.

Generally speaking, cost of living in cities is cheaper than rural areas, and cheaper in the north than the south. You'll probably need a car if you live somewhere more rural, and they are much more expensive to own than in the US, which drives cost of living up. Petrol is three times as expensive, average car insurance is 20% more expensive, and you pay up to £1000 per year road tax, depending on the age of the car and CO2 emissions (most people pay much less in car tax, but, in my experience, many Americans want bigger cars even when they move to the UK).

As for the job market, unemployment is high, especially in rural areas. That's why I'm so convinced you'll need a car, you're probably going to have to commute. I live right in the middle of a city with decent public transport, and even I'm finding it a bit more difficult to find work because I don't drive.

This, as a result, is lessening the quality of television because those of us who pirate are also not showing support or appreciation toward the network producing it, which can be done even while pirating, but only a handful of people actually bother to email or post on the networks Facebook walls about their appreciation for the show.

I can understand that they are already less universal, but I know the community is stronger than it appears if more of us were to show our appreciation by watching via the network instead of piracy. Mostly I am just worried that NBC isn`t going to renew Hannibal because my god that show is brilliant, and I would miss it dearly if it weren`t renewed. But most people aren`t aware of how to take a show and ensure a new season of it, which is more or less, simply watching it via network television.

Not only that, but future shows will be much simpler and dumbed down because those that are intricate and developed won`t do as well. Given there will always be good TV but less and less of it. Its basically a plea to fandom to support their shows, let the network know that we care and are watching.

I`m a piracy advocate, but only in promo, if you like something after the test, let them know, and that will ensure quality TV and hopefully take over those simplistic formulaic shows.

Thing is there's are more deaths and accidents for cyclists waiting at red lights than there are by the people that jump them.

While I stop at red lights, I don't care about those that don't as long as if it's safely done.  You should be more annoyed at the thousands of drivers that blow through them (again, causing death and injury).

I wasn't around back then, but I have done my research, and to me it seems like a *great* leap of logic to compare SAF's elation of an ""average"" Man United to Shankly's elation of a *shit* LFC squad. Taking a mid table team to the top isn't the same as taking a league 2 squad to the top within a few years. I know this has nothing to do with Paisley (well it kind of does, Paisley was in the back room at LFC at the time, but whatever) but I just don't think that you can say SAF has that specific achievement of Shanks completely equivocated. 

Also, Shanks might have had just as much success if he stayed on as Paisley, but the fact is that he *didn't* stay on, and no matter how good the team and foundation a manager inherits it does NOT guarantee the kind of success Paisley achieved. As the article (and we all know anyway) said, Paisley was the only manager EVER to win 3 European cups. Not only that, but his stint was a little more then a *third* of SAF's. There have been countless managers who have inherited a top side, but only 1 has the average of one European cup every .33 years thereafter. 

I know you aren't trying to discredit Paisley, Shanks, Or SAF, and neither am I, BUT I do think it is an overstatement to say SAF is both of those combined. As great a Manager as he has been, a truer thing to say would be he has an eclectic mix of each of their qualities.

That should also answer your question about my favourite shop :)

All that is quite unhelpful for you, of course, but the transferable point is that you should know what suits you, and stick to it.  There are plenty of websites out there that can help you work out what your body type is and give you some pointers for dressing it well, but there is no substitute for going out and trying on lots of things to see what looks good.  After a while, you get to know what suits you and start to be able to recognise it on the hanger/screen, meaning much less time spent trying on things that have no hope of fitting right.  Men's jeans in particular are a good one for this, as many shops won't change the cut of their core range for years, even decades, so once you've found one that looks good, you can just keep buying the same thing.

That being said, I've never met a man who didn't look his best in a polo shirt.  As for avoiding looking like a hipster, it seems to be all in the accessories.

true,txteva,null,null,"&gt;Thing is there's are more deaths and accidents for cyclists waiting at red lights than there are by the people that jump them.

Really?  It's not something I've heard of? I've been nearly hit by a few bikes as a pedestrian when they jump the lights but I've not heard of bike accidents while waiting - I'm genuinely intrigued in how this happens? Is it getting cut up by cars?

&gt; You should be more annoyed at the thousands of drivers that blow through them (again, causing death and injury). Strange how it's nobody ever mentioned red light jumping on motoring topics, but anything to do with cycling and it'll get mentioned.

I think it's more that its generally accepted that a car driver going through a red light is in the wrong and is an idiot but for cyclists its okay to it. And that's the part that annoys me.

Certainly a car will do far more damage but also they are far more likely to get caught. 

&gt;  People tend to get sick of it when there are a large minority of drivers that will ""toot"" for not riding in the gutters while overtaking with about 30 cm gap.

That's a point I will take on board.  I'll probably still toot those going through red lights though.

&gt;Bring on proper cycling facilities. I'm bored of the aggression from knuckle draggers.
Indeed - its more pleasant for everyone with decent facilities!  Some busy roads around Bristol really need cycle lanes or something - having it on half the roads make drivers complacent I think. 
I do think a bike safety course should be more wide spread.  And bike awareness courses for buses and lorries. 

&gt;Thank you for giving us room, it's very appreciated.

I'll keep doing it - even if I annoy those behind me... the 30 seconds saved squeezing past a bike is not worth someones life.

I am glad you can see that, the bullying and social acceptance aspects are still the same. So is being an alcoholic or drug addict a choice then? And what about people with mental health issues, is it a choice to suffer from depression or eating disorders? FYI ANY disorder where food is used for emotional rather than hunger or pleasure reasons is classed as an eating disorder. 

&gt;Seriously try being short, mixed race, from a religious minority, bucktoothed and speccy in a small village in Sussex. Given the hell I went through, and the beatings I took (FS, I have a pin holding my sternum together, for crying out loud, because some girls in my class kicked my ribs in) I think it's utterly fine to feel a small degree of satisfaction when I see the perpetrators of that, fat, miserable, screaming kids in tow, is entirely fine.

I can do the town in Sussex thing right now...! But aside from that, I have a sense of satisfaction when I see my bullies in shitty dead end jobs or on the dole. That does not mean I have that view of *everyone* that is in a dead end job, or on the dole, or didn't go to university to better themselves. I could have the opinion that people with no qualifications or school drop outs are all lazy and should go educate themselves and stop being a drain on society. After all they are not contributing to society like I am. But I don't see it that way and never will do, life is not a one size fits all, people are human and have failings, that doesn't make them lesser people deserving of contempt from others.

&gt;The BNP will repeal the Race Relations Act and all other far leftist social
engineering projects, such as the Equalities and Human Rights Commission aimed at enforcing multiculturalism.

&gt;The BNP rejects the “climate change” theory which holds that all western nations need to be stripped of their manufacturing base and pay untold billions to the ThirdWorld to build up their industries.

&gt;The BNP will repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, both of which are exploited to abuse Britain’s hospitality by the world’s scroungers.

&gt;The BNP will reintroduce capital punishment for drug dealers, child murderers, multiple murderers, murderers of policemen on duty and terrorists where guilt is proven beyond all doubt.

&gt;The BNP will establish a penal station for hardened and repeat criminals on the British island of South Georgia.

No, I don't. For reasons I'm not prepared to discuss publicly, I don't see anyones genitals as being of any importance. What do my tits, my pussy or yours, or our lack of penii have to do with the price of fish? (to use my Mums favourite saying (and no pun intended)).


Drug abuse and alcoholism are choices, yes. For whatever it's worth as well, I don't say that lightly.

I have an entire side of my family who are for the most part, substance abusers. I went through the same stuff as them as a kid, and I decided, from a really early age, that I *could not* allow myself to wind up like that.  While I know everyone is different and reacts differently to things, the refrain I hear the most form my Dads family is ""I know (insert drug name here) is addictive/dangerous/illegal but I don't care"".


Maybe that's not representative of everyone, and I hope it's not, but everyone *I* know who is a drug user or an alcoholic, chooses to put themselves in that position. My cousins have been in and out of rehab scores of times (again, no pun intended there either) but every yimes, they decide they can't be bothered and quit.


People don't *choose* to have MH illnesses, but they choose whether or not to seek help or to take advice or help given to them. And I *know* about EDs. I'm a recovering anorexic, and my Husband has had issues with food in the past. We didn't *choose* them (nobody would, right?) But we chose to seek help, go to support groups, and to try to recover, even when it felt like the biggest, most insurmountable thing in the world)

""I can do the town in Sussex thing right now...!""

I now live in Edinburgh, and don't visit home often. I try not to, to be honest. I lived in East Sussex for a bit, but spent most of my tie in, and grew up in Lancing - that famed hotbed of cultural diversity that it is :/

But aside from that, I have a sense of satisfaction when I see my bullies in shitty dead end jobs or on the dole.


Me too. I'm a full time student. Before that, I had a moderately successful career in a Bank, but was laid off a couple of years back. I went back to education full time last year, and am now taking a year off before going to Uni in Glasgow next year. I work part time and volunteer as well, so the next year is hardly going to be a year ""off"" (and even if it was, I can't think of anything more boring).

I do't think *everyone * in a dead-end job is worthless either - heaven knows, there's a dozen or more reasons for taking a job like that, of nowt else, it's a means to an end. Likewise,Uni is't for everyone.I've a cousin who can barely read, but makes really good money as a joiner. It doesn't matter that he can't count, he pays an accountant to do his books, so his lack of GCSE Maths is no big deal.

Qualifications are a crap shoot as well. What matters is that people do *something* with their lives. It doesn't matter what, but if people take from society and don't give back, when they could, then that IMO is wrong. 

And when people are overweight to the point of absurdity in the article OP submitted, and take the easy way out, then have the audacity to condemn the NHS for ""letting him"" get that fat in the first place? Sorry, but my supplies of fucks to give are exhausted by that point. That guy has been in the press before, ripping into the authorities for ""letting him"" get like that, when he could have prevented it if he sought help. but even if he did, help would no have worked unless he wanted it to.There are people in society far more deserving of help than him.

Firstly my skills in CSS/Photoshop or web design or non-existant. The extent it goes to are face replace in GIMP. 

However I do I could offer the sub quite time as an entrepreneur/student I'm on my computer all day and visit the sub multiple times a day. I've been part of this community since i joined Reddit, roughly 20 months ago. I may not be a frequent poster but I try my best to add quality content. 

As for my chelsea supporting history, I've followed the club for as long as I can remember. More vivid memories start around the millennium and the 98 super cup coming to mind. With the Gus having scored the all important goal. 

As for myself, without divulging to much about me. I'm Dutch, although have lived in England for 3 odd years in my younger years. I'm 19 and currently attend university for Hospitality at EHL. I am working with a friend of mine on launching a start-up based around Flowers here in Switzerland. I try my best to make it to 2-3 games a season (money permitting) and was at the spurs game this Wednesday (Fuck off you spurs). 

As for ideas on the sub:

- Manage the rumors more vigorously and make sure to keep it all in the allocated thread. As well as make sure new members know where to post rumors.
- Try to organize more interactive content for the sub.. For example podcast (30min) discussing the weekly happenings for the club and around the prem.
- Attempt to remove opinion based downvoting and rather make it on the quality of the content. Hence disagree does not equal a downvote.
- Weekly or 2x weekly threads where the community gets to vote on the banner picture.
- Make our twitter a better account in that it will not only post newest posts but also important ticketing/fixture/transfer updates and generally a more interactive account.
- Try and organize with the /r/soccer mods, that they have a sidebar link for club specific subs, in order to allow new redditors to find our sub and contribute.

I suspect that a lot of that is due to the desire for an ""equal society"", which often requires that everyone conform to a common standard -- and which makes minorities and immigrants a problem because their culture is not standardised with the centralised ideal.

He might be a bad investment but there's still time for him to turn that around.

And while i'll concede he'll never be an established starter I do feel he can be very useful in certain games. Look at matches where he has performed this season: he scored goals against Tottenham, Swansea, WBA, Southampton and Man City. Now we lost out on 15 points against those sets of teams - we scored 15 goals against them while they scored 16 against us, I realise it's a shaky stat but bear with me here - if he could add a single goal in all those games we'd be 9 points better off right now, that would leave us 2 points off Tottenham in fifth right now.

United allowed Fergie almost complete control over transfers, he would name the player he wanted and they would go ahead and try and purchase them. The only time this came in to question was with the Glazers and their leveraged buy-out that lumbered the club with £80m a year interest repayments. There was a period of a few years where finances were a concern as they wanted to keep operating at a net profit, which they did. Once that situation stabilised it was back to Fergie operating alone. He personally sanctioned every major player sale and they got as much money as they could first, then you have the acquisitions of players like RvP, Tevez, Jones, Rooney etc. A list is presented to the board, they go and make the deals happen. The downside of this is a higher number of poor value transfers like Kleberson, Bebe, Forlan, Djemba-Djemba, many players going right the way back to the beginning of the Premiership era, when one man makes the final decision he can get things wrong more often than a consensus

Compare that to Chelsea, and I don't mean to be rude but you're completely wrong about the situation when it comes to recruitment. Unless you're more in the loop than I am at the club, and I'd love to know if so, you wouldn't have the slightest inclination who is buying and selling players. I speak to the likes of Gourlay, Buck, Emenalo fairly often and I cannot tell you if it's one of those three, the manager or even Roman who decides which players to sign or which ideas to veto. The constant ambiguity over the decision making processes at the club are one of the most derided aspects of the company and high on the list of things the Stamford Bridge faithful dislike, nobody knows who is accountable or who should be praised. Why do you think Jose left in the first place?

With the games that I do go to I can give an incite to what's happening in and around the Bridge. The last game I went to was our win against Sunderland.

In terms of what I can bring, I have basic photoshop skills and  I can also do CSS (I'm studying IT at the minute and our current unit is looking at it in some detail so it's no problem to me).

I think this sub, in terms of design, and overall community is one of the best compared to all the other teams. This is due to the fantastic work you mods have been doing and I was hoping for an opportunity like this to come up

 
Like I said, I love this sub and Chelsea's a massive part of my life so I'd be pretty dedicated in contributing around here. I'm on reddit pretty much every day and this is the first place I come to. I already provide a lot of content and I'd like to help out with Discussion threads and new features that could possibly make this an even better subreddit.

Now I've done this in my life but, like most immigrants, I've come back to my home country.  

What you see as support for mass immigration I see as a conversation about why this was done, I guess we look at the world from different perspectives. 

The line ""but it is ok as they look like us"" got me, I have almost never encountered hostility from being an emigrant, is that due to the fact I’m a white European? I have to ask would I have had as much acceptance if I been a black African?  

I have brought back skills from my travels and I am now looking about how to improve services within the UK, which is the value of the freedom to travel and work overseas.

The Labour government withdrew significant tax credits for the film industry, which did see a dip in big productions. The current government reversed that and started tax credits for television production in addition, which is partly why we see Game of Thrones based in Belfast, taking $9 million from the government, yet directly contributing $65 million in increased tourism to the region.

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"(Tl;dr) Doesn't it all really depend on who comes in? Manger and player wise, then again as our transfers appear to be run by tombola(/Emenalo/Piet de Visser=Abramovich).
If Mourinho gets what he wants then Emenalo will be out of a job and someone new/nobody will be in. Good riddance, we are literally in the worst squad situation of any top 6 team with regards to ECC and no one in the entire Club has any idea how to fix that. We're screwed, seriously.

Ideally I'd like a better ball winning defensive midfielder to come in. And if Mou comes back then I think we'd keep
Essien (experience)
Romeu/Chalobah (one of them, personally I like Romeu as a better ball player and all-round anchor man whereas, Chalobah is like some sort of weaker Essien to my knowledge 'that' goal for watford as an example). Perhaps on loan for another season for Chalobah and tell him to hit the weights would do wonders.
Plus a guaranteed first teamer. Preferably a Vidal or a De Rossi. You see the kind of player I mean. A strongman, mentally and physically.
This depth do DM would allow us to play a 4-3-2-1 and a 4-2-3-1, 4-4-1-1 and even a 4-2-2-2 rather effectively.

Another striker, anyone of these high profile guys. Ideally you'd want 3 first team level strikers and one star. Lukaku, Ba, Falcao anybody?
You can't deny Torres has been wasteful this season but I think we'd have to loan him out, he's not leaving that kind of wages. (And I'd like him to come back after one season at Athletico and be amazing again and his shirt to read Zorro)

As for clearing out the deadwood: Benayoun and Malouda are gone.
Ferreira might stay. Not sure as what, Mou will probably decide.
We might have to loan out Marin as no one wants him.
If Schürrle comes in then Moses might get worried but 2 players who can actually act like wingers may help.

Kakuta is home grown technically so he might not go as we are woefully short in that space for the ECC as a result of our rather pathetic loaning instead of rotating of players. You would much rather have seen De Bruyne on your bench to come on for Oscar than Benayoun + Marin in the stands.

And finally. Hilario and Turnbull might be on their way.
For the same reason Kakuta might stay. We have Jamal Blackman who is doing well enough to be our back up until Courtois can be No.1 and he's home grown and English.

Just to elaborate on ECC rules. 4 Home-grown players (trained at Chelsea between 15-21) in the Champions League 25 man squad. We have, Terry, Ake, Bertrand.
In the EPL we must have at least 8 English home grown players in the 25.
I think that is trained in England between 18-21. We have, Terry, Cahill, Lampard, Moses, Turnbull, Ake.

Now maybe someone may be able to correct me on players who fit into those categories. But we literally have no young home grown chelsea players who will be regular first team starters in the future.

This is why buying De Bruyne and Courtois and Lukaku at 18 was great. Loaning them was not. This is where other top 4 clubs excel and frankly have to because they need them for the ECC. Phil Jones, bought at 18, spent 3 seasons as of this one at Man U. Alex the Ox, will be under this plan at Arsenal. (The buy in at 18 at the oldest and keep at the club for 3 seasons) Wilshere and co. have been there much longer.

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Do you think Jimmy Carr should have carried on using his tax avoidance scheme since it's actually legal?

Pretty silly, mob justice is never a good idea. Rule of law and so on - if it's wrong then make it illegal. You could draw a line to something like a public figure committing adultery or being racist, but I think tax avoidance is less inherently wrong.

Tax is a completely human construction, and how is anybody supposed to know how much unnecessary tax they should pay - are public figures allowed to take really obvious steps to reduce their tax burden?

true,battlesmurf,,do it for redders 24/7,"I'm gonna wait til the season begins and we've hopefully brought some new additions into the squad to really make my guess. But, as it stands I think we definitely have a chance. Especially we bring in some good players and there are no more issues with never ending takeovers going on. Even this season we've had solid shots at making the playoffs, and that was with Colin and hoofball. If we play a better style of football under McDermott (which I have no doubt we will) we should be right. Also, a fair few of our losses/draws were due to niggly little errors that shouldn't be too hard to fix over the summer (like conceding in the last 20 minutes). I think there was an article earlier that if the games had been 70 minutes long we'd have been in playoff positions under Colin. And hopefully a few players find some form and fitness over the break.

&gt;I think this probably is a good thing, but trying to compete on price with tax cuts does raise a number of issues.

Nothing you raised could ever be interpreted as an ""issue"".  Perhaps you think you raised issues, but you didn't.  All the issues were ""maybe it's not as good as some think, but it's still good"".  If it's good, it's good, certainly better than otherwise.

true,listyraesder,null,null,"&gt; **How many high-end jobs will be created, and how many will simply have the requisite talent imported?**

One of the major selling points of the UK for US studios is that we already have some of the absolute best crews and heads of department (those high-end jobs). In fact, we have many living here (Roger Deakins, for example) and paying taxes while working in Hollywood.

When Kubrick made 2001 back in 1968 he assembled a core special effects crew who went on to contribute heavily to science fiction for the next thirty years. Bond is another hub of high-end talent that has also worked on both Batman trilogies, Alien etc.

&gt; **are Disney going to continually invest in the UK after the 1-2 years of filming**

This is the first film of a trilogy, with an additional 2 films focusing on a popular character backstory. **To start with**. Disney didn't buy the rights to just make 3 films, and as the release schedule is very close together, there's a good chance that all 5 could be made here. Disney already has an established association with the UK - John Carter being another of their films recently shot here.

Go back 13 years, and look at Warner Bros. They spent a decade making Potter (spending billions in the process), then bought the studio complex, redeveloped it for £100 million and now Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden is bigger, newer and better than their studio complex in Hollywood. Potter also lead to WB allowing Chris Nolan to shoot Batman at Cardington. 

&gt; **how do we know we're in a better position than if there had been no cuts?**

When Gordon Brown was PM he cut film incentives. Foreign productions shooting in the UK fell considerably. Conversely, when this government introduced TV production incentives, we gained productions like Game of Thrones, which recieved $9 million in incentives from the NI government and brings in $60 million per year in directly increased tourism.

&gt; **It's unlikely that most of the skilled talent would simply have been unemployed otherwise**

Unemployment is our base state. We don't work unless films come over here to shoot. It's that simple.

&gt; **What sort of precedent will be set - will other studios expect similar cuts?**

They have already been getting them. It's a long-established and widely accepted practice. The rules for incentives are that either the film is set in the UK or is made by a British company or predominantly uses British crew and facilities.

&gt; **Where will that leave us in the long run?**

Our film industry contributes more to the national balance of trade than it costs in subsidies and incentives. For every Hollywood starlet there are hotel rooms, car service, travel. Insurance, equipment hire, contractors, building materials, catering (Hugo shot in the UK and spent £1 million on coca-cola), security and other support services are provided by small British businesses specialised in Film, all have employees, all pay tax at the normal rate, as do the Crew themselves.",0,1368277977,null,0,false,0,c9wq4wi,t3_1e48g0,t1_c9wq4wi,t1_c9wp6jm,null,1431228565,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

I feel as though he's only in it for the paycheck and doesn't want to invest all of his strategies in a team where he won't see the benefit.

Also, he has made marked improvements in the way some of the players play. Ramires is a better attacker than he was when Benitez took over, he has started to work on dribbling skills and opens up his body on the turn to make use of his running as quickly as possible.

An obvious one is David Luiz and his usefulness in Midfield. Allowing him to attack more, leading to some remarkable goals.

Lastly, Mikel, as a result of finding a DM with better distribution, vision, defensive abilities and drive has been given his best role - bench warmer.

Not to mention in a lot of situations best thing you can do is not be violent at all but just yell, often things like muggings or assaults are  purely opportunity crimes. If you increase the chances of the attacker getting caught they often just leg it and look for another target who won't be so much trouble, it's the same justification for having a burglar alarm. It doesn't trap the burglar or stop them getting in but the threat of an alarm going off acts as a deterrent in itself.

As for justifying telling others what ways they can and cannot use it's the same basis as telling people that you can't take the law into your own hands and kill somebody who attacked you because you'd face murder charges, or you can't just shoot intruders or pull out a weapon in a pub fight. The justification is that people have a right to defend themselves within reasonable means but there are limits on account of ensuring a broader public safety.

All of which is getting away from the point that I've given enough instances by now to prove my objection to the good guy vs bad guy argument on account of it being overly simplistic and stupid. I have in fact said on numerous occasions that there are times when having a gun helps protect a person, but I object to overly simplifying the argument on account of the many times when it instead makes things worse or is an unnecessary escalation of the situation.",0,1368280290,null,0,false,0,c9wqkb8,t3_1e2ovg,t1_c9wqkb8,t1_c9wpz4m,null,1431228357,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

* Don't underestimate JT's performance today - lucky to get a yellow for that foul on Benteke, but there was a big chance he would have scored otherwise, and then I think the game would have gotten away from us...
* JT never acts injured unless he really is, But he made the most of the Benteke high foot to get him sent off, another huge turning point which was desperately needed, again, very clever play from Terry.
* Looked like an MCL tear for JT as well, i'm not sure we'll be seeing him back, at his age, he has a mountain to climb if the injury is as bad as it looked.
* Ramires was poor, too slow to handle the Villa attacks, saw his red card coming a mile away..
* Cahill was very flat footed in the first half, again, too slow for the pace of the Villa attack, although he improved a lot in the second half.
* Hazard is a huge blow for Wednesday, I don't see him overcoming a hamstring injury that quickly.
* Luiz bought a bit of stability to the defence which was much needed until Benteke was sent off.
* Ivanovic made me laugh with the water bottle, but it looked like it was frozen and could have knocked someone out if it made contact.
* Ba was like a 3 legged giraffe a lot of the game, not on the same wavelength again.

I.e. just because you trust your meat supplier to a certain degree, and your supplier in turn trusts their supplier etc, does not mean that you should blindly trust the meat product once it's gone through the hands of several suppliers.  Similarly with the loan market, risk was underestimated because individual links in the chain trusted the next to the point where the true nature of the risk was obscured.

So yes, regulation is part of it, and prosecution of those who wilfully misrepresented their product is another.

Dear Mr. Boas,

I will restrain myself from asking “Andre, what’s the score ?” and will not point towards the league table. I will also choose to ignore all remarks made by you troughout Chelsea’s season.

I just want to ask something: Did you see today’s game? Do you know that legend’s name? Do you remember trying to bench him like he’s your Dempsey or Sigurdsson or any other Spud?

Do you remember that game against Wolves when you benched him and he came on with 2 minutes to go and saved your ass, but didn’t celebrate because you made his life miserable?!

Do you realise why he had the full right to DEMAND your sacking?!

Remember the name, Andre, and learn to respect!

For he is FRANK LAMPARD, and he’s immortal in our hearts!

Sincerely,
A person that bleeds blue

WTF?  Jeez, they threw themselves a massive champagne socialist party when Labour got in in 1997.  I seriously doubt there were any parties after the last election.

The BBC and the Guardian have near identical editorial policy.  Listen to the Today program.  The questions are never ""should government even be responsible for X"" they are always ""why isn't government doing more about X"".

There is a myth that the BBC are impartial; they are not, they are massive, massive statists.  There is no problem that the BBC editorial team doesn't think can be solved by more government.  Strangely, despite their apparent left bias, they are (small c) conservatives -- they are establishment and for the status quo.  They sometimes get accused of being right wing, or left wing -- no, they are neither, they will always move themselves to the politics of the current government, they are statists, and both left and right political parties are the same so it's not a big movement for them to make.
