Obama can be fun, joking, and very laid back, but when required he's an incredibly serious man with a great deal of gravitas.

Bush (jr) was fun, joking, and very laid back, and that won him millions of votes, but he was repeatedly caught out when it was crunch time (although there were times when he was an excellent leader, see post-911)

Farage may have the whole ""every-man"" thing going on, but if you watch him in the european parliament, and when he actually starts making coherent arguments, he's got a level of seriousness and depth that turn him back into a politician.

If you ask me, that's where he's winning plenty of votes. He's got a good balance between ""bloke you'd love to have a pint with"" and someone who actually wants to tackle issues head on.

No doubt Reddit won't agree with this assessment, but whether you like it or not, Farage isn't just some bumbling buffoon who people voted for (or more generally, his party) because they were bored. The guy's got some important things to say and whether you agree with him or not, he's doing it very effectively.

I never said it was bigotry on par with gay bashing. What I said is that if you want to understand pride parades you also need to understand that complaints about being outrageous (as opposed to non-LGBT specific complaints about parades) are going to look like an attempt to ensure conformity, and in fact whether well intentioned or not, that's exactly the purpose they serve.

Also, your claim that it's been building on itself for years now is so obviously bullshit if you know anything about the LGBT Movement (which you blatantly, blantantly don't). The original LGBT movements of the 1970s were characterised by radicalism, including radical feminism motivating lesbian separatism. Through the 1990s, one of the most prominent gay pressure groups in the UK was Outrage, which controversially outed public figures they knew were gay but who had voiced or supported anti-gay politics. Outrage, you will note, is more or less defunct now.

The situation now is one in which the Conservatives - the *Conservatives* - are trying to pass same-sex marriage. Gay activism has become a lot more political similar to other political groups. But the problem is there are still battles to win, lessons to learn. Stonewall is very keen to throw transgender and non-gender binary people under the bus in order to ensure they appear as ""respectable."" That's not okay. You claim that what you want is for LGBT people to be used to being ""equally ridiculed."" Your ridicule is not wanted, not needed, nor is it equal. You do not mock people who behave and fill the roles you believe they should be in. So when you say 'equal ridicule', what you mean is 'we should accept that you're going to be judged, and have jokes made about who you are, in an attempt to belittle or demean you.' No. That's not okay.

To approach this clinically, if such a thing were possible, you need to learn [the International Phonetic Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet). And probably take an Intro to Sociolinguistics course. What it boils down to is that English dialects have WAY more sounds than North American dialects. Like there are more than 10 extra symbols for the sounds native speakers make here. But knowing the IPA and how it works will give you a primer on how to use your mouth to actually make those sounds. Each sound can be broken down to where the tongue is, whether the teeth are involved, whether air is expelled (say 'poof' while your fingers are in front of your mouth - notice the shot of air coming out when you pronounce the p?), glottal stop, etc. 

The watching of BBC shows is good too, because you can approach the words clinically and even rewind if you want to hear them again. Figure out what their mouths are doing and practice.

However, I must admit that as I moved here in my mid-20s, my American accent was pretty well drilled in. I do now say things with a more English accent, like saying cahn't instead of can't, and pahth/path. My 'r' has softened and so on, but even though Americans find my accent to be very different, here in England everyone knows I'm from North America. 

A voice coach would be another, more expensive route. But honestly it's very difficult to maintain when you're surrounded by people speaking in your native dialect and accent. It's far easier for your brain to get your mouth to pronounce words in the way it learned them. That's why actors who do amazing accents in films don't keep the accent when they do interviews for the film. It's really hard work.

That said, you could probably do it if you were really determined. Grace Kelly had a voice coach in her early film career who taught her to speak with a 'soft British accent' which stayed with her for life.

Wiggins now has a choice. He is the defender, so things have changed. Imagine you're him, do you go for it full on and try and defend your title or do you effectively let your friend and teammate get his deserved win in return?

I'm just saying, if you're going to say that The Doctor swooping someone off their feet without their permission is sexual assault, then you have to tie up that every time he's done that to anybody is sexual assault. And Ritch's argument in particular is that men are not the possessions of other men, therefore (somehow) reducing the thought of sexual assault. But, if someone most definitely doesn't belong to you and you start sexing them up, then it's sexual assault, no doubt.

Let's bring this back to Doctor Who, though. If only women are sexualised then why have multiple Doctors been shown with their shirts off in this supposedly 'family' show? I certainly don't remember that happening to Colin Baker. The last time I checked, Doctor Who was not a CW show. It's not Smallville or Arrow or Beauty and the Beast. It's not made for teenage girls to gawk at the pretty boy male leads so why did that happen? With Matt Smith it only happened so Amy could admire him.

This whole thread exists because some myopic fool on YouTube refused to take a step back and see which gender was really being mistreated by this show. Under Moffat, this show has filled pretty much every anti-male trope TV Tropes has to offer.

On their front page 3 out of the 4 latest news stories are football and there are more football news links than all other sports combined (6 to 5). They advertise 2 sporting fixtures, both are football. They give results for sports matches on the bottom right - football is the only one showing, all the others are minimised. 3 of 4 columnists are talking about football. 2 of 3 featured articles are football. All 4 tv shows suggested are football. If the lions tour (which is going to be fucking great) wasn't happening soon there would be football to replace the limited rugby union talk. All this was true at the time of checking but things will no doubt change through the day. The BBC is good compared to the rest, it even televises other sports!! 

Frankly I sometimes wish people would stop watching so much football I find the game mind numbingly boring unless the very top teams are playing but all least all the commercialism and shitty products of popularity is tied up in football and doesn't spread to the rest of sport. I don't know why popularity normally leads to a dip in quality; you see it on reddit like in sports fans. We all owe football a favour. The longer it stays popular the more our fans will stay a dedicated respectful core and not a yelling mob.

Portraying women this way promotes an attitude that sees women as property or sexual objects. If women are seen this way then misogyny and rapes are more likely to occur. 

Sexualisimg men also displays them as objects to be consumed. I'm not going to ponder how much sexualization of people is okay, but men have not reached the point to where they are not seen as people.

true,crapusername47,null,null,"There's an entire network whose primary business model is the sexualisation of men. They're called The CW, and their shows are full of disposable, replaceable pretty boys. Every episode of every show features another excuse to show one or more of them less than properly dressed.

The institution you're talking about that marginalises men is called television. It's because men, unless it's half time during a Champions League game, don't watch adverts anymore. Women do, to a larger degree anyway.

So, now every show pretty much is about women, even the ones under the guise of being about men. Whether it be a 1960's advertising agency or a fictional fantasy land of warring Kings or a show about a time travelling alien and his blue box, it doesn't matter. It's all about their struggles, never shall us silly male viewers have a genuine good guy male character who isn't some adulterous, drug dealing, power hungry, murdering evil person.

The BBC isn't even reliant on ratings and advertising, but this is the same corporation that has London news broadcasts where all of the presenters and reporters are white women. It's the nature of the BBC to go too far in the name of being 'progressive'. 

As I said, Doctor Who fulfills every negative male trope you can think of. Male disposability? Rory in pretty much every episode, it's even treated as a joke. Straw misogynists? See Riddell in 'Dinosaurs on a Spaceship'. Double Standard Abuse? That's Amy's middle name. Women are Wiser? Pretty much every companion so far, especially River and Clara.

But after all of that, if some idiot on YouTube wants to complain about the Doctor kissing Jenny or Strax shooting at a woman then go right ahead.

He was far more referential to the shows history, like when he brought back Davros without really giving him much context for new fans (like me). He also had to clean up his own mess with the Time War far too often. How many times can the Daleks come back? He destroyed them all and brought them back about four times. 

And lest we think too highly of RTD's treatment of women, it was rare for a lady in his run to not make googly eyes at the Doctor all the time. He found a balancing act with Rose, but Martha's key weakness was a romantic relationship that we all knew could never happen. That's why Donna worked so well. Moffat flirted with it a little, but within a few episodes he totally removed the dreaded love triangle and just left Rory and Amy in love.

(Potential spoilers)

When baby River was kidnapped, the Doctor had this whole 'I will get her back' moment, which was just completely abandoned with the reveal that she was, in fact River.

The baby's never mentioned again. It's understandable that this would happen as River's history was probably 'already written' it just seemed quite 'Un-Doctor-y' to abandon the baby of his best friends.

Then there's this whole 'big reveal' that River is Amy and Rory's best friend from childhood, Mel - a character who is introduced ten minutes before this reveal, and clumsily pasted into the Ponds' backstory. It seems to me that another writer &lt;cough - Russel T Davies - cough&gt; would have had Mel introduced alongside Amy and Rory, and mentioned throughout the series?

I also dislike how he's made it more of a 'time-travel' show with time-travelling occuring mid story to get the characters out of sticky situations (the pandorica springs to mind) rather than the bookends of stories that I was used to from the Eccleston-Tennant era. This is just a personal problem of mine, and I'm sure there are things I've overlooked, and I've no idea what the classic series was like.

Regardless, I haven't enjoyed the show nearly as much during the last two seasons as I used to.

It is a reaction to the inevitable fact that Europe is more and more homogenous in terms of income, living standards and culture, and this is due to the people of Europe moving around the continent like they never left the country, and also due to the current balancing between East and West. Politics will take place over a large scale in the future, and the EU is an affront to the nation-state idea that forms part of the British identity. 

Meanwhile, the Conservatives, if you haven't noticed, are undergoing ""detoxification"". In an increasingly urbanised country, moving to the left on some issues wins votes for them. Imagine if Labour proposed renationalisation of transport and utilities; they would win by a landslide. The Conservative cabinet (esp. Cameron and Gove) are trying to be their heir to the Blairites in becoming a ""metropolitan"" party by becoming centrist economically and socially liberal (In my opinion, making the NHS a national health insurance system is centrist; getting rid of it altogether is right-wing, not that I agree with either). To a large extent, it's working; London was fiercely Labour until the election of Boris Johnson as Mayor. 

Hence, the A-List of candidates is very *petit bourgeoisie*; middle-class, fiscally conservative, socially liberal, targeted at women and ethnic minorities, Russell Group-educated, and very metropolitan or suburban. 

The result of this is the Tory heartlands feeling excluded from the political spectrum. It's why Lincolnshire, one of the most rural counties, was a hit for UKIP. Also, the more poorer areas of the Home Counties voted UKIP. It's a continuation of Thatcherite radicalism, supposedly standing up for the ""little man"" against the middle-class Establishment in both the Labour and Conservative parties. However, you can never get rid of an Establishment; it's rather a case of Sartre's *Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.*

To call him the 'showrunner' is very inaccurate; the 'showrunner' model of TV production doesn't really exist outside of America. The way that British and BBC television is made is a lot different from, say, Community or Breaking Bad.

I don't know for sure what goes on behind the scenes, but Moffat's role likely is rooted in pre-production. He hires writers to produce scripts based on ideas generated by the producers *or* premises originally created by the authors themselves. He works with the writers, redrafting scripts to fit with his general plans for the season. And, of course, he writes an episode or two himself. 

The difference between Doctor Who and Community is that Community has what's called a writer's room. Long before the season begins shooting, the head writer hires a group of talented writers, and they all work together to plot out the trajectory of the season, workshop scripts, collaborate, and assign episodes. The end result tends to be a fairly consistent and controlled product (note how most American shows trend by season; Community season 2 was awesome but season 4 is not great). Moffat is still the head writer with the highest editorial priority (besides BBC executives), but there isn't really a big group of young, brilliant creatives generating the series.

So, the point is, it's disingenuous to act like RTD or Moffat is the singular dictator of the entire show. They're much more like an American president in its legislative process; now and then able to take action, but mostly limited to passively guiding other actors.

true,TheRedCrumpet,english,England,"It makes me wonder why we have a ""political class"", I mean surely having a class of people to run the country for everyone else is counter productive, they won't be in touch with the other classes and understand what is needed of them..

I don't think UKIP is the response to that, I think the 99% protest stuff was a response to it. The problem is there is so much fucked up stuff that no one picked a clearly defined target to aim for, so everything ever was put on the agenda and the people in power completely ignored it, even going as far as to set their lap dog police on them for absolutely no reason in many cases.

As someone who enjoys dystopian fiction, I've basically come to the conclusion that we're all fucked. The rich control the world, punk is dead and any chance of a revolution is incredibly slim. Crime rates are down, the UK is furtherest from a real terrorist problem than it has been in 30 years and yet we're all living in a world of fear and being scared of it. Its just incredibly fucked up and I don't see a way out of it. Lets bring back the concept of Noblesse oblige and see what happens, I expect fuck all because these people will never have any honour. I remember a kid on some TV show screaming how her mother ruined her life by giving her her brand new car at the wrong time on her birthday. That little cunt is what is running the world now, and its easy to see why shit is fucked when you remember that.

The reason they do what they do to us is simply down to Voter Apathy and using the media to keep us at each others throats while they sneak in the stuff they do not want us to know about, as I said, the only way to do this is for the entire population to vote other than for the big parties, 

and you say it won't work? when the imcumbent party  receives less votes than the independents and then force themselves to stay in power is the day we have a proper uprising in this country.

true,ubermonkey,null,null,"You are likely to be disappointed with the old Who. It's almost heresy to say so, but it's true.

The writing, acting, and production values for the old stuff is all really, really far behind the post-revival work. Part of this is just how TV has worked -- virtually anything shot in the 60s, 70s, and 80s looks bad and dated compared to simliar modern efforts. The plots are simpler. The characters are less complex. The sexual politics clang like an episode of Mad Men. It's not unlike loving the modern BSG, and then watching an episode of the original version from the late 1970s, which was awful at the time. Classic Who wasn't as bad (or as derivative) as the original BSG, but it's not great work either. 

That said, it's worth your while to peek in at a few seminal moments. Someone else said to watch the first episode, and I can't argue with that. I grew up on Four, like most Americans, and it's Tom Baker I still think of as the classic version of the Classic character. You may feel like watching more after running through the Baker years, but let me warn you: quality dropped off precipitously after Tom Baker left the role. One gets the sense that he carried an old show longer than it probably would've survived without him. His 7 years in the role remain the longest of any actor; the classic doctors after him (Davison, C. Baker, and McCoy) combined have fewer years than ol' Tom.

(Of the Colin Baker years, the less said, the better.)

For example, I don't live in a tower block, but I only know one person in my entire street.  That's just the reality of modern life.

It seems to me that the main problem with tower blocks has been the collective decision by councils, the police and the courts to turn a blind eye to antisocial behaviour and low-level criminality.  Similar problems are found on any housing estate that has a large number of council or housing association houses - tower blocks just concentrate the problem in a smaller area.

To me, it's simple.  If the council or housing association puts you in a property - tower block or not - and you start to subject your neighbours to antisocial behaviour, then you should simply be removed.

Okay, I see where the confusion is coming here... **The change will equally affect spouses in the UK.** The BBC article just comes at it from an overseas perspective (probably because the conservatives want to be seen to be tough on immigration/foreigner in the wake of their UKIP loses)

So basically we are now saying, from 2016 a husbands earnings no longer entitle a wife to claim the same. Instead she will be able to claim the flat-rate state pension based on whatever HER contributions to NI were. Obviously her husband will be able to claim whatever he paid in so if they are cohabiting then they will continue to benefit from their joint pension income. 

This makes 100% sense in the modern world since both men and women are expected to work and contribute to NI, and given the more complex family dynamics that exist (i.e. divorce) it just doesn't make much sense to continue the old *married persons pension allowance* system. If anything this is anti-discriminatory as it makes people responsible for their own pension - not the financial sucess of their partner. I realise for some older members that might be a bitter pill to swallow... but with 25% of young people out of work, and 7 million households predominantly under &lt;30 years of age forced to rent in substandard accomodation... I would argue that paying for Mrs Smith to retire to Cyprus, or for Mrs Patel to claim £3500 a year even though she never even lived in the UK is hardly a priority.

Remember, this doesn't apply retrospectively, if you already claim pension then you will continue under the current system of married persons pension allowance.  ",0,1367855509,null,0,false,0,c9tgudx,t3_1ds6ao,t1_c9tgudx,t1_c9tgcrl,null,1431285087,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"Agreed with your assessment with Gillyflower. Women aren't some special little subculture that we have to handle with kit gloves: They're bloody *people* that can be both good and bad. I'm actually a bit pleased how Doctor Who has recently had a nice balance of female protagonists and antagonists.

&gt; But I definitely agree that forcing a woman into a kiss is not okay. It is technically sexual assault.

Nothing technical about it, I don't think anyone could argue a forced kiss like that wouldn't be sexual assault in our society. But on a bit of a side note (if it matters): Is it sexual to the Doctor?

I mean, the Doctor didn't seem to be kissing for sexual attraction and he's absolutely beyond the normal societal norms. He could (and likely has been) to worlds where kissing's the form of shaking hands or saying thank you, and he's never been one to respect boundaries much, particularly when he's in the thick of things.

But then you have another question: Did the Doctor do what he did just to feel a range of physical responses again? He would have known he was going to be slapped and his reaction seemed like he actually *wanted* five across the mouth. Perhaps he was simply using Jenny as a quick ""pinch me, I can feel again!"" (which is equally disconcerting to be using a person as a movement litmus test like that, although it's not unlike the Doctor to do so). **EDIT**: Would like to make it clear that while this is interesting to think on, none of it makes the act any less assault or have any less bad implications.

&gt; Maybe people don't understand this feeling, but most women are physically incapable of defending them self against a man (as men are usually stronger than women, especially in the upper body). That means we're always vulnerable in ways most men aren't.

I think this is a fine line to tread.

So many people would take this message as the green light to ""benevolent sexism"" where a patronizing patriarchal tone it seen as the solution to helping the ""fragile lesser sex"".

I think it's vital not to universally apply these things. Yes, some peopl are not as physically strong as others, this does not mean that you should constantly view that culture as frightened and incapable of defending themselves against men. Jenny's physical prowess in this episode is a perfect testament to that.

&gt; And this is rape culture. More specifically, this is entitlement. When a man thinks he is entitled to just grab people when he feels like it and engage in sexual activity.

This is really where I think you may be going a bit far.

I am absolutely certain that regardless of who the person was, regardless of their orientation or gender or even whether it was a friend of his or not. The Eleventh Doctor is just a very kissy Doctor. If it was Rory or Craig or just some hapless passerby I have no doubt Eleven would have celebrated his escape similarly.

Placing that aside, I can't deny the unfortunate way this scene can come across. Once again we have cliche being placed over creating characters that are rich individuals. This trend has been disconcertingly increasing as of late, and unfortunate connotations like these are a byproduct of writers only thinking in a two-dimensional ""churn out the next one"" mentality.

&gt; If you will bear with me and allow this controversial (yet I believe, true) statement, when Amy Pond comes onto the Doctor at the end of The Beast Below, she is also technically sexually assaulting the Doctor.

I think we had a discussion about this sometime last year (god, it feels like ages).

Bottom line: Couldn't agree more. And I'd certainly drop the technical. She was actively shoving him around and disrobing him in a *very* clear pressure for him to have sex with her (add her lewd comments, which are also sexual harassment). 

&gt; Nope, I blame the writers. **edit** no, scratch that. enough with the blaming of writers. I blame rape culture.

No, you were right in blaming the writers.

This ""rape culture"" is pervasive throughout the world, and yet there are scores upon scores of good, decent writers that not only work against it, but actively seek to end it by portraying sex as something between two people who are rich, individual characters.

I'd disagree on the funny bit. I just find it tiring.

The big thing that makes the angle attractive to Moffat is that it's not only something ""funny"", but it's a funny that 's easy to write and requires little to no effort. It's a stereotype, and one that society at large really won't balk at.

It's the same reason he makes River this flirty, winking devoted lover to the Doctor (who is also so super cool with guns and being a badass). She's an easily-written stereotype. An easy way to milk ""funny"" and ""cool"" points in ways that the audience at large won't bite you head off for.

Welsh people doing American things only serves my point. Your post totally proves my point. Welsh culture is clearly influenced more by English than the other way around.

You are of course, right, but you've clearly missed my point, because you aren't actually *arguing*, just angrily agreeing.

I'm not saying that Wales can't export talent. And I'm not saying that Wales doesn't have a distinctive culture of its own. Quite the opposite in fact.

What would this look like? We'd want to destroy the national polity. The country should essentially become unrecognizable. There should be nothing left of the culture which gave rise to such vast national crimes. The ethnic identity of the people responsible should be deracinated and dissolved into new peoples through mixing. Ideally the offending nation would be carved into new states and given to other countries.

And if any country deserves the 'national death penalty' it's Britain, which has invaded nearly every other country on earth. And mass migration to the point where it destroys their culture would be a pretty good way of doing this.

He'd also be good as advisor to the show to help them with their season long story arcs, even if he didn't write a solitary episode.

I loved his (now a bit dated) book *Good Omens* he co-wrote with Neil Gaiman a couple of decades ago. I think that kind of drama, realism, and humor balance would be a good fit for Doctor Who. Although, ironically, it has some of the same flaws as he chides Doctor Who for. Perhaps that's where he learned his lesson.

Also a big fan of his *Facing Extinction* auto-biographic video. I think adding this sort of perspective to the Doctor on his last regeneration would be very insightful.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Per usual, it's a bit of a long column but, per usual, well-worth the read.

Tomkins is **not** saying that Rodgers should be sacked or anything like that but he is simply ""uncertain."" Tomkins does well to compare a number of the top managers to Rodgers and wonders if Rodgers can achieve the same thing.

&gt;Most successful managers at the top end of the ‘modern era’ Premier League have certain traits, certain achievements under their belts.

&gt;Two things that stick out are, **a) previous notable success, and b) doing something remarkable in terms of impact in their first year.** Most can boast one or the other, and some can boast both. There’s also a third factor, which I will come to later.

Tomkins goes on to list the prior successes or ""remarkable"" events in the first year of managers like Ferguson, Wenger, Mancini, Mourinho, etc.

&gt;**The third factor is ‘player cachet’.** This is perhaps the least important, but having played at a massive club, and having represented a major international nation on many occasions, can surely help a young manager acclimatise to the pressures and expectations of clubs where success is expected (with the expected success often out of keeping with reality).

&gt; [...]

&gt;But out of the three categories (which you might find random, but I think have some validity), seven of the nine have ticks in two of the three columns, and Mancini and Ancelotti tick all three.

&gt;Rodgers, alas, has none. He has no notable prior success at the sharp end of a top league as a manager; he has not made a significant impact in his first season (fractionally better in the league, worse in the cups); and he was never a player.

But, again, Tomkins is quick to point out that he doesn't want Rodgers sacked. He understands the instability that a manager change can bring (though, if a so-called ""better"" manager that knows this system, why not?).

Finally, he closes with:

&gt;Part of me feels that if Rodgers goes out and replaces Carragher, Downing and Enrique with three better players for the XI, this team could really click into gear. And another part of me remains unsure about his killer instinct. Is he a winner? I think he has a pleasing edge to him, in that he can seem a bit steely. But I need more proof.

&gt;Whatever happens, next season needs to be better. If you want to write this off as a transitional season, then who am I to argue? But next season needs a proper challenge for the top four, even if the Reds fall narrowly short.

I've sorta summarized the post there but, again, it's certainly worth the read. I think it brings a lot of well-thought-out and honest assessments of Brendan Rodgers and the future.

Again, Tomkins doesn't hate Rodgers. But he doesn't love him either. As his quote in the title of this post states. He's simply uncertain.

Personally, I think Rodgers more than deserves a chance to see out his contract. But if an honest challenge to the top 4 is not made next season, I think a change could/should happen **if** the next manager (who must be clearly better than Rodgers results-wise, etc.) can continue to build upon the good philosophy, tactics and foundations that Rodgers has built.

As Tomkins mentioned, ""And it’s not like Rodgers is the only manager in Europe whose team can pass a football.""

Walker Caulker Vert BAE

Lennon Thudd Holtby

Siggy   Dempsey  Bale

The idea here being Lennon can inject a little more speed into the midfield and might be able to add some Defensive cover to make up for Thudds slowness, as well as provide width for the right flank since Siggy tends to cut inside. Also lessens Walker's usual burden of providing width, so he'll be in better position to keep the counter attacks in check.

Bale obviously has free reign, but I'd rather see him out wide to start, and hopefully provide width out there, before he starts coming inside This way BAE might be able to hang a little further back than when we have SIggy or Dempsey out left. 

I put Dempsey over Ade/Defoe just because the last few games he has had a couple killer passes (maybe once a game), he wins a lot of fouls(maybe most importantly), his heading ability, and he has scored some goals somewhat recently. Defoe should be reserved for super sub, and Ade has had a bright moment or two in each of the last few games but not enough to warrant a start I think. If he does start over Dempsey I would be fine with it, it was a close call. 

Thudd has been in good form but is so slow that its tough to put him in, but I think a combination of Lennon sitting deeper than usual, and Walker having less offensive responsibilities, and having Caulker who is a bit quicker than daws, will help cover our deep lying afro-monster. Parker could come in here, but I think without Dembele our best bet for getting the ball moving forward is to have Thudd pinging balls around. 

Some players are out of position, and having Dempsey being our furthest forward central player might be suspect, but I figure with Siggy and Bale cutting in it'll be roughly the same as having Bale central and Siggy and Dempsey always cutting in, but at least this way Bale will be more inclined to make some plays out wide. Its a little wonky but it makes sense to me. ",0,1367859437,null,0,false,0,c9ti4iv,t3_1drvh6,t1_c9ti4iv,t3_1drvh6,null,1431284483,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Also that title is a bit different to the thrust of the article. The article says that as white people move away from immigrants, those immigrants fail to integrate. What you can take from the article is not 'isn't it awful for white people' (as most of you seem to be heading for) but that white people are creating a self-fulfilling prophesy of the non-integration of immigrants. Someone who is anti-immigration might say that immigrants don't integrate as UKIP often do but if an immigrant tried to integrate by moving to their sleepy Oxfordshire village they'd be outraged. They move away from cities to get away from immigrants then criticise the immigrants for not integrating and lament the fact that city centres are beginning to have white minorities (resident, commuters are mostly white so tip the balance).

true,nothinbuttherain,null,null,"&gt;Let's just calm down and back up for a sec; speaking down to one another or accusing each other of lies or having an agenda isn't gonna get anybody anywhere.

Fair enough, I understand now that you weren't doing what I thought you were doing.  Unfortunately that initial impression colored much of the rest of my prior response.

&gt;I meant that a lot of people claim that the term ""misogyny"" is overused because they believe that it doesn't happen as much as it's claimed, rather than actually bothering to honestly assess whether what is happening is misogyny or not.

But, I am honestly assessing it.  You may of course *disagree* with my assessment, but I'm not objecting to the word in any blanket, absolute sense.  I just think people throw it around far too casually, where it doesn't apply, and I think the impact of this is greater than just an engaging discussion of semantics (such as this conversation is becoming) or a dogpile (as these conversations so often become..)  I will attempt to illustrate this further down the post...

&gt;&gt;I am not the internet
&gt;
&gt;I worded it like that because you did originally in your comment:

Ah, I should have left that out -- only because it was a general venting of frustration on my part, not intended to be central to my point.

&gt;Misogyny doesn't need to be explicit to be called misogyny... It just needs to be treating women as something other, something inferior, something weaker, something not-as-valid-as, or something of a more specified purpose or roll than everybody else.

But this is not the definition of misogyny - I feel you are moving the goalposts. (even if unintentionally.  I *see* where you are coming from, and I'm not trying to be needlessly pedantic by rejecting it, I do have a purpose)  Some of what you have there fits, but I still reject that the comment which sparked this conversation does.

&gt;For example, if a woman gets angry, it is an example of a misogynist sentiment to comment ""She was probably on her period"". (i.e. female emotions are less valid).

I agree with you about this.

&gt;""Tits or GTFO"" (i.e. your body is going to be inherently viewed as sexual regardless of setting)

I agree with you that this is a misogynistic practice, but disagree with your explanation.  I reject the notion that heterosexual people of either gender don't naturally notice the physical sexual qualities of those around them as a matter of course.  Being viewed sexually isn't the problem.  *Asking someone to display their parts for the gratification of others in order to be allowed to participate in a non-sexual discussion is the problem.*

&gt;A comment can be misogyny, even if the author didn't mean it as such, because 9 times out of 10, they obviously didn't mean to be sexist... They just were. Just like people can accidentally or passively be homophobic, heterosexist or racist.

I have some nitpicks here, but will probably just bog down the conversation without advancing the core topic if I go into them.  So agreed here as well (or close enough).

&gt;All I think it does is add some sort of taboo over using the word. If something is misogyny, I think we should call it that... even if the author didn't mean to be sexist, and even if the author isn't themselves misogynist.

This is where we depart the most strongly, I think.  Yes, if something is misogyny, we should call it that.  I don't agree that sexism is inherently misogynistic (most especially subtle sexism, where someone believes themselves to be being flirtatious or complimentary).  

And most importantly (as this is the biggest reason for my ire at seeing this word thrown around so casually), how can the source of a comment possibly make misogynistic comments and not be a misogynist?

If I whistle at a random woman on the street (which, FTR, I would not do) and someone calls me out and says, ""Hey that was really inappropriate and sexist, and catcalls from you are probably the last things she wants while she's out trying to take care of her daily business."" I'm going to feel appropriately shamed and realize that my behavior was just not acceptable in that circumstance.

But if the same thing happens and someone calls me a misogynist, my reaction is to be nothing but perplexed, and possibly a bit angry.  I whistled in appreciation, as a complement, and now you are telling me that you have concluded from that action that I must hate, mistrust, or dislike women?  No.  You don't have enough information to draw that conclusion, and you have severely reduced the possibility that I'm going to question my own behavior or attitudes as a result of the interaction with you - because I *know* that I don't hate, mistrust, or dislike women.  So while I can see that you (hypothetically) must have been pissed off at me to call me a misogynist, I can also clearly see that you had no valid reason to do so.  My introspection over the issue is quite likely to proceed much less deeply than a more appropriate response would have achieved.

When someone makes a comment that is inappropriate/sexist/out of place to a woman, but with no evidence of mistrusting, hating, or disliking women, we have lots of other words for that.  Sexist.  chauvinistic (which seems a bit old fashioned to me now -- rarely seem to hear that word these days), inappropriate, undesired, offensive, etc, etc, etc.  

So it appears, to me, in most cases, that people pull that word out because it somehow carries more weight.  It's the nuclear option with regard to expressing your disapproval towards how a man has behaved towards a woman.  But not only does it seem intentionally heavy handed and grandstand-y when no such behavior has been exhibited, it also (IMO) devalues the word for the cases where it *does* apply.  Because you are always going to have someone like me on the other end (unless I'm a special snowflake on this issue, which I doubt) who immediately writes off your complaint because the word is so thoroughly worn out, after seeing every person offended by a man immediately jump to calling him a misogynist.

I very rarely take the time to comment on this when I see it.  But I very, *very* rarely see the word used in discussion forums or other online discourse in a way that makes me say, ""Why yes, that scoundrel does indeed hate, mistrust, or dislike women.  Well said!"".

&gt;I honestly doubt that the original comment would have been left if it was a guy.

Hmm.  I wouldn't be quite so sure.  Unless you use hash marks you'll probably lose count.  ;-)  http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dqjcp/my_11th_doctor_72_cosplay/

And I doubt the OP of the link above is offended.  I know I wouldn't be.  

(And I would really like to think that as a woman I could handle the Tardis-key comment as well -- I could surely see my wife and other women I'm close with thinking it was funny or at least being flattered.  I can't actually picture any of them saying ""You won't believe what someone on reddit said to me today!!!  How dare he comment on my attractiveness with a Tardis-related reference!"")

To give an example of a bad one is the Dalek asylum.  It is one of the Daleks' greatest secrets.  Of course you wouldn't have heard about it before hand.  After the episode?  The Daleks turned the planet into an impromptu asteroid field.  That's the in-story reason.  Out of story?  Two things.  

First, the Daleks are side and reliable villains for Moffat.  They aren't the grand Myth Arc villains of RTD slowly building up to Stolen Earth.  There is no reason to go back to the asylum or really mention it yet in the story other than a call back to earlier in the season.  Second, it was the obligatory once a season Dalek episode so the BBC doesn't lose the licensing rights and are forced to re-negotiate with their owner who now knows New Who is to stay instead of a season or two flash in the pan.  Moffat could have, and likely may have made more sense to use, the Mondas Cybermen.  Could have even tied it into ""A Good Man Goes to War"" with the Cybermen proclaiming ""We helped you find your companion, Doctor.  You owe us.""

As for how I feel about Moffat.  I am not sure.  I guess my feelings are summed up in this way.  My view of Moffat can be likened to the Angels.

**Series 5/Blink**

An overall strong series.  A pretty good mix of obvious plot episodes and stand alones with some myth arc plot added to them.  There are some oddities, like love beating the Daleks and their robot's bomb timer.  Just like if you sit for a bit you realize Sally just kind of sits there and has things happen around her in Blink, or how silly the Angels looked banging the Tardis around.  For the most part though?  I feel like I'm nit picking looking for hard flaws.

**Series 6/Time of the Angels**

6A was strong except for the Curse of the Black Spot.  It largely feels like a five episode adventure with two filler, although the Doctor's Wife is a great episode.  Hell, the Doctor's Wife would have been even strong if they left the villain as The Great Intelligence as it was originally, and and having the Tardis appear where it does in The Rebel Flesh due to Tardis still recovering from House than a solar storm.

6B... falls flat.  Let's Kill Hitler feels a tad odd as a series ""start"".  I don't know anyone who really liked Night Terrors.  Series 7A feels off in the same.  

I can't help but to think (if Moffat was writing ahead this far) that Series 6 would have been stronger as a single series without ""Curse of the Black Circle"" and ""Night Terrors"" with ""Aslyum of the Daleks"" and ""Angels take Manhattan"" thrown into that season instead.  This single season would need some smoothing to make it work.

I guess Series 6B just feels like a ""dump"" season.  Series 6A is bleeds over with ""Let's Kill Hitler"" being officially AGMGTW's Part 2.  Then there is the whole ""Pond's Farewell Tour"" that begins half-way through 6B that then gets disrupted by 6Aish Wedding of River Song then returns to ""Pond's Farewell Tour with filler!!!!"" for 7A.

These two half-series feel schizophrenic in theme in the same way the Angels in ""Time of the Angels"" can't seem to decide if they want to stick to the Blink model or change for new plot reasons.

Series 6 isn't bad.  There is a lot of good stuff here.  It just feels like Pirate Ninja Cyborg Calvin Ball.

**Series 7/Angels Take Manhattan**
The Angels return to form as a threat.  A tad more in-line with Blink, but still some WTF moments like the Angel of Liberty.

I already dipped into Series 7A.  The stand alones aren't bad, mostly.  I'm looking at you Dinosaurs on a Space Ship.  But, even that had good moments.  A Town Called Mercy was good.  Power of Three was a nice slice of life.  To be honest?  All three just felt like filler episodes to extend the Ponds' time long enough to have Clara ""join"" for the Christmas special.  DoaSS and PoT, in hindsight, almost look like Moffat was simply trying to turn Rory's dad into Wilford 2.0 to add extra emotion for the Ponds' farewell.

7B is looking to be somewhere around 6A, maybe a bit closer to Series 5.  The only really weak episode is Rings of Akhaten that seems like an excuse to have a light hearted episode where the Doctor could spend 15-20 minutes spying on Clara's entire life.  It largely felt like the B-rate knock-off version of The Beast Below.

**Summary**

In broad strokes Moffat has great ideas, but the more and more he is allowed to stretch them out things begin to fall apart.  It looks like he is good at setting the ground floor for his ideas, but doesn't know how to keep all the ideas cohesive once he begins to use them.  This might explain a few things like why each of his series (now half series) seem to begin from a fresh plot, he is avoiding RTD era (that'd be a continuation), and why 7B seems so much stronger since a great chunk of his old plot points around the Ponds has been wrapped up.

As for women.  Before the Crimson Horror I could overlook or put up with things.  CH had me cringing, even as a straight male, when the Doctor kissed Jenny and then she proceeded to strip down to the Victorian equivalent of a skin-tight cat suit so she could take out a gang of super models with sexy poses.  Oh, and the Tardis' wood setting.  At least Amy being a kiss-a-gram (effectively a g-rated stripper/prostitute) served as a useful plot device (police uniform and helped explained Rory's habit of dressing as a Roman... I guess), but this is just getting too blatant.  


**I guess my TL;DR/Summarized Summary** is this.  I see Moffat as the George Lucas of Doctor Who.  Has some good/great ideas, but you cannot trust him to have unchallenged control of the series or you end up Phantom Menaces.  Enough criticism and he can produce Revenge of the Sith/Attack of the Clones, but if you want the great stuff (Blink/New Hope) he needs people to challenge him on things, to help with the major writing.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""2 consecutive years of CL and he hasn't won anything by then, at that point we can afford to look to bigger more proven managers"".

Were 7th in the league, we are quite far off 2 consecutive years of CL football. Even with me being optimistic I don't see us being able to get Top Four next season, which will probably be the end of Rodgers. 

Mourinho is coming back to Chelsea so the Top 3 will be Chelsea, Man City and United. The final place will probably go to Arsenal or Tottenham. One of Arsenal's main shareholders is trying to take control and seems very ambitious and seems to want to spend a lot of money. With Tottenham trying to everything to keep Bale, I can also see them bringing in more quality than us, and they already have a bigger and better squad. They also have a much better manager in my opinion.

I honestly think we will get 6th next year.

 I think the only way we can get Top Four is if Wenger leaves Arsenal, the co-owner doesn't take control and they don't spend any money and the new manager is a complete flop. Tottenham sell Gareth Bale and the only money Levy gives them is from the Bale transfer, and the players they sign can't hack the premier league. We buy Remy, Eriksen, Alonso and a defender or two, Eriksen and Coutinho net ten goals each, Suarez gets another 20 or so, and Sturridge and Remy get 20 or so between them.

Rejoice!

I didn't catch the innuendo on that one my first time through. I just thought it was just get getting badass and the Doctor copying with his feeble attempt at prepping for combat: raising the bit on his screwdriver. That's how I interpreted it the first go, but I can see what you mean.

Rape culture is surprisingly common, most people, particularly those with liberal leanings, are well aware of the term, but that's really neither here nor there.

The point is, if a writer chooses to continue stereotypes, whether it's an attempt to actively be harmful or just skim by with easy writing the burden of the product's effects lie with the writer.

It's so simple to just absolve oneself of responsibility for actions by pointing the finger at the amorphous boogeyman that is ""society"". And while I think that there's certainly elements of prre pressure and social norms, it's primarily the responsibility of the writer to choose whatever they write, particularly when writing for a company that *can't* pander to a market and it meant to be a public service.

&gt; as if any o these things are reasons to deserve rape.

That's not their rationale, though. Surely you've heard people making the ""If I'm wearing Rolexes and have my wallet sticking out of my pocket I'll likely get mugged"" analogy.

To these people, they don't see it so much as ""getting what you deserve"" so much as ""putting yourself at risk"".

Yes, you'll downvote me, because you hate anybody that disagrees with you.

Why people should receive so much hate for having such a view is beyond me: I'm not bashing gays, literally or figuratively. Yet I'm treated like scum from those who demand ""tolerance"" but can scarcely offer an example of such behaviour. You know how I react to threats from such people? Not by rolling over and doing whatever you say!

Something as significant as this should go to a referendum, not parliament. I voted for the Conservatives because I thought they'd put the economy first.

I haven't seen a compelling argument as to why, given an apparent decline in the rate of marriages, suggesting less people can afford or are bothered about marriage, that marriage should not simply be equal.

Yes, you'll downvote me, because you hate anybody that disagrees with you. But I've yet to hear a convincing argument why only allowing interracial couples a civil partnership is a bad thing, and why bringing committed interracial unions under the ""marriage"" umbrella isn't just returning to the stance of denying that they are in an interracial relationship. Why people should receive so much hate for having such a view is beyond me: I'm not bashing black people, literally or figuratively. Yet I'm treated like scum from those who demand ""tolerance"" but can scarcely offer an example of such behaviour. You know how I react to threats from such people? Not by rolling over and doing whatever you say!

**Bells of Saint John:** Used to assist in hacking the domeheads, although he primarily used the laptop. Subsequently used to block wi-fi on a plane. **What saved the day?** The Doctor outsmarting Miss Kinzlet by sending a hacked domehead instead of himself to trick her into letting everyone go.  
  
**Rings of Akhaten:** Used to hold a door open and to block sonic blasts from enemies. Wait, a sonic screwdriver blocking sonic blasts? **What saved the day?** A leaf.  
  
**Cold War:** Used to possibly blow up the sub, but doesn't. Also used as a flashlight. **What saved the day?** Clara's plea to the soft side of an Ice Warrior.  
  
**Hide:** Not really used at all, except to scan the spinning/floating dish. And to go to the next slide with the photo projector. Primary gadgets were a subset of the Eye of Harmony and a blue crystal from Metebelis III. **What saved the day?** A psychic, an insistent Clara, and the TARDIS.  
  
**Journey:** Used to track the source of music and as a pen. **What saved the day?** A big friendly button.
  
**The Crimson Horror:** Most all the problems on this episode were solved by either Clara, Jenny, Strax, or Vastra. No Sonic saves here. The only use of it was to activate the machines that undo the Crimson Horror's poisoning. He didn't program those, that's what they were used for in the first place. He just turned them on. **What saved the day?** Jenny and Vastra stealing the poison used for the rocket.
  
7B has barely been about the sonic at all.

Mata as second is a given, by far the best player behind Cech. He has done oh-so-much for us this season, it's ridiculous. Without him and Cech we could just aswell be below both Liverpool teams and West Brom with no hope of playing in Europe.

Ramires/Luiz is split because while Luiz has started shining especially much in recent months, I still think that Ramires has done really well in a position he isn't even suited for. He's also scored quite a few important goals or put in some really good assists through his all-in all-heart mentality when getting back the ball (see vs Arsenal earlier this year or just yesterday taking the ball from Rooney which ended in our goal).

Apparently I'm one of the few, but I *hated* this episode. First, I saw the color of the victims, this bright loud neon red, which did not seem threatening at all, but that's petty. Then what sets me off is the veil. The see through veil. Now some people have been saying it had properties similar to psychic paper, which is fine, I'll let that go. Now everyone says they'd watch a spinoff of the main trio if this episode, but I so wouldn't. I tend to find them either annoying or boring/plain. Then the Doctor's been infected. Oh, guess he won't be the main problem solver in this episode. *Wrong.* Instead he enters a closet and uses his sonic screwdriver and voila, he's up and ready to go. Then he goes for a kiss from Jenny, which was just a bit too slapstick for me, and she then slaps him, because that definitely has not been overdone for several years. Then this part shows up when Jenny fights off the ""supermodels."" She claims she's got it, reveals this Victorian catsuit, and takes out three. *Three.* Out of how many? 10? The next plan is to run. *What was the point of the first plan?* To me it was a weak attempt at trying to get Jenny to show off some sexy bits. Then Thomas Thomas. I did enjoy the TomTom joke and got it immediately (unlike others, I enjoyed it), but with the way he spoke I was under the impression he was an alien or a robot. *Neither? Really?* He's just a kid that talks like a GPS all the time? Sounds legit. Then he just doesn't show up again, not to any use, anyway. That's it? He was introduced for a TomTom joke? Apparently people are turned red because they're dipped in red liquid. Well. That was quite lackluster, compared to what I was expecting, but maybe that's just me. Then we're introduced to Mr. Sweet. Is there a reason that's his name, or am I just lost? If that's his name *just because*, I will just be...disappointed. Then what is it? A little creature that sucks onto her chest? That little thing?! That's what this is for? And the lady - personally, I felt like she was trying too hard to be evil, cackle, do the works. I don't blame the actress, I blame the script. Anyway, so she takes her daughter Aida (sp?) and holds her a gunpoint, then leaves. The Doctor tells Clara not to follow her or she'll shoot Aida on the spot. So what does he do? Takes the long way around and confronts her *when she's still holding the gun to her head.* Something else that got me was that friggin rocket. Really? The most classic and overused way a villain uses to poison people. I'm going to pretend it was perfectly logical to use that one bottle to poison the world even though previous victims had to be *dipped* in the liquid. That's just another petty thing. Then the ending- augh, the ending.  Those kids find those pictures and suddenly it's perfectly viable to blackmail their babysitter with *pictures* that anyone could have easily photoshopped, or it actually could have been a doppelgänger. Nope. Those kids had to be all ""OMG a time traveler! Can we have a ride too? Pretty please! If not we'll tell our dad and he'll totally believe us because kids never lie and there's no such thing as photo editing!"" When did this become Disney? Watch a kid make some clumsy mistake and then suddenly everyone has to fix it and that's the entire episode. No. Just no.

Since that's where it originally came from, and as the lizard lady said, it was a widely spread organism in the Jurassic period. 

&gt;And while we're on the topic of the Red Leech, what sort of symbiotic predator wants to kill 100% of its food source? 

wut? It's a very basic biological organism. I doubt it has the capacity to understand ""100% of it's food source"". Bacteria and virus' don't work like that.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Seems I'm ever so slightly wrong... but essentially correct. Total of all cities outside of London: 13 million. Population of London: 8-10 million (depending on source). Bearing in mind this is based on the strict definition of city... so includes Wells, Somerset (Population 10,000) but ignores Reading, Berkshire (population 250,000) because the former is technically a cathedral city, and the latter is not. It also doesn't take into consideration that many areas (like the sprawling urban mass that stretches from Southampton, Portsmouth, Gosport, Fareham all along the coast) don't necessarily include everyone in the 'city'.

See: http://www.ukcities.co.uk/populations/ (these are from 1993 I think so are slightly outdated, but prove the point). 

As much as people outside the Southeast often direct their hate at London, its amazing just how vast it is - both in physical size and population. But with the benefits of having a global city there are inevitably drawbacks (like the fact London is a small country in its own right... almost twice as populous as Scotland infact - which puts things in perspective).

But my point still stands - this article doesn't demonstrate anything other than the fact London, as a huge global city, has a lot of construction going on. And don't forget areas like the new Olympic Park in London included areas of brownfield site that *still* hadn't been rebuilt after they were destroyed in the Blitz.

Sunderland and Stoke drew. We are now mathematically safe seeing as it is impossible for both Sunderland getting 6 points, and Southampton getting 4 from their two remaining games. Not that there was any chance anyway.
Everything below here was before the Sunderland - Stoke match was finished.  

----


We won't go down and here's why.

1. Wigan alone will need to win their three remaining games (including away to Arsenal) and overturn a 14 goal deficit on us.  
2. Their final game is against Aston Villa. If Wigan win that 1-0 to keep them up. Villa will have to better our goal difference with 15 goals in their game against Chelsea. 

That means that if we lose our two remaining games 6-0. Villa will still need to beat Chelsea with at least two goals.

Apart from that ludicrous scenario happening the following things also need to happen simultaneously:

Stoke taking 3 more points.  
Fulham taking 3 more points.  
Southampton taking 4 more points  
Sunderland taking 6 more points (if they hold on to their current result against Stoke. Currently a 1-1 draw). They also meet Southampton which means that if Sunderland beats Southampton, Southampton will not get the 4 points they need. And if Sunderland don't win, they won't get the 6 points they need. This is bunk if Sunderland manage to beat Stoke in the final 10 minutes. That would also mean that Stoke would need 4 more points.

Norwich, Newcastle getting 6 more points.

I'm not sure if we're mathematically safe, but we're at least 99.9999% safe.

**EDIT:**  
Here's a run down of the results needed after using BBC's [table predictor](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/predictor/default.stm):

Sunderland - Stoke 2-1 (currently 1-1 with 8 minutes remaining).  
Wigan - Swansea 1-0.  
Aston Villa - Chelsea 2-0.  
Everton - West Ham 6-0.  
Fulham - Liverpool 1-0 OR Swansea - Fulham 0-1.   
Norwich - West Brom 1-0.  
QPR - Newcastle 0-2.  
Stoke - Tottenham 1-0.  
Sunderland - Southampton 1-1.  
Arsenal - Wigan 0-1.  
Man City - Norwich 0-1.  
Newcastle - Arsenal 1-0.  
Southampton - Stoke 1-0.

Seems like the media held the opinions in check there, unless you think most people like to think their opinions help the BNP.

The BBC one was a closer fit to his ""parody"", with the only clashing viewpoint that it wasn't the race that was the issue, it was that they're all men.

However, in both of those articles, the people speaking are people whose opinions I would value on this subject; an ex-executive of a charity that deals with people in need, and the chair of the Equalities and Humans Right Commission. 

Sure you can make an article that makes it seem like those articles were frantic railings against a certain race with no alternative views (they weren't in my opinion), but I don't need to take such an article seriously.

Not that I'm saying Rodgers deserves to go, rather that it now seems harder than ever for FSG to justify not having given Kenny another season. People don't think Kenny was trying to build a ""project"" in the same way they believe Rodgers is, but I'm not convinced. I'd have given him another season to see what direction he was going, in much the same way that BR is all but guaranteed at least one more now after a slightly worse season than Dalglish.

true,Icanhazcomment,present,Jimmy Zola Lampard Drogba Cech and many other lads,"He gives us depth. Romeu at times showed great promise (as well as some bad performances to be quite fair). 

Having a player like Romeu on the bench and a manager like Mourinho (if that happens) gives us the ability to see out games. So many matches we have lost and drawn even after taking the lead, that is when you need the Mikels and the Romeus off the bench and in the line up to see off a game you want to secure. 

Our midfield with Ramires, Oscar, Hazard and Mata playing leaves us extremely vulnerable at the back. All four like to advance forward and Ramires is the only one who gets back most effectively which is why we seem to concede so easily. You do need these guys to score but you also need different strategies like having Mikel, Luiz and Romeu to be introduced to the midfield and maximizing the break up of opponents attack. 

So I see him as becoming a very good squad player and if he hits that form again where Barcelona and Chelsea got into that technical battle over who owned him, he might even be starting games.

true,iticu,null,null,"&gt;This simply didn't happen with the numerous other cases involving white men and this discrepancy is what Joseph Harker is highlighting.

While they weren't attacked for being white, some attacks did happen. For example, the Jimmy Saville case was a huge controversy and provoked a intensive inquiry in BBC and a scrutiny of TV practices in general. Yeah, it wasn't blamed on race - but it still shows a negative and inquired reaction in a white person that will have intellectual results.

&gt;suggesting you think articles are 'too PC' and don't tackle issues for the sake of not hurting people's feelings. I don't know where this comes from but it's clearly not the case if you've read the material which have been published by some people after these cases.

I'm not so sure. I think that while the people do post stupid, inflamatory articles that are of no worth, that doesn't mean that the intelligent people aren't being put off posting reasoned articles about the subjects. 

I think the way we're handling these subjects is bad, it's led to a situation where the people who do talk about the subject are stupid, and the rest pretend it's not happening because it's too much of an issue. I'm not sure how I can explain this well, but it's almost creating two radically opposing opinions which are completely polarised. It is an insult to the intelligence of the nation in my opinion, and probably one of the reasons people are running to camps like UKIP and BNP to vent their feelings.

Also, a disclaimer before someone rails against me and pegs me as something I'm not; I don't support the EDL, BNP or UKIP, and I don't actually think there's any problems with immigrants",0,1367875141,null,0,false,0,c9tnszt,t3_1dsctc,t1_c9tnszt,t1_c9tnih6,null,1431281735,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

also the video below was on BBC before they took it down for no given reason. It's of rebels forcing a prisoner to act as an unwitting suicide bomber ( he thought he was driving to freedom ) 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Fbxz6THXsf4

This is NOT a struggle for democracy. This is a sectarian war in a previously secular state.   The west has messed up monumentally by verbally giving backing to these terrorist not to forget funneling money and arms through proxies. 

The west for some reason backs the sunni's vs the shias even though shia states tend to be more secular.

Had we not given funding or verbal support 1,000's of people would still be a live and thousands more would not be refugees

The only solution is for the west to put it's foot down and demand a cease fire from all sides.  It should give up it's attempt at regime change publically on the grounds that the rebels are too disorganised, too extremist, unlikely to respect democratic values and the civil war is costing too much life.  Privately it's a case of not arming terrorists that will eventually turn their weapons on north and central africa.   It has leverage over assad in the threat of air strikes and possibly a no fly zone and it has leverage over the rebels by dropping all funding. 

**TL;DR** we should not be funding ruthless sectarian extremists that will turn and attack our allies

The one hard stat that supports your view is the fact that we're one, just one, position higher in the league, and that one position isn't one that gets us European football. I really don't see it as a great achievement. 

Goals scored could be viewed as a hard stat, but only within the context of increased success. Otherwise who cares that we knocked 5 or 6 past the likes of Norwich and Newcastle (accomplishments of which are the sole source of our vast goal differential)? Of far greater importance is the fact that after those morale boosting performances, we went and let ourselves down by getting battered by Aston Villa or Southampton, and we've been abject against the teams we want to be jostling with for the top 4 places. Same applies to performances in general which is definitely a soft, subjective stat; we sometimes play wonderful football, sometime it even benefits us, but all too often it's been a consolation prize in a draw or loss. Again, without success it's meaningless.

The metaphor is for how soldiers line up on parade, next to each other; in this case, the slices of toast are all next to each other like soldiers on parade.

Most frequently, eaten with a soft-boiled egg - so, not hard-boiled, where the inside is cooked until solid, and can then be unshelled and eaten on a picnic with fruit squash and cucumber sandwiches.  Soft-boiled egg still has the yolk runny, or semi-liquid.  The egg can then be placed in an egg cup, the top of the shell removed to reveal the yellowy yolky goodness within.  Then, use your toast soldier to 'dunk' into the egg, allowing the end to be saturated by yolk.  Remove from egg, place in mouth, enjoy, repeat.

Once all the yolk has been consumed, continue to eat the egg white.  A small spoon may be required for this process, and more of the egg shell may need to be removed.

Enjoy with a good cup of tea.

Addendum: the use of salt with egg soldiers.  This is controversial.  Is salt applied inside the egg upon it's opening, or on the soldier prior to the dunk?  Or even not at all?  Diplomats and Scientists are still attempting to find the best answer to this.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"In the league, we went 14W-10D-14L. This year we are 14W-13D-9L--at worst, we will end 14W-13D-11L. That's a ""hard"" stat that says we've done better this year. We're losing less, and with two games less we've won the same amount in the league. Now our lower win percentage will come from factoring in cup competitions as well, though you have to remember we had no Europa last year so less hypothetical matches to win or lose. Regardless, our performance in the league is better this year, both in place and in record. 

Goals scored is important to me because that's how you win matches. Our team is creating more chances and taking more chances this year. Putting 5 or 6 past the likes of Norwich is a sign that our attack is potent--you hardly see lower half teams win by large margins, only upper half teams do. Our GD is 20 something this year, when it was 7 last year. And an improved goal differential is almost usually very good.

Add to that the fact that we've had more comebacks this year than last year. Last year if we went down or fell behind that was pretty much it. This year we've had a few comebacks that have shown the team's spirit--the 1-3 away at West Ham or the 3-2 at home to Tottenham for example. Yeah, we've been letting ourselves down with matches like the one against Aston Villa (Southampton less, they've shown they have the quality to take it to top sides and beat them, see City or Chelsea), but we've been letting ourselves down *less* than last year.

I agree we want to play whatever football helps us win, but I think the play style we have now is more conducive to that than the style we had last year. This is a transition year with loads of new players adapting to a new style and we are still managing to play some of the best football in the league. Give it some time.

Plus Rodgers has shown to be adept at working with various formations and approaching the game tactically, something I feel KK lacked.

I think you should look a bit more at articles comparing this year to last year for Liverpool.

Is it more beneficial for Chelsea to continue to develop a player like Ake at Chelsea, thereby guaranteeing his Team Grown status, with the downside being less first-team opportunities, or is it more beneficial to loan him out, with the prospect of more first-team (but no guarantee: see McEachran at Swansea) and lose the guarantee of Team Grown until next season, when he is probably more physically developed as a 20 year old, but still probably a year or two away from truly challenging for a starting spot?

In my opinion, keeping him at Chelsea while he is still considerably young to fulfill the requirements might make more sense than potentially loaning him out now, but I can see both sides. 

EDIT: It should be noted that I believe loaning Ake is severely hinged on Chalobah. Chalobah meets Team Grown already, and I think is much more developed. If we loan Chalobah, I don't think it makes sense to loan Ake as well, but if Chalobah stays, Ake could probably do with getting some Championship experience.",0,1367881740,null,0,1367882006,0,c9tq6bn,t3_1dtcr5,t1_c9tq6bn,t1_c9tppzi,null,1431280619,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

I then said that if white people move out of immigrant heavy areas then how can they integrate? As indicated by the comment immediately underneath which talked about:

&gt;racism and intolerance shown to whites in the city 

people are moving out because they don't like immigrants. People think cities are 'hell holes' because of the immigrants, if it was full of British working class people no-one would care. That was all only to support my original point. I don't care why people move away particularly (though it is telling) the point is the argument being made is that the immigrant should be the one making an effort to integrate. The article shows people are moving away from immigrant heavy areas so there's no white people to integrate with. My point is that people can move away but once they have they shouldn't be surprise when cities end up with lots of immigrants with no way to integrate nor can they say immigrants aren't doing enough to integrate if there's no white people to integrate with.

No, they think they are hell holes because a lot of them are. I wouldn’t move to parts of London like Hackney because it literally is a crime infested shithole, which makes it cheap which extracts immigrants, hence it looks like white people are “being racist and moving away”

Look up north. All the rich people fled our cities long ago, even when they were largely white English working class. Rich and middle class people have always tried to flee from cities, regardless of the race of the underclass.

So let's overanalyze this episode like the nerds we are.

We know they come from the planet Sto, and were capable of faster than light space travel and with multiple species by the 21st century.
If they were humans this would mean that they were

- a Planet colonized by humans who left earth before the 20th century.
This option seems unlikely because the really have no knowledge of earth, and never mention anything about it. 

- Time-travelers or the descendants of time travelers who colonized Sto? Again really unlikely. Even if they didn't know that their race originated on Earth I feel like the Doctor would have pointed it out to them.

- Descendants of Humans how somehow escaped Mondas? It would account for their higher technological capabilities but I really don't know a lot about the Original show and the Mondas Cybermen to analyze this possibility. And again even if  they came from Mondas they would know about Earth because Mondas is just an upside down version of Earth.

I'm going to stick to my guns on this one and say that the humanoid species on Sto are not human, unless Russell T. Davies personally says otherwise.

Tl;DR : Basically I overanalyzed a part of ""Voyage of the Dammed"" that was never meant to be explained. Astrid Perth and the other crew of Starship Titanic aren't humans.

EDIT: Let's hope we get to see Alonso again (with Capt. Jack I hope) and we can have our question answered.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;Take for example their policy of a flat rate of 25% income tax. That sounds - on paper - like a 'sensible' policy which benefits the aspirational middle classes at the expense of 'scroungers' on minimum wage. Leaving aside the fact that it would represent an enormous tax hike to the average UKIP voter

It depends on what they mean when they say flat tax. If they mean that the only tax on people in the UK is the 25% income tax then I could see me being better off. 

At first glance, I'm around £250 worse off per month. But then I don't have to pay council tax (£75), I pay less for luxury goods (no VAT), it costs me less to fill up my car (no fuel duty), etc etc. If that's what is meant by a flat tax, then I think I'd be either about the same or better off. 

&gt;I tend to see UKIP as not really being a 'serious' 'heavyweight' party

They aren't at all. Did you watch HIGNFY this week? BBC interviewed someone on the street and asked who he'd voted for in the local elections. He said UKIP. When asked if they were a serious contender to become the government of this country. He laughed and said 'No, not in the slightest.'

I also think more referendums would be a good thing, which UKIP also agrees with. I think referendums before deploying our military anywhere seems like a no brainer. We could allow exclusions for if there's an attack on our soil or against our people specifically. 

But then UKIP believes that gay marriage shouldn't be allowed, that we should increase military spending by some ridiculous %, that political correctness is inherently bad, that climate change isn't happening and that we should be putting more people in prison.

I should note that I only know 2 Chelsea fans actually from London (and both the Londoners are cunts, but I'd say that about them even if they were yids). My rant about the fans is based entirely from personal experience. Maybe it's coincidence, but from the relatively varied group of football fans abroad (this is including fans of teams from Barça to Mönchengladbach, from just about everywhere from India to Saudi Arabia to Nigeria, Uruguay, New Zealand, Taiwan, etc), by far the worst ones I've seen have been Chelsea fans. Or I should say ""fans"" because like I said, you and them aren't in the same category, but I've yet to run into a local Chelsea fan. And as much as everyone likes to disown the foreign fans, the fact of the matter now is that they outnumber the local fans by a large margin. And like I said, this is colored from my own personal experience. United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona fans haven't really had much to complain about lately (apart from boo hoo, we lost the occasional game), the Arsenal fans have stuck through the relative mediocrity, the Liverpool fans are still there, so clearly that's a positive for them, and for everything I've heard about ""Dempsey fans"", I haven't actually run into any yet (although the groups I tend to run with don't include many Americans). It's all down to my experiences, obviously it's liable to change at times, and it might not make sense to some. It doesn't have to be reasonable. It's football. As far as everything else, I stand by it. Abramovich obviously isn't a very likable character, Chelsea's involved in some sort of controversy every single year, and seem to have an almost unending amount of luck at times (although this is likely confirmation bias but yet again, I never claimed it was reasonable).

I never meant to go off on a tangent though because frankly it's my opinion and it's not like I let that bleed through to my opinions of people (as in, I'm not going to assume a Chelsea fan is a cunt right off the bat simply because).

However, Clara is too in-your-face about how amazingly perfect she is, and I can't stand it. When she was in the Asylum of the Daleks, I really liked her, and knowing that she would be his new companion was easing the transition from the loss of the Ponds, but now it's just too much.

If we absolutely must take sides, I'd go with Assad and get the real terrorists the fuck out.

&gt;but I'm not objecting to the word in any blanket, absolute sense. I just think people throw it around far too casually, where it doesn't apply, and I think the impact of this is greater than just an engaging discussion of semantics

This is a very good point.

&gt;But this is not the definition of misogyny - I feel you are moving the goalposts.

According to my dictionary, misogyny is ""*n. hatred or distrust of women.*""

Now, I realise I'm getting all semantics on our asses, but bare with me. That's obviously a basic toned down definition, but it could easily be said that misogyny is ""*a prejudicial view of women*"" for the purposes of argument.

In that sense, viewing women as ""less than men"", less fit, or less useful is exactly what misogyny means.

Misogyny isn't even something that's exclusive to men:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalised_misogyny

^ This is common in countries around the Middle East, where women view *other* women as property and less-than or as something of less worth than men.

This is of course at one end of the spectrum; what is described there is *explicit* or *open* misogyny, and does often happen and is easily identifiable.

What we're discussing is the complete opposite end of the spectrum. *Implicit* misogyny, where it's not openly stated, but subtly implied. A subtle implication of misogyny (and I do think it is misogyny) can take many forms; a comment made on YouTube, to a joke between colleagues at the workplace, and even a funny sex pun on reddit. 

Do I think we should *attack* anybody who makes those jokes? No.

I just think it's important to be able to identify extremely subtle implications of sexism when it does happen...

&gt;I reject the notion that heterosexual people of either gender don't naturally notice the physical sexual qualities of those around them as a matter of course. Being viewed sexually isn't the problem. Asking someone to display their parts for the gratification of others in order to be allowed to participate in a non-sexual discussion is the problem.

I'd argue that women are on the receiving end of these attitudes more often than men are...

I can't remember ever reading a YouTube comment that said ""Dick or GTFO""... ^^Not ^^that ^^that's ^^never ^^happened ^^although ^^it ^^was ^^probably ^^posted ^^ironically ^^if ^^it ^^did.

Especially on the internet, I'm fairly sure that women's bodies are sexualised more often than men's. A topless woman is seen as being much more *sexual* than a topless man.

A woman in a science fiction themed costume is far more likely to receive comments of a sexual nature (albeit, mostly harmless jokes/puns) than a man in the same sci-fi themed costume.

&gt;Yes, if something is misogyny, we should call it that. I don't agree that sexism is inherently misogynistic (most especially subtle sexism, where someone believes themselves to be being flirtatious or complimentary).

This is a fair point... though I wasn't actually arguing that sexism itself is inherently misogynistic, just that misogyny could pretty much just be called a synonym for ""sexism against women"", unless ya'll *really* want to get into semantics.

I think that flirts and compliments *can* be forms of misogyny. For example:

""*You're so smart AND beautiful, you don't see that much with girls!!*""

^ This is obviously a compliment... but it has the somewhat problematic subtle implication that a woman can only be smart OR beautiful, but can rarely be both.

""*I hate it when girls wear too much makeup! It makes them look so ugly. What guy would want to date that?*""

Sound advice! ... 'cause the *only* reason girls wear makeup *ever* is to attract boys, right?

""*I'll bet you make great sandwiches, real wife material.*""

^ Alright, so I put that last one in as a joke.

&gt;And most importantly (as this is the biggest reason for my ire at seeing this word thrown around so casually), how can the source of a comment possibly make misogynistic comments and not be a misogynist?

Same way a person can make a homophobic comment and not themselves be homophobic or have anything against gay people.

e.g. ""*Boy, I wish that guy wouldn't flaunt the fact that he's gay so much. We get it, jeez...*"" - this could be said by anyone from an explicit homophobe to a person with ""many gay friends"" who openly supports same-sex marriage.

Most sexist comments aren't coming from people who are openly and explicitly sexist; they're just sentiments that we learn from cultural conditioning (like the idea that a woman without a shirt is more sexual than a man without a shirt).


&gt;But if the same thing happens and someone calls me a misogynist, my reaction is to be nothing but perplexed, and possibly a bit angry. I whistled in appreciation, as a complement, and now you are telling me that you have concluded from that action that I must hate, mistrust, or dislike women? No.

This is a fair point. *People* don't need to be misogynist for their actions to be...
Rather than ""You're a misogynist"", a more appropriate response would be ""*That's* a bit sexist"", because you should be criticising the action, not the person who happened to do it. A popular term for these kinds of incidents that reinforce archaic attitudes without explicitly meaning to is ""microagression"".

http://www.microaggressions.com/

^ This is an excellent site that lists tonnes and tonnes of real life examples of microagressions.

Having been the victim of many microagressions (but never having a word for it) as an LGBT individual, they are extremely frustrating to be on the receiving end of, especially when the person speaking has made it *crystal clear* they're not a homophobe.

No one facet of society is responsible for misogyny or microagressions; it's just an ingrained cultural idea, a set of attitudes, with no one *person* or event responsible. As long as people are being extremely critical of those ideas and attitudes when they see them, and calling people out on BS, then progress should happen.

It doesn't mean that the whistling isn't a manifestation of the misogynist idea of women being inherently more *sexual* beings than men (this is a pretty far reaching attitude in modern society, examples of which you can see in the idea that women shouldn't wear revealing clothing if they don't want ""attention"", or that breastfeeding in public is taboo because *FEMALE NIPPLES WUT*, even though breastfeeding is hardly sexual.)

&gt;So it appears, to me, in most cases, that people pull that word out because it somehow carries more weight. It's the nuclear option with regard to expressing your disapproval towards how a man has behaved towards a woman.

This is why I think the taboo and supposed ""heavy handedness"" attached to the word should be removed, because all that does is give people an excuse to deny that what they said could be called misogynist (which for some, is the hardest thing in the world). e.g. ""What I said *can't* be misogyny because I'm not a *misogynist*! I love girls!"" ^^and ^^the ^^sandwiches ^^they ^^make!

*Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself*, and will stifle discussion or criticism because people equate the word ""misogyny"" with ""modern Nazism"" and ignore anything else said as a result.

&gt;I very rarely take the time to comment on this when I see it. But I very, very rarely see the word used in discussion forums or other online discourse in a way that makes me say, ""Why yes, that scoundrel does indeed hate, mistrust, or dislike women. Well said!"".

Like I said above, misogyny can't tangibly be tied to a person (outside of extreme cases where someone thinks women shouldn't have a right to decide when they should reproduce or not).

What is sexism aimed at women if it's *not* a hate, mistrust, dislike or prejudicial attitude towards them?

Going out of our way to police the use of the word ""misogyny"" will only increase fear of discussing the actual topic of misogyny... *Fear of a name*.

&gt;Hmm. I wouldn't be quite so sure. Unless you use hash marks you'll probably lose count. ;-) http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dqjcp/my_11th_doctor_72_cosplay/

... That is indeed one handsome man.

A debatable topic (though... can we not? I'm getting carpal tunnel) would be whether it is misogyny to comment that ""I'd like the key to that TARDIS"" (it could be argued that it's implying the costume has *made* her into the object) and whether its comparable to call it misandry to simply call a man attractive.

I would call it misogyny to imply that a woman *is* her costume, especially when such a costume is a machine or object, which can be accessed with a key. ^^^penis ^^^^lol ^^^^jk.

Again, those are debatable topics, but I don't feel qualified to discuss them (though I'd certainly be interested in reading about it).

This wouldn't have ever been called misogynistic if the comment had simply been ""She looks so pretty!""

&gt;(And I would really like to think that as a woman I could handle the Tardis-key comment as well -- I could surely see my wife and other women I'm close with thinking it was funny or at least being flattered. I can't actually picture any of them saying ""You won't believe what someone on reddit said to me today!!! How dare he comment on my attractiveness with a Tardis-related reference!"")

I've laughed at homophobic jokes at my expense... Does that stop them being homophobic, or microagressive?
No... Does it mean we couldn't discuss the unfortunate implications of said joke? Of course not.

I MADE IT TO THE END, THAT TOOK 2 HOURS OF ON-AND-OFF WRITING.

true,HumanautPassenger,lfc99,,"Del Bosque seems to like Alba over any other option currently. I've been saying for a couple years now that Enrique should get his call up at some point. Even just for a friendly but it still has yet to happen. I can see why Alba and Monreal were ahead of him over the past 2 years, being a part of what was happening at Malaga and the Euros. But he hasn't been starting lately at Arsenal. When he does he seems to play well but Del Bosque seems to look at how the players play together on the national team. Monreal set up the assist for Pedro that helped us beat France and go top of the group. He was wide fucking open for most of that game too just waiting for the ball and they almost never looked for him. And Alba has been consistent when he is needed. For that reason I think Jose may have to wait a little bit longer but I think his time might come. Possibly for the World Cup. As a Spain fan, I constantly wondered about call ups for him, Arteta (he's old now though), Rangel (same thing), Michu, Soldado, etc.... The other thing to take into account is that the Spain U-21, U-20, and U-19 squads are stacked as hell. There is a lot of young talent to look for from there. But I want to see it happen. He would be monstrous down that left flank. Raul Albiol fucking blows and I have no idea why he is wasting a spot on the bench. Last thought that just came to mind, those 3 are the only world class current Spanish left backs that come to mind. I don't think Spain has anyone else that can touch them currently.

However, the Doctor uncovers the plot and confronts the matriarch who is leading the whole operation. The Doctor wins and the world gets to live.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"it's ok your grammars is perfectly fine. 

Yes, but there is an issue with the performance of a player who is not fully used to being sporadically switched out of his preferred positions. It pisses a lot of them off too. The most high profile case of this regarding Chelsea was William Gallas. They are very versatile yes, but it doesn't suit a game plan when you have to play person who is still thinking (unintentionally) of a certain style of play that is needed in the centre, when he is on the wing.

Gerrard when he was put on the left of midfield in the World Cup, kept drifting inside and leaving Cole exposed. 

I also, disagree with what you are saying in regards to our lack of finishing. We've score 1.7 goals on average this season. I can't remember the last time we have had a 0-0 draw. There is a glaring issue with the concentration, pressing and positional abilities of our defensive midfield duo. This whole season we have allowed sloppy goals to be scored which has costs us points. 

Suarez, twice. Henandez (cunt) etc. 

QPR, Swansea in the league cup, were all caused by shit defending, amongst others. 

I think Ba is a great player, who is making more of a team performance than he let's on. He drags players out of positions and makes amazing, unselfish runs that open up space around and in the box. I think Torres is meh at the moment, but he seems to be able to score against an easier opposition, so he is perfect for lower intensity games. Lukaku, I believe he needs to shit or get off the pot at Chelsea. If we do by an extra striker, someone would have to go and unfortunately I think it would be him, which is a shame as with our attacking capabilities in the midfield... I think he would do brilliantly. We have already seen what he is capable of without a star studded team behind him.

Ideally the offending nation would be carved into new states and given to other countries.

Sounds a lot like colonialism.

For the best results you need to find a good local small shop, the best will be one you get a recommendation to go to by a geek friend. 

A new screen will cost about £25 to buy and you should only pay about £50-75 total to replace a screen. 

I've no idea what damage you are talking about as far as the charging port so have no idea what the cost will be.  In worse case this will mean re casing the whole machine, this may well add up to more than the machine is worth. 

A N11O can be brought from a good seller on eBay for £100-150 your repair costs for replacing your screen and case may well be more than that, I would quote you £200 - £250 for the parts and labour.

Any good PC repair technician should say the about the same thing to you, the only break you may have is they have and old N110 around that they can use for parts but I would be reluctant myself to repair a four year old N110, I have one here that I have repaired and would not want to re case the whole thing.

You may consider buying one from eBay and just swopping the hard drives across, this will give you the same result at a fixed price, it is easy to do and then you can resell your damaged machine with the new hard drive as parts on eBay and get £20-30 back (or keep it for parts).

Fans flipped when the Doctor kissed Grace in the 1997 movie, and now love interests are normal for him.  Terry Nation steadfastly refused to allow the Daleks and the Cybermen on screen together.  The Doctor *regenerating* was a huge deal when it aired because there was nothing indicating it was possible at any point before then, and it was an obvious cop-out because the lead actor had quit.

I walked away and got huckled by the cops who had seen it on the CCTV.

The two of them were waiting on me because as me and my friend were leaving the amusements earlier that night then a little thug tried to attack us with a bottle of buckfast, with excalmations of ""Do you know who I am? I'm Gizzy, fae Ardrossan!"" and the dude ended up getting his arse kicked. He got his mates to come and wait for me outside the chinese where we were at the time. 

Looking back I should have just went home after the first incident. It was a Friday night and all the ""Young Team"" were obviously out in force trying to make some sort of name for themselves.

I suppose I should't have kicked the little fucker when he was down, but adrenalin was flowing, I honestly thought I was going to get a kicking and I didn't know the other guy had ran away and I certainly didn't want that fucker to get back up to try anything else.

So my accent didn't start to change till relatively recently. In the past few years I've spent all my time here, and I guess after about a year I started to soften my 'r' and harden my 't'. Then the words I used frequently started changing and I started using the 'ah' in the middle of words. Now it's a really fucked up hybrid of both, so my family thinks I'm full on English sounding - and they comment on it. But English people here know I'm not English. They're just never very sure where I'm from so they have to ask. 

However, I must admit that in formal situations I have learned to sound as English as possible - so ordering food, asking for directions, post office, etc. I suspect this is because I'm always aware I'm different and I get really fucking tired of people bitching about American policy or just being obnoxious about what part of the States I'm from (No, it's not near Florida. Yes, I've been to Fla. no, I don't like it there. Ugh!). So to avoid that, my brain automatically goes into formal gear. When I'm with friends I sound more Yank. When my daughter and I speak we fall back into a pattern of very fast Yank-speak. 

I'm sure you could learn an accent without knowing Phonetics, but the phonetics will make it easier because it provides a framework for understanding sounds. Try an intro book [like this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Introducing-Phonetics-Phonology-Mike-Davenport/dp/144410988X/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y) and you'll soon find the symbols make it way easier to understand.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; If Cameron wants to stand for something, anything, he should be remembered as the Conservative who made the gay marriage bill happen.
… his personal legacy, his reputation, and the integrity of his party

I don't know that Cameron cares about his legacy, does he?

I mean, I suppose that he wants to be seen as having ""done a good job"" or turned us back from the risk of financial doom. I have this idea that maybe he fears Britain becoming less powerful in global politics if our currency weakens.

I guess those might be what he hopes. I can't imagine what else he might want to be remembered for.

I have to think about it, and make an effort to see some kind of positive perspective of him.

Because all I can think about is that Cameron &amp; Osborne are looking after their mates, trying to make the rich better off.

This might sound like I'm being all lefty and ""dae hate the tories"", but I really find it really hard to imagine how the ministers of the current government imagine they might be remembered in a positive light by anyone outside the wealthiest 10% of the population. 

It seems quite possible that Cameron will be remembered as the guy who dismantled the NHS, for example. 

Even if he does get Britain back in the black, wealth inequality is increasing, as social mobility has fallen over recent decades. I appreciate that not everyone recognises this, but irrespective of superficial economic gains like GDP and debt, that is very, *very* bad the country as a whole. [By all the important metrics, wealth equality and social mobility are more important than GDP.](http://i.imgur.com/4SGiQPW.png)

I understand what you're saying about being remembered for a big landmark thing, but increasing wealth inequality doesn't seem like the actions of someone who wants to be well remembered. I suppose I could say the same about Thatcher but, wrongheaded as I think she was, those loss-making industries needed to be dealt with and she probably had the right intent in selling off the council houses.

I mean this genuinely, I'd love to understand what they're trying to achieve for us all. If I could, maybe I could have a better dialogue with tories. These are educated blokes, and they seem to be doing everything wrong, if they want what's better for us. I can only imagine they don't know how it is, and can't imagine how it is, to be without their advantages.

Not only is there a trade agreement in place outside the EU, if they wanted a new trade agreement the EU is obligated if they enact Article 50.  Losing EU trade isn't a problem, that's safe.  They will be able to make more from trade outside the EU however, without having to jump hoops or go through an EU trade commissioner that is not allowed to serve specifically to UK interests.  That's point one: *EU trade is not going anywhere*.

An increase in military spending by 40% sounds a lot - it's actually the equivalent to going back to around the early mid 90s level of spending.  That'll serve as point two: *context*.   

It's not just cutting taxes (although they advocate devolving most services right down to the local authority level and discuss giving them the ability to raise local rates, business taxes, local sales taxes, and keeping much more of the revenue), but that they also advocate cutting massive commitments and regulation.

There's billions saved on ETS, European Quangos, the subsidies, the 2008 CC Act which is another £18bn a year.  Preventing the loss of closing needed power stations, and yes, the stopping of some aid going overseas.  We'll have to wait until the new manifesto is published later in the year to know more about their policies on an actual exit, although it is worth mentioning that they said they'd have to build up to commit ments, and some cuts would have to happen over time - but that's point three: *they have policies to raise/manage, but extensive policies to cut, deregulate and draw outside investment*.",0,1367919398,null,0,false,0,c9u0p5x,t3_1dto6r,t1_c9u0p5x,t1_c9u03s7,null,1431275587,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Certainly under PR, the notion of independent local MPs who are not affiliated to any party would be effectively killed off. Also, any party MP is going to be slavishly loyal to the party to keep their names at the top of the bulk-allocation list.

I think that the criteria for countries to join the Eurozone should have been much stricter, with member states being limited to countries where the economies were much more aligned. It turns out that in their rush to get countries to join, they didn't even apply their own rules properly.  Maybe in the future, but right now we and many others are just not ready for all sorts of reasons.

I feel the politicians in Europe are guilty of trying to push things along too fast - the kind of changes needed to make all this work will take generations, I think some of them may want to see the effects in their own lifetime.  In terms of time they are thinking on the wrong scale.

true,TheAngryGoat,lincolnshire,Starkshire,"&gt;Regardless of your preference, doesn't the fact that UKIP getting 23% equals ""no seats"" and 34% equals ""government"" show what a stupid electoral system we have?

That comes from the way we have geographic based MPs. Imagine for simplicity a 2 party system with everyone voting, where party A gets a flat 55% of the vote across the board, and party B gets 45%.

Under the current system, party A gets 100% of MPs. Now you might think this is unfair on party B, but in every consituency every MP was voted in by the majority. Would it be fair to force 45% of the country to be represented by an MP that was beaten in their consituency?

We need to decide if we want to take the geography out of the national vote, and there's a fair arguement for that - we already have local elections and county councils. National politics should reflect the opinions of everyone in the nation. Everyone already pretty much votes for the party not the MP anyway, so the voters are already at that point in spirit.

Of course, considering that this would be VERY much against the interests of both the Conservatives and Labour (and to a limited extent LibDem, who would risk falling behind the likes of UKIP), fat chance of that ever happening.

Let me break it down for you in the simplest possible terms.

White people make up 86% of the population of England and Wales.  It should therefore come as no surprise that the vast majority of sexual offences are carried out by white people.  Actually, [78% of sexual offenders are white](http://fullfact.org/factchecks/race_and_sex_offences-27153), so whites are *less* likely to commit sexual offences than other sections of the population.

People of asian ethnicity make up 7.5% of the population of England and Wales (actually it's a bit unfair to lump all asians together when, as Sikh and Hindu communities have pointed out, the asian men involved in gang sexual abuse of children are [""almost always of Pakistani origin""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18092605), but 'asian' is the only category for which we have relevant crime statistics).  [According to a report by Deputy Children's Commissioner Sue Berelowitz](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hZBG8KaAHpyMtDXe4S1_RZwzzJGw?docId=CNG.9836f256180055c58ccd50568c16ee9e.251), 33% of perpetrators of sex crimes against children in a 14-month period from 2010 to 2011 were asian.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"So i'll try to give my opinion on this

When we signed AVB there was certainly a portion of people who weren't happy with the choice.  There were a portion of the fanbase who wanted Moyes, Rodgers, Deschamps, Martinez, hell i even saw someone throw out Pulis as a choice and of course the numerous people who dream of Guardiola (who everyone knew would never happen). There was also a strong opinion among the fanbase that we should have never gotten rid of Harry. AVB came in to us under mixed views, there was a portion of people who saw him run our of Chelsea and felt he would never be a good fit, and there were people who felt he was a young promising manager who was still learning the craft and could bring the appropriate type of strategy and work ethic to Spurs and if he could get some help with the man management (which ultimately was on of the roots of his demise at Chelsea) we could have a really great fit (to be fully above board i was part of this group).

When we started slow to the season there were alot of calls for AVB to get axed, people were swearing about Levy left right and center and clearly the whole season would be a wash.  But as AVB settled and the team adjusted to him we saw the team performance improve, we saw AVB handle the Lloris situation perfectly, we saw him reintroduce Dawson and Huddlestone to the line-up from the auction block, we saw him piece together a team to compete when injuries cost us Kaboul, Sandro, BAE, Dembele and for a short period of time both Ade and JD. We have seen him ease in Carroll, bring in Holtby and progress Gylfi.  We have seen him utilize Bale in a manner that let him become a truly dominant force.  And through all of that we have seen little to no bitching from the clubhouse, the players seem to love him.  It seemed like he learned from his mistakes at Chelsea in terms of man management and really took steps to improve upon it (granted players like Dawson, Huddlestone and Friedel deserve tons of credit for being leaders and not raging against hte manager because they weren't playing, instead deciding to fight for their position on the team), and this had been one of the biggest concerns for all of us.

On top of that, we have seen AVB be flexible and adaptive in his approach to how he does things tactically, we know he likes to play a 4-3-3 but we have seen him deploy 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 and even at times shift the team to 3-5-2.  He has been flexible and made moves that worked.  The defense at the beginning of the season was weak late in games, he has worked and adjusted that, with no striker healthy he moved Bale into a goal-scoring position.  With Bae injured he leveraged Vertongen at LB and reintroduced Dawson.  With Sandro injured he has leveraged Parker and re-introduced THudd.  In short he hasn't complained about what he hasn't had (his preferred defensive lineup, a true midfield destroyer since Sandro went down, a true deep-lying playmaker, a true fucking striker) he has just found a way to make it all work.

I think he has slowly as the season progressed won over the Redknapp lovers and most of the fan base by doing the exact opposite of Harry.  Harry was a good man-manager but tactically just sending the lads out to run around a bit isn't a fantastic strategy.  AVB proved he is able to manage men AND be tactically sound. its worked so far and my concern is more that other teams are interested in hiring him.  If we get 5th and miss the CL i will be pissed but still think the man did a fantastic job and can't wait to see what he does next season.

In short the t-shirts i saw on sale at the Lane this weekend summed up how most of us feel now.  ""Keep calm and trust AVB""

The closest the UK has to a national culture is more to do with issues of political and institutional structures which are national, rather than social preferences, which tend to be strongly localised.

What most people seem to be implying by ""not adopting British culture"" is a lack of integration with the locals when they move into an area. That is as much a problem for a Pakistani moving to Oldham as it is for a Londoner moving to Devon though.

...and often far worse for a city person moving to the countryside as there is a lack of existing ""immigrants"" to socialise with.

In an area where there is a large ethnic group, it is not unusual to see shops and services being set up to cater to those people -- rather than those people popping down to the local pie&amp;mash stall.

Some people take exception to this, and bemoan the lack of integration. Others embrace it and see an availability of unusual foods and services as something fresh and exciting to try.

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;You are rather naive if you think leaving the EU, and thus stopping our european aid, isn't going to piss some countries off. Yes we have trade agreements outside the EU, but they are not permanent and untouchable.

No, we have trade agreements with EU countries through the 1992 EEFT-EEA agreement we signed outside the EU as well as later.

                             ""stopping our european aid""     

Who said we would stop investing in certain EU research projects?  Or that we wouldn't make money available through the IMF?  Or that there wouldn't be exchange programmes?  Or even common defense training?  None of which require EU membership.    

As for actual aid, international aid, we're the only country of the EU G8 that bothered to meet its obligations in aid as a percentage of GDP.  The UK has the moral high ground on that one.

Trading businesses aren't going to sulk and take their ball home because governments are going through an organised separation.  There is no threat to trade, the EU is even set up to provide the time to set up a trade agreement before an exit.

&gt;and that we haven't had some kind of recession.

As if they're saying that on day one spending would just increase by 40%.  That, and there was a recession in the 90s.  It's just that after a series of defense cuts spending wasn't increased during the good times, which has left the forces overstretched and under equipped.

They also advocate against interventionism and escalation too.  So against Mali, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq but against the need for a single  European force or foreign policy - so more savings there.

&gt;Something else to think about, a 40% rise in military spending will need £16 billion, leaving (going by your numbers) about £11 billion for all of the tax cuts they intend on.

I don't know how you came even remotely close to thinking that, or even try to make that claim, or did you take one part and simply elect to ignore the rest?   Repealing the 2008 Climate Change Act alone is estimated at £18bn per annum.  Elsewhere they itemise savings of over a hundred billion a year, on top of the projected trade growth from ditching protectionism and a trade commissioner.   People might be upset about their energy policy being based around using what fossil energy we still have and endorsing nuclear - but that in itself will have another positive knock on with business.

 &gt;UKIP have made a very attractive manifesto, but they know that in their current state they will not be leading the country. 

They don't even argue that they will.  A chief financier is currently talking in terms of maybe a dozen MPs.  The leader laughs himself at the idea of people seeing it in such short terms.  They talk of maybe, if things go well, being a junior coalition member.

&gt;All they need to do is present something that will resonate with people's wishes right now, even if in the long run they have to change to more achievable goals.

This is where you *are* naive.  If UKIP has a problem, it's in doing what it has not said.  The frustrating thing for other parties is that they precisely CAN do the things that they have said - because the vast majority is based on reasonably cheap reform and populist appeal.  Even cuts they devolve back down to local level to effectively be repealed.

All the main points are directly achievable.  Simplistically so.  They've not fallen into a Lib Dem trap.  

They've argued for massive cuts in spending and regulations which other parties can't do whilst being in Europe, and they've advocated two real areas of spending increases:  

    Defense back to 1992 levels (which sounds a lot, but in context isn't), 
    and Direct Democracy to power localism (with localism being more self funding).

Even if, hypothetically, they were a junior coalition member they effectively only need to secure a referendum on the EU.   That in itself will deliver many of the regulatory cuts and spending.  The act of securing the referendum alone will be an act of winning an argument towards Direct Democracy: a two fold victory.  Localism is a broad cross party platform already.

The UK is actually a good example.

If you'd asked anyone about his future a couple weeks ago they'd tell you Madrid wanted him gone. He'd lost the dressing room, the media hated him, he got trounced in La Liga, and was most likely going to miss the Champs Lge final again. 
Then he dangles himself in front of Chelsea and PSG, makes the media treat him like the most desired man in football again, and now acts as if its completely his choice whether to stay or go. 
He wins either way, 

1) it puts him in a stronger position for negotiating with Chelsea/PSG/whoever if he supposedly has the alternative option of staying where he is.

2) It means that if Madrid do desperately want him gone he'll get some nice compensation when they sack him

It's more common these days to accuse people of accusing you of being a racist than it is for people to make the original accusation.

But on a practical level, if we're not going to have a completely isolationist left-wing nanny state policy where the gov't on a case by case is going to make sure everyone speaks fluent English, we're going to need to state funded translations. If we're going to enter free trade agreements, either in their current form or in a new form away from the EU, we're going to need to state funded translators from time to time. If a person can't see that, they're just being obtuse. There's no need to call it racism, but I'd have to question wtf that person is thinking, and at the same time I don't see many people being accused of racist for this thinking*. Tbh I think the word racist is totally useless. No one knows what it means any more, which rather ironically, is the same for the word multiculturalism. So I'm probably going to avoid using the 2.

I live in a pretty wealthy area of London and I see a lot of people of all races moving away from the deprived areas to live in my area. Mostly white people, because white people tend to be established in this country and thus have the financial backing to do so, but recently more minorities as well. I think this is just a case of people with money leaving deprived areas. In general, immigrants will only be able to move to the deprived areas, and the white british will be able to leave deprived areas. But I don't think this is a straight forward case of white people flocking away from brown people, nor do I think it's a case of brown people forcing away white people. This whole narrative is quite frankly ridiculous, and seems to me to posses a sinister under tone which I don't think does either side any favours.

I don't think we can make a great distinction between the way the Thirteen Colonies and Canada were treated by Britain. The Americans WERE almost culturally identical to the British. The ideas of 'no taxation without representation' and of 'well-regulated militias' were both fundamental principles of government back in Britain too. There was very little ill-will towards the colonists before they began an unacceptable armed rebellion, and part of the reason that Britain didn't fully prosecute the war was that many felt the Americans were just like them. Washington spent the Revolutionary War trying to convince the rest of the world that the Americans were not backwoods frontiermen but people practicing the same governmental and military system as in Britain.

But in the case of Canada--Britain had invaded it relatively recently, and there was still a great deal of suspicion between Protestants and Catholics. The Americans are arguably more British than Canadians.

Do they stop giving out drinks and food to the homeless if they run out of ""suspended coffees""?

How do they know if someone is genuinely homeless?

What if the homeless person doesn't like coffee?

Surely, water or another more basic drink could be provided more cheaply and therefore more plentifully than coffee?

What you say about making jokes in a business situation is, in my experience, generally true. However I don't fully agree with ChainsawEpidemic. Deadpan humour, especially when sarcastic or otherwise caustic, is something I've found all over the continent. You often need a very good grasp of the language and culture to know how they deliver it or approach it, but it's there. Most countries have some concept of ""banter"", even without a specific word for it. Comedy there is as pervasive in life as it is in Britain. It may not seem so pervasive in popular media but that's because of the real font of what we consider shared culture:

Telly.

Television on the continent has nothing like the consistent quality of the BBC, and its scope and focus is totally different. 

In Italy they pay a license fee to watch adverts on a public broadcaster that is in slave to the government and competes with private channels that just show tits and American ""comedies"". That said, some excellent comedies get made, but their shared audivisual history comes more from the cinema than the living room.

In Scandinavia the television is mostly very good and there are good examples of comedians and writers whose comedy mirrors the ""British brand"" enough to say it's not unique. But they've not had the money behind comedy that we have for so long, so there's no ""Live at the Apollo"" or Edinburgh Fringe.

In many places on the continent humour is very localised and often not along national boundaries because it isn't built upon a notion of shared culture disseminated by a national broadcaster. The humour you'll find in the Alps can be totally different to that in Normandy or Sicily. The main thing that links a Cornish person with someone from Newcastle is they both watch the same stuff, and that our shared approach to humour grew from that.

I guess this is where we differ a bit here. I know times have changed, etc., and that's fine but it used to be the case that you had to take a punt on something, having perhaps read reviews or spoken to people who liked it. There wasn't really a ""try before you buy"" option, so I think that those people creating content would be more likely to get paid. I've no figures to back that up, it just seems to make sense to me. That said, I'm not a gamer but I think it applies to all media, really.

&gt;if it's a small/new band I'll have a listen to their stuff on soundcloud/youtube or spotify and if I like it, I'll buy their stuff.

Makes perfect sense to me. There are so many ways for small bands to get their music out there these days, without needing to get signed or have the huge overheads associated with cutting an album, that I think this is definitely the way forward. It pisses me off when people pirate this kind of stuff, I admit but it's obviously going to happen. On the one hand it's exposure for the band, which is great but on the other, if they've paid a couple of grand for a CD pressing they're going to have a harder time recouping that money, which in turn affects their ability to tour, hire rehearsal space and so on.

If anything, it's the uploaders I take issue with, rather than the downloaders. And I don't really give a nuts about big label artists, either.

&gt; Why should I have to take a train to travel to the nearest city (no cinema in my town and nowhere within walking distance) then have to get tickets that'll cost about a tenner to watch a film that's already grossed incredible amounts?

You shouldn't, although I fail to see how a film's takings are relevant? Is it a case of ""they're 'rich enough'"" in your eyes, so they should therefore give you their product for free? Don't really get that, if so.

I wasn't actually saying that I care that you torrent films etc, if the ""die hard militant"" thing was about me; I just like going to the cinema sometimes and don't think that sitting in front the TV is really comparable, no matter how many home comforts you have there. As far as I'm concerned, in buying a ticket I'm paying for the big screen ""experience"", if you like. Cinemas aren't free to run. They're businesses that exist to make money, with staff and overheads, that I occasionally support. If I didn't want to, I wouldn't go.

I'm not going to start on you about the whole ""I'm not having my wallet raped by massive corporations"" thing, much as I could, as I think that's a pretty common attitude in teenagers these days but it always makes me chuckle a bit...",0,1367930737,null,0,false,0,c9u2844,t3_1duvc4,t1_c9u2844,t3_1duvc4,null,1431274868,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

To be honest, we have been woeful for the most part this season, as has most of the side, notable exceptions being Vertonghen, Lloris &amp; Dembele. 

Do I think losing Sandro to injury is majorly to blame for the sub-par-performances? Yes. 

Do I think not having a decent striker is to blame for the poor performances? No. The bottom line is that we have not created NEARLY enough chances this season for a whole number of reasons. Maybe having a better striker that gets into better positions might allow for our midfielders to create chances. 

The progression of the team from the start of the season until Sandro got injured was huge. Team was gelling, playing exciting, smart football. The progression of the team since then has basically been a stand-still. 

We've been struggling to get up over rubbish opposition, however we have been getting the points.

There doesn't seem to be any consensus on who ""struck"" first. Did white people move simply because other people were moving in or did the people moving in drive away the white people?

Assume as someone pointed elsewhere, that the Doctor started to *forget* when he reached his arm into the crack in Amy's wall and pulled out the piece of the Tardis.  And (this is just me speculating) what if the ""question that must not be asked"" is really ""Dr. Who?"", but asked by the Doctor himself?

Who then would have the knowledge of the Doctor's past who could help him remember?  The only person I can think of that would have that knowledge, and be brilliant enough to use it would be Rose's Doctor in the other universe.  Even though he is (mostly) human, he still retains all the knowledge of the timelords and the memories of the Doctor before he met Amy Pond.  And we've seen since he was left with Rose that it is still possible for travel between universes.

So, here's my theory.  River is living inside a planet sized computer and we know River has extensive technical abilities.  She was put into that computer before the Doctor started losing his memories, so maybe she's also aware of his past, but doesn't know the details as well as Rose's Doctor.  

The alternate Doctor gets in touch with River in the library computer and between her and him they seed time with ""Clara"" who I think is possibly a construct of the flesh and the Clara avatar is being controlled by River and/or Kal.  We already know that connection to a flesh avatar can be maintained through time and space because they did that to Amy.  

It might also explain how the Dalek's in the Asylum could not convert her, if her mind was really in the big planet computer.

1. Structural issues with the Eurozone.

2. Internally uncompetitive economies that have struggled along on boom time without reforming.

Leaving the EU doesn't fix either of these points. Despite the dreaming of Farage and co trade is still bound primarily by transportation. In the coming decades the world is going to get bigger as oil prices continue to rise. We'll do more trade with the EU 25 years from now. It is reasonable to believe globalisation has peaked and will remain peaked until the energy crisis is resolved. The basic assumptions for transport in a $90 (going on $190) oil market are very different to that of a $30 oil market.

Like it or not we are fundamentally tied to the EU for trade in the foreseeable future. At least this side of fusion. The question then becomes how we can fix the Eurozone or internal structural weaknesses by leaving the EU?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I guess this is where we differ a bit here. I know times have changed, etc., and that's fine but it used to be the case that you had to take a punt on something, having perhaps read reviews or spoken to people who liked it. There wasn't really a ""try before you buy"" option, so I think that those people creating content would be more likely to get paid. I've no figures to back that up, it just seems to make sense to me. That said, I'm not a gamer but I think it applies to all media, really.



I don't always trust reviews, afterall it's just another persons opinion and we all have different tastes. TO address your other point, they should be paid on merit, not by tricking people into buying their games. With false advertising (showing stuff that isn't ingame footage)

&gt;Makes perfect sense to me. There are so many ways for small bands to get their music out there these days, without needing to get signed or have the huge overheads associated with cutting an album, that I think this is definitely the way forward. It pisses me off when people pirate this kind of stuff, I admit but it's obviously going to happen. On the one hand it's exposure for the band, which is great but on the other, if they've paid a couple of grand for a CD pressing they're going to have a harder time recouping that money, which in turn affects their ability to tour, hire rehearsal space and so on.

Yeah pretty much.

&gt;You shouldn't, although I fail to see how a film's takings are relevant? Is it a case of ""they're 'rich enough'"" in your eyes, so they should therefore give you their product for free? Don't really get that, if so.

I'm not that deluded/entitled,  I don't expect things for free. But things are getting really expensive, it'd rumoured that PS4/XBOX720 games will cost upwards of £50 when they're first released.

How can people on minimum wage afford that? You shouldn't be forced to choose between food/entertainment.

&gt;I wasn't actually saying that I care that you torrent films etc, if the ""die hard militant"" thing was about me; I just like going to the cinema sometimes and don't think that sitting in front the TV is really comparable, no matter how many home comforts you have there. As far as I'm concerned, in buying a ticket I'm paying for the big screen ""experience"", if you like. Cinemas aren't free to run. They're businesses that exist to make money, with staff and overheads, that I occasionally support. If I didn't want to, I wouldn't go.

It was at ^^^satanspanties haha. Fair enough, you enjoy the cinema, it's your money. I've just had my experience ruined too many times by careless individuals who talk and rustle etc

And they should change with the times, people are stopping going because it's too expensive. So they should do something about it if they want to keep running.


&gt;I'm not going to start on you about the whole ""I'm not having my wallet raped by massive corporations"" thing, much as I could, as I think that's a pretty common attitude in teenagers these days but it always makes me chuckle a bit...


Well it's fairly simple, things are expensive and wages haven't increased to balance it out. Back in the eighties or whatever, wages were lower and stuff was cheap.

Also, Barkley is one or two years away from starting material in my opinion. While it would not be ideal for him to start next year, he should start seeing time as a substitute and in cup matches. He is not far off.

Assuming we get 15 for Felli and spend 10 on the aforementioned midfielder, hopefully we would spend the remaining 5 on some more young talent. The team is shaping up to be strong in a couple of years with the likes of Barkley, Oviedo, Stones, and Coleman. Another strong youngster can put us over the top in a couple of years.

TL;DR We need a creative midfielder who can unlock defenses and investment in youth.",0,1367932715,null,0,false,0,c9u2n5s,t3_1duwvv,t1_c9u2n5s,t3_1duwvv,null,1431274671,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

The last time there was a report on so-called white flight around London the conclusion was that it was more to do with housing policy than anything else. The 'native population'  living in London boroughs - particularly East London, had benefited from right-to-buy schemes that meant they got a foot on the property ladder and were able to trade-up. This meant moving to more pleasant areas in Kent and Essex.

So the areas that they moved out of got filled in with incoming immigrant communities because they were comparatively cheap with available housing.

All Scottish council are elected by STV. There are many independent councillors. So you are wrong.

What should matter is untangling this mess that was created by everyone's ancestors, because both sides feel like they aren't treated fairly.

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"This is a huge shout, and I disagree strongly with it. To say the modern midfielder needs to be a jack of all trades is untrue. If anything, the way we play has a clearly defined system that has clearly defined roles for each player. I'm not in anyway comparing us with barca but that is the model on which our philosophy isbasef and every player has a clear job to do. Yes they have to be versatile but a jack of all trades massively undermines the holding position. I've played in it for 15 years it is a very specific role. 

EDIT: Sorry I just want to further this point because it's one I feel strongly about

Defensive mid is also such a loose term. I prefer holding midfielder because the role is based on building. The role changes from breaking up play to collecting the ball from the defense to build attacks depending on which way the midfield trio is flipped - usually its a combo of the two. It's an EXTREMELY specific role- get the ball, play it simple...The best player I've ever played with in that role didn't cover more than 40 Square meters of the pitch and did exactly what was required. Look at Alonso, he sits he passes, he sits, he passes...obviously his passing range is huge compared to these lads but that is what's required. We absolutely are not in need of someone who can run with the ball or 'hold it up' (although this is something a center forward would do, not a holding midfielder) 

Look at Stevie, he's the closest thing to a complete midfielder you will ever see realistically, but he never excels in that role..why? because his decision making isn't good enough - it's as simple as that. Scholes (Obligatory SCUM reference)  is the best example I can think of to be honest, or even Carrick this season. Carricks not quick, not a huge tackler but his decision making as much as I hate to admit it is sensational. 

This is particularly relevant to the way we play. Everyone has a VERY specific role. We don't need a box to box midfielder (Although we have one but he is a master of all trades not a jack ;)) and we don't need complete midfielders in any way shape of form. We need everyone to do there job and that makes us tick.

Lucas, not coutinho, was our biggest asset against Newcastle. He got  the ball and he gave it, then he did it over and over and over. At the same time he policed that hole just in front of our defence to perfection. 

Sorry for the essay. I love Wanyama and would be delighted if we got him but  to say he is better than Lucas in every way is a massive overstatement - not only this but it undermines the focus of the holding mid to want a jack of all trades to occupy it.  Wait till Lucas puts his weight back on over summer and judge him again next year.

Right now there is a clear cut reasoning why the European market is the most important by far. It is the cheapest in terms of transport. We already have common foreign policy goals with all the members (i.e. France will never cut us off over the Falklands while Brazil might). We already are standardised in practice. There is also good reason to believe it will get more important as transportation gets ever more expensive.

People who want to argue for the out case need to present what the alternative to the EU is and how they are going to mitigate the problem of energy prices endlessly increasing.

Sovereignty is unconvincing because it is talking about a specious principle rather than a hard fact. When sovereignty puts bread on the table I'll care for it. I don't care about sovereignty for sovereignties sake.

&gt; How do you know that transport trumps everything else?

The fact that most of our trade has been with the EU. That globalisation only took off with the sudden surge of cheap oil in the 90s. That globalisation has actually struggled since oil prices went up. China have been looking towards internal consumption more and more because their external exports have not been growing as they would like. When it comes down to it one nation is as good as another. The only real factors are distance and development levels. The distance, in terms of energy, is getting larger while the development gap is getting smaller.

&gt; How do you know energy prices will be endlessly increasing?

Scientific fact. Oil is limited and we aren't finding any more easy oil. Most of the remaining oil is difficult to extract.

&gt; What are these common policy goals? the EU can't agree on anything important when it comes to foreign policy.

Agreement on the basic principles of democracy, liberty and capitalism. France are never going to boycott the UK on a matter of ethical principle. Whereas it is entirely likely we'll butt heads with China over disagreements of what amounts to civilised behaviour. The truth is in the grand scale of things France and the UK are almost indistinguishable.

&gt; Do you think France would take Argentina's side in the case of another Falkland's conflict?

No they won't. Britain is both closer to them in world view and geographical location. Opposing the UK is as dangerous for France and it is for the UK and that is a core principle behind the EU. Also there is the fact France has similar territories. Supporting the UK is in its own best interests. Finally France believes strongly in establish law and acting in a legal manner. The last EU treaty firmly establishes the Falklands as British. France would be undermining a very basic principle of theirs to oppose British interests in the Falklands.",0,1367937742,null,0,false,0,c9u3znv,t3_1duoxd,t1_c9u3znv,t1_c9u3hqx,null,1431273966,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Not sure if subtitles exist, but for an example I would suggest having a look at [Boris](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_%28serie_televisiva%29) for an intelligent sitcom. The premise is brilliant since it's taking the piss out of the squalor and shame of Italian television, in a way that sets it out very nicely and explains how that culture of intellectualism gets gobbled up by the public need for crap (definitely not something unique to Italy).

As for satire, which I think is fantastic in the UK, they have something interesting called [Blob](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blob_%28programma_televisivo%29). Silly name, but I haven't seen anything like it before. Every day they put together a montage of footage, mainly recent goings-on about Italy, and manage to put a spin on it with absolutely no commentary save for perhaps one word in the corner of the screen. For instance, an obvious example would be a juxtaposition between news footage of the Italian government's reaction to the recent revolution in Libya and a few shots of Berlusconi kissing Gaddafi's hand, no jokes or cynical narrative, they just show you what's there and let you think (come to think of it, the best shows do this, Civilisation springs to mind...)

i've not been on this website for very long, but i detect across all subreddits an almost *pathological* need to look at *everything* from a left of center perspective which severely inhibits discussion, you can look at the worst aspects of any group an ridicule them to strengthen your position across all sides of the political spectrum.. 

this is purely speculation but i suspect most of you are under 30 years of age, from a middle class background, lived in a ""shire"" area an moved to a big city to attend a university... of course you're going to be derisive of people who are against high immigration, its never affected you in bumbleshire in your mum an dads detached house. And any contact you do have with immigrants its affluent middle class ones like your family or students. The Nigerian and Pakistani and Somalian immigrants we've accepted make our chavs look fucking cuddly by comparison, the heroin an cocaine market in Britain is 100% controlled by the aforementioned groups of people, (and they took it over very very quickly, early 2000's)

i *dare* one of you to go to ANY street in newham an display anything resembling patriotism. you'l feel uncomfortable at best. 

i would welcome further discussion of this issue.

Politicians claiming that they have changed loan repayments to help poor people are just playing political games, or showing total economic illiteracy.""

The high repayment threshold is the main reason I supported the scheme, because despite the higher fees it creates a repayment system which is much more progressive then the one I’m on.

I pay 9% on everything over about £16k; I think the current system is 11% on everything above £21k. I’d be repaying at half the rate I currently am, and that *would* have made a difference at how long it took me to afford a deposit on a house (or, how long I had to live with my parents to afford a deposit on a house ¬¬). Where's the advantage in increasing the debt burden university-leavers have to carry?

I like the current system because it's essentially a graduate tax; you can take it out in full knowledge you may never repay it. You could do a degree in a low-paying area, like social work, or leave university with a degree and go work for charities, never needing to worry about the cost too much. You could learn for the sake of learning alone, if you wanted too.

Keeping the threshold high also helps out poorer graduates by transferring the burden to the high-paid graduates. If there is a ‘much better way’ of helping the less well-off afford higher education, I’d love to hear it. The most of the major universities have already failed to recruit sufficient bursary students to justify their upper-limit fees.

1. Huge amount of development of Clara's character without bashing it over your head saying ""HEY THIS EPISODE IS DEVELOPING CLARA'S CHARACTER"". We've seen her good, we've seen her bad, we've seen fears, hopes, and everything in between. We (and the Doctor) are learning about who she is through how she gets through all of these situations being thrown at her. Look at how she reacted in Cold War to seeing those dead bodies, or how she feels about ghosts in Hide, or how she'll openly be violent to the Doctor and call him out on his shit in Journey. And Clara's dialogue and interactions with the Doctor has been the most fun I've had in a companion since, well, Donna.  
  
2. The reduction of the sonic screwdriver to being only a tool and not a magic wand. How many times has the sonic saved the day since the Ponds left? I'll give you a hint: zero. A laptop and a domehead and quick thinking saves in Bells. A leaf saves the day in Rings. The power of persuasion in Cold War. An amplified psychic and an insistent companion in Hide. A big friendly button in Journey. Jenny, Vastra, and Strax are about 100% the reason why The Crimson Horror was prevented.  
  
3. The nods to Classic Who. RTD's era vaguely acknowledges the classic era, returning enemies not withstanding. But 7B has been chock full of callbacks to how far the Doctor has really come. He references his granddaughter, fights old forgotten enemies, uses items from Classic planets, references old companions like Tegan.  
  
Has the writing been suspect? It depends on the person watching. My only problem thus far has been the ending to Rings, but I understand where they were going and respect it.

true,ninj3,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"I am British from an immigrant family, and a young academic at university from a middle class background to boot.

As you might expect, I usually dismiss anti-immigration policy as utter bullocks. In my line of work and amongst my friends and families, we don't see (new) immigrants as a threat, but rather as highly respected competition. When immigrants come into research and technology, they bring a lot of expertise to the table that can't be found in the UK. That's why I am pro-immigration for skilled workers.

However, you make a really excellent point that the same thing cannot be said for unskilled/low-skilled work. I can understand it must be so frustrating to see your jobs taken by people who are, perhaps no more hard-working than yourself, and no more skilled at the job than yourself, but just willing to work for much less and live at a lower standard because they come from a place where they are used to it.

A capitalist would say, hard luck, this is competition at work and you gotta compete to win. I don't agree with that. I am a socialist and I think it's terrible that hard working people can't get jobs with a decent wage.

So I am torn here. I am pro-immigration because I think we need the skills and knowledge that immigrants can bring to our country if we are to progress technologically and economically.

I am anti-immigration because I don't want our low-skilled labour market to be flooded with poor people (both immigrants and Brits) who work for shit pay because they have to.

My personal preference for how to solve this problem is neither fast nor easy:

British people can't compete in the unskilled labour market. No way. So hard working Brits like yourself need to be trained up so they don't have to compete there any more. We need to convert our home grown workforce to skilled labour. That can only be done through better education and better opportunities for kids from poor, unskilled backgrounds.

But most of all it needs a cultural change from the public to appreciate that rather than complaining and isolating ourselves from foreigners, we need to improve ourselves and change the jobs we do so that we can compete in things we *are* good at.

Stop making it cool to skip school and hang around the park for a fag and a drink. Stop making it OK to pick the easiest subjects and just get by. Stop making it uncool to excel academically and put studies first. Stop making it fine to spend our time complaining at the pub rather than voting. Stop making it acceptable to hope for a sudden, easy way to the fame and riches with the lottery, or x-factor, or reality bullshit shows rather than bettering ourselves bit by bit.

If we can't solve this problem properly, with real long-term cultural change rather than blaming everything on outsiders, then even if we shut out all the foreigners or kick out all the immigrants like myself, it's just going to mean a long and lonely fall to stagnation and the UK will be irrelevant as a country in this increasingly connected world.",0,1367941594,null,0,false,0,c9u586i,t3_1dut3m,t1_c9u586i,t1_c9u45c1,null,1431273383,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,DeathByCocktail,,Rye Manhattan,"&gt;But things are getting really expensive, it'd rumoured that PS4/XBOX720 games will cost upwards of £50 when they're first released.

See, I do see where you're coming from with that- I guess that, to mind my though, I'm just not going to buy an expensive console with expensive games if I can't afford to, since it's not something I need. So to me, at least, saying
&gt; You shouldn't be forced to choose between food/entertainment.

Is a bit redundant, since you're never ""forced"" to be entertained by buying the latest piece of tech. It's just a toy that absolutely nobody ""needs"" in their life.

&gt;Back in the eighties or whatever, wages were lower and stuff was cheap. Now look at how expensive everything is and how teenagers earn less than your age group. People under 21 earn less then everyone else, then people under 18 earn even less.

Sure- I earned just around £3 as a postman in the 90s but yes, a lot of things were cheaper (though don't even think about music though- a lot of CDs were up to about £15 at one point...) Younger workers earned less back then, too- remember that there was no minimum wage. I think a lot of it comes down to marketing and expectation. I was an 80s kid and an avid reader. That said, I also got a C64 in the late 80s, and I'd save my money to buy magazines and games- which were, I admit, only a few quid each for the most part. I wasn't, however, constantly bombarded by adverts telling me how amazing the latest game/app/iphone or whatever was. Around Christmas time, sure, the ads would start but that was about it, really. 

It does feel a bit like if you were young back then, you just had to be patient (or swap with friends, or make physical pirate copies on tapes/floppies if you knew someone who had a game you wanted), whereas today (and I'm not talking about you here, btw, I just mean in general) there's a certain degree of instant gratification expected and that leads to that word again- entitlement. I hate the word and the way it's been so overused in the last couple of years but I do think it's suitable at times.

I think the real difference was that kids weren't really perceived as an exploitable market back then- I don't think that really took off until the late 90s. I'm not harking back and saying that everything was better back then, by any means, just that it was different and I preferred it in a lot of ways. Nor am I saying that ""the corporations"" are at all blameless but I do think that a lot of you young'uns  ^heh need to stop and ask *why* you feel the need to be entertained in this way so much. You've grown up in the world of the internet, being aggressively marketed at. I'd be more pissed off at the companies who have done that and made you feel that your ""wants"" have become ""needs"", if I were you.",0,1367941661,null,0,false,0,c9u58zi,t3_1duvc4,t1_c9u58zi,t1_c9u2j7c,null,1431273374,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

First of all, we're the most likely winners as our form right now is crazy good. 

I'm imagining Ramires-Luiz in the pivot with JT returning to CB and Ramires' pace used to track Bale and shut him down. 

Speaking of Bale I've seen him move out to the right recently, but assuming we start Ash they'll focus him on the left as the right's our weaker side. Thus Ramires' involvement and chasing will be really fucking important. We might play Iva on the right against Bale as he's more physical than Dave, with Ramires making up for the pace we lose from switching out Dave.

I'm not sure if Dembele will start, he took a pretty bad knock. That weakens their offense a lot. 

I'd love to see Romeu come off the bench at some point, maybe 60-70 minutes in? 

Hopeful lineup:

Cech

Iva-Cahill-JT-Cole

Ramires-Luiz

Mata-Oscar-Hazard

I was thinking that would turn out to be the case too, and that her know-it-all-ness was due to her being uploaded to the Internet, or whatever it was that happened there. But still, though, I can't help but feel that it's a bit of a show-stealer for her to *constantly* and *consistently* out-do the Doctor. It's one thing for her to be the occasional big help, or occasionally save the day. But throwing all these things back to back, in show after show, it gets old really fast.

It's true that it would be hard to replace the Ponds... though, it was hard to replace Rose, too, and we all got over that. I think part of the reason Martha doesn't get as much fan love as she deserves is because she came after Rose. But trying too hard to make something or someone seem cool is doomed to fail... I don't mind Clara's boldness, or cleverness, or flirtiness... I think the Doctor needs someone who can put him in his place sometimes. That's why I liked Donna so much. I just mind that it feels like the show is waving it around and rubbing it in our faces, that's all.

You could do a degree in a low-paying area, like social work, or leave university with a degree and go work for charities, never needing to worry about the cost too much.

That's a great deal for you; it's not such a great deal for the taxpayers who have paid for your education.

University funding doesn't just appear out of thin air.  Universities have to be paid for.  If you're not paying for your degree, someone else is paying for you.  

Also, the length of time you have to wait to put a deposit on a house is none of the taxpayer's concern.  Many of the people paying for your degree cannot afford to buy a house of their own.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"""ok"" is a word which could mean several things.

If I seek to work purely through an philosophical ethical model then I would have to say that all are *moral*, in most circumstances at least. Then again from an ethical perspective I can't justify a reason to prevent people from having ""no blacks"" or ""no homos"" signs up on their shop doors. Liberty should be maximised, afterall.

Do I think they're *ok*? No, or at least not all of them.

In general I'm of the personal belief that to discriminate against someone for a factor they do not have control over is undesirable. That said, we're forced by the universe and nature to do this all the time, do you give a 75 year old a job down a mine or on a building site? No of course you almost certainly don't. That's discrimination and there's a reason people discriminate in certain cases.

However to, for instance, not choose to make friends with an otherwise awesome person because they happen to be ethnically asian is stupid. They had no control over their genes, their genes don't inherently make them a dick, so it's illogical discrimination. A very stupid thing, and also rather mean.

That said, maternity, pregnancy, marriage, and religion are all things which we have personal control over. Debatably ""gender"" in the sense it's used here also is, although that's probably not a debate worth getting into, since we're not lacking clear cut examples.

true,Das_Mime,null,null,"&gt;America was founded by several cultures simultaneously. Unless you're arguing for having Saxon, Celtic and Norse on road signs that isn't a particularly applicable comparison.

It wasn't at all simultaneous. Ben Franklin had the following to say about German immigrants:

&gt;""Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation…and as few of the English understand the German Language, and so cannot address them either from the Press or Pulpit, ’tis almost impossible to remove any prejudices they once entertain…Not being used to Liberty, they know not how to make a modest use of it…I remember when they modestly declined intermeddling in our Elections, but now they come in droves, and carry all before them, except in one or two Counties...In short unless the stream of their importation could be turned from this to other colonies, as you very judiciously propose, they will soon so out number us, that all the advantages we have will not in My Opinion be able to preserve our language, and even our Government will become precarious.""

Germans were one of the larger ethnic groups in the US for a long time, and in fact there were many regions of Pennsylvania, the Upper Midwest, and elsewhere where German and English were spoken side by side; this only ended during WWI when bigotry against Germans increased to a fever pitch. Later waves of immigrants included the Irish in the mid-late 1800s, Italians in the late 1800s and early 1900s, followed by Eastern Europeans, Poles, Jews; can't forget the Chinese and Japanese immigration to the West Coast starting in the mid-1800s. Every single ethnic group has faced the same claims that they are ruining the country, that they'll never integrate, and so on.

&gt;But seriously, I don't think people here have a problem with seeing Chinese on road signs in Chinatowns. The Chinese have integrated fairly admirably, it's just a certain other culture that hasn't been so harmonious.

Chinese have been immigrating to Britain for about two centuries. I can 100% guarantee you that if you go back to the mid-1800s or so, you can find innumerable quotes from British people bemoaning the Chinese immigrants, how they were ruining the neighborhood, how they'd never integrate, etc. For a country as venerable as England, people seem to have quite little historical perspective.",0,1367942696,null,0,false,0,c9u5lii,t3_1dsewh,t1_c9u5lii,t1_c9u0olr,null,1431273208,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The way to keep track is look at the Chest plate. If it doesn't have a Cybus C on the chest plate then it's not supposed to be from Pete's world

The reason they reused the Cybus design was because the Cybermen of Classic times would look much too silly compared to the production levels set by the new who age. They didn't have the money to make a whole new cyberman design, and did not have the point where they could properly explain why there was a completely new design of cyberman without having to devote a full story to reintroduce the Mondasian Cybermen, and simultaneously explain their upgrades, why they were missing for so long, and still keep the plot going.

So they went with a slightly modified Cybus Cyberman design and slowly reintroduced the Mondasian Cybermen (Again I'm pretty sure not outright, just implied it) with The Pandorica Opens, A Good Man Goes to War, and Closing Time. Most new fans still won't notice these Cybermen are mean't to be our universes versions, and their backstory, and that's fine. I just hope Gaiman throws in a line or two on their origins (i.e. the Doctor explaining to Clara briefly about the Tenth Planet, maybe even throw in a little joke about how they helped cause his first regeneration) Just so the longtime audience is clear this is Mondasians and not just Cybermen that happen to exist, but with no full background or something

But on the other hand, don't you think it is unfair on the students who chose their subject carefully because they know what job they want to do in the future?

For example, a student wants to become a civil engineer. He wants to design and build the bridges and building of the future. But not just the pretty ones. He wants to design hydroelectric dams and tidal turbines to power our homes, he wants to design flood barriers to defend our lands, he wants to design coastal defences to slow the erosion of our coastline.

To do this, he has to study engineering at university or he has no chance of ever joining a civil engineering firm. Not just that, he has to do a 4 years Masters course, specialising in civil engineering and takes out a massive loan to cover the huge tuition and living costs.

If he works hard and succeeds, he will probably eventually get to a salary where he has to pay back a lot in fees. Fair enough, he is now a great example a contributor to society (I don't think anyone would argue that he doesn't deserve his pay for doing the aforementioned tasks, unlike certain financial sector workers ¬¬) and it's time he pay back what he owes.

Contrast that with a lazy, under-achieving sap, who somehow bumbles his way to getting the minimum grade for some doss subject at university (I won't give an example for fear of offending someone *coughlassics*). He completes his 3 years, then goes off into some completely unrelated area, where a university degree has no benefit. He never has to repay his loan.

Essentially what we have here is the Engineer and all the other taxpayers in the country paying for this guy's journey through university; and society is getting no added benefit from this expense.

I would argue that this is unfair, and that, given how we obviously have limited money to spend on sending people to university, it is silly and inefficient to spend the money on people who will not use their education to full effect and pay back its value in money or social benefit.

true,RassimoFlom,null,null,"For me, the child bearing thing is a moral dilemma. Many women don't want kids. And many men would (hopefully) want to spend time rearing their children. Finally, without kids our society starts falling apart. And child rearing is (IMO) 1) a legitimate and important job and 2) vital for the wellbeing of our nation. But again, being totally honest, I might discriminate on that basis, as a full time parent might not meet my needs as an employer as well as someone who will never have kids might (although how one proves one is never going to have children is also a tough one).

In terms of not hiring the 75 year old, I put the proviso in my question ""if they are able to do the work to the same level as other applicants."" So if it was a choice between a black miner and white miner with equal experience and qualifications and the employer chose the white person on the basis that he was white, well, that would be wrong to me.

Obviously, these laws are unenforceable, but the fact that they exist is something positive, for me at least.

true,thashicray,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"With movements like the EDL it is clear that no one is excempt from criticism, the prevalence of 'the Muslim patrol' and the discovery of certain paedophile rings around Britain which are run by Pakistani's living here is bound to bring some racist backlash. However, the EDL has benefited in my point of view from the crackdown on football hooliganism, it seems that those who were once fighting in pubs and on the terraces are now looking for a similar ruck by joining the EDL.

I would also like to think that perhaps, rather than sitting on the fence those who hold a strong opinion against certain religious groups or people whom they see as being a threat to British society should definitely be allowed to have some form of catharsis. NOT THE EDL. Constructive crticism and debate are some ways of doing it. I'm not quite sure how to word this because I have given it some thinking and the kind of people you won't get on this subreddit are those who rarely voice their underlying racist and xenophobic opinions. But what needs to be respected is that there are people out there who live very minimalist existances and they are very succeptable to groups like the BNP and the EDL and they need to be catered for and not just have hate thrown their way. That is what they like, ""look at the illegal immigrant loving lefties!"" Is one of their favourite catchphrases. But on the same note fundamentalist Islamic sects should be treated exactly the same as the aforementioned predominantly white working class groups.

As you can see I do live in a shire and have certainly noticed this undercurrent of hate among some of my peers who only feel comfortable to silently voice it when they're drunk. People need to be a bit more educated on the subject rather than (to quote someone the other day, a philosophy student no less) ""he only got that lecturing gig because he was black."" 

As for Islam I don't tolerate many religions, especially those whose zealots shout the loudest reasonating throughout the media who then subsequently benefit by writing another bigoted peice of red top schlock. But I have noticed with those people who see it as trendy to jump on the atheist bandwagon they are all too comfortable to criticise Judaism and Christianity but it just seems to me that when people engage in these discourses they have little knowledge about certain religions like Islam or they are so inwardly stereotypical with people of that creed that they believe them all to be suicide bombers, which is immoral.

This is just my humble opinion and I doubt I'll be taken seriously but my initial hypothesis would be providing those who aren't too far gone into being fascistic bully boys with a bit more info rather than ""you tolerate or you're a racist pig"" because it seems like where I'm standing, those people who aren't like the above commentors on this thread, and aren't as well informed would need some guidance and not hate rags like the daily mail catering for their every step. As far as the Muslim brotherhood goes and imposing sharia on Britain thats a definite no on my part and I have had some perfectly cordial relationships with muslim students, though I have experienced violent altercations because I am not part of that religion. But having lived in Walthamstow I can't begin to think how you would integrate these communities into society, or maybe I'm just too Pat Condell.

Before, people were complaining that Moffat's stories were too over-arching and that there were not enough single stories and people complained about how every single episode had a connection to the bigger plot and maybe inaccesible to new viewers. Granted, some people loved them, and even I loved them but this time, Moffat is taking it easier and giving us various different genres to watch. DW has been around for 50 years. I can imagine finding a story is hard what with there being hundreds of books and episode. So to get single episodes like this without draining their thinking caps and overusing ideas is great. And adding a very, very soft mystery is just nice. 

But then again, perhaps this is just Moffat's way of making people lower expectations before the finale and the 50th Anniversary special. I think there's something big going on and if we know Moffat, its going to be mindblowing.

In regards about the kids, IMHO, the writers just wanted to have fun. In recent years, DW has become very serious, more than it should. I think this season is the season where Moffat captures back what DW essentially is, a fun show that has serious moments and also funny moment and also WTF moments (as seen in Angels of Manhattan). And also, a show that changes companion constantly (like the change from Amy and Rory to Clara). 

Overall, in the 50th anniversary of DW, Moffat wanted to capture the spirit of DW and take it easy and perhaps, make it explosive for the finale and the 50th special.

My problem is that each degree is funded equally. I'm not all for the STEM circlejerk but from an economic point of view it makes sense. The government complain about a lack of STEM graduates but to nothing to incentivise them going to uni. The government should subsidise fees based on how much we need the subject. e.g. arts courses still cost £9k, but STEM courses cost £3k etc.

Another STEM related discrepancy is how the government always complain about a lack of maths graduates going into teaching. £22k is way below the market rate for a maths graduate, where as it's above market rate for a lot of other types.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; A flat tax rate is incredibly far right

I would agree it's ""right"".  But you need to recalibrate what you think of as ""far right"".

&gt; It means the worse off pay more tax than they currently do

No it doesn't.  The large allowance means it lifts the worst off out of tax altogether.  The large allowance means that for a great many earning above the allowance, you can still be paying less.  If anyone is hurt under their flat tax + allowance system it is the middle, not the worst off.

Flat tax is nowhere near the disaster that the left-leaning think when it is combined with a high allowance.  If you plot (and I have) the tax paid under a flat-tax plus allowance and a progressive system against gross income, there isn't much difference in shape.  That means that you get a simpler system and you just tune the two parameters as politics dictates.  Now, if you want to argue that they've picked those parameters incorrectly, I can get on board -- they are too favorable once you get above £200,000 earners.  That is nothing to do with a flat tax system though -- it is parameter selection.  (Although one might argue that people on that sort of money don't pay income tax anyway, you are in loop hole territory, which a flat tax helps with).

I didn't notice any tax cuts.  Flat tax isn't a cut, or certainly doesn't have to be.  And the NI changes are just change to method, so total revenue should be the same.

As for balancing -- I believe their budget does balance; it was done (originally) mainly by http://markwadsworth.blogspot.co.uk, who obsesses over this stuff.

1. I wanted to get as much Classic Who in the banner as possible, seeing as this subreddit isn't just celebrating the past few weeks of Who. You'll see that I did the same thing for the Ice Warriors as well.

2. If neither Vastra or Strax was up there, it would just be Mr. Sweet, and he's just a tiny little guy. Not a very impressive addition to the banner.

There is also the wider issue of the middle classes using Universities as a rite-of-passage or soft landing for progressing their children to adulthood, regardless of if they actually intend to learn anything.

I guess it comes down to weather you believe that higher education should serve as pragmatic vocation training (science/engineering/medicine/law), or that it should have a more idealistic 'open to all' and 'learning for the sake of learning' basis (english/art/philosophy).

The point's been raised in local media each time the club looks at the stadium issue.

&gt;Ruth Little, of the Anfield and Breckfield community council, says: ""After people suffered so much, from the football club and Your Housing leaving properties empty and blighting the area, when they went back to the original plan I did wonder what the last 12 years of consultation have been for.

The consultation over the last 12 years was to get the viewpoint of those who are still resisting and to try and find a solution. A new set of owners came in, saw the results of that consultation and decided to go back to the original plan because it's apparently more cost effective and/or will address the concerns that the consultation brought to light.

It is a non-story. They tried to expand to compete, they bought out private owners, others resisted, they consulted with residents, chose a course of action and now people are still complaining. If people keep complaining no matter the proposal, no wonder nothing is being done.

It's not a new issue, it's not been kept hidden (and if it is, it's been the worst kept secret in the city) and the article brings nothing new to the table in terms of details.

In the first I did vote, before I had really got a grasp of the way the electoral system worked, following that I have spoiled my ballot on a couple of occasions, did some ""vote Labour for more of the same Tory shite"" anarchist sticker/poster/leafteting, voted for a minor candidate when it looked as though she was in with a chance of not losing her deposit, but otherwise simply stayed away altogether more recently, whilst making sure that I am on the electoral roll.

I have always lived in solidly safe seats, so my vote actually means nothing. The last time there was a change of party in my current location, for example, was in 1906, two constituency boundary changes back. I have lived in a constituency where the Tory MP was caught shagging someone he shouldn't – contributing to the sleaze and eventual defeat of that government, but his majority in the constituency only dropped by 10,000, so he himself still comfortably kept his seat.

The only circumstances under which my vote could actually make a difference would be if there was such an overwhelming landslide nationally that previously safe seats would become marginal, but by then one more or less MP itself would be irrelevant. Otherwise, it is only those people who live in marginal seats whose votes make any difference under the current system.

The only other way that I can register anything at all effective, is by staying away, and so reducing the mandate that those elected have. Low turnout is a recognised issue, but it will need to be much lower still before any kind of effective electoral reform actually happens as a result.

As far as local elections go, and excluding the recent police commissioners farce, my situation has been depressingly similar, but at least there is more of a chance to influence the individual councillors otherwise, so actually voting for or against them can occasionally make a difference and I sometimes have, on one occasion going as far as second the nomination of a candidate.

Overall, though, there are only perhaps two or three people, who I know well, who I would actually trust to buy me an acceptable pair of socks for my next birthday, let alone represent my views on an effectively infinite range of issues for a period of 4-5 years, and I have yet to find a single candidate with an even remotely realistic chance of getting elected whom I actually think might represent them in even the broadest sense.

Should you think, in response to this: ""well you should stand yourself”, the problem is reversed. I could no more represent the views of everyone else in any constituency than they could mine.

**TL/DR:** There is little point without electoral reform.
