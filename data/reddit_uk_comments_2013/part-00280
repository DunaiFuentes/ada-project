&gt;How is it fair that if an accident is caused by a cyclist, the motorist must pay half of the costs?

If a cyclist caused an accident unintentualy (ie didn't run a red for example) then yes. The costs are equal among each party. Makes sense as the cyclists mistake is no doubt been made 10-100x worse by a car being there. 

Here's why it's a better system...

It places the responsibility on the one introducing the danger. A cyclist offers no real danger towards cars, a car on the other hand is a very differnt matter.

If the roads where not public spaces, that where not to be shared I'd agree the rules wouldn't be fair. But the roads are public, used by cyclists and pedestrians, and assuming they should be held accountable in the same way as 1 ton plus of speeding metal is madness (really, just think about that)

A form of Strict liability on the road exists already for drivers who collide with the car infront. And strict liability is in common practice for shop, business owners already too. 

Also. While you're worried about the injustess of it all. The insurance companes have very little problem with it. It has one additional benifit in that it will speed up the process of compensation by potentially months. Me with my damaged bike (beyond repair) will get a new bike quickly without a drawn out negotiation, meaning I can get on with things. While no doubt the car that hit me will have nothing more than a damaged door panel to worry about.

And finally, it benifits everyone. As a pedestrian you will have additional protection.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;If a cyclist caused an accident unintentualy (ie didn't run a red for example) then yes. The costs are equal among each party. Makes sense as the cyclists mistake is no doubt been made 10-100x worse by a car being there. 

No, any cyclist error is half liable to the driver. Only actual *intent* to cause a collision would negate responsibility for the motorist.

Please take a look at this: http://bicycledutch.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/strict-liability.jpg

&gt;It places the responsibility on the one introducing the danger. A cyclist offers no real danger towards cars, a car on the other hand is a very differnt matter.

A car driving safely is not introducing danger. A cyclist's mistake is a cyclist's mistake.

&gt;If the roads where not public spaces, that where not to be shared I'd agree the rules wouldn't be fair. But the roads are public, used by cyclists and pedestrians, and assuming they should be held accountable in the same way as 1 ton plus of speeding metal is madness (really, just think about that)

Of course they should be equally accountable. It's utterly irrelevant what you're driving. If you make a mistake, you pay for it.

Just because you're driving a car, it doesn't mean a cyclist is more likely to make an error. That's asinine.

If a cyclist's error of judgement causes his bike to be damaged and my car to be scraped, why the hell should I be liable for any of it?

&gt;A form of Strict liability on the road exists already for drivers who collide with the car infront.

It's not the same though is it? If you can prove that the error was indeed the fault of the driver in front, you are not liable.

&gt;Also. While you're worried about the injustess of it all. The insurance companes have very little problem with it. It has one additional benifit in that it will speed up the process of compensation by potentially months. Me with my damaged bike (beyond repair) will get a new bike quickly without a drawn out negotiation, meaning I can get on with things. While no doubt the car that hit me will have nothing more than a damaged door panel to worry about.

I don't care whether the insurers mind. If they have to pay out on my policy, my premium will go up.

Why should I have to pay for someone else's mistake?

&gt;And finally, it benifits everyone. As a pedestrian you will have additional protection.

You're talking about something completely different from the ""porn filter"" here. This is an explicit ban by the courts. Yes, I agree. How about we talk about what the article was talking about instead?

&gt;  BT block access to sites that 'promote a lesbian and gay lifestyle' 

No they don't! They offer customers the facility to block this. The choice is down to the customer.

&gt; Only to avoid being forced by the government, who were always going around making threats of ""do this or we'll make a law"".

So there is no law. What is blocked is down to the ISPs! What the ISPs offer is what a lot of their customers want but the ISPs weren't providing.

&gt; Because censorship is bullshit. It will always hit unrelated sites. For that matter, it will hit sites offering help and advice, as it already has.

I wasn't arguing about that. I was questioning why blocking pro anorexia sites and pro suicide sites at the customer's request was such a terrible thing. Talk about a red herring. Yes! Blocking childline is bad. That goes without question. It does not follow that blocking sites promoting suicide are bad.

The censorship is parents censoring what their children can see. There are no moves to increase this to make it mandatory. There is no government directive on what should or shouldn't be blocked outside of some crude categories. 

&gt; I hope you realise reddit will probably be blocked by your precious censors.

Why will this affect me? I've opted out! Why do you think I like them? I just questioned the bias in the article! Rather than attack my points you attack me based on wild guesses about what my opinion is.

And is reddit blocked? Probably at the request of parents. There is no mandate for this to be the case.

A voluntary filter is introduced and rather than point out the flaws and the problems with this, we get hysterical ranting that a cursory analysis will show as being biased, misleading and horribly exaggerated.

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"I think we'll have to agree to disagree about other transport. I still think you can't compare across different modes because the weather affects all of them differently and they will have different ways to recover (with rail really being the weakest). 

&gt; Similarly, taxi drivers don't want to damage their vehicles, and will stop running in severe weather conditions,

Taxi drivers probably aren't subject to penalties for deciding not to run a service - unlike train companies.

&gt; and local bus companies hate the idea of buses trapped in town when they could be at the depot ready for when the weather recovers.

Does that happen? It's not like there are multiple roads all over the place. Unless the depot itself is blocked, the buses should be able to find some way back.

&gt; and any weather induced failure is more a result of the rail firms choosing (probably for economic reasons) to not prepare for normal weather.

This is mostly Network Rail's problem - since it is the rail lines that will be affected, and based on conditions they set the speed limits and whether trains are allowed to run at all. I don't think they haven't tried to do what they can, but there's only so much you can do to prepare for falling trees (which happen without warning, so you're going to get trains striking them) and flooded lines (I understand Exeter has flooded *again* and that's with Network Rail keeping a close eye on it and attempting to put some prevention measures in place - as well as lots of other obstacles across the network).",0,1387880814,null,0,1387880997,0,ce95qop,t3_1tjfdj,t1_ce95qop,t1_ce95ox2,null,1428004574,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

This guy totally looks like Harrison Ford.

Anyway, for the lazy:

&gt; In celebration of the 50th anniversary of BBC science fiction show Dr.Who, the Aberdeen Face Lab can, for the first time, reveal the 'real' face of The Doctor. 

&gt; Through the use of cutting edge face averaging software previously developed by Aberdeen scientists, post-doctoral researchers David Robertson and Robin Kramer have created an average face for The Doctor, using images from each of the Time Lord's incarnations.
&gt; Fans will be delighted to know that this average face was created using all of the thirteen known Doctors, including the 'War Doctor' played by John Hurt, as well as the latest actor to fill the role, Peter Capaldi.
&gt; This face average provides a remarkable insight into the true identify of the mysterious Time Lord. As you can see, the face is not dominated by the features of any one of the actors to have played The Doctor. Rather, the face represents a combination of the averaged features of each actor to have taken on the role

&gt; Current research at the Aberdeen Face Lab focuses on investigating the problem of within person variability in face recognition. David Robertson said, ""While The Doctor represents the extreme form of this line of research, in that he takes on an entirely new face after each regeneration, in the real world people do keep the same face but their face still varies considerably across their lifetime and in photographs. This variation can be caused by the natural ageing process and changes in expression, pose, lighting and hairstyle. Indeed, we have all heard the phrase 'your photo looks nothing like you!, and our research focuses on how we are able to recognise a person when we know that their face can vary considerable under different conditions'.

&gt; Dr. Kramer said, ""Research by our head of lab, Professor Mike Burton, and colleagues, has shown that we are excellent at recognising people that we are familiar with. For example, if I was to show you 30 photos of Tom Cruise taken over his 30 year acting career, it would be quite easy to recognise him in each of the photos, despite all of the changes in his appearance over that time. However, if you did the same thing with someone you were unfamiliar with, you could find it much harder to spot that all of the photos showed the same person""

&gt; Understanding how we are still able to recognise a person given how much they can vary and why we find this easier for familiar compared to unfamiliar faces is important in a number of real world situations in which face recognition is vital. For example, passport control officers have to match unfamiliar faces to their passport photos, while those who have witnessed a crime may have to identify an unfamiliar perpetrator from a police line up or a low resolution CCTV image.

&gt; As Peter Capaldi takes control of the TARDIS this Christmas for the first time, we at the Aberdeen Face Lab will continue to explore our ability to recognises faces across space and time.

true,blueskin,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;You're talking about something completely different from the ""porn filter"" here. This is an explicit ban by the courts. Yes, I agree. How about we talk about what the article was talking about instead?

Because it's using a censorship system for scope creep - the system it uses was originally only intended to block underage porn. the same scope creep will happen here.

&gt;No they don't! They offer customers the facility to block this. The choice is down to the customer.

No, they don't. If you turn their censorship on, it blocks those. Such things should not ever be censored anyway. You're giving abusive parents and partners the resources to prevent vulnerable people from getting the help and support they may need.

&gt;So there is no law. What is blocked is down to the ISPs! What the ISPs offer is what a lot of their customers want but the ISPs weren't providing.

Very few of their customers want this. Even most parents would rather be responsible and actually keep track of what their children do rather than let the government's censors parent for them. If people wanted ISP censorship, they could go with talktalk who have had this shit since 2011 with added Chinese spying as it's done by Huawei.

&gt;The censorship is parents censoring what their children can see. There are no moves to increase this to make it mandatory. There is no government directive on what should or shouldn't be blocked outside of some crude categories. 

Crude categories, yep. Therefore, false positives. Also false negatives, for that matter. Censorship is always crude.

&gt;Why will this affect me? I've opted out! Why do you think I like them?

Because you're defending this censorship.

&gt;A voluntary filter is introduced and rather than point out the flaws and the problems with this, we get hysterical ranting that a cursory analysis will show as being biased, misleading and horribly exaggerated. You accept this without any question. If the controls are increased, everyone just ignores the Chicken Littles, because they've heard the hysteria before and it was rubbish.

Have fun saying that when it's no longer possible to opt out.

Aston Villa are one of the founder members of the football league, and were considered one of the best sides in the early Eighties; winning the first division (The top division then) in 1981 then winning the European Cup and European Super Cup in 1982. 

The team nowadays is generally considered to be a bottom-half club, but I genuinely believe that the worst is over for us. We have a promising squad of young, hungry players with a lot of potential. This flies directly in the face of our old manager, Martin O'Neill's strategy of spending big on players. Currently in transition, Villa and Paul Lambert (Current manager) are trying to clear the books of high wages in preference for youngsters.

Our current best players (Although this is just my opinion) are Brad Guzan, Ron Vlaar, Fabian Delph, Ashley Westwood and Christian Benteke. However, after being one of our most sought-after players last season, Benteke hasn't had a great year so far. Some would speculate that it is because he doesn't want to play for us anymore, and others would just say that he is going through a lack of form. We could have sold him for a significant price last Summer, but Paul Lambert managed to convince him to stay. 

Some of our best players of all-time are: Olof Mellberg, Gordon Cowans, Paul McGrath, Dwight Yorke, Brian Little and Mark Bosnich. Dwight Yorke of course went on to be a huge success for Manchester United. 

Rival-wise, Birmingham are definitely our biggest. However, we also have a pretty big rivalry with West Bromwich Albion. Due to proximity, we also always want to win games against Coventry and Wolves. 

Hope that's a good overview. Enjoy watching Villa, and glad to have you here. ",0,1387882210,moderator,0,1387882414,0,ce95xfb,t3_1tkq4t,t1_ce95xfb,t3_1tkq4t,null,1428004487,6,false,avfc,t5_2s569,6

true,farnz,eu,"Oxon, England","Taking your points in turn:

&gt; Taxi drivers probably aren't subject to penalties for deciding not to run a service - unlike train companies

Exactly - and if they've given up running a service because the weather makes them fear for their vehicles (and hence their livelihoods), I'd argue that it's also reasonable for a train operator to declare that it can't keep running due to severe weather. I think that on this point, we're in agreement.

&gt; Does that happen? It's not like there are multiple roads all over the place. Unless the depot itself is blocked, the buses should be able to find some way back.

Yes, it happens due to bad weather; while there are multiple roads, they're often not suitable for buses (e.g. too narrow). When severe weather happens, bus drivers are told to leave their normal routes and come back to the depot by any navigable route so that the buses can be prepared to run again when the weather returns to normal.

&gt; This is mostly Network Rail's problem - since it is the rail lines that will be affected, and based on conditions they set the speed limits and whether trains are allowed to run at all. I don't think they haven't tried to do what they can, but there's only so much you can do to prepare for falling trees (which happen without warning, so you're going to get trains striking them) and flooded lines (I understand Exeter has flooded again and that's with Network Rail keeping a close eye on it and attempting to put some prevention measures in place - as well as lots of other obstacles across the network).

It's possible to fix these problems, but it can take huge amounts of money, which isn't necessarily a good use of rail firms' resources (I include Network Rail in the set - if their failures mean a TOC has to pay out, then they should be compensating the TOCs accordingly). If at least one other form of public transport (coaches, local buses, taxis - any one of the three) has given up due to the weather, then it's reasonable to state that the weather is so severe that it's uneconomic for anyone to prepare. If it's simply that (for example) the one line between Exeter and the rest of the country has flooded, then NR and the TOCs should be prepared to pay out for alternative transport around the blockage - maybe a rail replacement bus to get you from Exeter to Taunton, and normal service from Taunton?",0,1387883166,null,0,false,0,ce961we,t3_1tjfdj,t1_ce961we,t1_ce95qop,null,1428004429,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,squigs,cnty-expat,Brightonaut in Berlin,"&gt; Because it's using a censorship system for scope creep - the system it uses was originally only intended to block underage porn. the same scope creep will happen here.

Of course it will. The government already has a government controlled system they can use. Why are you bitching about a voluntary porn filter when they have a system that could be used for what you say it will be used that predates it!?

&gt; No, they don't. If you turn their censorship on, it blocks those.

So if you choose to block them it blocks them. No shit! 

&gt; Such things should not ever be censored anyway. You're giving abusive parents and partners the resources to prevent vulnerable people from getting the help and support they may need.

Yes. There are problems with what is blocked. Talk to the ISPs about it. It doesn't make the filters inherently wrong. It means we need a mechanism to unblock obvious errors.

&gt; Very few of their customers want this.

Oh come off it! This is a vote grabbing thing from Cameron. Of course they want it otherwise he'd not get any votes.

Are you just being obtuse? **THIS ISN'T THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT. IT'S THE ISP**

No I'm not! When did I say anything positive about it? Just because you can't critically access an article without seeing things in crude black and white doesn't mean that other people can't.

I'm saying you're wrong because you are suggesting something will happen with no evidence, conflating the government's role with the ISPs role and coming up with a ludicrous conspiracy theory about how this will be used when, even if there was a plan to control us, the government already has a much better tool to do so.

&gt; PS. Nice work dropping threads you can't reply to any more. Sign of someone losing an argument.

If ISPs wanted to provide censorship, they just need to get a partnership with censorware companies and distribute free trials plus discounts to people who want it. I'm sure the censorware vendors would be happy to get some trial customers.

He had some great anecdotes about various club people, seeing Torres, Carragher, getting coached by Rafa, Xabi. (this is just from memory btw, so not precise on the details). 

He got harassed, and deleted his first account because some people didn't like how we treated him like a mini celebrity, apparently the pm's were pretty bad. Personally I've always thought his contributions improved this sub immensely, a bit like devineman in r/soccer, he has knowledge to share, but gets a lot of backlash for whatever reason. (football fans don't have a great reputation for being smart, reasonable people I guess...)

Anyway, he returned from hiatus under the guise of ER2 for a bit, things got back to normal, then the harassing started again and he apparently forgot his pw, thus the evolution to ER3, which he said would be his final form and he was staying with us indefinitely.

Lack of legislation and lack of demand from the ISPs. If Cameron thought legislation would be easy he would have pushed it through. Legislation to force ISPs to do what they're already doing would be even harder to push through.

&gt; ...so why make it easier?

They're not. Using the ISP controlled filters would be harder.

&gt; So 65% don't want it.

Read the poll. Point is it's more than 10 people. I imagine at least some of the 52% of those who want opt-in are happy with what we've ended up with. 

&gt; If ISPs wanted to provide censorship, they just need to get a partnership with censorware companies and distribute free trials plus discounts to people who want it. I'm sure the censorware vendors would be happy to get some trial customers.

This isn't what the customers want. They want what they're now getting. The free market failed to provide this.

&gt; It's based on fucking past evidence as exactly this thing has happened before. Imbecile.

Sorry. My historical knowledge is not that great. When has a voluntary internet filter been expanded to a government controlled censorship before?

&gt; Again, the hijacking of the CP-blocking system (which was originally introduced as to only be used for that purpose) to block TPB etc?

Indeed. I'd imagine the government would use that for their censorship rather than a voluntary system.

&gt; Meaning what?

Meaning that the system that already was in existence to block child porn is a much more useful tool than a voluntary ISP controlled filter.

Nobody wants this. ISPs already offered censorware - the fact takeup was so low shows nobody wants censorship.

The 'Cleanfeed' system was designed to block CP, and it was repeatedly promised that would be all it was used for. It was then extended to TPB, newzbin, KAT, etc.

&gt; BT and O2 block sites they shouldn't. There's no way to unblock specific sites.

The solution here is to create a mechanism to unblock specific sites. Not to eliminate the filters entirely. 

&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole

Yes, but even so, more than a third is hardly trivial support that you suggest.

&gt; Nobody wants this. ISPs already offered censorware - the fact takeup was so low shows nobody wants censorship.

Yes 35% of people would prefer opt-in filters to opt-out. So evidently there is a demand for it. Perhaps it was a failure to advertise effectively. Who knows. Clearly the free market failed. 

&gt; The 'Cleanfeed' system was designed to block CP, and it was repeatedly promised that would be all it was used for. It was then extended to TPB, newzbin, KAT, etc.

Well, that was never voluntary, but anyway... So the government has a mechanism they can use to block what they don't like. Why the conspiracy theory about them creating another? Why would they need it? 

&gt; I thought you said you opposed this censorship? Make your mind up.

I do. You seem to be hallucinating my argument again. I didn't say I approved of this. 

&gt; Again, you said there isn't a precedent for scope creep; I countered with an example; you ignored it.

The government already has a government controlled system they can use to censor. Why are you bitching about a voluntary porn filter when they already have a system that can be used for censorship that's completely separate from it?

  I wanted him to be the real deal, but always had serious doubts. The manner in which he conveyed information didn't seem quite right, even while overlooking some of the suspect responses.

  All of that being said, I once met a first team fitness (I think) coach from Charlton Athletic at a party. This was when they were in the Premier League. He was quite blunt about who he thought was good and who he didn't rate, but this was a one-on-one conversation which could not have endangered his position unless I was a journalist, which I'm not. So that's why, even when ElevenRedsIII said things that seemed unprofessional, I could accept that a coach might speak like that.

 The AVB thing, though, really got to me. Given the sort of position he seemed to have (youth team coach, occasionally working with the first team), I can't believe he would have had any access to AVB. Also, if he was the real deal and was trying to protect his identity, that would have been a really suicidal move.

I've read most of the comments in the thread and I'll pick up on bits and bobs as I recall that they're relevant.  The main thing I picked up on that I think might explain things is that you commented somewhere that you're in your thirties.

If I picked up on that right that means you grew up predominantly in an era with Thatcher's Conservative government as the political background.  This was a period where the government of the time rolled out the usual suspects and blamed them for everything.  It's standardised political rhetoric.  It's all the fault of **them**.  *""It's all the fault of the union thugs, demanding decent treatment for workers and causing inflation!""  ""It's all the fault of the single parents and their wretched, fatherless offspring sucking the benefits system dry!""  ""It's all the fault of the foreigners coming here and taking your jobs!""  ""It's all the fault of the Civil Servants who won't do as they're told!""  ""It's all the fault of the Europeans making us call sausages high fat offal tubes!"" *

Don't look at the man behind the curtain it is all the fault of **them**!

Human beings have a nasty tendency to try to *(metaphorically)* peck to death anyone that is different.

The differences, in reality, tend to be rather literally only skin deep.  I may be 98% genetically the same as a chimp, but you and I are exactly the same barring the sequencing of some odds and sods that are sub-microscopic unless you have a pretty awesome microscope.  *(Yes, that's a bloody terrible simile.  You know what I mean though, the difference is really, really small.  (The bonus part here though is that it's true regardless of who we are.  We're something like 99.99% the same.  What's 0.01% worth?  That's not even a little toe.  We're both less than a little toe's worth of variation from being Usain Bolt!))*

Ok, back to the point...

On the up-side the majority of people don't really hate you.  Honestly, they don't.  Most of us are desperately trying to survive our own pathetically small lives.

Recently I saw something described as an issue of **Pleural Ignorance**.  That doesn't seem to be a commonly used term, but the gist of it was something like the idea that we're all walking around thinking, *""Well, that's clearly not true, but everyone else seems to believe it!""*  Regardless of the term we use to describe the issue this is what we have going on in the UK and it leaves everyone feeling like they're under attack.

You see the Daily Mail headlines and hear some ignorant ass call you a Paki and you think, *""They all hate me and I'm loathed by everyone.  No one will even open their mouths to utter a word in my defence!""*  Every day someone accuses the baby boomer generation of taking all the goodies and pulling the ladder up behind them and they complain, *""I worked hard for everything I have.  I worked my whole life and you begrudge me this little in my old age?""*  

The young are reviled for everything short of causing global warming simply by breathing; we blame them for violence, promiscuity, for being lazy, for being stupid, we tell them they only got decent grades at school because everything was dumbed down for them, there are no decent jobs.  When I was a kid the social contract was supposed to be something like study hard, get a decent education; get a job, work hard, reap the rewards.  It was all lies, but the young now don't even have that much to look forward to.  

If you work in the private sector, unless you're very lucky, your employers have stripped away most of the perks, your wages have probably stagnated, your job security has evaporated, your work pension has been looted and your state pension has run away from you by a decade.  If you're not especially lucky you have an only slightly better than minimum wage job with no job security *(or two, or three)* and your management chain sneers at you almost daily, *""You should be grateful even to have a job!""*

If you work in the public sector your management seems to despise you, for the most part so does the public and everyone seems to keep telling you that you're fat and lazy and overpaid and undeservedly pampered.  You're reviled for your gold-plated pension *(gold-plated is actually an extremely accurate term for most public sector pensions because they're only shiny on the surface)* and you might find yourself thinking, *""I'm not sure where all the pay-rises the red tops keep telling me I've been getting went, my take home pay has dropped every year for the past five years!""*

We've all been expertly played, divided and set at one-another's throats.  If we all stopped fighting the straw enemies we're told are to blame forty-five million pairs of eyes would turn to face the people screwing us over and start asking questions with truly chilling effect.  but as a general rule when you never get a moment to catch your breath it's not all that obvious that crap washed downhill over everyone else's boots too.

There is a background problem that sort of colours the background of people's lives in a tremendously ugly way.  This isn't isolated to, but it is absolutely personified by the Daily Mail.  The thing is this:  The average guy on the street doesn't really believe what the red top papers say.  Even the people who buy them don't actively believe it.  But the problem is that it's there every day like the ticking of a clock that you only notice when it stops.

The corporations stopped paying into the retirement benefit schemes and chuckled and said, *""Sorry guys, there's no money!""* and you were told it was the fault of the private sector because they hadn't been stripped of their pensions yet.  Money was poured by the bushel into the NHS to be sucked out by the leeches of the private sector who attached themselves to the system and you were told it's the fault of medical tourism.  The jobs dried up and you were told it's the fault of the Eastern Europeans.  

You'll have heard people saying, *""We have all paid ourselves too much!""* in the last few years, but it's worth critically thinking for a moment about who this *we* is.  It's also worth challenging people on these things.  Nicely.  but they tend to have nothing behind the statement.

*(On a related note it's also worth challenging people when they utter, ""There's just no money left!""  The UK's neat worth at the end of 2012 was estimated to be **[£7.3tn](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/422412/7-3trillion-is-Britain-s-net-worth)** or around £114,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. While it would be unreasonable and unworkable to expect things to even out completely in **[2010](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/21/british-household-1m-assets)** the top 1% had wealth of over £2.8m.  The top 10% had wealth edging up to £1m.  But the bottom 10% have wealth of less than £13k.  There's plenty of money,it's all just in the hands of a small number of people.)*

Ok, looking for something positive:

British society has changed **SO** positively since I was a kid.  When I was a kid I remember being at a family do and hearing my grandfather describe one of his friends *(while the friend was right there)* as a coon.  It was entirely normal to call small shops, 'Paki shops'.  I knew of people who trained their dogs to hate and to bark at coloured people.  I'll not continue, you **know** what it was like.

We are far from perfect, but so much better than we were.  And you have to try to remember that.

On a final thought, because I have rambled on here:  This will be uncomfortable, but you have to let racists speak.  The fastest way to kill their credibility is to give them free reign to let thestupid in their heads fall off their tongues.  If you remember when Nick Griffin *(a man described by Russell Howard as looking like someone had draped luncheon meat over a frog)* was on Question Time the audience was loaded with people who thought they were clever by trying to score points off him.  That didn't help.  If he'd been allowed to speak for every person who thought, *""Hmm, you make a fine point there, Nick!""* a thousand would have looked at their TV in shock and bewilderment thinking, *""You're so ignorant I may not have the words to express my astonishment.""*

The EDL are another case in point.  Their last protest in Bradford was corralled by the police and they were of no threat and no relevance to anyone.  The louts clambering over people's cars and throwing things at the police weren't the EDL idiots, they were local idiots.  You must have seen them when they're interviewed.  They can barely string a coherent sentence together.

Anyhow:

1.  Thank you for provoking this extremely interesting thread.

2.  Please try to bear in mind that the number of people with genuine racist issues are small and they're mostly ignorant and scared.

3.  Try to remember how far we've come as a society since we were kids.

What separates success is not just the players or the formation but what Ferguson, Wenger, Guardiola, Mourinho have in common is that they are master tacticians. We haven't any evidence that Sherwood has proved this at all.

*""AVB is a good coach with the potential to be great.  He isn't a great coach with the ability to be legendary, at least not yet.  He is young and still needs to make and learn from any number of mistakes before he can progress. If he can continue to learn from his mistakes he can be something special, if he can't he will stall out.""*

He does seem to have learned from some of the mistakes that he made at Chelsea, particularly his locker room presence.  But he still needs to learn from some of his other mistakes (tactical inflexibility for example) to become a better coach.

With us, it sounds like his relationship with the front office became badly broken. Not openly hostile but strained and dysfunctional to the point that when he sat down with Levy they both agreed it wasn't working and agreed to a ""mutual consent"" departure.  Like a marriage that has failed and both sides know that the effort to repair the relationship seems like more effort than it is worth.

On the field he had issues with tactical inflexibility and odd choices for substitutions. He also clearly had some issues with personnel (Ade and Benny) and while improved from when he was at Chelsea still something that needs to be dealt with as he moves forward in his career.

As for the third ""less discussed theory"", the rumor is that Sherwood was constantly undermining AVB with Levy.  I have seen people refer to Sherwood as ""Tottenham's Worm-Tongue"" (from Lord of the Rings).  I think that is almost certainly overblown, i don't see Sherwood whispering to Levy with the express intent of removing AVB.  I could absolutely imagine Sherwood raising some of the same concerns to Levy that people expressed on this board (slow un-creative football, odd choices for lineups, questions about personnel) if only because Levy reportedly rates Sherwood very highly and if we as fans are questioning decisions, Sherwood as a coach is bound to have a few as well and Sherwood doesn't strike me as a guy who is anything but painfully honest when he speaks.

So, now we have to see what Sherwood brings to the table.  He already is shown some promise, my main concern is that if AVB made mistakes and still needs to make mistakes in his fourth managerial post that Sherwood will still need to make mistakes in his first post, hopefully his learning curve isn't as steep.

Also, I think having English players is quite important for the clubs image. We're playing in an English league yet the foreigners are vastly outnumbering our home-grown players.

But anyway, the striker we would need is someone with strength and the ability to create their own space. Torres and Eto'o are both players that require service, while Drogba could make something from nothing.

true,SoyBotones,null,null,"Why did the AVB project fail?

Maybe, just maybe, AVB caught lightning in a bottle his one year at Porto, and we judged him on his one brilliant season, and were too quick to discard his lackluster results with Chelsea.

What AVB had going for him at Porto:

1. Radamel Falcao having a breakout year with 39 goals. At this point in time, everybody now understands Falcao to be one of the finest players in Europe. In 2010-2011, he was a relative unknown.
2. Hulk having a breakout year as well, with 35 goals
3. Joao Moutinho was pulling the strings of that side
4. The Portuguese league is generally pretty lopsided, and while Porto, Sporting, and Benfica can all assemble quite strong teams, and it's nothing to beat up on Belenenses or Braga on a regular basis and traipse your way to top leagues and cup victories

The single most impressive thing about AVB's 2010-2011 run was his Europa League campaign, which probably should be almost entirely attributed to Radamel Falcao (who broke European scoring records that year, with 17 goals, topping Klinsmann).

So, in summary, at Porto, AVB had:

* Three of the best un(der)recognized talents in Europe
* Relatively weak competition
* Radamel Falcao ""putting the team on his back"" for EL

So, with AVB, we've got:

* 2010-2011: The splendid Porto run
* 2011-2012: The 'disastrous' Chelsea run
* 2012-2013: Bale's breakout year (Falcao part II?) - Imagine how dire this season would be without Bale
* 2013-2014: ???

Maybe, outside of controlled circumstances, and with a very specific set of players, AVB didn't have the managerial chops to adapt to another league with another set of players, and we've been too quick to ignore his failures, and too quick to celebrate his victories.

true,Kynsky,null,null,"i'm sorry pooled sovereignty? that is a radically new concept casually bandied about by europhiles that has been undermining the idea of the nation state for a good while now.. 

you don't think that concept warrants some thought? or scrutiny? or debate?

Lets take the philosopher Jean Bodin's example of sovereignty:

""The Prince has the power to both legislate and rule over a given territory without interference by another state or organisation""

now obviously replace prince with parliament an you can see, ""pooled"" or not the UK is not in charge of its own affairs, can parliament legislate an rule over a given territory (the UK) without interference by another organisation? no. it cannot. 

Does parliament remain free to change or reverse decisions that the UK Government has been told to ratify by senior EU bureaucrats? No. It does not. 


right the second point i'm going to have to go in to a little more detail about i suspect. 

In 2010 the group NGO Monitor petitioned the European Commission to reveal details of the NGOs it has funded in recent years. A lot of non government organisations which are funded by the EU push highly specific political agendas so some oversight in this area would be beneficial to the public.

Specifically there has been a history of the European Commission funding rabidly anti-Israel groups in Europe and the Middle East. 

NGO Monitor wanted more transparency in NGO Funding. 

the European Court of Justice backed the EC’s refusal to release the names of organisations which the EC has funded. Hence my comment.

I said signed off OR heavily criticised. It's in the first line of your link  ""errors persist in all main spending areas""

oh an ""since 2007"" isn't a great fact to bring up when defending the EU. It's existed alot longer than that. it's accounting history is suspect. At best. 

By monstrosity i refer to the *sheer amount* of legislation it pumps out. Secondly how much *power* it wields, wayy back in the not so distant past, the EU was about trade. A free trade zone. It was *never* meant to be about politics, and ""ever closer political union"" it has been taken an subverted from trade to this political utopia project that many people feel deeply skeptical an uncomfortable about.

the commission (who has all the power remember) *no member of the public voted for* 

""The president elect of the Commission chooses the commissioners from the lists of candidates put forward by the EU countries. The proposed list is then submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers"" 

you're on very shake ground there. democratically..

&gt;An ongoing tax obligation, in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency, maintains its value. Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's deficit spending or budget surplus) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment, and *not a means of funding the government's activities per se*.

They recognise that the **only** way the non-government sector can net save the government's currency is if the government dissaves it. That is, if we are to have growth not dependent on private sector credit we **need** government debt.

That's what this article points out: the UK cannot depend on the foreign sector for pounds, because pounds come from the UK. That's why unlike on the Bretton Woods systems and gold standards of yore, the UK simply cannot be expected to have an export lead recovery. What we've seen instead is that the growth that has been occurring has been coming from households lowering their savings rates, exactly what got us into the mess in the first place, along with a meagre contribution from the government despite its claims of austerity.

The logical solution for a betterment of the UK is to simply drop the pretense of austerity and increase spending and/or decrease taxation.

Since the software and even the settings are seen to transfer over from one sonic to the next, the only conclusion we can arrive at is that somehow the Doctor backs it up and transfers it over to each new screwdriver.

The screwdriver has been shown to have some link with the Tardis at times, so many assume that the Tardis backs it up. This is not an illogical conclusion, but hasn't been displayed in the show.

Bale was not the same bale from years prior, not by a long shot. You can say what you want about ""breakout performances"" but they don't just happen, he doesn't just strike gold that many times.

Chelsea was a wreck already, Torres was a shadow of his former self, avb wanted to build a dynasty there. 

The term ""you play the hand you're dealt"" is the mantra of the post season at spurs. He was rife with injuries and still managed to have a decent squad, it wasn't like bale was also playing all the defense and creation, there was a team at play.

This team is incorporating 7-8 new players if you consider those returning from injury or those having a bit more time in the limelight like holtby. That takes time, and while I agree that the high line play requires fast players, you're not gonna do it with guys playing out of position or fucking fryers/naughton...

That and the board can quickly cause problems with the team. I'd wager they forced certain decisions that should not have been made, like avb's sacking exemplifies. Where's the replacement? You want ugly football? Look art RDM's Chelsea. All of avbs decisions there weren't bad, he brought on Mata and meireles, that played a huge part in their cl victory.

If you're only against something because it's against the law then you aren't really against it. Law has nothing to do with it. I would disagree even if this protection wasn't theoretically enshrined within law. And presumably you wouldn’t agree with the law if it was 'illegal to force religious believers to performs things they didn't want to' etc.

also the law doesn't actually stop [sexual harassment, it’s endemic]( http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2013/oct/23/sexual-harassment-workplace-endemic-women) *""sexual harassment in the workplace is rife among both men and women, with almost 40% of men also reporting experiences. But 60% of those surveyed say they have kept a possible harassment incident to themselves, making this an invisible, yet enormously common problem.*

*""When I was 23 my arse was regularly pinched at work. I was too afraid of losing my job to report it.""*

This lack of freedom at work you defend allows disgusting acts to be committed, yet it would be right even if nothing was committed. The fact that people can’t just ‘choose another job’, and fear revealing their abuse, is one of the reason this is reproduced. Presumably in all these cases you would respond in the manner you have been doing, by saying ‘you chose the job’, by victim blaming. My point wasn’t specific to this case but about the conditions and nature of work in general, and the dangerous power relation between employer and employee.
 
Pretty much every workplace has the same hierarchical structure, and hence the conditions in which harassment and all other manner of oppression can occur. And thus it’s simply not enough to say, ‘just work somewhere else’, because not only is this choice usually meaningless (one of the reasons it continues, as the perpetrators doesn’t fear the employer when it isn’t the employer themselves), but no workplaces are protected. 

Workers are dominated in the workplace, and have no freedom. *""Domination is inherently degrading and demeaning, since it submerges the will and judgement of the dominated to the will and judgement of the dominators, thus destroying the dignity and self-respect that comes only from personal autonomy. Moreover, domination makes possible and generally leads to exploitation, which is the root of inequality, poverty, and social breakdown.""* A meaningless response to this is ‘just work in another workplace’.

Lewi isn't coming to Chelsea. Everyone in Germany has said that he is going to Bayern for over a year. From Kloppo to Lewi's agent, it looks to be a sure thing. Sure Chelsea might be able to give him more cash, but cash isn't everything to a player. He feels that it's better for his career to go to Munich. So we can lay that to rest.

Benteke has been a shell of his last season form. He hasnt looked great since the Arsenal game, and has had a huge scoring drought. Why bring in an out of from player we would have to overpay to get? He stayed at Villa over the summer for a reason. It makes no sense to leave 6 months after saying you are staying for another few years.

The January transfer window isn't the summer. Teams aren't willing to sell their best players to overpay for a replacement player. Luke Shaw is a smart buy but it isn't going to happen over the winter, even if we loan him back. If Ashley Cole is riding the pine, then why would Shaw come to Chelsea?

I am obviously not talking about one particular episode but iPlayer ratings do have an effect on the BBC seeing a shows potential value. Some shows don't get many viewers on TV but when they premiered on iPlayer, they got millions.

My point isn't even saying that accessing iPlayer through a VPN is OK. I just don't think it's any worse than torrenting as both have negative impact on the copyright owners. The small percentage of iPayer users who are accessing from outside the UK are hardly crippling the BBC.

At least the BBC are in control of the content on iPlayer. With torrenting people can find 1080p downloads where iPlayer is limited to 720p. They may now want people being able to get 1080p download for free considering they sell the episodes in 1080p on iTunes (usually the source of the 1080p torrents). Also, people can get any single episode from torrents where iPlayer will give a small window where episodes are available. If they are accessible any time through torrents it can affect DVD sales.

It just makes no sense to take a moral high-ground about unauthorized iPlayer usage but then say torrenting is fine because that doesn't cost the BBC (I think they'd beg to differ).

Aside from the history and stuff, the main thing I think you should know is that the team is rebuilding after a failed attempt to crack the top four a few years ago. As a result you'll see a lot of negative comments on the team, but it's not real most of the time... just frustration.

There are a TON of places that will  hire you with none of the above and we don't have to justify it.  If you want a legit job, you file for a work visa, green card.. etc and hop on plane basically.

I find it hard to believe that all three of these guys, two of which were at a world class level within the part 3-4 years, are all so terribly inept all of the sudden. 

I realize Torres wastes a lot of possession, and appears to have led weights in his shoes whenever he's faced with beating a defender off the dribble, but I feel like the midfield doesn't do a great job of creating quality chances for him. Some of the more promising play I've seen this year has been when there's been two strikers up front. I'm not happy with the output of the strikers, but I think it's likely more systematic than an issue of poor form of the strikers themselves.

&gt;  Your comments over the last 2-3 days have made it abundantly clear you've made it your goal this week to get one over on him.

I left one comment, and he responded - which was fun. He then kept responding and getting defensive about it, which only made it more amusing. He has now deleted his account, which has made it even more fun. And now I have people yelling at me about it, which has made it even more fun!

I fell into this, didn't anticipate it, but boy has it been great. I must admit that I went from not caring at all 2 days ago to checking this sub more regularly just to see if I got to him, and I did.

You guys should be asking yourselves how is it with so many people here that it takes a guy who does nothing but the occasional troll/sarcastic comment to finally out this guy?

edit: and its hilarious how people are trying to downplay it now like it isn't a big deal - like, so what if one of the largest contributors of this sub that every user fawned over wasn't really a coach at the club? puh-lease. the fact that there is an entire 100+ comment thread dedicated to this guy deleting his account and that i've had over a dozen pm's about this tells you that this is a big deal and that you all got duped.

We don't need to buy a striker in January--we need only look at our past history buying strikers in January to see why.   We need to wait until lukaku returns, ship off demba, and buy another striker in summer for depth. 

Our midfield is in dire need of reinforcements right now. OP says our midfield is in great condition but that's simply not true. We are stacked (too stacked) with wingers/am's but the center of the field is WEAK.  Romeu isn't anything special, mceachran showed promise years ago but has fallen off. Lamps is too old to be relied upon every week, easier is clearly past it and that leaves us with just mikel and rami, not exactly offensive juggernauts.  We need someone who can distribute the ball.

""John Houlding (Liverpool FC founder) attempted to hijack the club by registering another company, Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds, Ltd.in March 1892. Everton were still occupying and playing at Anfield, Houlding sought to take over Everton's fixtures and position in the Football League. The Football Council[clarification needed] would not recognise Houlding's new company as Everton, resulting in his changing the name to Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd in June 1892, creating Liverpool F.C.. The distrust between Houlding and the Everton Committee resulted in Everton abandoning their substantial ground at Anfield and moving to Goodison Park on the north side of Stanley Park,[5][10] issuing 5,000 shares as they did so, giving the directors a 6% stake in the club.

No Gerrard? He's playing at a higher level than Lampard this season and always has done. I wouldn't expect any other LFC players to be in there.

The oddest selections? Hazard at #100? He should be in the top 30. Witsel at #52 is much too high. I wouldn't have him on this list. Buffon at 24 and Totti at 31 seem like sentimental choices. Both are at the end of their careers and should only be scraping into a to 100. 

Verratti should be much higher, so should Kompany, Silva and Javi Martinez. Then you have Ramsey at 49 after half a good season. Higuain, Modric, Vertonghen, Hamsik, Turan, Verratti, Di Maria, Sanchez, Martinez, Koke, Strootman, etc I'd rate all of them higher than him. Nasri is nowhere to be seen.

http://www.rcn.org.uk/nursing/work_in_health_care/become_a_nurse

&gt;To work as a nurse, you’ll need a degree in nursing and you must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). You won’t pay university fees, as your education is funded by the NHS. You’ll also need to choose which of the four nursing specialisms you’d like to study – adult, children, mental health, or learning disability. Nursing requires a high level of technical competence and clinical decision-making skills, and you’ll spend half of your nursing degree on supervised placements in local hospital and community settings.
Find your nursing degree

&gt;Visit the NHS Careers website to find a university near you offering nursing degrees in England or in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. There are also options through the Open University. Then visit the individual university website to learn more about the content of the course. You might want to go along to an open day to get a better idea, talk to lecturers and current students. Once you have decided which course and university, apply through UCAS. If you are employed in the health sector, your employer may support you to study part-time for a nursing degree.

&gt;As yet, there are no specific national requirements for becoming an HCA. Some employers require literacy and numeracy skills. You simply need to apply for a job as an HCA, and once you have been accepted, your employer will train you to be competent in the skills required for your job. You might want to think about getting work experience to find about what it’s like to work in health care first.",0,1387909417,null,0,1387909725,0,ce9cn9f,t3_1tknce,t1_ce9cn9f,t3_1tknce,null,1428001339,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Although medical alert tattoos are rare compared to the necklaces, as long as it is in an obvious place we will see it. Part of our secondary survey is to look for medical alert jewelry or tattoos. If you are seriously unwell after we have you stabilised it is one of our priorities to check for a cause, and hence medical alerts

My advice is to get it on the following areas:

Underside of wrist

Underside of arm

Chest

Shoulders

The wrist and arm due to IV access

The shoulder because that's where adrenaline is most often administered for allergic reactions

Chest because if you are in a condition where you are unable to communicate your problem your chest will be exposed for purposes of ECG'S, Listening to your heart and lungs and part of a general inspection

That said, unless.what you have is rare, we can probably figure it out allergic reactions, Epilepsy and the like.

true,KoolAidMan1,null,null,I have been downvoting his bullshit for months everytime I saw him post (RES has him at -90). It was really obvious that he was bullshitting ever since the time he made a new thread on here in the summer promising 100% insider knowledge that we would get a certain player (who we actually had absolutely zero interest in).

true,lapin7,null,null,"I'm a bit embarrassed now to say that, after initially completely doubting what he claimed, I eventually deferred to the consensus of this sub that he was who he said he was, and even sent the kid a message saying 'don't let hurtful PMs that people have sent you bother you' because he seemed really upset during the first tantrum.

In the past I used to browse and occasionally post on RAWK and, like most people, I was somewhat perturbed and deterred by the general attitude of a lot of users, especially the mods. Too cynical, too abrasive, etc. But after long periods of time, after various things such as the H&amp;G disaster, Hodgson, most of the players we signed, and many other things, I realised that the consensus on RAWK, albeit cynical, was almost always right. Startlingly accurate actually - it seems to me at least that the general positions on most things re Liverpool were proved right over time.

What I'm saying is, this place has a long long way to go. Due to the nature of reddit and its voting system, the 'consensus' (aka circlejerk) on most issues is even more overwhelming than other forums. It was embarrassing and frustrating at the time to see ElevenReds's posts upvoted to the top of every thread, and people making jokes/requests to him in every thread also, but now it looks even worse. It barely needs stated that everything he posted was very poorly written and boring, offering no insight at all. Even when I thought he was real I didn't want to read anything he posted. Hopefully this whole weird story will humble all of us here and make us think more carefully about stuff. In general it'd be nice to have more considered and varied opinions/viewpoints in here. 

That's not to take all of this too seriously. It's just an internet forum, no one's really been hurt or anything, and the whole story is quite amusing and entertaining and interesting to look back on. Certainly more interesting than anything ElevenReds actually said. I also don't blame the mods, it looks like the kid was a nightmare to email back and forth and nikcub is good for detailing what happened so thoroughly.

true,mushroomgodmat,null,null,"&gt;No, any cyclist error is half liable to the driver. Only actual intent to cause a collision would negate responsibility for the motorist.

If a car was as dangerous as a bike I would agree.

A cyclist/person making a minor mistake should be just that - minor. Once a car is introduced the car by its very nature (not the driver necessarily) has made the situation much worse.

&gt;A car driving safely is not introducing danger. A cyclist's mistake is a cyclist's mistake.

I disagree - mainly because of my 1st point. By introducing a car you have introduced a danger. If a driver replaced their car for a bike the danger introduced would be smaller to none at all.

&gt;It's not the same though is it? If you can prove that the error was indeed the fault of the driver in front, you are not liable.

Technically probably not  - but from the presumption you might be at fault its very much the same.

&gt;No it doesn't. It's massively unfair on motorists who could potentially have to pay out for something that was not their fault in any way, shape or form.

And that's where we fundamentally disagree.

I see the dangers a car (or any vehicle that can travel at massive speed) can introduce by making minor mistakes of others into catastrophic mistakes - or if not catastrophic a hell of a lot more complicated.",0,1387916992,null,0,false,0,ce9fh2w,t3_1tioxb,t1_ce9fh2w,t1_ce95kgd,null,1428000020,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,AgentUmlaut,null,null,"Wow that's kinda crazy. I never really saw him as someone too high or mighty, I would just talk some basic sport banter through pm's and that was about it. What's kinda interesting after going over all the PMs I ever sent him, at points there were definite times where he talked about how he enjoyed being the talk of the subreddit at times and having people agree with him. Pretty sad since he was just a bullshit artist who wanted to be liked by people.

His story seemed a bit fishy to me when he was telling me something along the lines that his German parents lived in Africa as a missionary or something for a short while but was from Blackburn and his whole family was Rovers fans or something. I mean plausible sure, but from the bunch of times I've talked with him the stories seemed to get all mixed up. He also said at different times he was living in West Midlands, then Bristol and then Liverpool.

What I think is kinda creepy was how he claimed to be buds/would hang with players like Allen, Borini, Suso and other younger players. He would mention how he helped Borini move in and how Borini just watched weird dog videos and talked about wanting Big Macs from McDonald's. I then looked back at some of the tweets Borini had and some of it was banter to friends/or family about eating cheeseburgers and links to viral vids with dogs (all for the most part in Italian).

I'm not gonna bother looking through PMs but I wanna say on two different times he gave me two different first names and I remember looking at the staff roster and how nobody with that name was on there. EDIT: I looked through PMs, at one time he said his name was ""Jon"".

He also said how he was going for his pro license several times but a lot of the things he allegedly was doing was things that would require higher licenses than what he had.

I also remember him saying to me several times that the planned MLS team NYC FC wanted to hire him for coaching and would be making enough to live comfortably in NYC. I was pretty skeptical due to despite that club having owners who are Man City and Yankees, it'd be pretty hard for a coach of that status on an MLS team to be making the salaries he was talking about.

Either way that is the most ridiculous shit I've seen on the Internet in awhile. Someone trying to play people that elaborately but obviously not having the brain to realize that people are gonna be on his case about who he really is.

**Long TL DR** I chatted with elevenreds for quite a bit about general footie banter and other bs not really focusing too much on his alleged job. After going over about a year and a couple months worth of messages, its interesting how many twists and turns his story and background had; it looked so fishy. Honestly it's pretty sad how he lied so extensively and avoided when people were trying to fact check him on shit. The most obvious lie was how he said he was on the Academy staff roster but if you literally check out every single job profile on the site(even the guy responsible for getting kits together), they all had a picture with a face and info. Elevenreds told me on several times he was allegedly in his mid 20s, hardly any of the Academy staff seemed to really look like that.

true,PhantomGoatherder,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;A cyclist/person making a minor mistake should be just that - minor. Once a car is introduced the car by its very nature (not the driver necessarily) has made the situation much worse.

It's not about danger though is it? It's about damage to property.

If I'm sat in my car and a cyclist accidentally crashes into me, I have introduced no danger, nor have I made the situation worse.

&gt;I disagree - mainly because of my 1st point. By introducing a car you have introduced a danger. If a driver replaced their car for a bike the danger introduced would be smaller to none at all.

Again, this is nothing to do with danger.

&gt;Technically probably not - but from the presumption you might be at fault its very much the same.

Yes, but you can fight it in the courts. The ridiculous system in the Netherlands is fixed.

&gt;I see the dangers a car (or any vehicle that can travel at massive speed) can introduce by making minor mistakes of others into catastrophic mistakes - or if not catastrophic a hell of a lot more complicated.

I've already covered this. Danger is not the issue, damage to personal property is. Cyclist's mistake; cyclist's problem.

Claiming that the car has made things worse by being at the wrong place at the wrong time is nothing short of victim blaming.

This is merely an appropriation for circumstances where people were driven into such situations without their fault.

Another example would be a bailiff who was instructed by his boss to take away someone's car, while in reality the boss made an error which triggered the take (say, a miscalculation of the outstanding debt by accidentally moving the decimal point).

If you're asking if I believe that the risk of an event and the likely consequences of its manifesting are important components in determining how much time and effort to invest mitigating it, then of course.  However, since the risk of an earthquake event isn't zero, and the consequences, whilst most likely modest, could potentially be severe, it's not surprising to find that we do [consider them](http://www.quakes.bgs.ac.uk/hazard/Hazard_UK.htm).

On Mata, yesterday Mou had both wingers covering deep, basically making a line of 6 at the back. If we do stick with a 4-3-3 and keep Mata I think Mou will put him on the right.

First off there is no way they could keep the secret. People are going to wonder why Matt Smith seems to have booked his next year full of stuff not Doctor Who. So unless they planned on saying there would be no series 8......everyone would get wise to the fact that Matt Smith will no longer be playing the Doctor.

Also someone is going to get wise to the fact that Capaldi keeps going to the Who set and also has nothing booked next year.

Next which is most important is that there is very little payout. 
It's like the Khan reveal in Star Trek Into Darkness. 

Look it's your fault that you look at spoilers so that's one thing.
Also the 50th pretty much used up all the surprise there could have been anyway. If anything many people would have suspected that the 50th would have been an exit. 

Now final incarnation thing is the big reason why there would be little payout. Internet fanboys are the one obsessed with this limit. And Moffat had to state that the metacrisis regen counted. So many people would and will go into tomorrows episode not realizing he can't regenerate again. Also they aren't going to cancel the damn series either. 

Honestly I just think it's stupid to hide it. I'm not going to get more out of a cliffhanger. If there's anything people despise more is those kind of cliffhangers. 

This was not a huge opportunity. What you are suggesting is a screw you to fans just so people have a quick little shock.

It can work, they're both narrow attacking formations, good for the counter attack but less so for build up play because there's no ""natural width"", you'd need strikers to work the channels or a central mid to drift out wide, if you wanted anything besides fullbacks providing width.

That's what made the Christmas tree and 4-3-1-2 so popular in Italy, it was very compact defensively and players were able to get behind the ball quickly and defend and then hit on the counter with the strikers intelligent movement and the attacking mid spraying passes between the lines, how well it would translate to Spurs personnel, I don't know.

There really is no true 4-4-2 going forward, just like there really, mostly, is not a true 4-3-3 going forward. That is nothing new, Van Gaal referred to Barcelona's in possession formation as a 2-3-2-3, the two center backs, then the two fullbacks in the next line with the deep mid, then the two advanced mids and finally, the three forward players completing the fourth line.

So, a 4-4-2 in the modern game really only means that when the team goes out of possession they form up two banks of four with the strikers upfront. From there, there are an endless amount of differences in how that defensive shape operates, how tight the two banks are together(some are as close as ten yards apart), how high or deep is the backline and when do the strikers start the pressing.

The problem with the 4-4-2 defensive shape is the ease in which it can be broken down and the press can always be beat if the opposition uses three midfield players. If the strikers press the centerbacks(as Spurs did to Southampton) a deep mid can drop in between the two centerbacks and receive the ball and slip into the midfield and create the 3v2 in the middle that is the most frequent downfall of the 4-4-2 as a defensive shape, Southampton did not do this on Sunday but others will. The wide mids are caught between two choices, press the fullbacks and completely open the midfield(you're now talking about a 5v2 in the middle) or cover their opposite number and leave the fullbacks to have time on the ball. 

It's not a bad attacking shape but it just causes all sorts of issues as a defensive shape if you do anything other than sit very deep and soak up pressure, that is where the formation is applied most often in modern football, minnows trying to avoid playing an open game and leaving two up to give them something on the counter.

No, we've only had actual democracy in the UK for perhaps the last 100 years. Let us not forget that both of the two unions leading to the UK's formation (1707 Treaty of Union (with Scotland) and 1800 Act of Union (with Ireland)) were both signed against the will of the vast majority of those former nation states' people. Nor can we forget that until 10 years after the First World War, women could not vote, and not far prior to that, only privileged men could. We should also not forget that until the mid-1800s, people had less rights in England depending on whether they were Catholic or Anglican.",0,1387926300,null,0,1387926521,0,ce9irbn,t3_1thqsu,t1_ce9irbn,t3_1thqsu,null,1427998487,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Bitcoin seems like the worst thing to start with if you are new to ""investing"", I suggest you stick to highly straightforward fully regulated investments such as stocks and shares to start with. Bitcoin is totally unregulated, exchanges have disappeared and taken investors money, different countries are still undecided on whether bitcoin is a currency or not,the system is full of criminals and computer hackers who are stealing coins left right and centre (see reddit any day !!). It is regularly ""hyped"" on Reddit and elsewhere. Please be very careful.
As a new comer I suggest you spread your spare investing cash quite widely and not have more than 5-10% of it in any one thing. So if you expect to have , say,  $3,000 per year for investment then no more than $150-$300 in bitcoin, or indeed anything else.
Personally I am avoiding bitcoin entirely as I do think it is effectively a scam/pyramid/bigger fool thing albeit quite different to other schemes that have gone before.

I'm of the mind that our strikers skill is not the problem but more how the game is played around them. Chelsea seem to tactically play in a false-9 style with a striker in that role but not playing as a striker. Our midfielders are great but they play amongst themselves and look to take on people as opposed to playing the ball in to the striker, a sign of our false-9 style. Our strikers have been starved of service for quite awhile. 

I also think this is why  Mourinho has rightfully relegated Mata to the bench. The team is set up to take on people and counter attack and Mata tends to slow things down. He is an absolutely fantastic player but the team does operate in the perfect style for him. Schurrle and Willian are better for pace and are not afraid to take people on and take shots. Mata seems to prefer short passes to try and create space in the congested area around the box. With that being said, the styles of Willian and Schurrle are probably set up better for how the team operates. Oscar is our only attacking three midfielder who seems to play long balls along the ground and through the air on a regular basis which is why Mourinho has established him as our number 10 (again I think rightfully so). That leaves him to compete with Hazard. Hazard is very quick with the ball at his feet and always tries to go forward and frankly I rate him slightly ahead of mata. 

So with that said I think we need to sell Mata before he forces his way out(although if he is willing to play like he currently is please keep him) and sign someone in the mold of Pogba or Xabi Alonso who can control the ball and play those decisive balls from the middle into the final third. 

A striker would be nice but I honestly don't think a new one does us much good if we don't get a midfielder first. Finally, I definitely agree with everyone saying to buy Luke Shaw.

If you used trains more often you would. 

Never has an opening comment disproved everything you have to say on the subject more than this. 


&gt;All packed in - surely as good a reason to talk to each other as any.

No, because if you don't like who you're talking to or have nothing in common you have no where to go and an audience to watch the awkwardness. 

I'm not a game show host or compere so I have no desire to drag everyone else into it.

It's off putting. 


&gt;Bags all over the place - see above

Everyone is hot  and uncomfortable, people are cranky. 

&gt;Nutter bellowing - obese or not, everyone else chatting would make him less of a problem.

It would make it difficult to hear. Also, it might invite him to have a conversation as well, which is something no one would want. 


&gt;I don't wish you would talk but you obviously hate travelling by train with a vengeance. Is it not possible that chatting to a stranger might distract you from all the shitty aspects of the journey?

No, because everyone is tired and cranky and just wants to get home. 

Having conversations under those circumstances is draining, and I had been travelling for ages and I don't know where other people have come from. 

It's not a time for bullshit smalltalk.

Chelsea is probably more doable. I'd be pretty surprised if we won, and I *won't* be surprised if we lose, but I could see a draw happening, especially since Mou is clearly OK with just taking the draw against top teams.

Hull at home I'd expect to be a rout too, but the other way around. After what's likely to be two very tough away matches and after the embarrassing loss to them away earlier this year, I think the team will be keen to make a statement. 

So, I'd say we'll hit the new year with 39-40 points. Anything more would be surprising to me, even as well as we're playing of late.

The stoke is an excellent place for comedy evenings and particularly for dancing - they do salsa etc usually on a Thurs night I seem to recall.

We've by far got the hardest run. Then Chelsea. 

I will say this. If we beat City, I will go fucking nuts. Although I'd rather we played not to lose. Here's what happens.

City win: Everyone expects this. They're the best side in the league. Probably going to win league. This game is a write off. It's not too big a deal if we lose. Especially if we can pick up a win at Chelsea.

We draw: Shows we mean business. First team not to lose at the Etihad this season. Valuable point earned.

We win: Heads explode. Impossible not to look at us as potential title winners. It's unavoidable.

Despite the appearance of a slam-dunk case — Suárez had, after all, admitted using the term ""negro"" in his spat with Evra — there remained questions as to the methodology employed by the English authorities and media. I was particularly surprised at what little interest the UK media had for the Uruguayan context (for starters: negro isn't a pejorative term in Spanish).
Brian Dean, who edits the UK media watchdog site News Frames, had carefully clipped and cataloged the coverage of Suárez's ""crimes"" in the English media. ""The so-called 'quality' newspapers in England,"" Dean said, ""didn't seem interested in the aspects of Suarez's background, which contradicted their own simplistic narrative ... at times the English media exhibited a kind of xenophobia—promoting the notion of 'ignorant' foreigners who didn't have a civilized comprehension of racism. The irony of this seemed to escape them.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_identification

There are already reasonably interesting steps taken with video, in terms of predicting actions based on behavioural cues, electronically.

Consider that, to some extent - and it's expanding - we are cyborgs. We carry around our mobile phones and, the moment something occurs to us or we need some information, out comes our thoughts, through the phone, to Google or whoever.

With Google Glass and other 'lifeblogging' tech, soon everything we see will be saved 'to the cloud' for posterity and government intrusion.

By the end of my life, we will have brain implants that will keep us connected to the internet constantly. What we do and decide today will determine whether our ongoing cyborgification is at the whim and control of large corporations and governments, or whether it is up to the discretion of the individual. A backdoor in your computer or phone is one thing... but in a couple of generations it is not infeasible that there will be backdoors into our brains. 

Open source software, open hardware and government transparency are vital. The history of human civilisation is the history of continual integration into the systems that we have created to sustain us, now those systems are becoming increasingly automated, and we will adapt to that.

It sounds like science fiction, but given the cultural phenomenon of smartphones and how they are used, the internet, and the strides we are taking in (and the funding that is being thrown at) integrating technology into every aspect of our lives, we need to know that technology is a means to empower and inform, rather than what governments want, which is technology as a means for control.",0,1387936048,null,0,false,0,ce9lrvv,t3_1tm043,t1_ce9lrvv,t1_ce9j4e6,null,1427996010,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Having the Doctor *meet* historical figures is one thing.  Having him deliberately changing the lives of people who are very important to Earth's timeline is something else entirely.  Especially since the impact of a world-famous artist on history is, by necessity, going to be chaotic and unpredictable.

Simply put, we have no way of knowing whether a world with Van Gogh in it longer would be better or worse, or what sort of long-term impact it would have on the timeline.

&gt; Hi, and merry Christmas.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm honoured to have a chance to speak to you and your family this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently we learned that our governments, working in concert, have created a system of worldwide mass surveillance watching everything we do. Great Britain's George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information. The types of collection in the book: microphones and videocameras, tv's that watch us, are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go. Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person. A child born today will have no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves; an unrecorded, unanalysed thought, and that's a problem because privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be. The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together we can find a better balance. End mass surveillance and remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is better than spying. For everyone out there listening, thank you and merry Christmas.

If our midfield stop Nasri and Silva playing, then we can limit their attack. I think Glen on the left can keep Navas quiet if one of the aforementioned don't play. Hopefully we'll frustrate City enough that they push Yaya forward, and we catch them on the break. That's the only place I see goals coming from tbh. (or a set piece), how we go about keeping a team that averages 4 goals a game at home though is erm, difficult to say the least. 

They're not impossible to score against, its just trying to stop them from scoring. 

However, after playing the same amount of games in the league this season, we're ahead. So, there's that. Hopefully they're too worried about Suarez and our other players can be the goal scorers, thus removing pressure off Suarez letting him get a cheeky goal.

    Ricardo Carvalho, Petr Čech, Didier Drogba, Paulo Ferreira, Arjen Robben, Michael Essien, Mikel John Obi, Salomon Kalou, Ashley Cole, Michael Ballack, Alex, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Florent Malouda.


Would you call any of these guys flops? Except SWP. 

- Murinho has never made a January transfer as Chelsea manager. So there is no track record off him making bad decisions in January.

I did not bother to check his track record from other clubs, but I hope you get the general idea of my intention behind this post.

Most of the emotional sections of stories that have come out under him have felt very cheap or manipulative.   He doesn't seem to have a good grasp on how to lay the plotting and emotional groundwork necessary for a good weepy scene to really pay off.

Sure, with strings humming away in a minor key and someone pretty looking teary-eyed, you get feels.  But it's just cheap if the reasons for the scene are unjustified, or feel like they were invented solely to force melodrama to happen.

My favorite example:  The episode where, out of nowhere, River Song suddenly starts telling people she's experiencing her relationship with the Doctor in a strictly backwards chronology - despite this having never been stated before - so that they could have that weepy first/last kiss scene.  

And then in the VERY NEXT goddamn episode, they throw that rule to the winds and have the Doctor's first meeting with River in ""Let's Kill Hitler.""

Like, I could have forgiven Moffat inventing the reverse-chronology rule if he'd done something interesting with it going forward.  But inventing it solely to create a single weepy scene in a single episode, then ignoring it the next week and forever after?

true,SoyBotones,null,null,"&gt; This would make sense but the thing is that these players had been around before avb came on.

Keep in mind:

* From 2002 to 2013, FC Porto has won the Primeira Liga **9** of the 11 seasons.
* **5** different managers won the Primeira Liga in this time (Mourinho, Adriaanse, Ferreira, Villas-Boas, Pereira)
* From 2002 to 2013, FC Porto has won the Taca de Portugal **5** of the 11 seasons
* **4** different managers won the Taca de Portugal in this time
(Mourinho, Adriaanse, Ferreira, Villas-Boas)
* The current manager, Fonseca, has Porto in a dead heat for first for the present season, and is the heavy favorite for the Taca de Portugal

I would argue that, given the current wage and revenue structure of the Primeira Liga, and the overall lopsidedness of that league, any *good* manager can win the league, or the cup, and, in one decade, *four different managers have won the double*.

It's also *very* important to note that of the four different managers who've won the double in that time, only Mourinho and Adriaanse have won a league outside of Portugal. (And Adriaanse's only league to win was Austria, with Red Bull).

I mean, I certainly couldn't coach Porto to a double, but there's probably a dozen no-name coaches on the peninsula who could.

So, let's put aside the league win, and the cup win for a moment, and say that, contextually, neither are quite so impressive.

This would mean that the most notable thing about Villas-Boas' 2010-2011 year was the Europa League run (which, I'll agree, was splendid).

So, again, what would make the 2010-2011 Europa League run so damned different?

1. FC Porto are a club normally used to playing in Champions League (of the 11 seasons from 2002 to 2013, Porto were in the Champions League for *9* of them, Europa League is actually an easier competition for them, and something of a step down
2. So, instead of getting knocked out in the quarters by Manchester United or the round of 16 by Schalke or Inter or Chelsea, they're playing against CSKA Moscow and Spartak Moscow, this is, by all accounts, a much easier competition than they're used to
3. And, then add in Joao Moutinho (Sporting's wunderkind) and James Rodriguez, in the summer signing window

I'd like to bring up Falcao again for a second: 

In 2009-2010, Falcao was playing Champions League ball for Porto, and scored 4 goals, against the likes of Arsenal, Atletico, and APOEL (Hulk scored 3)

In 2010-2011, Falcao was playing Europa League ball for Porto, and scored 7 goals in group stage alone, against the likes of Rapid Wien, CSKA Sofia, and Besiktas

Which of these two is the more impressive feat?

true,biggrahamosmond,null,null,"Firstly there is no campus as such - but I guess what you mean is should you live in university owned accommodation or use a private landlord. Personally I would recommend the former; it's much less hassle as the colleges generally make much easier landlords than the private ones, it's also likely to be cheaper, and the accommodation will be designed with student needs in mind.

Noise wise I doubt it would make much difference, as a lot of the university houses are in similar locations to non-university property, although you may be accommodated inside a college rather than in a house, in which case the noise of the town would be somewhat reduced. So overall I'd say go with ""on campus"" i.e. use the college accommodation.

In terms of choosing a college, I'd say that you should pick based on more than the accommodation, since most colleges have a real range of places all over town. All I would say is that at the moment Worcester tends to be highly oversubscribed due to its popularity (at least among undergrads) so they must be doing something right. My friends there say it's a great place to study - they also have massive grounds and a good chance of being isolated from roads etc.

Unfortunately they I only operate in the North - but some big names that are definitely present in London include TimePlan, Protocol, Randstad and Reed. There is also one called ANZUKteachers which might be helpful since they offer services in Australia. (Side note: if you are worried about not getting enough work, other supply teachers register with a couple of agencies to ensure a call each morning.)

In order to work, I was on the youth mobility visa; if you are under 30 it is worth checking out - it is a relatively inexpensive visa that will allow you to work.

As far as challenging students, I have had my fair share of difficult classes! If you find that one school in particular, don't be afraid of letting your agency know that you don't want to return. Your agency will have your interests in mind (since you are bringing in money for them) and not every school will be a good fit for you. If you go to schools which you really like, be sure to let the department you worked with as well as the receptionist know! That way they can ask for you by name when they call your agency.

Best of luck. If you have any more questions, feel free to PM me!

Paradoxes don't seem to occur very often to the Doctor; because he understands that his flight through time and space is meant to be rather non-harmful to the local (time-wise) flora and fauna.  

Changing the course of history much more than 'just being there' can have nasty consequences.  Like when Rose tried to save her dad.  He's brilliant enough to understand that, for example, you can walk on a frozen lake once and probably leave the ice structuraly sound; but hopping about, treading and retreading the same bit will make it crack.  

When something (anything) happens, it usually gets built into the fabric of time -like a floating tire on a lake that freezes over.  With Rory and Amy, the second it happened in the Doctor's timeframe, Amy had already written the book, and had therefore been sucked through time.  It happened to him in the wrong order, but both events had occurred already.   More and more events stacked up on top of that first event- more and more and more tires, straining the time-ice to its limit.  The doctor could try to go back and take that first tire out of the ice, but it is a linchpin for the rest of the personal histories of Amy and Rory.

If you get an early enough train the bacon rolls they do are really tasty. The first class seats are quite comfortable too. I prefer the Super Voyagers to the Pendolinos because of the larger windows on the Voyager stock.

Standard Premier on Eurostar is also very good. It's like a halfway house between first and second class. You get 2+1 first class seats with leather headrests, free drinks and a cold meal served on a proper plate with metal cutlery.

If a keeper decides this, this time it won't be Hart. 

Chelsea have seemed absolutely puzzled by the thought of scoring goals and Mou seems to think he is back at Inter. I think our attacking style can crack what Arsenal could not. Chelsea's counter was very quick, and our attacking defenders could put us in a bad spot, but Chelsea just can't score. 

I'm hopeful for 2 underdog wins. Even if we lose 2, it is 2 away games that very few teams will take points from, so i'm not overly concerned.

true,GodsNavel,null,null,"I like how you down play porto's achievements considering that they're basically a turnstile for players, a talent pool for Europe and a profit mill all together.

Are we talking about avb or Falcao? Because as a player it's kind of unfair that you're trying to take away from Falcao's successes just to try and wedge your point in there. The teams porto faced were among other teams like Napoli, Bayer leverkusen, psg, Sevilla, Villarreal, man city, Dortmund and Liverpool.

Not saying that Falcao could have scored against those teams as easily but if he's facing the victors of those matches I'd say chances are pretty good.

That being said, other than Mourinho, a manager playing the Europa league at the same time as the league let alone the cup is much more stressful.

Cameron might want to win favour with scaremongering 'think of the children' types, but why should these people be allowed to set the agenda? And why should the filter also include categories like [sex, sexuality and gender education content](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bt-internet-filter-gives-parents-option-to-block-gay-and-lesbian-lifestyle-content-9018515.html) or political or 'esoteric' content?",0,1387989156,null,0,false,0,ce9wvwy,t3_1tmkho,t1_ce9wvwy,t1_ce9woq5,null,1427990755,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Seems to be that journalists are distancing themselves from their handling of Liverpool last season (TWO votes for Saurez as Player of the Year by supposedly the most informed viewers of the game in this country). And much like that childish handling of Suarez, Rodgers himself was subjected to a lot of Brent from The Office type treatment for his Rodgersisms. 

I will not be forgetting that stuff too easily. Its good to get good press but, much like unwarranted bad press (more of the vain of the examples up top, I am not referring to bite-gate here as I think that that was justified throughout), we should NOT be getting carried away.

Because of this, we need a point from Chelsea at least.

A bit gutted Sturridge is missing Chelsea, he always gets so fired up against his old clubs. Ah well, we'll just have to make do with Suarez...........

Also, moving on from these fixtures I think that the way the 2nd half of the season's fixtures are lined up means that we could put together a decent run. There's only 1 month where we have any of the bigger teams very close to each other fixtures wise (i.e. we again have City and Chelsea close to each other in April but we have West Ham, Norwich and Palace around them. In March we have Tottenham and United but these fixtures come around the time we play Sunderland and Cardiff). And also, we only have to go away to United.

&gt; Hi, and Merry Christmas. I'm honored to have the chance to speak with you and your family this year.
&gt; 
&gt; Recently, we learned that our governments, working in concert, have created a system of worldwide mass surveillance, watching everything we do.
&gt; 
&gt; Great Britain's George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information. The types of collection in the book -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go.
&gt; 
&gt; Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person. A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They'll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves -- an unrecorded, unanalyzed thought. And that's a problem, because privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.
&gt; 
&gt; The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together, we can find a better balance. End mass surveillance. And remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.
&gt; 
&gt; For everyone out there listening, thank you, and Merry Christmas.",0,1387991581,null,0,false,0,ce9xkdd,t3_1tnzet,t1_ce9xkdd,t3_1tnzet,null,1427990438,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

true,kid_boogaloo,null,null,"Until 2008 I agree with this, but we grew badly stale after that.  I will always appreciate Moyes for turning relegation battlers into a side that competes for top honors, but we grew badly stale in the later.  

Everyone in the world recognized our fantastic start to last year, but our play was one-dimensional and we were badly found out in the second half of the season. Last season we did well in part because Moyes finally benched Neville, but that decision came a few years too late.  

Moyes was simply too set in his ways, Martinez has used Osman more effectively than Moyes by using Osman sparingly. It is a mischaracterization to say that Moyes was all hoof ball, but he was a static manager, late like-for-like predictable substitutions, depending on the same players.  That stability was great earlier on when we were grinding out wins, but in the last few seasons the league has strengthened a lot, and we should have been more ambitious. 

And results don't tell the full story, sure we managed a point at Emirates, but the takeaway is we out passed and outpossessed Arsenal in the first half, and Bobby made the crucial substitution to earn a point.  

Last season everyone lauded our fantastic form going into new years, but we still weren't 2 points off the top.  And it's not like we're nicking points, teams are genuinely afraid to play against us.  

I agree that we shouldn't revise away Moyes' accomplishments but we shouldn't sugar-coat his shortcomings either.  

And I don't think Martinez is perfect, this is the honeymoon and the flaws will show later on. But I've liked everything I've seen.  In previous seasons when I would play Fifa, I would try to play around and find ways to play the way I thought Everton should play.  Now I find myself doing my best to emulate Martinez' style.

We do know that Gallifrey is out there so it's more than likely he can get more regenerations. Especially if you are one who follows the belief that the Baker Cameo in the Day of the Doctor was a future regeneration into a past form. At which point he likely has more than enough regeneration's to not worry about these things.

The said I think moffat's reasoning here is a bit eh. The Doctor knows how many faces he's had so far. 

This is simply what happens when you retcon things.

Plus it's funny he makes the point that it's ""His twelfth body but the eleventh doctor"" when the whole resolution at the end of Day of the Doctor was that the War Doctor deserved to be called doctor. So he technically still is the twelfth doctor in the twelfth body.

I am so nervous for this game, its such a big test for all the players and the manager, its the first meaningful game we have played in forever because if we beat City at home however unlikely that may seem that is a real statement of intent and teams will honestly begin to fear us and take us a lot more seriously.

We need Suarez on top form as he has been recently, I can see him getting double marked maybe even tripled though so it's important that the rest of our midfield, in particular Coutinho take advantage of that.

Our ""wingers"" are inverted wingers. Sterling will make a lot of runs towards the box, and Coutinho will stay back a bit to assist. Sterling will have to play wider too keep our width (I assume Kelly's priority is defence). Johnson has to make runs on the left side.

I am wondering what tactics Brendan Rodgers will apply. Playing on the break is favourable because of Man City's attacking full-backs and Demichelis (although we might be underestimating him). Playing possession-wise is a lot harder, since Man City's midfield is so packed.

I haven't been watching City lately, but I'm sure Rodgers has. Since City is such a strong opponent, it is important to fine-tune the formation/tactics to City's, and not apply generic tactics.

In Rodgers I trust. (Anything less than a comfortable 5‒0 win for us is disappointing).",0,1388000034,null,0,false,0,cea05tp,t3_1tohq8,t1_cea05tp,t1_ce9zsib,null,1427989165,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

PM me if you want any advice on living/studying in Glasgow. Your orientation will teach you quite little, and there's a ton I could tell you about the city/uni that could help you (including stuff I wouldn't post in public). My only advice football-wise: get to some Partick Thistle games... they're in the same neighborhood as the university and now are in the Scottish Prem. It's not the EPL but you can see some top quality football just a short walk across Kelvingrove Park. I know there's Celtic in town but that's pricey and the atmosphere isn't all that much better, unless it's a CL fixture, which Celtic will have none of this spring.

You can make a SSL handshake on any port

While you can indeed do this, the nature of an SSL connection is still sometimes determinable in limited circumstances. If not by standard TCP information then due to traffic analysis - although I am not aware of any DPI system which goes this far. However I do recall a research article where words spoken over VOIP were recomposed despite the use of TLS.

I concede if anyone is bothering to do this for an individual user, then it won't be long until game over for them regardless. However your original point is people could start up their own VPN services as and when. A point I agree with... but would only lead to whack-a-mole much like we have with torrent sites. If they wished, they could go further and start determining unauthorised VPN services automatically until the point where it becomes too technically difficult for either end users or VPN administrators.

&gt;All they care about is sending fake DNS responses

All the ISPs care about is doing the absolute minimum - they really have no interest in this business at all (hence their  opposition to previous legislative attempts). What I do not understand however, is why they are bothering at all. They could have told Cameron where to go in unison, and to just let him carry out his threat of legislation, betting on it being defeated. Instead they fell back, and I honestly am not entirely sure why.

That said, a few ISPs do go considerably over DNS based blocking. VM for example use IP blocking.
