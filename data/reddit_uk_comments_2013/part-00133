To my surprise he promptly winds down his window and says without thinking twice: 'Scuse me love d'you know where't nearest chinky is?'

This Southern lady recoiled, her sensibilities clearly offended. 'I beg your pardon?' she said. My dad's brain caught up with his mouth, he goes bright red, starts to sweat at his brow, doesn't notice that the lights have gone green, me and grandad are both staring at the ceiling. 'I mean, do you know happen to know where there might be a Chinese restaurant?'

She's deigns to give this contrite Northern racist some directions, but my dad is now being beeped at from behind. He has to pull over to the roadside after the junction and jogrun 50 yards back to her for 3 minutes of typical British awkwardness: the old slightly-uncertain direction giving and following pretend comphrension of incomprehensible directions.

He runjogs back to the car, gets in, he's out of breath, and still red in the face, 'For fucks sake son, don't do that again!' I don't understand, 'Do what?'

DHP is short term, discretionary and must be claimed, and then re-claimed when it expires. It is a temporary sticking plaster for some people.

I have a client that I saw last week in mind. She isn't 'feckless', she did nothing wrong and she used to work. Her brain went pop one day. She has brain damage from a haemorrhage. While she may appear functional at first she really can't deal with things and often has overwhelming anxiety and depression. The council now have a court order to evict her and she will count as intentionally homeless, with no duty on the council to re-house her. I have managed to get them to allow a fortnight to try and sort things out before they enforce it. Her rent arrears are caused solely by under-occupancy/Bedroom Tax but there is no suitable cheaper social housing currently available to move to, certainly none that will keep her in range of her support network. She is caught in a perfect storm of cuts in support to the disabled. She lost her ESA after the rules were tightened and was badly advised by the DWP so she has had no income other than £40pw DLA since January. She did manage a DHP claim for a while, which she had to spend on food so rent arrears continued. That expired but we now have a fresh claim in, as well as an appeal on her ESA claim, which will take months (I have clients whose appeals were lodged a year ago). 

She needs and will always need someone to hold her hand with her affairs. But unless suitable accommodation appears someone is going to have to keep making DHP claims and hoping that they are accepted. If she gets her ESA back it will be reviewed and removed again by ATOS in a few months so I will be back at appeal. Or rather I won't because legal aid to support people with disabilities was abolished and I am about to lose my job, so I don't know who will support her. And DLA is being abolished and replaced with PIP. That is based on an ESA style assessment by ATOS or Capita so she will probably lose that as well and somebody, somewhere will have to help her appeal that, but I really have no idea who that is going to be.

In Australia, asking someone ""are you alright?"" is usually done when both parties know that something is wrong and the person wants to know if you are coping with a bad situation.

Whether it was economical to do so -- that's a different matter.

Yes, increased investment, funded by debt can be a good thing, but only if the investment also generates a return great enough to repay the loan.

Borrowing to invest in long term physical infrastructure is generally very wise as the cost can be spread over the lifetime of the asset. New schools, roads, railways, hospitals -- certainly should be debt funded.

There are also well understood economic models used to calculate if a new road will pay for itself in economic impact.

But, does borrowing money to pay the wages of nurses boost the long term GDP output by enough to pay off the debt? Certainly, some spending on wages boosts long term GDP in for example, faster medical care = back to work sooner, and that is a compound growth.

But is it enough growth to repay the debt? I don't know. In fact, it's a damn difficult question to get an answer for!

Yet it seems to me that it should be the first question that gets answered.

Same with a bash hat. You can spend 3, 4, 500 quid on a bash hat, but an 80 quid one will protect you just about as well.

We have provided safe haven to many who have needed it and always fought for what we believe is right. Of course there are always exceptions to the rule.

I haven't lived in the UK for the last 15 years, I live in what is supposed to be one of the world's ""best"" country. Only I feel, maybe in a biased way, that the UK is a better place to live overall. Many people who are non UK natives tell me they feel this way too after having visited a few times.

I get tired sometimes of people, especially the natives concentrating on the negatives about the UK or saying they want to leave, just because they can and it's considered a bit cool to bitch about the UK. If they want to leave they should, and get a real experience of how it is to live elsewhere. I am eternally grateful to my mother country, had I been born somewhere else I would most likely be dead right now (I grew up with a single monther where ends never met). I got an education up to post degree level without paying anything - infact I got a grant. I know things have changed since then, but I still see the UK a a great place to live.

I hope to live again in the UK in the future.

At 36 mph you are above the speed limit and above the leeway usually afforded you to make up for inaccurate speedos and I suspect that the only reason you didn't get a ticket is that they didn't have accurate proof of your transgression.

The six week holiday is too long. You forget a lot of the stuff you learned the last term over the 6 week holiday. It would be much nicer if the 6 week holiday was shortened, and other holidays were lengthened slightly (make it so summer holiday is 3 weeks, and each half term is now 2 weeks, for example), so children get more used to work like schedules, and they don't forget as much stuff over the holidays. 

However, Gove has managed to get his dirty little fingers on it again.

true,TheKingMonkey,eng-warwickshire,Birmingham,"I've been thinking about this comment for a while now, and it has made me see why American people grab their ancestors heritage so fiercely and think of themselves as Irish even if they only have one great grandparent from Dublin who emigrated to the USA at the age of 22. 

My dad did a genealogy thing a few years ago and traced his side of the family all the way back to the Battle of Bosworth Field (1485, end of the civil war, Richard III and *""a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse""*) while my wife was born in London to Indian immigrants.  She considers herself every bit as British as I am.  

The different attitudes are two sides of the same coin, aren't they?  If you are American then really you are living in a country where almost **everybody** is an immigrant so the issue of being an outsider isn't really there and therefore you get your sense of identity from where your blood came from (and yeah, pick the one with the best story even if it isn't where most of your blood came from) while here it is the opposite.  The vast majority of the population can trace their lineage back hundreds and hundreds of years with ease so people trying to come into that probably can't afford to identify themselves as being from the old country as much if they want to fit in.   Ironically they probably keep the traditions of the old country a bit more rigorously though.

true,vishbar,eng-hampshire,Yank in Winchester,"Yes, but the circumstances are different. US politics, for a very long time, was defined on immigrant lines. In addition, Irish and Italian immigrants to the USA made a specific effort not to assimilate to the mainstream American culture: traditions were kept and passed down, people lived in ghettos unique to their ethnic group, and traditional foods were cooked. This led to American Irish Catholics becoming a unique ethnic group and political unit.

People in the United States claiming to be Irish (they're really saying Irish-American) are acknowledging the huge role their Irish ethnicity played in their family. In addition, it is a signal that they've grown up in a specific environment. While yes, you may have had an Irish great-grandparent, you did not grow up in a specific subculture *defined* by your family's immigration history.

American immigration history, especially at the turn of the 20th century, is a pretty fascinating topic.

Farming is basically creating and selling the ultimate in commodity products. Milk, carrots, potatoes - they're frigging potatoes FGS, what exactly were you expecting?

As with any commodity product, the profit margin to the manufacturer (or farmer in this case) is razor-thin.

So thin, in fact, that it's virtually impossible to earn a good living if you are also paying rent on much of your land or if you have a whacking great bank loan to pay off.

The majority of farmers who are still sticking at it bought land thirty years ago, have long since paid off any mortgage and have relatively few debts. But while the money coming in is just about enough to feed the family, it sure as hell isn't enough to jet off to Spain for two weeks every year - any excess cash really needs to go back into the farm because if you don't work to improve efficiency every year, you're going to be completely buggered if your costs go up some time before the price paid for your goods goes up.

And they can't sell their land to realise any of this ""wealth"": nobody with half a brain will take on the debt necessary to buy the land, the return on investment is too small for an investor to buy it and besides, without that land they can't earn a regular living. Many farmers don't really have the qualifications to do much else.

true,TheMania,null,null,"The UK is in a position not at all comparable to Sudan's.

Sudan's debt is nearly entirely *external*, ie denominated in USD or [SDR's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights). Via this kind of borrowing a nation can live beyond its means, and its ability to afford its debt can come into question by markets leading to an increase in rates. Eventually it has to be repaid with high interest - and to repay foreign lending this means the Sudanese will need to, some day in the future, run trade surpluses to bring enough foreign currencies in to pay back the debt. It means working in factories and not even getting to keep what you produce, having to ship it off-shore instead.

The UK's debt though? It's entirely denominated in pounds. It's simply the non-government's net savings, viewed on the other side of the accounting ledger. Every year the non-government manages to net save, by receiving more in income than it pays the government in taxes, the debt increases. It's why Osborne hasn't been able to stop the deficits despite every attempt - because he has been failing at stopping us from net saving.

There's no ""crippling debt"" on future generations, only ""cripping policies"" - policies that attempt to force the deficit down from where it needs to be for full employment (described well in parable form [here](http://heteconomist.com/parable-of-a-monetary-economy/)) due to ignorance. Ignorance of the fact that the Bank of England sets how much interest we pay and not the market (for short-term debt at least, and long-term debt issuance is entirely optional for the government). We will never be ""forced"" to pay down the debt any more than Japan has been.

Additionally, the interest we pay is quite simply the subsidy on savings we all receive on our savings accounts when rates are positive (and, today, on 10yr fixed interest accounts etc), it's just an integral part of monetary policy. There's no need to fear interest, nor deficits, not debt.

Basically though, two main premises that everyone needs to understand (or at least consider):

1. The only way GBP enters circulation is through debt, and so the *only* way we can all net save in GBP/GBP-denominated bonds simultaneously is via government deficits. Deficits add to our savings, surpluses remove. That's why ""paying back the debt"" seems so impossible - it'd be a destruction of our entire savings, and also why it's quite natural for the public sector to be in net debt.

2. As long as the market reasons that the government would sooner print than default, it need never do neither - and this is straightforward to show. If you have GBP to lend, and the government promises it'd sooner print than default, then there is simply no safer entity you can loan GBP to - as whether or not the government prints affects you all the same, however if you loan to anyone else you have risk of default *in addition* to any perceived risk of inflation. Accordingly, as long as the market reasons this to be the case (as it does all free floating currency issuing nations, ie America/Japan), the government always gets risk-free interest rates - rates set by the central bank itself (for short term, long-term is expectations of short-term rates over the tenor of the bond).

Add the two together and you realise that the constraint on government spending is not taxation revenue, but inflation even if it's paying for spending via selling of bonds, and not printing of cash. If the government tries to buy more than is for sale, tries to hire more labour than there is, etc, prices will rise (or, with a central bank, interest rates). Revenue just does not come into it, because no one with pounds to lend is going to check the UK government's books before deciding that there's no safer GBP denominated investment than a gilt. They just know it is, because the government's got the sole access to the printing press. Markets simply do not assess free floating currency issuers as running out of the currency they issue.

Unfortunately for those on the Euro, they gave up monetary sovereignty. There government borrowing *is* like household borrowing, and credit card analogies are appt. When you're setting your own interest rates, they are not.

true,ianvisits,null,null,"&gt; I broadly agree. But then that depends upon the projected time scale of the debt. Which is not something I fully understand. 

That is one of the big problems with government debt -- it is rarely repaid, just rolled over.

For example, they might ""sell"" bonds to investors worth £500 million, with a maturity of 7 years. Ideally, you then spend the next seven years putting aside a bit of cash to repay the bond with it matures.

What actually happens is that in seven years time, the government sells another £500 million bond to repay the old one and just rolls over the debt for another few years.

In some economic theories, that isn't a problem as GDP growth erodes the net impact of the debt, but it only does that in terms of affordability -- ie, debt as percentage of GDP -- it does nothing to actually pay off the debt.

So we keep borrowing, and rolling over debt and hoping that some magic money tree will somehow spring up at some point in the future that will allow us to eventually start paying off the debt.

It's just not sustainable.

&gt; My point was further away from borrowing money vs taxation and more towards the point that, as a society, many of the things we want to spend money on are economically unsound, but morally necessary

Yes -- no problem with us making the decision to fund those. And we should be the ones picking up the bills as well.

Moths making holes in a cloak—

Working our works out of view—

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;Fairly certain, on one of the wikis, that the Moment is revealed as a modified De-Mat gun (considered the most powerful weapon that the Time Lords had, and The Doctor built one / took one, and modified it).

This is from a comic/novel though so not official by any means.

&gt;And I am also fairly certain that, perhaps one of the Time Lords, has mentioned that the Doctor still posses it.

They mention it in the End of Time : ""the Doctor still posses the Moment and we know what he intends to do with it... He will destroy Timelords and Daleks alike"" which is obviously referring to the Timewar, not the aftermath.

&gt;But that's the thing, it is something the Doctor would be ashamed of doing: committing genocide. He's a healer, someone who fixes things...to resort to destroying something is to admit defeat, that there was no other way. It's the equivalent of a thief using dynamite to open a safe -&gt; if a thief has to do this, and in doing so, ruins everything within, the thief has 'won' only in a very empty way. And that's also what was driving him loony later on -&gt; the Doctor thought that he had mad a terrible sacrifice (his people, and those of his enemy), but that it was over and done with; instead, he finds out that he sacrificed his people, and many of the enemy...but that the enemy is still out there.

Yeah no, he has comitted genocide countless of times because it was right. Even since the Time War the species just keep tacking on and on. 

&gt;You've probably watched Torchwood, and seen the episode where Jack sacrifices a few children to buy peace / freedom for Earth from unknown invaders; at the times, Jack knew it was morally wrong, but that was something he was wiling to live with...because the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few; well, those aliens came back for more...and Jack realized that the original sacrifice wasn't the end of things, but the beginning. The Doctor is no different here...he realized, like many have, that sacrificing leads only to more sacrifices. Or as Hans Christian would put it, that ash tree the other trees offered up to save themselves became the handle of the axe to cut the rest of them down.

And yet he continues to do this. :)

&gt;The Doctor does not want to be The Warrior, get me? But he often times gets dragged into the role. Remember Demon's Run, where that girl said that the name doctor didn't mean healer to her people, but great warrior? And the look of his face when he heard that?

Sure, but it's part of him anyway. And when you think about it, depending on the context, the two are effectively the same. If there are creatures that cannot be fixed or healed and are bent on killing everyone else, then the warrior is the healer.

&gt;Why I don't believe this

No quotes, I don't need to tell you that papers are making up rumours between spurs and clubs.

Poor source, who is dailystar? They are the guys running ""Spurs to hijack Mkhasodif from Liverpool"".

Player has constantly said he is happy currently. If this was a player, like Gomez who is obviously on the way out, then I would believe that Levy is planning an approach. But this guy is making it harde to take him from Valencia as he constantly is quoted as saying he wants to earn CL back with them.

Sideways move (arguable). Valencia are in the same boat as spurs, they are on the cusp of CL and want in.

&gt; Why I believe this

Spurs would be stupid not to throw bids like this at the likes of Gomez, Soldado, Kiessling etc. You can only catch a fish if you cast a line, the worst they can say is no. Soldado is 10x the player Damiao is, if spurs could land him cheaper they would be stupid not to. 

He would be a perfect fit. He can hold the ball up well (read: Involve Bale) and he is a clinical finisher. He is also CL experienced.

Valencia have been bumped out of the CL. I know we aren't in it, but they lose that trump card. 

Good way to scare Barca/Villa. They are holding out for £10m+ so spurs show they are happy to shop elsewhere for that kind of money. I doubt this is true, the leak would probably come through a different source. ",0,1372766607,null,0,false,0,caufgj9,t3_1hhp5g,t1_caufgj9,t3_1hhp5g,null,1430610194,22,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,22

The primary argument used for immigration used now is basically that you're racist if you don't want it. That isn't an argument that promotes immigration, it's one that attacks opponents.

In a country where house prices were already high, we know have landlords who know that they can get £60 a week per person by squeezing 8 people in a 2 bedroomed apartment (meaning house prices get pushed even higher).

They do the jobs people don't want? As little as 8 years ago we didn't have problems filling jobs for supermarkets, hotels, fast food places. This hasn't changed. Wages get kept rock bottom because they can afford to live on minimum wages because they accept living conditions deemed unacceptable to UK citizens.

Raising the minimum wage wouldn't help either. A lot of young people took these jobs in the past, either as part time jobs to fit around education or as stopgaps, not for careers. If costs go up through minimum wage increases, stores are even less likely to want to take on short term and part time workers (who have high overhead costs) in favour of eastern European workers who'll work full time for longish periods. British workers looking to make a career in these industries will suffer further as there'll be less pay rises to counter the increased costs.

Er, what? The effect of inflation upon your investment is a major concern. Except for annuities and other funds which must buy bonds the only reason for keeping money in bonds now is for liquidity the rate of return is deplorable. 

The issue is not one of running out of money, since as you rightly point out the printing presses are good to go, the problem is that inflating away debt is just as painful as deficit cutting. Otherwise, the 70s and 80s would have been a great time since inflation was high - as was interest rates. 

For many investors it is also about the relative safety of value not the paper itself. If I am assured of always getting back £100 that I invested then brilliant, but the risk is very different if I know that people will run to the printing presses so that, for example, my £100 which was worth $160 is now only worth $50.

Most police forces used it more or less for the purpose for which it was stated. Had the abuse been the ""aim"" of the power, then surely such use would have been more mainstream?

The Met didn't come up with s44, so the fact they then abused it, as they have abused most powers they get given, doesn't change the ""aim"" of the measure, which was to give police enhanced powers to deal with terrorism.

Basically I don't think it was a power cynically drafted by politicians, with the aim of targetting all crime.

In the UK?  I'm not sure where you're getting that impression.  It is taxed quite heavily.  APD for instance, then the airport tax, is normally the majority of my ticket price when flying internationally.

So I had a quick google!

First link is this:
http://www.foe.co.uk/cymru/english/press_releases/uk_aviation_public_subsidy.html

Which is the biggest load of horse shit.  Where can I buy AVGAS without that the tax?!  Seriously, it costs three times as much in the UK as it does in the US per litre.  Now if your a big international firm, and buy fuel in another country, it is covered by the Chicago Convention, meaning the UK can not apply extra tax.  As is, last time I filled up with some avgas, it cost £1.82 per litre.

They then talk about VAT but don't appear to understand that companies net that shit off.  If I buy 300 servers, I'm not paying VAT on them, but I charge VAT to my clients.  As a business I make profit, that means my charge to clients must be higher than server cost, this means more tax is paid overall.

I could go through the rest of them, but another google shows someone has done a nicer job than I would:
http://www.flightmapping.com/james-blog/aviation-subsidies-myths-and-facts

It is very irksome, that as a nation which has done so much for flight, we make it very hard for people to get in to the industry.  Being a student in the UK for the European syllabus costs over double, if not three times, what it costs to be in the US learning the USA syllabus, which in some ways is better (the basic qualification demands more things, such as night rating, the standard syllabus demand more visits to airports, which in the UK charge extortionate fees, in the US do not charge students.)

2nd of all, I don't really see Paulinho having to compete with Schweinsteiger and Khedira for his position, so saying Bender doesn't start really has no comparative value with Paulinho, because they aren't playing for the same position/team. You know who else doesn't start for their national team? Juan Mata. So that's two moron points for you.

The fact of the matter is a few things: One, Paulinho isn't a bad player, but he's a Spuds-level-hilariously uninspiring choice of player to spend your record transfer fee on. Central midfield help has to be around the last of your needs anyways. Of course knowing Spurs supporters' complete inability to separate fact from reality, I fully expect to see the /r/coys camp start drumming up Paulinho's Ball'on d'or campaign the minute he completes a forward pass. Three moron points for you

Also, AVB is a fucking joke when he has money to spend. Remember Chelsea? Maybe if he spent less time combing his hair and claiming Arsenal were in a 'downward spiral' and then promptly choking his CL position away, he'd learn a thing or two about managing and having a better result than Harry Redknapp. Four moron points for you

I understand you feel the need to respond to Arsenal banter and all that and defend your team and whatnot. I get it. No matter how stupid of a decision breaking your club's record fee for Paulinho is, you gotta defend it because you're a spud and spuds stick together. 

But seriously, what's the plan? Throwing Dembele at CAM? That's AVB's big idea? Breaking his club's record transfer fee so you all can see Dembele at CAM? Yikes. Embarrassing. Five moron points for you.

Dembele - Paulinho

Lennon - Holtby - Bale

Striker

Anatomy was a science feared and hated by most, which is why we condemned certain criminals to be anatomised.  The problem was, there weren't enough executed criminals, so people just stole corpses from wherever they could get them.

In order to stop this, the government changed the law and allowed medical science access to the poor.  The safeguards put in place were easily avoided, and the result was that if you were poor (ie in a workhouse) and hadn't put any money aside for your funeral, you knew you'd end up on the table, being chopped up.  That was a terrifying thought for most people, since they believed that you took your body with you into the afterlife.  That's one of the many reasons why people were so terrified of going to the workhouse.

true,EnglishMD,null,null,"Hypothetical bollucks presented as irrefutable fact. The conspiracy theories regarding the 'safe-haven' of owning a football club is a ridiculous premise anyway. Why not bring up Roman's huge investment in Chukotka, his sponsorship of Russian football, paying Guus Hiddink's salary personally so that the Russian National Team had the best, his lack of conflict with the government and several other pro-Putin moves. These are some of the reasons why Putin and Abramovich remain close, why Putin refused his offer of resignation from the Governorship of Chukotka

If it's not the presumption of conveying the private thoughts of a secretive individual, the misrepresentation of the Berezovsky case then it's the oddly certain way he presents his outlandish theories. I have no idea how he came to the PSG/Man City and war in the Middle East conclusion. If he's suggesting that those clubs are investment vehicles to safeguard assets in the event of a conflict (which would almost certainly cause oil prices to skyrocket, the opposite of what Syed is saying they are guarding against) then it makes no sense, since each club is essentially a black hole of funding that is worth as much as someone is willing to pay, all things considered that may not be too high a valuation. Surely anyone with a functioning brain would be investing in real estate, a diverse investment portfolio and other tangible assets throughout the world. These clubs are vanity projects and advertising vehicles for their owners, pure and simple. Through friends of friends, I've met some of the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, mainly younger male members who live in London and New York. The Saudis have been looking at clubs, as have other members of various ruling families across the region. It isn't about a love of football, it's a sense of competition between distant family members

The comments on the other submission are literally too stupid and misinformed to even discuss. A large number of people who've never experienced the kind of world they are seemingly so accustomed to they can comment with gusto

Edit: Completely slipped my mind, perhaps Syed should lay off the hors d'oeuvres next time he's at the Bridge, if he's so uncomfortable with how the money used to pay for them was earned. As a friend texted me earlier, this could be abstractly simplified to ""Bitter Muslim City fan blasts Jewish owner of Chelsea"".

Saying that though there are good teachers who really put the hours in and then some freeloading swines who put the bare minimum in and what they do do is entirely geared towards test scores. 

 20 years on and I can't remember a damn thing about what my English classes were like other than that our teacher was boring. I would like to say we copied stuff down or something but I genuinely don't have a clue what I spent a huge chunk of my teenage years on.  English literature on the other hand I can remember with absolute clarity because our teacher was enthusiastic to the point of near crazy.  We would read the books as a class but she would adapt the important sections into plays herself and have us read them. With Shakespeare she spent hours and hours actually teaching us what all the words meant with an emphasis on the dirty words to get us hooked. 

I owe this woman a lot as she was the one who introduced us to translated Latin texts and not our history teacher,  I loved Cicero's [fuck you speeches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippicae) to Marc Anthony  so much I learned to read them in the original  and went on to Roman history academia.

Oh yeah, I too remember the glorious days when Britain had no working class people or single mothers. 

&gt; Have you ever been to another country or seen another culture? Things are not the same everywhere you go... and some who come into the country do not appreciate the differences.

Kudos, you've managed to be both patronising and ignorant in one sentence. 

And if someone has made it to the point where they're in the UK and applying for permanent residency, it's a little far fetched to suggest that they're unaware that things are done differently here.

&gt;  The value of teaching them about the Battle of Hastings over how Britain runs as a country seems ridiculous to me. 

Why? The BoH was a hugely important event. It was the time when England went from being a semi-tribal collection of Thanedoms bound by blood-oaths to a coherent European-style feudal monarchy. It was the founding of England as we know it.

Since people who move here are planning to live among, or maybe even become, English people then it seems prudent to learn about this defining moment. The significance is cultural - you wouldnt move to the US and refuse to learn about the American war of independence, would you?

&gt; I've lived in England all my life and I can't recall the last time I needed some fact from a history lesson. 

You don't *need* history, just as you don't *need* art, books or any of the humanities. If you don't see the value of these things then you are a hollow human being.

true,mfanning1990,ZW,zimbabwe,"Right, it seems like everyone is just reacting with their own opinions on what is going on here, and because it's Reddit, I feel like this is being blown way out of proportion, so I will include some facts and my opinions:

Yelstin and shares for loans:

* In 1995, as Yeltsin struggled to finance Russia's growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for his bid in the early-1996 presidential elections, the Russian president prepared for a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. The program was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatization and ensuring the government a much-needed infusion of cash for its operating needs.  
* The privatization of state enterprises was a unique opportunity, because it gave many of those who had gained wealth in the early 1990s a chance to convert it into shares of privatized enterprises.
 
* In exchange for the loans, the state handed over assets worth many times as much. Under the terms of the deals, if the Yeltsin government did not repay the loans by September 1996, the lender acquired title to the stock and could then resell it or take an equity position in the enterprise. The first auctions were held in the fall of 1995. The auctions themselves were usually held in such a way so to limit the number of banks bidding for shares and thus to keep the auction prices extremely low. By summer 1996, major packages of shares in some of Russia's largest firms had been transferred to a small number of major banks, thus allowing a handful of powerful banks to acquire substantial ownership shares over major firms at shockingly low prices. These deals were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a few powerful, well-connected, and wealthy financial groups.

Morally, it was a bit grey, but it was nothing illegal, but this is how he made a large majority of his cash:

* In 1995, Abramovich and Boris Berezovsky, an associate of President Boris Yeltsin, acquired the controlling interest in the large oil company Sibneft. The deal was within the controversial loans-for-shares program and each partner paid US$100 million for half of the company, below the stake's stock market value of US$150 million at the time, and rapidly turned it up into billions. The fast-rising value of the company led many observers, in hindsight, to suggest that the real cost of the company should have been in the billions of dollars.

[The aluminium wars are way too long and complicated to get into but the gist of it is this.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2003/jul/06/russia.football)
 
Key Highlights:


*Friends of Berezovsky recall that Abramovich likes a challenge more than vast wealth. They say his decision to serve as governor in the remote province of Chuchotka was such a challenge. They say his involvement with Chelsea will likewise be a challenge. But he can have faced no greater challenge in his professional career than when he took on Russia's aluminium industry.

Now onto the speculation:

* Both Abramovich and Berezovsky were in the Duma (the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia (parliament), the upper house being the Federation Council of Russia.) 
* Abramovich, with his eyes and ears close to the ground, understand that Putin is going to make some changes and he might as well be on his side. 
* Berezovsky opposes him, steps down from the Duma and fucks off to the UK. Coincidentally, this is around the time that abramovich and him properly fall apart. 
* Litvinenko is poisoned. Berezovsky and the UK blame the FSB, they blame Berezovsky
* Abramovich becomes governer of Chukotka in 2000, the year Putin becomes president, they are said to have a great relationship, but Abramovich has little influence on him. 
* As soon as Berezovsky leaves, the government sell some of his companies. 
* Neither are tried for their crimes, however, other oligarchs are. 
* Why buy a football club if all of your money is going to be taken away and you are going to prison?
* You may be high profile, but as a Russian national living in a country, if they want you dead, you would probably be dead. Putin does not care, he helped overthrow Gorbachev for a new capitalist Russia.

exactly. when was the last time a national tv station broadcast a message instructing christians to go to church?

Classical sentiment made by cynics.

Just so you know, being cynical does not mean you are wise or have some profound outlook on life.

If our goal in life is to work, reproduce and consume then why do we have entertainment industries? Why do people have interest in the arts? Why do we visit museums? Why do we read books? Why are we interested in questions such as ""Are we alone in the universe?"" or ""Why are we here?""? Why do people find comfort in religion? Why do people care about the nature of their social structure around them? What drove scientists such as Einstein, Newton or Heisenberg?

We are more than machines, and while our primal instincts are found in many aspects of our nature, our evolved intelligence has brought us to surpass these instincts in huge ways.

That's not a Christian ritual though, is it?

&gt;Furthermore it is not just a call (like church bells ringing) it is words carrying an explicit message; there is one god (allah) and Muhammad is his messenger. come to prayer now. god is great. on national uk tv from a public service broadcaster.

So the bit you're objecting to is the bit where it tells Muslims to come to prayer. The rest of it is basically a hymn, which, as we've established, you don't object to.

&gt;it is a bit like that, if this song was broadcast daily at the same time, and was always the same song, and the song told people to go to church. I suppose that would be a bit like what channel 4 are doing.

And...what? You're afraid you might hear it and get brainwashed into going to a mosque? Don't watch Channel 4 for a grand total of about 20 minutes every day if you're that concerned.

So your argument is that because it was that way before, it's not a problem that it's still that way now? Awesome. 

&gt; Kudos, you've managed to be both patronising and ignorant in one sentence.

Since you don't seem to grasp the division between cultures and how something we take for granted may be totally alien behaviour to someone coming into the country - I don't think it's patronising at all. 

&gt; And if someone has made it to the point where they're in the UK and applying for permanent residency, it's a little far fetched to suggest that they're unaware that things are done differently here.

Citation please. Living near the local University I've seen Chinese students go through their entire 3+ year degrees here and *still* have trouble running out into traffic because they don't understand traffic lights. You'd think it would be obvious - but don't underestimate it - or that some people might not *want* to change their way of doing things. 

&gt; Since people who move here are planning to live among, or maybe even become, English people then it seems prudent to learn about this defining moment. The significance is cultural - you wouldnt move to the US and refuse to learn about the American war of independence, would you?

There's nothing wrong with learning about it - there's everything wrong with prioritising it *above* fitting into modern society. We are not in feudal England and the BoH wasn't last year. If you want people - entire families - to integrate well with indigenous British people, start with modern society and how to survive in it - then work backwards. 

&gt; You don't need history, just as you don't need art, books or any of the humanities. If you don't see the value of these things then you are a hollow human being.

See above. History is important - but not *as* important to every day functionality as knowing how to register with an NHS doctor or how to make sure you're on the right tax code. 

&gt; You'll never learn any of it from a book though.

Considering you can learn how to sign on with an NHS doctor or to find your tax code or whatever other modern society skills you need from the internet or fliers or similar - yes - you really can learn this from what equates to a book. 

What continues to surprise me is that you value ""a willingness to learn about our culture"" above the actual information needed to survive in the UK without being a burden on the system. Yes it would be nice if everyone coming into the country took an interest in Queen Victoria but frankly we barely expect it from our children so it's a long shot to expect it from anyone coming here because it offers a better quality of life. 

That effort would be better spent - once again - making sure anyone coming here is well informed in how Britain operates in modern times so that they have all the tools they need to become a part of this country without friction or issue. That will place a much smaller burden on our infrastructure and personally that is way more beneficial than whether that person can tell me about the Black Plague or the development of radar along the south downs.

We know the Doctor retained some (possibly all) of his memories from Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS, so it wouldn't be at all surprising if the TARDIS also remembered those events.

JttCotT is one of only a handful of instances in which the TARDIS's internal time has been twisted and folded in on itself. It was deeply painful and scary for the TARDIS - she was injured, trapped, and pointlessly attacked by invaders who just wanted to steal parts of her. As the Doctor said, she was a panicking animal, growling at them.

And Clara provides a link back to that sequence of events. She shouldn't be able to remember any of it, but she can, which means Clara's personal timeline is wedged in the temporal wound of JttCotT. More than that, though, Clara held the solution which would have prevented the whole mess in her hands *and didn't use it.*

As far as Sexy is concerned, JttCotT *is always happening*. Clara isn't just a reminder of it, she's the primary event conduit which keeps those events tangled up in their timelines. She's covered in paradox, and worst of all, *she reeks of the Doctor's gravesite.* from Sexy's perspective, Clara not only defiled/will defile his tomb, she also mutilated/will mutilate his corpse.

Frankly, I'm surprised at Sexy's restraint.

As for the Clara who had a chat with the first Doctor: Jumping into the Doctor's time streams didn't teleport uncountable Claras into time as fully grown adults. It created timelines for those Claras to be born and live a continuous life which led to the events experienced by that instance of Clara.

A lot of students go home and work fulltime to save some money to get back out of their overdraft in that time (or get themselves financially ahead for the long first term).

It's also much more our choice as to what we decide to do, I think, if we wish to delve into our studies over summer or not. Sure, kids have the choice but I don't think it's the same in a way. Most things they learn might not be their interest and/or choice so naturally they're not going to follow it up.

That the system has improved is not proof that it works, and that the system works is not proof that it works well: the organ donation rates of countries which favour opt-out systems is provably higher than that of those which favour opt-in.

From Wikipedia's [article on organ donation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation#Opt-in_vs._opt-out):

&gt;Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation.^([1]) For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%.^([1][2])

If you stretch to £36/month you get 2000 mins, 5000 texts, unlimited data, and you're allowed to tether which means you can use the phone to supply your PC/laptop/Mac with an Internet connection.

If you can settle for an older smartphone, then they do the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini for £20/month with 100 mins and 5000 texts, £23/month for 500 mins and 5000 texts, or £26/month for 2000 mins 5000 texts and tethering.

When you (general you) stop judging them purely on goals and just watch their entire play, you'll notice that Ba actually still brings quite a bit to the position.  He can knock balls down off goal kicks (Torres can't), he has pretty good technique in tight spaces (Torres doesn't), he doesn't try to beat people since that's not his game (Torres does and fails), he doesn't have the first touch of a brick wall.  He's just a better all-around player that still had a similar goals output against significantly consistently better opposition.  Plus don't forget all those goals he scored for Newcastle while this sub was ready to call it quits on Torres before January.

Watching Torres last season, almost half the time the ball was passed to him, it ended up with the opposition.  It was just absurd.

The use of people who were already very well trained by the days standard, (for example the 36th (Ulster) division received no formal training and was the only Pal division to achieve all their objectives on the first day of the Somme) to protect their communities and country is of course as you say a travesty. There was a great number of jobs held over in the RUC for Catholics (the same percentage as the general population) not to mention most of the full time RUC were made up of members of the RIC, so at the very least had experience.

So the Ulster Special Constabulary, which was formed in response to a completely different force intent on imposing a government on an unwilling people, not to mention the persecution of those people in the progress, especially in border areas. Recruiting members who were already very well trained, and willing to use their training was the natural conclusion. So the USC was not such a horrible thing just badly managed, mainly due to the low members of Catholics in the ranks (with many that were receiving scorn from their own communities) meaning that Catholic areas were rarely patrolled by locals and others had to be drafted in from elsewhere which did lead to problems.

If someone was born a man and had a penis, and subsequently had it removed, I would say that the majority of people would consider them male, no matter how womanlike they seemed, hence the term transgender.

You can bring up intersex to make your point but there is a difference between someone with a physical condition which leaves their sex indeterminate and someone who was a man/woman and subsequently changed their gender by choice.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is the kind of ridiculously xenophobic comment you often see on top of r/worldnews. The Saudi situation is outrageously grim, even I as a muslim who plans to keep Ramadhan will admit, as will any other sane human being. The Saudis are to many Muslims in the UK basically what extremely right-wing American christians are to Anglicans here. Basically nutjobs.

Funnily enough when Buddhists or Hindus heck even some Christians fast no one calls it a ""barbaric stone age ritual"". People think it quaint, but when muslims do it suddenly it becomes an attack on the UK's liberties. I don't believe in god but I still plan on fasting during Ramadan-- the reason is because it brings my family and friends all closer together for a month like no other part of the year. It is exactly the same effect you get at Christmas. Just because you used one remote example from Saudi Arabia doesn't mean it's exactly the same in all parts of the world. 

Ramadan is actually really really fun. When the time comes to break the fast, different families from all around the neighbourhood will often come share their food amongst each other or gather together and have a big feast. People you've never talked to will come and wish you well. The fasting bit is hard, but seriously the amount of food you eat in the morning and at night more than makes up for it. What's more, it's super healthy-- the fasting pattern of eating tons in the morning and night and nothing during the day is actually one of the most effective dieting/bodybuilding food plans. After Ramadan last year I cut my body fat percent more than I had ever before. 

At the end of the day there's no obligation whatsoever to keep it. No one really gives a shit if you do or don't. Lots of Muslims only bother with the first or last day just to say they took part and be a part of the community. 

Obviously on this subreddit, from the one or two stories they've read, everyone here an expert on Islam. How dare people keep up a harmless tradition that they are perfectly free to to do or not? There are many many many many many many problems with Islam, but clearly this is the worst because of this one thing I saw once in Saudi Arabia.

I keep debating it, I keep looking at it, and the more I read what is happening to teachers, the more I feel it isn't about the education to politicians.

People generally have a fixed concept of teachers; they work 9 til 3, go home, put their feet up and then go back to work the next day. They go on about them having great holidays and all that, but they completely ignore the reality.

If a teacher has a class for every hour period at school and never see the same set of kids more than once in a week, and you assume a school day consists roughly of 9 - 12 then 1 til 3, giving 6 lesson periods per day, then that means a teacher could potentially be responsible for managing 30 different workloads for different tiers of children. If you assume a class size is roughly 20 people, then that's 600 different sets of work per week that has to be individually assessed and marked according to standards.

That is a lot.

Not to mention you have parents evenings and in-school events to manage as well, where you have to give feedback to the parents of each and every child.

I think teachers get a lot of stick for doing something that I don't think a lot of people would be willing to do, and they really do deserve more respect for it.

Luongo played 5 months there last season and impressed. Hall is a lesser known defender*, granted his age this will probably be a loan with the view of selling.

Word is that spurs + Swindon have an unofficial partnership setup. Spurs loan/sell players to Swindon to help there bid for promotion. Players sold to Swindon will have 1p buyback clauses so spurs can recall them if they want.

Whilst this is speculation (which will now be fuelled by these two loaning's) it could be a master stroke in the development of spurs youth. 3+ promising youth players could be sent to the championship (assuming Swindon get promoted) and spurs don't have to cover wages + get the players back if all turns out.

I disagree and I think AVB would too.  When he ran his 4-3-3 at Porto, he used Falcao as a poacher.  When in possession, the FBs are supposed to push up while the DM hangs back slightly, turning the 4-3-3 into more of a 3-4-3.  That means one *more* attacker than normal.

Firstly that Villa will play on the left. Villa can play on the left but it is not where he is strongest nor where he will want to play (something he has a say in as he signs a new contract). I doubt Villa will sign to be second fiddle again, also forcing Damiao up front and Villa on the left would hamstring Bale (who would then be glued to the right). Spurs won't blow £17m on Damiao to stick him on the bench either.

Secondly, he goes off of the fact that the odds are good on Damiao signing. But odds are just controlled by what people are betting on, not on what is actually happening.

The same can be said about a 4-2-3-1, which in attack more or less turns into a 3-3-4, with Sandro back, the fullbacks and Moussa in a midfield space, and the wingers, striker and #10 attacking the defence.

That's just how I see it, there are definite interpretations of every formation, but I think AVB will be looking for someone who can do more than score goals, especially since Defoe is good for 15 goals a season, which he's maintained, more or less, over his Tottenham tenure.

I think if we're getting anyone, it'll be a top class striker.

If you want someone in the box though, why would you be against a more poaching-type player?  They are born in the box, live in the box, and die in the box.  Adebayor, who is great at holding up play, also comes wide very often.  That is an aspect of play I really like from him since it keeps our width and allows our midfielders to push into the space he creates, but it is in direct opposition to what you seem to want out of a striker.  You keep adding the qualifier ""who can score goals"".  If you want someone great at holding up play, don't expect him to score a ton of them, and don't expect him to be the farthest up the pitch.

No my argument is that you act like these things are due to a lack of awareness of 'how things work' rather than things that have always happened. We live in a society where education is free, yet there are still morons. Go figure.

&gt; Since you don't seem to grasp the division between cultures and how something we take for granted may be totally alien behaviour to someone coming into the country - I don't think it's patronising at all. 

You were patronising to me, and ignorant of other cultures. I spent quite some time living in India, and the idea that an Indian immigrant would be totally lost in the UK is insulting.

&gt; Living near the local University I've seen Chinese students go through their entire 3+ year degrees here and still have trouble running out into traffic because they don't understand traffic lights.

Liar. [China has traffic lights.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/HK_Hung_Hom_Cheong_Wan_Road_view_%E5%8D%8A%E5%B3%B6%E8%B1%AA%E5%BA%AD_Royal_Peninsula_Mar-2013_traffic_light_n_China_Travel_%28Cargo%29_Logistics_Centre.JPG) Why don't you tell us one about the african who didnt know how to use a phone or the polish guy who didnt know what forks were for.

&gt; If you want people - entire families - to integrate well with indigenous British people, start with modern society and how to survive in it - then work backwards. 

Do you realise how racist you sound? You act like you're so knowledgable about the world but you seem to think everyone else is living in the stone age. Newsflash: other countries really aren't that different from ours. 

&gt; History is important - but not as important to every day functionality as knowing how to register with an NHS doctor or how to make sure you're on the right tax code. 

How does anyone else learn these things? Did you get taught it in school? No, you didnt and neither did I. Yet here we are, paying taxes and visiting doctors.

And besides, at no point have I said that one should be taught and not the other. You're the one who's acting like it's an either/or argument, and saying there's no value in teaching immigrants the history of the people they are trying to live among. 

&gt; What continues to surprise me is that you value ""a willingness to learn about our culture"" above the actual information needed to survive in the UK without being a burden on the system. 

If someone is going to be a burden on our system then they don't deserve to be coming here. We do have a points-based immigration system, you know.",0,1372779314,null,0,false,0,cauixn2,t3_1hgar6,t1_cauixn2,t1_cauh6nl,null,1430608555,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; We live in a society where education is free, yet there are still morons. Go figure.

Yes we do, unfortunately, but if you're coming into this country from another and do not understand how *this* country operates then you will struggle. The fastest remedy is to be taught that and the best way to safeguard against it is to *test* that. All that can happen without the need for questions about the Battle of Hastings. 

&gt; I spent quite some time living in India, and the idea that an Indian immigrant would be totally lost in the UK is insulting.

Well then be insulted. My work sees me talking to a great many visa holders and I spend a good deal of time educating others of how the job application system works in the UK amongst other things. Totally lost? Perhaps not. Need some help getting settled? Definitely - I don't mind saying that *I* would need the same help if I moved to another country. Let's be realistic here. 

&gt; Liar. China has traffic lights.

That made me laugh, but again I draw from my personal experience of over a decade living in towns with Universities and whilst it's dangerous to generalize - I'm not saying the Chinese students struggle crossing roads for the fun of it. My flat last year overlooked a crossroads and I'd glance out at the sound of car horns from time to time - I'd wager 7 times out of 10 that the horn was directed at a person - it was a Chinese person laughing with their friends and running out of the way of a car. 

But hey, I'm lying right? Moving on... 

&gt; Do you realise how racist you sound? You act like you're so knowledgable about the world but you seem to think everyone else is living in the stone age. Newsflash: other countries really aren't that different from ours.

Did I mention the stone age? No, I did not. That's *your* prejudices coming to the for (looking at your posting history I see you thought of joining UKIP 7 months ago... how is that going for you?). But again if you actually do go to other countries as you claim you have - you *will* see differences. They may not be huge, they may not be 'stone age' but they're differences all the same. 

Women in Saudi Arabia aren't permitted to drive. if a Saudi woman comes to the UK and is faced with driving - she'll be learning from scratch and have to come to grips with our road laws. That's not stone age - it's horribly realistic. Don't like it? Take it up with Saudi Arabia. I'm making an observation - nothing racist about it. 

&gt; How does anyone else learn these things? Did you get taught it in school? No, you didnt and neither did I. Yet here we are, paying taxes and visiting doctors. 

*We* learned these things by osmosis over many years. There's a difference between that and coming into the country as a fully grown adult who needs to know these things from day one. 

&gt; And besides, at no point have I said that one should be taught and not the other. You're the one who's acting like it's an either/or argument, and saying there's no value in teaching immigrants the history of the people they are trying to live among.

Compared to teaching them how to properly adjust and function within a new country and a new culture - the value is massively decreased. *You* value the history of the country because you're presumably British. What will be more valuable is the life skills. Right now the test is vastly skewed in favour of comparatively useless facts and *not* life skills. 

&gt; If someone is going to be a burden on our system then they don't deserve to be coming here. We do have a points-based immigration system, you know.

And yet it's possible to work in this country without ever really adjusting to its culture - creating division that wasn't there before. Meanwhile there are plenty of *British* people who are a burden on the country as well - from overpaid corporates to sponging chavs (like it or not, both exist).

In an opt-out system, only those who oppose organ donation will opt-out, leading to a donation rate of around 66%—33% higher than the opt-in system.

I must admit that the public flogging of teachers by politicians over the last decade or three has been rather dispiriting, and the ""easy life"" myth is a tough zombie to kill.

Shooting it with facts doesn't seem to work, in a perverse way perhaps it will take abolishing summer holidays (and all the joy, experience and self-directed learning that means to children) to score a headshot.

On the flip side teachers do love a good moan and are excellent grudge-holders. I was deeply heartened to see a picture of Maggie and Kenneth Baker on the office wall the other day. It wasn't Maggie that the teachers had drawn a Hitler moustache on. 

To continue my rambling, I would just like to get to a position where the people that are entrusted with your children's lives were accorded a degree of respect and the support that goes with it.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"That was definitely another way of avoiding the question.  Well done.

I was told I was ""a fucking twat box"" for suggesting that the profit motive is good because my praise of the profit motive didn't apply because education wasn't a commodity.

My question is therefore ""why can't education be treated like a commodity"", and thus the profit motive _would_ apply (given that the person calling me a twat box implicitly accepted that profit does lead to good outcomes when we're talking of commodities).  Interestingly, some countries have introduced school-for-profit and voucher systems, and amazingly haven't become the educational wasteland predicted.  In fact, they've improved.  They obviously didn't get the memo that education isn't a commodity.

What exactly is the key attribute of education that means it can't be bought and sold just like any other commodity or service?  Other than ""that's just not the way we do things, dear oh dear, fancy making a profit out of poor little children, evil I tell you, evil"", all I've got so far is ""twat box"", and ""it just isn't. nyah"".  Unfortunately, exactly the same logic would apply to MRI machines, or cancer medicine, or paying teachers for their time.

&gt; What you really want is for everyone to just agree that you're right.

Of course I'm asking everyone to agree with me.  Isn't that what a debate is?  I'm not demanding that everyone agree with me though; but I would like a better argument than effectively just shouting ""wrong, wrong, wrong"".

Yet they don't have the Eaton education behind them to stand a chance in the main parties. Not to mention running as an independent not only greatly reduces chance of election, but also causes the cost of campaigning on a personal level to sky rocket.

Unless the electoral system allows for fair and equal representation on an MP level it's never going to change, it caters to those who come from affluent backgrounds with the ""right"" education.

Jobs that are rare and require expertise tend have good rewards and jobs where there are lots of potential employees don't have to offer such good rewards to get the people that they need. 


Being an MP *should* be a job that requires lots of expertise and thus *should* be very rewarding.

Also that's part of the reason why being a MP should be made attractive, so people from all walks of life are keen to try for a life in politics. 

I do take issue with you claiming that all MPs went to Eton. There are lots of MPs who went to state schools and do lots of hard work for their constituents and it irritates me when people dismiss all politicians because of their perceptions of a small minority.

They'd say education is about becoming a better person with a deeper understanding of the world, and a greater ability to think for one's self etc.

So what stops institution A helping with that more than institution B?  If you had infinite money and both were private, which one would you send your child to?  Imagine this situation: your child's school has two maths teachers.  One is highly regarded and the other is just average.  Do you think it's outside the realms of possibility that you would secretly hope to get the good teacher?

When institution B's money started to dry up what would be their response?  To give up?  To try and emulate A's success?

It's not the educatee that is competing, it's the educator; and there is no problem with that.  A marketplace would more successfully achieve exactly what you say is necessary: a tailored solution.  The free market shines at providing customised options; in every state-funded venture in history, the production becomes one-size-fits-all.

true,crucible,cnty-wales,Wales,"Sadly I suspect a small minority of people see schools as some kind of state provided national babysitting service. The fact that their children gain an education there is a bonus :P

Lengthening the school day and opening on Saturdays are good ideas *in theory* but will need huge changes to staffing to accommodate. Gove just throws ideas out there and expects schools to deal with it.

Personally speaking as a computer technician, many of the changes under the Coalition have not been good at all.

* [BECTA scrapped](http://www.education.gov.uk/aboutdfe/armslengthbodies/a00192537/becta) (They had their uses - approved lists of products, suppliers and services you could take to senior management when buying things)

* [Schools Support Staff Negotiating Body scrapped](http://www.ome.uk.com/example/School_Support_Staff_Negotiating_Body.aspx) (just after we had gone to ""single status"" pay under the council)

* Schools converting to Academies and coming away from LEA control. (While we buy many services in from our old LEA, management chose to buy support for a key computer system from a company on the other side of the country. We lost 10 years of working relationships with the LEA support department. Ironically enough the new company we use was formed from a similar department at another LEA. Go figure.)

true,Samuraisheep,,,"&gt;Nah I don't subscribe to that double standard, just be classy about it like you'd expect a guy to be.

Fair. Or just don't tell the girls about it! The problem is if I start getting too pestering about it. Not in a ""I want sex, give me sex, lets have sex"" constant messaging, but just in messaging too much generally. I had that issue with my last FWB.

&gt;Ahhh feelsbadman, breakups are never fun.

This one was particularly bad and I've been almost constantly dating (different guys) for about 5 years. I need to be single for a while!! But oh well, more time to hit the gym (or the running) and get that beach body us girls are supposed to have at the moment!

&gt;Depends where you look.

True! Not in durham so much. The only guy(s) I know I'd want to sleep with are currently attached. 

&gt;Why not?

It's just never really appealed. I'd rather sleep with someone I know and trust, and also therefore don't have to deal with the awkward morning after. There's also a ridiculous onus (perhaps self imposed) on girls to be pristine or whatever and in a relationship it's fine if you're a bit stubbly or whatever on occasion but I feel like for a ONS you should be in good condition or whatever and I'm not currently! Perhaps that's more of a confidence thing...particularly as I'm waffling about it...

However, it's taken me a while to get to this place.

I've also had some spectacular arguments, been called a c word etc etc too. Not as bad as AlyoChem's experience for sure, but certainly not pleasant. That word is reserved for the worst possible scenarios in my head, so if it's used, then it's used only to illustrate the very worst of the worst, and if I ever use it, you'll know someone's pushed me over the edge. Not the same for everyone though is it? It's not as though I don't have a potty mouth, you bunch of mofos! But yeah, not ever the c word, ta.  

I learn a lot on Reddit, get some giggles, and I've even made a couple of what I'd consider to be IRL friends. I get to give out advice to people who are a bit lost and just need a bit of help, those people take it with gratitude (in DMs or on the phone, not always the case on the subs), and generally it allows me to feel as though I can contribute something useful towards society and have some laughs along the way.

true,tenshikitsune,null,null,"OP of this theory obviously didn't think this all the way through, but water and the transience of it is an interesting theme to explore and not a bad jumping off point for Eleven's final goodbye. Water brings life, but also death- Like River did. She killed the Doctor but she also save him in the end- That's not such a stretch at all when you think about it. The Ponds- The transformative nature of water. Water changes the things it touches- You gain some of it when you swim and swallow water, it smooths down rough stones, takes things from point A to point B... water has always been associated with peace, calm, regeneration- Rebirth of a different sort in a way. A whole bunch of ideas like that. 

The Ponds changed the Doctor in a way that nobody else possibly could- They created River, the Doctor's future wife. They showed him that love can and will find a way even when it seems improbable or unlikely (Rory as the last Centurion, Amy and Madam Kevarian's arc, her speech about Rory...) When the angels took the Ponds and they 'died', the Doctor gave up being the Doctor altogether until Clara showed up to pull him back out again. You could even make the argument that River herself changed the Doctor in some ways, smoothed him as a river's tides smooth the pebbles and stones that fall into it, but that one is more of a stretch to me.

Clara- A girl from the sky, like rain renews and rejuvenates an old and tired world. Rainy days give the world a certain 'newness' once they settle and besides, the Doctor must love the rain- One of the passcodes for the TARDIS locks was 'petrichor', the smell of the Earth after it rains. Clara could very well be his petrichor after the rains (sadness, grief and guilt over what happened to the Ponds and River's inevitable death still looming...)- A promise of new things to come and a new beginning.

And don't even get me started on the time stream itself- The metaphor is in the name itself. Streams. Moving currents and adaptability, mystery of never knowing quite what's next around the bend even as a Time Lord, battered and beaten by said currents (the Time War, HurtDoc's eventual terrible choice...). So many ways to explore that theme, so much time and space you really could drown in it.

In a way, the Doctor and Clara are already drowning in the time stream. They are currently lost within the scar that is the Doctor's life- A rip in the stream itself. You could easily connect that scar to his potential death. Maybe Clara won't be able to swim in the time stream and the Doctor will die to save her. Maybe the paradoxical nature of being inside his own lifestream will 'drown' the Doctor in memories and paradoxes he can't reverse or weasel out of but Clara will somehow save him from complete destruction and the Doctor will regenerate that way. 

Who knows, I'm just pulling out the first thing to come to mind here, but water as a theme isn't so far off the mark if you ask me. I mean, clearly OP of the pic didn't think too hard about the possibilities and meanings of 'drown' or 'water', but when you take a writer like Moffatt and give him a thread to tie together something as spectacular as the 50th and then Eleven's final moments, you can bet he's thought it through. Water is innocuous enough to go completely unnoticed and yet strong enough to carry a pretty big story if you write it well enough. 

I don't know, that's just my first impression- Feel free to pick it apart and tell me I'm wrong :p

Tl;Dr- Water is more than just that wet stuff that comes out of taps. Make it a metaphor and it becomes the Time Stream.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; a useful or valuable thing: water is a precious commodity.

Is education not a useful or valuable thing?  If it is not then why are we worrying about it?  If it is, then we should find the way that supplies that thing at its highest quality.  Or at the very least provides a motivation to increase quality.

&gt; Also, please describe how quality can be increased through greater profits on education?

The same way profit motivates any producer to raise the quality of their product... for fear that their competitor will do so and steal their customer.

Imagine government told parents that any cheque they write for the education of their child would be reimbursed; then imagine that all schooling was private -- that would be no problem as every parent, backed by the government in this hypothetical is infinitely rich.

Which private school do the parents pick for their child?  How does one private school distinguish itself from the other, in order that these infinitely wealthy parents choose them?  The answer is that they compete on quality.

Now let's go back to the real world: imagine that each child carried with them a voucher that allowed the school educating them to claim £X per week from the government.  The parents, exactly as in my fantasy example above, choose the school.  On what basis would parents choose?  On what basis do the schools distinguish themselves?  Again, on quality.  The child has multiple entities competing to persuade the parents that they will provide the best education.  Just as with every other product, they will have to create a reputation and be able to demonstrate that they can deliver.

Bad schools will close because of lack of funding, good schools will expand and take over (by purchasing) the property of closed bad schools.

Compare that with what our children get now: the local authority takes a large chunk of the money that goes with the child.  The parent doesn't select anything, they get assigned based on their postcode.  If the school they are assigned is not of high quality, what options do they have?

I don't underestimate the difficulty of changing from where we are now; and I'm not sure it's even possible.  However, that isn't relevant to the question of whether it would be a good or bad system.  It's far too easy to simply shout ""our schools are run fine, they just need more money"".  Unfortunately, more money is exactly what has been tried and it has not succeeded in improving the lot of our children in any significant way.

I can't find UK equivalent, but here's the relevant chart for America. http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/6cd9c52e49f2.jpg

I don't doubt that we would see monstrosities like ""Coke"" schools being tried; but that seriously underestimates parents.  They will not be impressed with a branded school.  Equally, let's not forget that the country already has a quantity of monstrous schools.  The question is which of the two systems would produce more educated children?",0,1372790131,null,0,1372790614,0,caun4bo,t3_1hglrq,t1_caun4bo,t1_caum59w,null,1430606445,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm for opt-out but you making this statement has suddenly made me understand the objections people have alot more clearly. Seriously, I never really got it until now. You think the government should have the right to ignore the wishes of a persons closest family when deciding what to do with their body. The government can override the wishes of a persons closest family and do what they want with his or her remains instead. Can't you see why people find that objectionable?

If the person involved didn't specify what should happen, then the family should be next in line to decide what happens, not the government. If the family specifies no wishes, then the government can have their organs.

A few other things you might know but I'm still going to mention:

* First, in Britain a cell phone is called a mobile phone or mobile and a plan is called a 'mobile tariff', just so you know. 

* Second, if you are from North America, as I take it you are, you'll want to make sure that your phone has been unlocked by your phone carrier before taking it to Britain. 

* Third, to set up a phone contract (as in, to not pay as you go) I'm almost certain you'll need to have a UK bank account established first so keep that in mind.

* And finally, sim only plans are much cheaper, usually about £15 per month compared to £30 with the phone so if you can bring the phone with you (i.e. have it unlocked) I'd recommend that.

There's the problem.

This isn't a ""field"" nor should it be treated as one.

In any job you need one thing primarily: Experience in your role. An MP's primary role is to represent the populace: nothing more. The majority do this really well, but due to the way our political system works, the majorities views are rarely represented due to partisanship, labels and money.  

Education really isn't a factor in this, there is no qualification for what an MP does, is intelligence required? Yes, and obviously education plays a role in this, but just like a normal job, education is usually the smallest factor in whether you're suitable for a role. 

Someone who has experienced the worst life has to offer, is much more experienced to represent the populace than someone who had a private education and was sheltered from the harsh realities life has to offer from reckless decisions made by government ever could be.

Schools-for-profit would simply put the control of the funds (that must already exist) in the hands of the parents.  They then choose who gets it.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"I meant the school as an institution when I said educators.  However, that doesn't matter.  The educators (teachers) _do_ teach for profit; you might not think it's sufficient profit (presumably you value them very highly), but they turn up for work for the same reason the rest of us do: because they are paid.  Given the fuss that teachers unions kick up when their pay or benefits are even breathed at, you would have to be extremely naive to think that if you took that away they would continue working.

Now, I will accept that there is more to the choice to become a teacher than mere financial gain.  But there is no reason we have to speak only of financial gain when we talk of profit.  Perhaps the educators price is made up of pounds plus fulfillment?  Excellent, they will be able to lower their prices in exchange for fulfillment where another educator who values money alone will not.

&gt; You may be driven by money, but most workers in the social based services are not driven by this. So keep you greedy opinions off these sectors and allow them to do there job.

This is just hyperbole.  They might not be driven by money (nor am I exclusively), job satisfaction is important too -- but that is still a component in price.  Just because it's not measured in pounds doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  The fact that none of us can survive on zero pounds means that we are able to accept more satisfying jobs for less money, or less satisfying jobs for more money _at our individual discretion_.

&gt; Also, profit has not proven to improve any of the health or social care services now has it? The companies are getting richer and the care is getting more lean and less humanistic. Stop driving non-humanistic concepts on a humanistic sector

That's opening up a whole additional debate.  However, there had been no change that gives the customer the power to walk away with their money in either health or social care.  So that's irrelevant.  There is still no profit incentive where it matters: fighting for the customer.

The idea of for-profit conversion of a public sector service to a private sector service is not to supply the profit -- I don't give two shits about corporates getting their profit -- the point is to make them work for that profit in a way that advantages all of us.  I, perhaps foolishly, assumed that was implicit -- who on Earth would want to privatise schooling as a way of handing money to companies?  The idea is to spend the same money and get better results; if companies make profit at the same time, so be it -- provided our children are better educated, then that's perfectly acceptable.",0,1372792688,null,0,false,0,cauo4fe,t3_1hglrq,t1_cauo4fe,t1_caund79,null,1430605931,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It is used when serious violence or disorder is likely to occur in a particular area. Often this happens when gang tensions raise. I hardly think its unfair to say that there are, for a raft of social reasons,  a lot of young black men and boys who are parts of these gangs. 

That's going to make that particular power looks like it is being used inappropriately but to take it in context further investigation is warranted.

Thersa May also supported her argument by saying that 9% of stop and searches result in an arrest. That's practically 1 in 10, which isn't bad. However you also have to think that things like cannabis often don't require arrest and can be dealt with on the street, there are other disposal options that we can use for various things. Just because there is no arrest doesn't mean that it isn't a positive stop.

A brief run down of Macclesfield Town (in easy to read bullet-point layout.)

- After making a damn good show of it, last year was our first outside the football league for 15 years. During this decade and a half saw us hit the dizzy heights of Division 3 (now league one) to teetering in the relegation zone for 80% of a season until a last gasp sprint over the line.
- During our football league stay, we played a few games which make a pretty interesting story:

[Thrashing the rivals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrokE_VDzkU&amp;list=PL73D63312CE8FB95F)

[Throw in a Cup Final](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt41IGDHkIs&amp;list=PL73D63312CE8FB95F)

Not to mention playing these guys during our many cup runs:

[Chelsea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXNd7gzPU4w)

[Bolton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48YzWZkmWWM)

[Wigan (this season)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6AeN2mrS-Y)

[West Ham](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ALleQYq5Q)

- For the past decade we had two brothers who owned the club (Amar and Bashar) and constantly backed numerous managers as they showed their commitment season after season. Then we had a few years of silence from them as we went about our business. Regrouping after relegation, Amar breaks his silence and single-handedly appoints out new manager; Steve King (this decision made 80% of the board step down) 

- After failing to make the play-offs, Steve King was sacked.

- A closer look into the finances after King left made shocking reading. He had assembled an amazingly talented team playing the best football in the Conference - he had left the club dangerously close to liquidation.

- Happy Ending! Thanks to a deal with the council, they purchased the freehold of the land our stadium is built on and enabled us to pay off our debts. We were then transferred from a PLC business to a CIC which meant the public of Macclesfield now owned the club (the first professional team in England to do so.)

- We now have two absolute legends in charge in [John Askey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Askey) who played nearly 700 games for us and [Efe Sodje](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efe_Sodje) who scored our first goal in the Football League.

cognitive dissonance is a simple concept. You approve of one side of an argument in a given set of circumstances, but don't approve of the same in similar or identical circumstances. 

As we have many supporting the adhan but refusing to support similar for other religions, we have cognitive dissonance. that you refuse to state your position doesn't solve the problem; that's just avoidance (which is your right).

Because I disagree with you, you are trying to ascribe certain beliefs or values upon me, which you can then use to attack me personally, rather than any argument regarding cognitive dissonance.

All you are really doing is asking 'have you stopped beating your wife yet?'

I know what cognitive dissonance is, that was why I asked you about your use of it earlier. I think you don't really understand it, but think it sounds like an impressive way to subtly insult the intelligence of others. I suggest you reread the wiki definition you googled earlier.

&gt;As we have many supporting the adhan but refusing to support similar for other religions, we have cognitive dissonance.

You haven't shown any proof of these people, there certainly weren't any when I began asking you for proof of them and I am not going back to read all the comments posted since then.

&gt;that you refuse to state your position doesn't solve the problem; that's just avoidance (which is your right). 

It is not avoidance because you are dishonestly presenting the question, as already explained. 

&gt;hey, I don't care. You're not the first to encounter cognitive dissonance within oneself and attempt to defend it or justify it. I don't care if you're inconsistent, I don't know you. so carry on. 

Now you are just getting childish. You can't win so you are just going to pretend I have cognitive dissonance. You've been doing this for several hours now, it does not make it more true if you keep saying it. 

The fact is that your claims of cognitive dissonance in this thread were a figment of your imagination, and were caused by you having such a pre-determined view on this subject, combined with an irrational belief that you are somehow being persecuted, that you are unable to argue rationally.

true,DiscoPopShop,null,null,"The literal translation of the title is “I’ll kill myself this summer”, but as you can probably guess that’s not what he means. This interview was mid-May this year.

Not a city fan, but I’m a big fan of Guidetti. Came across this interview and though it might interest a few of you. I won’t translate the whole thing word for word (I’m far too lazy for that), but I’ll just do the most interesting things he says. Also, don’t be too critical of my translation if you’re Swedish, I haven’t lived in Sweden for a long time.

On training: “Before I could have been like: *More cardio? I’d rather just stay at home and slack off.* Now I appreciate every moment. And you get stronger mentally as well. If I get through this I can get through anything. Bench me, put me in the reserves. I can get through anything.”

The reporter then asks how it felt to be out for so long.
“It never hurt. It was just super stressful. No one could answer my questions. No one could tell me what was gonna happen. Is my career done or not?”

“The worst part of it all was watching the Euro’s. It was ridiculously hard.”
Reporter asks if he thinks he would have started.
“Yeah, probably. It was incredibly hard, seeing them playing in front of 70,000 people. The guy that was supposed to cover me got to start nearly all the games, so I know I’d at least have had a chance to play a bit. I’m trying to be humble but...”

Perhaps the most interesting thing for City fans is this bit:
“The doctor said ‘You’ll get to 100% fitness, you’ll be completely recovered. Our goal is just to get you ready to hit the ground running at the start of the season and fight for a place in the team. If you keep developing the way you have, you’ll be rewarded with a few Premier League games towards the end of the season.'”

The interviewer asks about what he’ll be doing this summer. Just rest?
“This summer is where I’m putting everything into.  I might hide away in a house somewhere for a month and just train.” This is at 4:40. The reporter jokes and says ‘Rocky 4’ and has a bit of a laugh about it. Look at John’s face. Determined as fuck. He then goes on to say “There are special places where you go just to train. You get everything. A cook, coaches, I get to bring my dad and some mates and just go for it. I get rehab training, football training and just go for it. I’ll end up killing myself in the summer.”

The reporter says that he probably shouldn’t overwork himself, John responds “Yeah of course. If all it takes is some yoga in the morning, sleeping in the afternoon or eating some special algae, whatever. I’ll do whatever it takes.""

2) Email the uni if you're unsure about anything. I've always received plenty of help that way.

3) Pros and Cons lists really really help, make sure you've made one of those before making the final choice.

4) Research some employment options too. What will you do and how much will you earn after finishing this course?


Basically, you need to do some proper in-depth research about your courses. Utilise everything you've got, speak to your school teachers too. Nobody but you can make this choice, but there's a lot of information available to you out there.

&gt; CSE allows you to pick external modules from the electronic engineering course but it is not really encouraged and you'd be at a significant disadvantage to students who do other EE modules as you wouldn't have exposure to that kind of maths.  University is as much about learning new stuff as it is the final grade, but only a fool would claim that the final grade is irrelevant and CSE already requires you to take what most people regards as the most difficult modules within CS.  You don't get much choice of modules within CSE and if you chose external modules, you'd be narrowing your choices for courses in later years that have prerequisite courses. CSE is much more about computers as a whole, from hardware to software,with a focus on VLSI design supported by enough electronics knowledge to make this useful.  That's also what is in use at most companies these days.  Chip design is largely a process done using HDL and knowledge of system architecture, and pure electronics knowledge takes a back seat.  It depends what you really want to go into, but you kinda need to choose one path or the other because CSE has no more soldering than plain old CS

They are definitely distinct ethnic groups, and they are defined by the traditions and practices of their home country--what would you prefer they call themselves, other than Italian- or Irish-Americans?

Plus, you have to realize, people didn't simply stop identifying that way when they stepped off the boat: for generations, there was institutionalized discrimination against the Irish and Italians, to the point that signs were put up on businesses stating ""Irish Need Not Apply"". This caused a ""ghettoization"" of the two ethnic groups, further strengthening their ethnic identity.

But it seems like it's easier for some people to simply take the position that ""Americans just glom onto other peoples' history because they have none of their own!"", ignoring the huge demographic implications of ethnic origin in the early USA and the huge uphill battles both demographics fought to be recognized.

As to the final point, I realize it's different. Ignoring the sacrifices of British, Canadian, and Soviet troops is unforgivable. 

I think both highlight a common tendency of people in general: people want simple, bumper-sticker explanations to very complex situations, whether it's ""The USA won WW2, back to back champs!"" or ""Americans don't have history, listen to them claim to be Irish, they're so dumb!"".

true,vishbar,,Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout,"Yes, I agree. Funding terrorism, regardless of whether you agree with what they're fighting for or not, is an absolute moral wrong--though I respect Irish-American cultural history, the funding of the IRA was a national disgrace, full stop.

I think, though, that completely erasing their cultural ties to their home country is counterproductive as well. Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans have shared ethnic experiences (with individuals in the same group, not together) that deserves recognition. You'll definitely get the Plastic Paddy who shows lands Dublin wearing a ""Kiss Me, I'm Irish"" shirt and orders an ""Irish Carbomb"" in a pub, and he's definitely an idiot, but I think the majority of I-A's understand that they're not truly Irish. They've gone through a lot, and I think their culture deserves to be recognized as unique. I am, personally, not anything-American--my great-great ancestors were immigrants from England and Scotland, but I don't feel any personal connection to either (well, I do, but because my girlfriend lives in England and I'll be moving there in a few weeks, not due to my ethnic background). That being said, the English and Scots immigrants in the US didn't go through the same struggles the Chinese, Irish, Italians, or Vietnamese did, hence the lack of a cohesive English-American or German-American culture.

I can see the patriotism thing, too--you're right that we haven't seen the horrific consequences of blind nationalism to the extent that Europe has. Honestly, it really grates on my nerves, too; that kind of attitude is responsible for the people who refuse to accept that the USA was part of a much greater whole in WWII and WWI.

They are liable for damage caused, but they are categorically not considered to be having sex without consent, regardless of the fact that the victim, fully informed would not have consented given the information.

To be clear, I'm one of the people who definitely isn't sold on Shelvey, but he definitely has the potential to be a very good player if he gets consistent time. I really think  a year of PL first-team experience would have given us a much clearer idea of whether or not he's got a future as a Liverpool-quality player.

That's pretty misleading. Those two are very different.

Yeah, lies about marital status and HIV status are similar in that neither is either a s. 76 deception nor vitiates s. 74 consent under the SOA2003.

But while a lie about marital status *is* perfectly legal, a lie about HIV status may not be. If you end up giving someone HIV after lying about your status, you've committed s. 20 (of the OAPA 1861) GBH (by recklessness). And if you lie about your status *intending* to give them HIV, then even if you fail, you can be charged with attempt to commit s. 18 GBH (by intent). (But you can't be charged with attempt if you didn't actually intend to transmit HIV - inchoate recklessness isn't a crime).

Point is, just because something isn't rape, doesn't mean it's ""perfectly legal"". Tax evasion isn't rape either.

&gt; Moreover, unlike gender history, both of these represent genuine possibilities of harm. (getting drawn unwittingly and unwillingly into someone elses affair can be a genuine danger)

Yes, both are 'harm' in some sense, but it seems to me that getting infected with HIV without consenting to run the risk is very definitely the sort of harm which it's appropriate for the state, in the form of criminal law, to punish.

Its a risk for him (Henrikh) to join Liverpool because of this. A far smaller risk is joining Dortmund, to which style he will get used to very quickly.

true,RandomPotato,null,null,"I agree. I'm much more worried about the defensive aspect of our midfield than our striker problem. I think we have some of the best AM's in the world, and with them I think we can pass by with a striker with good holding/linkup play and who doesn't blow easy chances. While Cavani would almost certainly be a great addition to the squad, don't need a 50mil striker for that. 

Our defense is looking better, with Luiz growing into a world class, modern CB, with solid options in Ivanovich, Terry, and Cahill. They may not be very complementary pairs, but any of them world at least be capable. Cole is still great, and Azpi is developing quickly as well. Some extra depth in the full back positions would be nice though; Bertrand is ok, and Brana has to fill in for Azpi right now.

The only problem I see is the DM role. We only really have Mikel, who in my opinion is certainly good, but not world class. He is also slightly inconsistent. Ramires can run all day sure, but makes rash tackles and isn't really good a passer of the ball. Lampard isn't really suited to the added defensive responsibilities, as he either has to check his offensive runs forward or leave his defensive duty open. I don't really know how Romeu or Essien will do, injuries and all; though I doubt either of them would be able to solve our problems. We lack a truly world class defensive mid, and we don't really have any deep lying playmakers. In my opinion, I'm much more concerned with us spending big on a great defensive mid than another striker. 

Other than that, I think how our loanees adapt will certainly play a huge factor as well. Lukaku could easily be a fearsome striker here, and KDB can (hopefully) fulfill several roles to add depth and change to our attack. Or they could take to long to adapt to our style of play or the PL (in KDB's situation).

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"To be honest, I wasn't very familiar with Kristian Walsh's work on The Anfield Wrap but during the time he started blogging for ESPN he is quickly becoming one of my favorite writers about LFC. Very solid writer, great insight, seems to capture what I am feeling about most situations, thoughtful, doesn't seem to be very knee-jerk or over-emotional about a situation. A bit along the lines of Paul Tomkins, I think.

I was on the fence about Jonjo.

A part of me wanted to believe in the lad and I thought that he deserved a season-long loan spell to prove his worth. Maybe regular playing time would sort out his game (and maybe it will) but this article by Walsh tipped me over the other side of the fence and I believe that if the deal with Swansea (or whoever) goes through, it is the right move for both parties involved.

Some may say, ""Give him time."" But do we have the time to give him? We need a Champions League position as quickly as possible and we can't wait for a Shelvey to shine while players like Sturridge and Coutinho step right in and make an immediate impact.

Another interesting thought is that I think that with the reported transfer fees of Shelvey, Aspas and Alberto being so similar, I think they may be compared with each other for the remainder of their careers in the Premier League.

Anyway, best of luck to Jonjo, I say. And I will be happy if he succeeds and maybe he'll do it in an England shirt as well which would be a nice little bonus.",0,1372824726,null,0,false,0,cauz916,t3_1hj1ve,t1_cauz916,t3_1hj1ve,null,1430600613,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,kyhadley,null,null,"I think your assessment of our current midfield situation is excellent and I think the solution could be playing with a 3-man midfield.  I'm not sure why it's so assumed that we'll stick with the ""pivot"". It's true Jose has favored it more recently, but he played a 4-3-3 during his first reign here, and we don't have any Khedira/Alonso all-around CMs that the ""pivot"" requires. 

Mikel I think could do wonders in the ""Makelele"" role, and Romeu, (maybe Luiz*), and Essien could also play there.  Playing with a central sitting defensive mid allows us to have the other two paired with him have less defensive responsibility while still being able to provide some cover.

With the other 2 spots, I think this would also solve the problems Ramires and Lampard have with a 2-man midfield.  They could both be allowed to make their trademark runs more often knowing they have cover.

As for the lack of a deep-lying playmakers, I think both Oscar and De Brunye, when in a 3-man midfield, would be capable of filling this role, as might Lampard.  It would also allow us the ability to get more of our great young players on the field at once.

*In the two games against Basel, we played a hyrbrid 2/3-man midfield consisting of Luiz, Ramires, and Lampard and I thought it worked well.

I quite like Stephen Moffat and his stories are often excellent, what he has done however is change the essence of the character itself. In the past the Doctor was almost anonymous. He would slip in, save the world, then leave before tea (except maybe on Christmas Day). Moffat has every one of his enemies converge to imprison him at Stonehenge. Similar enemy count in a Good Man Goes to War. Instead of the vastness of time and space we are given the vastness of Monument Valley, Utah. The stories are more cinematic, more epic and so is the Doctor. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this but the Doctor's ""essence"" has been changed. 

If I have any objection to Moffat as a show runner it is this. I liked my Doctor small, anonymously doing big things. Moffat's Doctor, well Winston Churchill has him on speed dial.

first of all: if you are going to live in bradford, live in city centre. i live in Little Germany and I have no complaints.

Bradford is pretty shitty, but not in a way that it's going to make your life miserable. The thing is, England has an amazing transportation system. Leeds, which is a really great, cosmopolitan city, is about 18 minutes on the train. So honestly you only have to eat and sleep in Bradford, and then on the weekends if you like going out dancing/to bars/pubs/etc,  you can just take the train to Leeds and then cab back for pretty cheap. There ARE clubs/pubs in Bradford, but I warn you that they will be filled with a .... strange group of people. Bradford doesn't have a lot of money, and it's not a ""cool"" place, so most young people just go to Leeds/Halifax/Huddersfield/etc to go out. 

People say that Bradford is dangerous, but I have never felt scared here and I have walked back from the bars/clubs in City Centre at the most ridiculous times of night. 

Umm what else ... Bradford has amazing Curry places. Ackbar's on Leeds road is the BEST. It's so delicious. You will be obsessed with curry before you know it. 

I wouldn't worry about it, honestly. I have had the time of my life while living in this city. I moved here at teach secondary school with about 30 other Canadians and we became a tight knit group right away. I have met friends here that I will keep for life. I have travelled to Prague, Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Dublin, Edinburgh and Barcelona (and numerous other places within England itself), I have never partied so much in my life, I have just generally LOVED LIFE. 

Bradford might not be the coolest place in the world, but England is so small that it doesn't matter where you sleep on weeknights. You can get coach tickets to London for as low as 8 pounds, you can take the train anywhere, you can get cheap flights on ryanair or jet2.

On top of that you'll need living expenses.

That's not an unreasonable figure, by the way -- although it's possible to survive in London on less than that, it's going to be a miserable existence.

As for your questions about where to live, well let's wait until you've decided where you'll be studying. London's a big city and there's no point picking somewhere to live if it means a 2-hour commute each way to Uni every day.

true,Herringgull,cnty-scotland,Tea-powered,"Despite the increased numbers of urban gulls, their general numbers are in such decline that they have been given red status by the [RSPB](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/h/herringgull/index.aspx)

I can only hazard guesses at the reasons until studies are conducted, but, seabirds in general have been in decline for some time now. A large factor is the depleted fish stocks, certainly in the case of puffins their normal food source, the sand eels, have depleted to such a point that the birds are trying to eat pipe fish instead.

Pipe fish look pretty similar to sand eels, but they're just that little bit larger, and the problem arises when the parents attempt to feed the pipe fish to their pufflings, who can't get them down and often choke.

Gulls are innate opportunists, and from their point-of-view our urban environments provide them with high-rise buildings that mimic the high cliff tops they would traditionally use as nest sites, coupled with an abundance of easy food; bins bags, discarded takeaways, it simply offers them an easier life.

They do get quite territorial during breeding season, but in a natural setting gulls would have to defend their [chicks](http://is.gd/OsGf) from other predatory birds such as black-backed gulls and skuas, even other herring gulls, so I guess instinct is colliding with the modern world....

If you hear a seagull go meh-meh-meh-meh-meh, it's warning you to back off. Best to avoid eye-contact with it, and leave...failing that, if you can do a fairly decent meh-meh-meh back at them, a lot of the time it freaks them out a little bit that a human is speaking seagull and essentially saying 'fuck off' back at the gull, so they will fly off!

FYI, I hate it when people do this. Particularly when they don't pay attention to what they are doing and then get pissy with the cashier because they can't count their change right or whatever. Yes, I've seen that happen. As a manager, many times. The cashier does nothing really wrong but because the person is on the phone and not paying attention they get yelled at for doing something wrong when they didn't. 

I can understand this cashier's frustration. All she wants to do is be pleasant, serve this person, count back their change, and get them out of there, but she can't even tell if the person is seeing that she's getting what she needs because the person won't stop chatting long enough for her to pay attention. But first rule of customer service. You don't antagonize the customer even when they are wrong, being rude. 

It is not true that the customer is always right, but you never let them know that unless you absolutely have to It's bad for business and the customer being vaguely rude by being on the phone is a non-issue in terms of her really being a problem. This is very minor stuff, and the cashier reacted like it was major stuff, and she shouldn't have. She should have kept her cool and just dealt with it.

As a cashier you face far worse than rude people on a phone every single day. If you can't handle something as minor as that, a small annoyance with some grace, you don't belong there.

true,lilythekitten,eng-northumberland,The NORTH,"It's not really a scam as such. Basically there are two types of parking 'tickets' that can be issued. Ones from the local council or police that are issued for offences on the public highway - these are backed by law so you'll have to pay them (unless you have a legitimate argument that the ticket was issued in error, there is an independent tribunal scheme that can be used if there is a dispute). 

The other type of 'ticket' are those issued by private companies for breaking parking rules on private land. These rely on contact law, and for the company to enforce them in court they have to prove three things

A) that a contractual agreement between you and the company exists 
B) that you have breached the agreement 
C) that the amount they are seeking is equal to their losses as a result of you breaching the contract (this is important, under contract law in this country 'penalty' charges are unlawful, you can only claim for actual losses) 

Recent legislative changes have established a regulatory scheme and code of conduct for private parking companies that outlines rules for signs, terms, etc. This will likely make it easier for PPCs to prove that a contract does exist (assuming the company is complying with the rules). However they still have to prove a breach of contract, and more importantly, actual losses. In your case, it's possible that actual losses can be proved, since there has been damage done, but unless the matter goes to court no one is under a legal obligation to pay. 

Since it is so difficult for PPCs to prove all three points in court, they very rarely take matters that far, they'll just send increasingly threatening letters in the hopes that you pay up. So yes, in short, you can probably ignore anything but a court summons. ",0,1372841243,null,0,false,0,cav2z3r,t3_1hk1bl,t1_cav2z3r,t3_1hk1bl,null,1430598787,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

Anyway, all jokes aside Bradford is a place that gets a lot of bad press, not least from it's residents. But what most people miss out is that the residents give it the bad stick because despite everything, we still care about our little corner of Yorkshire. It doesn't have the glamour of Leeds or the beauty of some of the places further up into the Dales but we're a proud friendly folk who will tell things like they are and make sure you know where to get a good curry and a perfect pint. 

Make sure to check out the Media Museum, the Industrial Museum and a host of other things. Get yourself on the train to Keighley and hop on the Keighley Worth Valley steam Railway, stopp off to see the Bronte Parsonage. Hop out for a few days in the dales, they're on the doorstep.

Yes you are. You're clearly trying to frame some guy not taking heavy traffic seriously (my guess is that he's used to running across busy roads) with someone who doesn't know how traffic lights work. There's a huge difference.

&gt; But again if you actually do go to other countries as you claim you have - you will see differences. They may not be huge, they may not be 'stone age' but they're differences all the same. 

Nice, an ad hom followed by a strawman. Yes there are differences but if you think that an Indian needs to be taught how to use a post office then you're an idiot.

&gt; if a Saudi woman comes to the UK and is faced with driving - she'll be learning from scratch and have to come to grips with our road laws. That's not stone age - it's horribly realistic. Don't like it? Take it up with Saudi Arabia.

Are you saying that the taxpayer should pay for her driving lessons? Why can't she pay for lessons herself like every other citizen of this country? 

Is this irrelevant example the best reason you have for not teaching any history to immigrants?

&gt; We learned these things by osmosis over many years.

No *we* didnt. You learned it by doing it, or by asking someone who knew. You act like immigrants are incapable of doing this.

&gt; Right now the test is vastly skewed in favour of comparatively useless facts and not life skills. 

Again, if you don't have the life skills to do or learn things that are required in 90% of the worlds countries then you're not the immigrant we're looking for.

&gt; And yet it's possible to work in this country without ever really adjusting to its culture - creating division that wasn't there before.

And your solution is more of the same. Good going.

&gt; Meanwhile there are plenty of British people who are a burden on the country as well - from overpaid corporates to sponging chavs (like it or not, both exist). 

I am aware of this, thanks. Corporates at least add to the economy. We don't need more spongers - which is exactly what we'll get if we handhold people who cant be bothered to learn for themselves.

Case in point: I recently moved within Birmingham and throughout the previous year faced problems with the local bin-men collecting *just* the contents of the bins outside my block of flats and *not* the rubbish surrounding it (which was several times moved right outside the main entrance / exit) - this rubbish often split open and was eaten by local pests etc. 

Despite complaining to the agency and the council, nothing changed throughout the year except a few apologies.

Ultimately it felt like complaining did nothing at all - I'd have been better off chucking the rubbish into the centre of the main road nearby and *then* watching them come and collect it within half an hour...

Having watched a fair whack of Doctor Who from Classic to new; I have to say that the best episode for me is ""Waters of Mars"".  There are a number of reasons for this:

1.  It came during the year where Doctor Who truly was Event Television; there were only a few episodes spread across the year, and we had to wait for each one.  The episode came along, and it delivered.
(Granted, we could use the same argument for all series openers, or The Movie/Rose - however they did not have the same impact that this episode did).

2.  It dealt, sensitively, with a number of adult themes including morality, duty and personal relationships.  However; it did it in a way that neither went over the heads of the young people watching the show nor patronizing them.  

3.  During the climax of the show, Murray Gould's re-do of his theme:  ""All the strange strange creatures"" added awesome and since unreachable tension within the show and it really showed how tense what was happening actually was.

4.  It told an amazing movie style story; with proper character development (The Doctor included (and I would say especially)) with so many twists, turns beauty and hatred...but managed to do it in 60 minutes.  Other contenders for the crown, like ""The War Games"" (in my opinion) or ""Planet of the Spiders"" also did this, but they took anywhere between 6 and 10 episodes to do this.  

5.  [Timelord Victorious](#s ""Watching The Doctor descend into being the villan at the end was just such an excellent conclusion.  But it was done in such a way that you could understand, and even identify with why he became what, or who, he became."")

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;That's like saying the westboro baptist church aren't extremists, they're just doing what the bible says.

Claiming that society is paying for the sin of homosexuality?  Yes they're doing exactly what the Bible says.  God even provides a neat little precedent in Sodom and Gomorrah (he's always thinking ahead).  

&gt;contradictions in the scriptures

Perfect word of God eh?  But I'm not talking about contradictions in the Scriptures. The Hadith and Quran specifically call for the murder of apostates (for example):

&gt; if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper.
*Quran 4:89*

&gt;The Prophet said, 'If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him. *Bukhari 52:260*

So yeah, they're doing exactly what Islam asks of them, no contradictions, no metaphorical meaning to be explored here.  I'd say the same about the Israelis.  Divine mandate from the Bible specifically allows for genocide in order that the Jews are able to settle the Holy Land.  If you're a true believer, you're an extremist, like it or not.

true,dave8001,null,null,"As far as I am aware; the mystery surrounding John Hurt's Doctor has not been revealed yet.  

It has been generally assumed that he is from the past, and it is generally assumed that he is a full, previous doctor.  However; he could also, quite easily be something in the form of what happened to David Tennant's Doctor during the Episode ""Journey's End""; or a ""kind-of"" regeneration, like say ""The Watcher"" or ""The Valeyard"".  

Lest we forget that all of the ideas above have happened before, and nothing negative has been said about them  For the best part of 6 months Russell T. Davis was happy to let us believe that David Morrissey was ACTUALLY The Next Doctor; and even gave that the title of the episode.  Who is actually, at this point, to say that John Hurt's Doctor is something that will Ruin Doctor Who.

As explained above, if he is a lost ""doctor"" he is hardly the first person to do this within the ""lore"" of Doctor Who.

Beyond this; there are a number of inconsistencies that have happened throughout the telling of Doctor Who; which suggests that it's relationship with canon is loose at best.  For example, in Remembrance of The Daleks, The Seventh Doctor destroyed Skaro; by the movie (which also featured The Seventh Doctor, and it was him in fact who made the reference) Skaro was back again...and so was the master.

The idea of 12 regenerations has been there since ""The Deadly Assassin"" however; that has only been stuck to loosely as well.  Look at The Master, for example, he was at the end of his regeneration life cycle and managed to steal more.  Furthermore, during the Time War (a concept brought by RTD) all of the timelords who fought as part of the time war were gifted a full set of new regenerations.   (Didn't the Doctor fight in part of the time war, before he defected?).

The repayment terms are generous though, and it doesn't count against you when applying for say a mortgage, but the interest rates are pretty bad. Given that there's no minimum payment, they're safer, but likely to grow more and cost more in the long run.

The worst case for paying them back would be if you leave university and score a 40k a year job, which would cost you £14k more than if you'd paid them off (long term). The best case is you earn 20-25k ish and end up never repaying the total amount.

This is, however, assuming the terms don't change. 

&gt; sinking all of his money into an education represents a significant opportunity cost.

Minor nitpick, it would equate to roughly 1/3rd of his money.

true,Sabazius,yorkshire,Sheffield,"You're only thinking about the production side of things. If anything, I think legalisation would have a far greater effect on the rate and nature of consumption than on production.

If weed were made legal and set up a regulatory body, people would buy from licensed vendors who had a controlled, regulated supply that worked within the confines of the law, because the product would be superior. It would be cheaper and easier to acquire the resources needed to produce marijuana on a mass scale through legal means, so the companies who produced weed legally would have a better product at a cheaper price. The individuals and organisations who produced weed illegally would have to change their business model to fall in line with the law, or they'd risk their profits.

The thing is, nobody who smokes weed WANTS to break the law. Nobody who smokes weed WANTS to smoke sprayed shwag or 'support human trafficking'. They WANT to get high and if they have the option to do so legally with a product they know will be good from a supplier they know they can trust, they will do so.

Also, if the growth of marijuana was legalised, the people who steal electricity because they don't want to get in legal trouble for growing weed would stop stealing electricity, because they don't want to get in legal trouble. The kind of person who steals electricity simply to avoid paying for electricity isn't stopped anyway by the fact that it's illegal and even if the growth of marijuana was legalised, they would still be prosecutable for stealing electricity. Nobody's proposing we just let them steal electricity.

Despite that they are added to GDP, they really are a cost - think of it in real terms, we're sitting working away in factories to ship the produce off-shore. Why do we do this? So that we receive GBP, GBP the buyer has purchased using their own currency.

The GBP exporters receive then is simply the GBP our importers put up for fx exchange. Of course it's a little more complicated in reality - the foreign sector may decide to buy GBP and not use it to purchase exports immediately but instead as a store of value or investment. This means a trade deficit today - we import more than we export, so that the foreign sector can accumulate GBP. Should they decide they want to dip into their savings, we'll run a trade surplus.

Note though, that this is for free floating currencies - the logical way they should be run. Back in the day we used to have to export to acquire ""money"" - for it did not come from within. It came from gold and/or USD. Under these systems, exports literally import more ""money"". This allows more money to enter circulation, more people to have jobs at home etc. It's what drove every nation to be [mercantilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) - each attempting to export more than it imports, which is clearly impossible in aggregate.

They probably are, unless you started uni last year. From 1998-2012 the terms are awesome, it's the BoE base rate + 1% or RPI, whichever is lower. That leaves them currently at 1.5%. Coming after 2012 they range between RPI and RPI + 3%, depending on your earnings (earn more, pay more interest) although are at RPI + 3% until you graduate.

A recent speech given (http://www.newstatesman.com/economics/2013/06/danny-alexander-confirms-student-loan-book-will-be-privatised) says that the coalition want to sell the student loans off. A leaked report some time ago (http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/why-privatise-student-loans-andrew-mcgettigan) suggested this approach but said they'd be hard to sell because a 1.5% interest rate and no guarantee of payment is a pretty poor debt to buy. The suggestions were to do one of the following:

* Financial incentives, selling them at a large loss/or giving people money
* Raising the cap
* Removing the cap

Whether or not they're able to do this is possibly up for debate, but it doesn't seem like it was clearly not possible.

&gt; I would still say paying for education is a bad idea, you can always change your mind and pay them off at a later date if that becomes the best use of the money.

There's no university town/city that I would explicitly say you should stay away from, though obviously the bigger the town, the more there is to do. Once you've researched interesting looking courses, come back here and ask if anyone knows anything about the cities that offer the best courses.

Obviously each city will have its own pros/cons/specific attractions, and that's what I feel Reddit is probably best to help you with, but I suppose the common theme is that, by and large, you should be OK relying solely on public transportation. Each university will cater well for its students - at Leeds the main student housing area was 15 minutes walk from campus, and I believe the same can be said about Manchester/Bristol and others. You almost certainly won't need a car with you wherever you end up. 

As others have pointed out, London is much more expensive than other places in the UK, and you should budget accordingly. My sister studied in London and paid about £120 a week in rent, while I was at Leeds and paid about £60 a week.

I'm fairly certain that's the same case in Aus, NZ, and all European countries.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt;So why don't we just borrow trillions of pounds worth of debt, and defer all interest payments until the year 3013?

There's still the real limit of resources available to the government. It cannot allow labour to become scarce, for instance, or prices will rise. Nor can it attempt to purchase more imports than our exporters can support, nor can it attempt to purchase more iron ore than we can produce, etc.

&gt; So if the British government attempts to borrow as much from British people as it wants, at a ridiculously low interest rate, as you suggest, people will just stop lending to it.

Then **all** lending has stopped in GBP. No bank would loan to a houseowner for a lower interest rate than it would the government.

&gt;Monetary inflation is a stealth-tax, and debt is just offsetting that tax for later.

Question. If the government funds a billion pound deficit via bond sales, it creates a billion pounds worth of bonds and sells them at auction. We receive back the same billion pounds we spend at auction as government expenditure, **and** receive a billion pounds worth of bonds.

The bond funded deficit therefore increases our net savings by a billion pounds - there's now a heap more people that can proudly tell people that they have a heap more in extremely liquid assets than they used to be able to. That their bank accounts are higher.

Why do you see that as inherently less inflationary than simply printing a billion pounds? Both ways you add a billion pounds to bank accounts (although in one scenario the bank holds them as bonds, the other as cash). As far as I can tell, whether you own a billion pounds of cash or a billion pounds of bonds you are equally wealthier and can exert just as much pressure on prices - yet you see one as inflationary, and one as not. Why is that?

And if your theory was correct, that printing bonds is inherently less inflationary than printing cash (assuming interest rates on risk-free debt are maintained the same both ways by the central bank), then why is QE not proving hugely inflationary in Japan and the US?

&gt; It doesn't matter how much you borrow, or when it gets repaid, it's always a burden on future production.

We are always consuming all we are producing **less** our net exports. Provided we're not forcing people into unemployment at a later date due to allowing spending to become scarce (as we are today), I cannot really see how our net savings (equivalently government debt) can be a burden on future production.",0,1372849040,null,0,false,0,cav3zdx,t3_1hhdyq,t1_cav3zdx,t1_cauf309,null,1430598312,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Loaning them players (that are probably a bit above Swindon development wise) should help them see promotion, which in turn means spurs will have a championship team to loan multiple players too. Hell, if rumours are to be believed spurs are willing to sell players to Swindon with a 1p buyback to get past the 4 player cap on loans.

The aim of the war on drugs is simple, reduce drug use and harm. Since those stated goals tens of thousands of peer reviewed scientific reports [and dozens of people who know way more about the issue than you or I ever will](http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/wp-content/themes/gcdp_v1/pdf/Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf) state that those goals have completely and utterly failed in every meaning of the word.

They've failed at prevention. They've failed at helping users. They've failed as a deterrent. They've failed in use rates and they've failed at enforcement. They've failed at preventing smuggling. They've failed at criminal justice. In every way its possible to fail, it has.

However those same studies show that the original goals can be acheived... by legalising it. Might seem counter-intuitive... but the science proves it. If you make something illegal, it will not prevent people from using it. If you make it legal, the same people will use it... not more (sometimes marginally more, a lot of the time less). But most importantly you can target the problem users with healthcare treatment if they suffer from addiction (which WHO say is only 10% of users, 1 in 10... so 90% of drug users are functioning users with no adverse reactions to their working life).

If the exact same thing came out about murder - that we could reduce the number of murders by changing the law, or treating it as a mental health issue... and hundreds of scientists and world leaders agreed - and countries had done it and succeeded... then yes.

Salvaxe had an abusive childhood - her father would mock her accomplishments and belittle her ambitions.

Consequently, for her discussion is not about constructively arriving at a consensus (for example), instead Salvaxe sees all debate as inherently antagonistic. 

Not only that, but she has a very robust ego - admitting she might be wrong about something is an admission of failure. Instead of an opportunity to find anther solution, it's opening herself up to insults and mockery, so that's why she can't do it. I admit she's fucking ignorant, but in that regard this subreddit's reactions to her only prove her right.

[Legal highs which are being made illegal now, ridiculously.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017)

Do you agree with the government ignoring their own advisory council on drugs and doing whatever they want without evidence?

It happened quite a few years ago when I was reliant on my parents for transport some of the time and they let me borrow the family car for an hours trip between towns. 

Arriving at my destination town I was stuck in traffic and heard sirens behind me - I pulled over to let the police car pass along with all the other traffic but was shocked when it pulled *me* in. Bear in mind I had been sat in traffic for the past 10 minutes so knew I hadn't been speeding. 

The officer came over and I asked what was wrong - he asked if the car was mine (""no, my parents but they let me borrow it"") and he went on to tell me that not only was the car not road taxed but also not insured (at all, not just for me). Turns out  that my parents had received the letters through but as they hadn't used the car for about a week, they hadn't thought about it and didn't renew either road tax or insurance. 

About an hour later and a lengthy phone call to my parents and - rather than lose my license or receive any kind of points - I was allowed to go on my way. The cop saw we weren't trying to take the piss but genuinely didn't realize the mistake. He had us register insurance on the spot but get road tax within a week and send proof… and that was that! 

Considering a situation that could've been much worse for me - I'll always be grateful for the lenience shown for a situation that was (at the end of the day) entirely the fault of myself and my parents.

An ounce of tobacco costs around £7 of which around £6.10 is tax (20% VAT = £1.20, plus tobacco duty of £4.90 give or take).  Tax accounts for 87% of the retail price.

An ounce of cannabis costs around £280.  At those same tax rates, it would provide around £243 of tax revenue per ounce.

It is estimated that 3 tonnes of cannabis are consumed each day in the uk.  That's 105,822 ounces or £25 million in tax revenue per day, or £9.3 billion per year.

Although it's a back-of-an-envelope calculation based on estimates, it suggests that you're right  - we probably wouldn't get more than £9m from cannabis tax, but it's not far off.  If you factor in the savings from policing, etc., then an overall saving of £9m or more is plausible.  There's also the fact that usage might increase when legal (for better or worse) which would result in more tax revenue.

To be honest, the potential tax revenue is a nice bonus, but it's not a compelling argument for legalisation in my book.  Cannabis should be legal because no government should have the right to tell any adult what naturally occurring plants they may or may not cultivate and ingest.
