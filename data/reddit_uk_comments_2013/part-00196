No I'm not an idiot, fucking, blithering, or otherwise. No, low interest rates mean that borrowers became even more leveraged and therefore further increased property prices disproportionally to earnings (rent). Which is what has happened. 

Landlords didn't buy one property then stop there, they brought a second one using the first a security, then a third. Each time maxing out the amount they were able to borrow. In the mean time the BoE lowered interest rates making larger loans possible meaning that more and more people were getting in on the game. 

Today we have landlords who have bought property and cover the mortgage with the rent on a 4-5% (for example) interest only loan. The entire rent just about covers the mortgage and running costs. They expect the their profits to be made at the end of the sale of the property when they retire (anthropomorphising the speculation as their pension to make it sound like it's not just pure speculation).

See, if you take one Landlord who purchased a property and rented it out then paid down the debt, and then paid his/her taxes your arguments make a little sense. If you think about how people have behaved collectively then fixing the market so it's better for speculators rather than savers leads to something that will be on par with the great depression.

Finally, low interest rates are a mirage to most economists because the perception is that we will never see the rates we had in the 90s (16% and higher). The reality is that we don't need rates that high to cause the system to buckle. Even taking them to 2% will be cause a massive recession. Imagine now a landlord who has to deal with an increase on his interest only mortgage from 8% to 10% and then tries to pass that cost on to his tenant, let me tell you that in most cases is very unlikely to happen.

Now I'm sure that you know some scenarios that don't fall into this category, or you've invest properly and don't see a problem with the market the way it is. That's okay, markets in a bubble don't need everyone to be caught up in it, and they don't need everyone to be around when they pop. Stock, tulip, and property markets only need a fraction of trades to go sour to see the whole thing fall apart.

I think everyone is living with some scars because of the show. As you said, the whovians may never don those costumes again. The heroes have lost fans and gained a lot of scrutiny. I'm optimistic though, I think things CAN change. I would love a documentary like ""[Cosplay! Crafting a secret Identity!](http://video.pba.org/video/2365060703/)"" I've also read just as many accounts of people wanting to cosplay now because of what they've seen on TV. I can come along side of those that have been discouraged and assuage their fears and explain what conventions are really like. But I can't inspire someone the way they can. 

It may be ignorant of me, but I think the heroes, whovians, and community can embrace this and mold it into something better. Because if there's enough draw for a second season/new show - then they'll need cosplayers and convention's support. And I think everyone will be the wiser.

IMO that's totally different from forcing your children to wear it.

When you not only raise your daughters so they must cover themselves like this, but isolate them so that all their whole peer-group thinks its normal, and allow them only friends who are in the same position - that feels like borderline child-abuse to me.

Like maybe most of these girls are totally ok with it, and also totally psychologically ok, but I really feel like it makes coercion and ostracism way too easy.

I'm in exactly the same position as Vaneshi, in that I support people being allowed to end their lives (and get the proper assistance to do so), but also am fine with charging people for inciting suicide, and I maintain the two are very different issues that you muddy the waters by mentioning in the same breath.

I think there's two points where you're mistaken, leaving out the nonsense about being upset and offended and all that. Nobody mentioned being upset, so that's just something you've woven out of whole cloth and not worth addressing.

&gt;  How can encouraging someone to do something legal be illegal?

This starts quite simple - by having the encouragement rather than the act illegal. This would hardly be the only situation which that would be the case for; fraud would be the biggest example. If I encourage you to deposit money in my account, I've just encouraged you to do something that's entirely legal. But my encouragement, specifically, would be what is illegal.

I don't mean to imply there's any real comparison between the two crimes, by the way - I just want to make clear that encouraging someone to do something can be illegal even if the act itself is not.

&gt; Either all who incite or assist suicide are prosecuted or none are.

And here's the crux of the matter - your confusing the issue by mixing these two as if they were equal.

To incite is, potentially, to cause. When someone incites someone to suicide, they have taken an action that potentially can directly cause the death of another human being - a situation that may not have happened without your intervention. To put it in purely utilitarian terms, you've increased unhappiness and pain for people.

To assist is to aid someone in doing something themselves; when you assist someone in committing suicide, the decision has already been made. That person has already decided to do so, and helping them do so simply makes the process more comfortable. Again, speaking in utilitarian terms, you've decreased the amount of pain and suffering.

And you're claiming these two acts are equivalent? THAT is not a logically consistent position.

TL;DR you're drawing a false equivalence between two distinct and very different acts.",0,1379562718,null,0,false,0,ccb833x,t3_1mn0h7,t1_ccb833x,t1_ccb5erw,null,1429414417,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

Most supermarket chains are only regional in the USA.  There are some exceptions.  One is the worlds largest retailer - Walmart.  If Walmart has an equivalent British supermarket, however, it would have to be Asda, as they are owned by Walmart.

Tesco is the worlds third largest retailer (after Walmart and Carrefour).  When they were run by Sir Terry Leahy, I might have bet on them even passing Walmart one day (under his leadership they went from about number 15 in the world to number 3.)  They certainly are not having much trouble from Asda (Walmart in the UK).  But, I'm not sure they still have it.  They came expensively unglued in their US West Coast foothold, and are selling it.

There is really not a close Tesco Equivalent in the USA.  

Whole Foods Markets might be considered a Waitrose sort of equivalent.  In a market where Walmart owns low price, they have grown rapidly and made good profits competing on organic, natural, fresh, and high end food at high prices.  They are pretty much nation wide, but only in selected (affluent) neighborhoods.

The average region has many supermarkets.  I am in the suburbs of Boston.  Locally we have Walmart, Costco (bulk buying from warehouse, you need to buy club membership), Shaws ( once owned by Sainsburys in the UK - they couldn't make money from it - sold it to venture capitalists), Stop and Shop (owned by Royal Dutch Ahold), Market Basket (Prices almost as low as Walmart and much better food!  god only knows how they do it?), Crosbys (a very small local chain with about 5 stores - competes on monopoly locations.  Is the only supermarket in a few small but affluent towns), Whole Foods Market (very good, very expensive, a bit too far away), Trader Joes (another very interesting chain that has figured out how to compete with Walmart - most equivalent to M&amp;S in the UK - they do only own brands, lots of unique things, lots of ready to eat).

Everyone who wanted to use the train for specific reasons (wanting to work on the way, not being able to park car, not wanting to drive yourself, you want to catch a nap, wanting to go to Europe without driving on the (in)correct side, not being able to drive) ~~would not be using it.~~ ^edit would have more choices. ^/edit (I left out speed purposely in that list.)

They would be using a ubiquitous network of on-demand, self-driving cars. The road network already exists, is far more flexible, is extensible, has greater reach; and automated individual vehicles would have more advantages than trains. I'm not quite sure about speed (remember, ***HS***2), and whether the safety aspects of it would mean that the speed limit of those cars would be increased; but if money was a factor (and it always is), I think for an individual travelling from A to B the slower option may be cheaper.

I've seen another opinion piece in a newspaper stating that most workers would be telecommuting by the time the line opens. I'm not so convinced of that though. There are business and psychological advantages to working in close physical proximity to your colleagues.

I'm not particiularly against the idea of HS2 (I'd be more for it if they built a station at [Aylesbury](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=1986960#map=11/51.7085/-0.7213) or something thereby benefiting the people of the Chilterns, who are most opposed to it), but the Government should know that just because they invested in it, doesn't mean there won't be good-old capitalist competition.",0,1379565208,null,0,1379578731,0,ccb8s92,t3_1mn2g4,t1_ccb8s92,t3_1mn2g4,null,1429414091,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Consider Japan, Singapore, China, even where I am in HCMC.  It's somewhat like British avoidance behaviours on the tube, where social interaction is minimised and somewhat frowned upon, and a book is a welcome barrier, but in reverse.

It had a decent social scene such that you would bump into people you knew around town and on nights out but you could equally  go to places if you fancied it and not see anyone. There is some variety to the places. 

Around it is pretty nice, witht he new forest not far away and if you like windsurfing and the like there is plenty to be done. The other plus is not far from the rest of the UK. London is 2 hrs on the train or so maybe a little less. Likewise Heathrow airport is not that difficult to get to with a good bus connection.

however saying that, i did my postgrad in Edinburgh (i know definitely not Glasgow) and i think i would have had an awesome time had i been there for four years and i am sure the same would be the same with Glasgow. Seemed like there was just a lot more going on and being a much bigger city there was a greater variety of activities and stuff to check out.  i think i would lean towards this one myself.

Southampton maybe slightly cheaper in living costs.

We also need to make sure that we keep the ball till the final third and there, we look to just create space for anyone person. Our strikers need to take traditional striking positions and not try to come forward to play ball with the midfield trio. 

When Schurrle / Willian are playing in (and even Hazard up to a certain extent), we need to get more people in the box and put more crosses to boots.

Though 'Big Data'-type solutions are often the only ones that will work at more than a few TB, I'm not convinced that they're absolutely necessary for basic medical records. Storing 65 million people's data in 5TB of space affords you about 77KB of storage per person - approximately 3800 words of text encoded in UTF-8.

As a result, I think basic medical records probably only *just* push into the realm of Big Data. I suspect handling the number of people who want to query the database simultaneously is harder.

true,DarkLordOlli,null,null,"I don't think a 4-2-3-1 will ever work out for this team. You have such an amazingly creative offensive midfield but by playing this system you essentially have to cut either Oscar or Mata which I just can't understand. 

What if, just once, we'd try something like a 4-1-4-1 with a lineup like this:

Cech - Azpilicueta, Cahill, Luiz, Cole/Bertrand - Mikel - Hazard, Mata, Oscar, Wilian/Schürrle - Torres

Why? Obviously Oscar and Mata can both start. Mikel is rock solid defensively and Azpilicueta + Cole/Betrand can close the space on the wings. 

Both games against Everton and Basel we had about 70 minutes of pinning them back but always running into a wall when we reach the box. With 3 offensive midfielders you just run against that wall all game. Van Ginkel barely contributed anything forward and there were hardly any good runs because there simply were no players free to make them. If Either Hazard or Willian makes a run into the box and the ball gets intercepted, suddenly there's a huge gaping hole on the wing. With 4 forward you naturally have more surface area around the defense, they have more players to deal with and if someone makes a run into the box, there's 3 others to fill the hole.

TL,DR - I don't think this team needs two defensive midfielders. At least not against any team that isn't a Champions League contender like Barcelona or Bayern.

I know that's a big experiment but I feel like a system similar to that would suit the players and their individual qualities far better.",0,1379574560,null,0,1379574881,0,ccbao82,t3_1mo6yn,t1_ccbao82,t3_1mo6yn,null,1429413210,8,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,8

All of the men where are the end of their tether, they where desperate for help (which is why they where in the documentary) - they constantly said they where not evil, just mentally broken.

Mikel and Ramires should be paired up. Mikel can cover Luiz when Luiz moves forward. It is a good balance. I loved Ramires' runs vs Everton.

But, in general, I would like for Chelsea to just stop with the experiments. Start with something that works, and then rotate the squad. Not fully change everything.

At the moment, Mourinho is acting like, I have this new toy, I'm going to play with it right away. Starting Eto'o right away, and then starting him again and then adding Willian to the mix. I know they played together at Anzhi, but, come on. Give them a chance to gel. 

This team is so congested in the middle, kind of miss Moses right now. Schurrle could provide the width, he had a terrible game vs Everton, but I don't see that as a reoccurring pattern.

I don't like doing starting XI, but next game, this is who I would like to see starting the next game.

Do they?  It's an interesting point. If you've made yourself intentionally homeless because you couldn't keep up with the rent and they deem that you could have paid that rent ( which they obviously will because of the nature of the bedroom tax ) then they don't have to provide you with anything. You're on your own. 

You'll also be on your own if they offer you a shit hole ( say like a multi occupation or shared accommodation bedsit )  you refuse it ( for whatever reason; they could stick you with a bunch of junkies, you may just have too much stuff and can't to move, you may be ill  ) and then they evict you. 

I predict a debate coming up as to the nature of intentional homelessness over this issue because anyone deemed intentionally homeless won't be eligible for help. 

And anyway, even if they don't decide to evict, you can bet that they'll still come after the rent arrears through the courts. Which will eventually mean bailiffs knocking on your door and people losing everything anyway.

No it didn't because there was still a maximum LTV so you had to have the deposit available to do it and when I did it was a maximum 70% LTV so unless you had a 30% deposit plus fees, in my case £3,500, the it wasn't happening.

&gt; Today we have landlords who have bought property and cover the mortgage with the rent on a 4-5% (for example) interest only loan. The entire rent just about covers the mortgage and running costs.

Shows just how much you know. I have done that and the mortgage payment is just over 50% of the rent so I draw an income from it **and pay income tax on the difference** currently around £700 a year tax bill.  

&gt; Imagine now a landlord who has to deal with an increase on his interest only mortgage from 8% to 10% and then tries to pass that cost on to his tenant, let me tell you that in most cases is very unlikely to happen.

Really it would when the AST came to an end or the tenant moved out - the next tenant would be hit with it.

&gt;If the court gives your landlord a possession order and you still don’t leave, your landlord must apply for a warrant for eviction - this means bailiffs can remove you from the property.

Bullshit.

The original GTA was huge at the time.  I can't remember anyone back in the day who had not played the game on the PC. Everyone had played it, if they had not played the game they wanted it. So basically it was exactly like GTA 5 or CoD games are now, it's just that the scene was much smaller.

On the PS1 it was one of the best selling games of the year; I can't find any info about the PC release, but most people I knew played the superior PC version. Sales were boosted thanks to a media campaign by the Daily Mail to get the game banned and it being a topic of discussion in parliament.

&gt;With its profile boosted by the controversy-press, GTA strode on to become one of the biggest-selling PSone titles of the year.

When some people see life as a game, they will find ways to cheat. No doubt. 

But not everyone who's poor and on this system is doing that.

What the Tories have done though is looked at the tabloid rhetoric and how a few cases have turned the minds of the public and jumped on it using it to their advantage. 

The thing is though, the Tories and their cronies are the one's really taking the piss. Big time. On a scale that's exponentially larger. 


Going after the poor is a tactic they're using to divert the attention away from what they're really doing; and that's sending our social services system up the river. They want rid of it, they have done for years. Same with the NHS. 

They can't make enough money from it. 

So whilst this ""the poor are taking the piss out of the benefits system"" rhetoric is running through our society like a virus, they're standing back rubbing their hands with glee. 

When they've kicked away one set of steps though there's always another one right above it. 

You might be on that one. So don't be so quick to help them.

true,samw11,null,null,"I often do use the ""wrong side"", however, I don't like doing it. Here's why;

1. I have experienced the ""it doesn't reach"" shame. One particular garage near me has signs up saying not to, people still do! It's always smugness inducing to watch, knowing that you are on the right side.

2. Avoid spreading grime across the back of my car (especially when she's just been cleaned) or scratches to the spoiler/paintwork on those nozzles with the solid lump to protect the bend in the hose - the clanking noise of those on someones rear window goes right through me.

3. I'm not rich &amp; filling my tank up from empty can easily cost £70. i don't always have £70 spare &amp; can only afford to put a weeks worth of petrol in (usually £40). From the wrong side of the car, some garages have iddy-biddy tiny little displays &amp; I can't actually see how much I'm putting in... playing Russian Roulette with my bank balance is rather unpleasant!

4. My stupidest reason, is that although beloved &amp; I both drive Fords... the filling cap is on the 'wrong' side of his car. I always just feel like people are watching me thinking, ""look at the stupid woman who can't remember which side of her car to fill up on"" &amp; I stand there, blushing crimson &amp; honestly believing that if I think ""this isn't my car"" loud enough inside my head, people will stop judging me!

5. Finally, and most commonly, it's because when I get there to join the queue, all of the pumps look busy. I have to choose a lane &amp; then the other queue (the one I didn't pick) always, always, goes faster &amp; I'm left sat at the back feeling stupid and unwilling to reverse out of the queue I picked a) in case another car comes in mid-manoeuvre &amp; b) because it would shame me to be so impatient and un-British that I would change queues!

But, when I am in my husband's car, I regularly use the 'wrong' side by accident &amp; in my car I will occasionally do it if, I know the garage (&amp; therefore that the hoses will reach), I know I have sufficient funds to fill up in case I can't see the display &amp; finally, if I am in a hurry &amp; there is a ridiculous queue for just one side, at which point, I am always very grateful to the people who queue for the 'right' side.

I imagine he was assuming that you've not already accepted a binding offer in settlement of the incident, when saying that. 

&gt; Is this even legal ?

It would appear that the police officer was wrong to approach you and the ""I don't feel comfortable"" suggests to me he'd received a directive from up on high, poor man. Whether the directive is due to [something like this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21586786) or something more insidious (who are the girl's parents?) I wouldn't like to guess

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_misconduct

(My own first-hand experiences had already led me to suspect that manipulation of the figures is common in many English police forces.)

&gt; i have been getting emails from my insurer saying the other sides insurers ( the cars actual owners insurers) are still chasing the police report.

FWIW I would guess that the insurer of the apparently-stolen car will be waiting for reliable evidence as to how the car was misappropriated before reimbursing your insurer. Evidence submitted, and facts found, in a criminal court could be crucial. It could be that the insurer will be off the hook for example if facts came out that the owner was grossly negligent such as leaving the keys where a child/thief could access them. Of course the supplier of alcohol could also be implicated, especially as this involves a child. Without the alcohol probably none of this would have happened. Many people could have been killed, perhaps due to a sexual predator or a greedy shopkeeper/illegal distiller. LOL, any idea whether that issue has been successfully swept under the carpet - seen anything in the local newspaper about it or similar?

If it's found to be appropriate that government, companies (shops, businesses etc.) or any other 'establishment' can demand all people's faces be uncovered then there must be legal precedent which should really be established on a nation wide basis. France has already tackled this.

There's always billions left to start a war, maintain nuclear weapons and prop up outsourced areas of the public sector which politicians profit from and go and work for after they are finished being an MP. Then when it comes to people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, we don't have the money NOT to force them to undergo physically and mentally debilitating medical assessments over a few quid a week. We can't afford NOT to throw grieving mothers out of their own homes after their kids die, either.

In any case, who even said that the mother was unemployed? Chances are that she is employed but isn't paid enough to be able to afford not to be turfed out of her own home. If she isn't employed, perhaps she would have been able to get a job if this government (and the previous one to a lesser extent) hadn't spent years turning actual jobs into government-subsidised no pay workfare positions or two quid and something an hour if you're lucky 'apprenticeships'.

So there we have it. I, at 18, broke the law when I was with my girlfriend, 17.

We got together when we were 17, but then when I turned 18 and we carried on having sex, I was apparently breaking the law. Who'da thunk.

They've replied to me within hours if not minutes of me sending them a Tweet, I've had a replacement modem, and I've had a couple techs come out. They escalated it to BT Broadband who checked my wiring and rewired the pit outside my house. 

They follow up every complaint, they send me emails to help me. It's all been good.

The only bad thing they did to me was phone me up with an annoying sales call guy who wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer. I hung up and sent them a letter of complaint.

Lately there has been controversy over the use of the term. The FA recently issued a statement that Spurs supporters who use this term will be prosecuted for it. I think it is ridiculous.

We can score from other areas of the pitch. Torres led our scoring with 22 goals for us throughout the season, which is still a respectable amount. Our midfield scored 81 goals, between 6 players (Mata, Hazard, Lampard, Ramires, Moses, and Oscar). Our defense scored 27 goals between 4 players (Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill and Luiz).

Unless you've lived on a council estate in the 80's, you're hardly qualified to judge.

Independent schools are obviously not subject to the same oversights, from a school culture POV, as state-run schools. And it would seem odd in the extreme for a non-Muslim family to send their child to a school that enforced the Islamic dress code on its pupils. 

At the same time, and bearing in mind all the frictions between Islamic and liberal Western culture over the last few decades, there is something deeply frustrating to many people about the enforcement of something that a liberal secular culture finds not just distasteful, but fundamentally disrespectful to the rights of women. 

And therein lies the rub: cases like this fuel the fire of right-wing rags who point to the continued refusal of some British Muslims ""integrate themselves"" with the culture of the country they've moved to. Meanwhile we, as a country that promotes religious tolerance (at least in principle) try to reconcile our tolerance with a religion which carries so many rules and laws that seem, by nature, to be intolerant. 

So it's not as simple as ""it's a private school, so they can do what they want"". Private schools, for example, permitted corporal punishment long after state-run schools outlawed it. In fact, corporal punishment in schools that are entirely privately funded was not banned until 1999. There's a case that went to the European Court of Human Rights in '93: look it up.

Yes, absolutely. Mainstream neoclassical economics exists to push broken rightwing trickle-down theories from Milton Friedman that cause enormous suffering. The complete failure of their theories to predict the economic collapse of five years ago has not made the slightest difference.

Harvard has been heavily criticized for continuing to promote reality-free economic theories.

http://rwer.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/

&gt; As Harvard undergraduates, we enrolled in Economics 10 hoping to gain a broad and introductory foundation of economic theory that would assist us in our various intellectual pursuits and diverse disciplines, which range from Economics, to Government, to Environmental Sciences and Public Policy, and beyond. Instead, we found a course that espouses a specific—and limited—view of economics that we believe perpetuates problematic and inefficient systems of economic inequality in our society today.

&gt; A legitimate academic study of economics must include a critical discussion of both the benefits and flaws of different economic simplifying models. As your class does not include primary sources and rarely features articles from academic journals, we have very little access to alternative approaches to economics. There is no justification for presenting Adam Smith’s economic theories as more fundamental or basic than, for example, Keynesian theory.

Economics is not a science, it's an evidence-free cult that knows how to use integral signs. (And this is precisely what we would expect given basic economic principles of supply and demand. Academic economists will simply promote theories which make their benefactors rich...)

Oh that's right... there are not enough of these types of properties available, and those that are are HMO or houses that have been 'converted' to flats that are even smaller than comparable one bed properties...

Easiest way to solve the problem is to bring back an extensive building programme to boost Single Occupant dwellings (heck create 'retirement villages' for older people) then introduce Rent caps on BTL properties (you are aware that BTL properties generally have to be returning 120% of mortgage cost in rental as part of contract terms?)

Hence BTL properties become more expensive for housing benefits to fund, and tend to be a lot larger than single occupancy dwellings.

There really isn't a shortage of 2 bed council houses in this country, it's 3+ beds that's the problem and there are many many more people stuck in houses that are too small for them and the papers are not going out to take pictures of those families with 3 sad looking kiddies all crammed into one bedroom.

I'm not saying the government is going around this the right way, it's a half assed blanket tax that does not take individual circumstances into account, but the fact is that it's the pensioners they are trying to get out of houses and into smaller flats but they can't say that because it would lose them a shitload of votes.

true,CptES,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;At the same time, and bearing in mind all the frictions between Islamic and liberal Western culture over the last few decades, there is something deeply frustrating to many people about the enforcement of something that a liberal secular culture finds not just distasteful, but fundamentally disrespectful to the rights of women. 

While partly true, it's worth noting that there's plenty of Muslim women who actively like wearing the Hijab as a statement of modesty and religious pride. Actively stopping them from doing so is every bit as bad as actively mandating that they wear them in society.

&gt;And therein lies the rub: cases like this fuel the fire of right-wing rags who point to the continued refusal of some British Muslims ""integrate themselves"" with the culture of the country they've moved to. Meanwhile we, as a country that promotes religious tolerance (at least in principle) try to reconcile our tolerance with a religion which carries so many rules and laws that seem, by nature, to be intolerant. 

Talk to me once the Church of England stops fucking over LGBT people. When Little Englanders actually stop blaming ""foreigners"" for everything from theft to the rain that day. When the Orange Order and Sinn Fein realise that the world doesn't need both sets of cunts. The UK is more tolerant than a lot of countries, but the adage of stones in glass houses comes to mind.

&gt;So it's not as simple as ""it's a private school, so they can do what they want"". Private schools, for example, permitted corporal punishment long after state-run schools outlawed it. In fact, corporal punishment in schools that are entirely privately funded was not banned until 1999. There's a case that went to the European Court of Human Rights in '93: look it up.

_being unable to downsize due to the lack of housing stock in the rental sector._

Are you really suggesting that families still often with young children be forced to share? For couples in their 50s and early 60s?

I think the lack of width is also pretty obvious, which is not terminal. Hazard can get wide and I'm sure Willian is capable too. Is this their natural tendency/using their best skills? Maybe not, but playing to everyone's strengths is causing a huge amount of clutter which I think is why we're having trouble putting that last pass or last shot together. Yes both Cole and Iva are getting pretty advanced, but I don't think that is really solving the problem since at least 2 defenders follow Hazard whereever he goes.

Mikel needs to play more. Mata HAS to be starting. He is the focal point of the offense and Oscar just doesn't distribute as well as Mata did. It's a waste of talent to sit him on the bench.

Agreed. I was drawing the point about our society's norms, but you're right to raise the point. As with so many things, it's about perception and interpretation. Although I'm sure that plenty of liberal commentators would say that centuries of use have normalised it. 

""Talk to me once the Church of England stops fucking over LGBT people. When Little Englanders actually stop blaming ""foreigners"" for everything from theft to the rain that day. When the Orange Order and Sinn Fein realise that the world doesn't need both sets of cunts. The UK is more tolerant than a lot of countries, but the adage of stones in glass houses comes to mind."" 

You're conflating a lot of very different issues in your eagerness to get your ire across. Your point about Anglicanism is reasonable in some ways, not in others. For example, there are openly gay senior clerics in the Church of England. Bunching xenophobes together into the vaguely-defined ""little englanders"" is as reductionist as some of the reactionary right-wing nonsense you're purporting to disdain. And the problems in Northern Ireland are often as social as they are religious. Case in point: paramilitary groups' involvement with drug-dealing and other forms of everyday criminality, firstly to fund themselves but now, with the Troubles ostensibly - if not actually - over, as ends in themselves. 

Your final point passes me by completely. They're both customs, rules or whatever you want to call them. And they both take place in private schools. The point is not the nature or severity of the custom or punishment - which is, by the way, a completely subjective judgement - but that private schools have a certain amount of autonomy in how they're run, far more so than state-run schools, and that this autonomy has and does give rise to mores and rules that society at large may find unpleasant, distasteful or unacceptable.

I'll freely admit to that, my brain was defaulting to all of the intolerance I could think of in the UK off the top of my head.

&gt;The point is not the nature or severity of the custom or punishment - which is, by the way, a completely subjective judgement - but that private schools have a certain amount of autonomy in how they're run, far more so than state-run schools, and that this autonomy has and does give rise to mores and rules that society at large may find unpleasant, distasteful or unacceptable. 

This, I think is something we both agree on. Private schools are an entirely different social ballpark from public schools and what they choose is not always in lockstep with the rest of the country. My point is that of all the things to take aim at with the whole Western/Islamic culture divide, we should focus on greater society and just why do most large English (and a few Scottish cities, though oddly not really in Glasgow) cities have a sizeable, largely non-integrated Muslim population?",0,1379602058,null,0,false,0,ccbf78d,t3_1mnh1i,t1_ccbf78d,t1_ccbf1n4,null,1429411029,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

No seriously, in that specific case then there is NO alternative. Multiple rules that cannot be ignored leave no option but 3 bedrooms. Mum can't share with the elder or younger child, and they can't share with each other.


But that's not the case here. Just because the 16 year old is allowed her own room does not make it MANDATORY that she has her own room. 

Therefore there's no reason why a younger female sibling can't share with her, and therefore it is not incorrect to say she ""only needs only 3 rooms"". This is what I feel the inspector has done, i.e. applied a bit of logic that is seemingly lacking in these forums.

EDIT: I'll try to explain it with a simple analogy. Let's imagine two small children are fighting over the same toy. What is a mother to do? Buy a second identical toy so they can have one each? Or tell them to share the damn thing?

&gt; I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run. I didn’t like the culture that had grown up around the series. So I left, I felt, over a principle.

&gt; I thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of shit. I’m not being funny about that. I didn’t want to do that and it comes to the art of it, in a way. I feel that if you run your career and.. we are vulnerable as actors and we are constantly humiliating ourselves auditioning. But if you allow that to go on, on a grand scale you will lose whatever it is about you and it will be present in your work.

&gt; If you allow your desire to be successful and visible and financially secure – if you allow that to make you throw shades on your parents, on your upbringing, then you’re knackered. You’ve got to keep something back, for yourself, because it’ll be present in your work.

&gt; My face didn’t fit and I’m sure they were glad to see the back of me. The important thing is that I succeeded. It was a great part. I loved playing him. I loved connecting with that audience. Because I’ve always acted for adults and then suddenly you’re acting for children, who are far more tasteful; they will not be bullshitted. It’s either good, or it’s bad. They don’t schmooze at after-show parties, with cocktails.

Though I'm sad he left so quickly, though this is only his side of the story, I can respect his attitude, and I'm glad he enjoyed playing the Doctor.

That isn't an appeal to worse problem fallacy, that's how the government approaches the deficit.

true,mormengil,null,null,"There are currently no US ballistic missile defense systems in Europe.  The US has four ballistic missile defense systems deployed or under development.  

The first is called GMD (Ground-based Midcourse Defense).  This system is still being developed, but 30 interceptor missiles are deployed in Alaska and California (presumably against the threat of a North Korean strike).  The deployed number is supposed to rise to 44 by 2017.  These missiles are said to have a success rate of  worse than 50% so far, which is why they are still under development.  None of these defenses are deployed in Europe.

The second US system is the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence.  This is thought to be the USAs most fully developed, and best to date ballistic missile defense.  It was designed as a naval system, mounted on ships, and is currently deployed on 24 Navy ships, mostly with the Pacific Fleet (N. Korea again I guess).  There are supposed to be 35 ships equipped by 2015.  A land based version of this system is what the US proposes to deploy in Europe.  The plan is to make ""Aegis ashore"" sites in Poland and Romania to protect European allies from Iranian missiles.  These deployments are supposed to happen in 2018.

The third US BDM programme is called THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense).  This is a truck mounted system intended to ""protect critical assets worldwide"".  It is still under development, though testing is said to have been going well.  In April 2013, the US announced it would deploy one of its three prototype THAAD systems to Guam (presumably to guard against the N. Korean threat).

The 4th US BMD system is Patriot.  This is a missile designed to shoot down aircraft at long and intermediate ranges and high altitudes.  It was deployed in Israel during the Gulf war, where it did not do very well against Iraqi Scud ballistic missiles.  It has been through many upgrades since, and the current version is ""Patriot Advanced Capability - 3"".  The US recently deployed this system to Turkey to defend against missile attacks from Syria.  It is also deployed in S. Korea, (and probably other places where US troops are deployed).  Versions of this system have also been sold to US allies.  Taiwan, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Spain, and South Korea all own some Patriots at some stage of development.  The Patriot has always been a very good aircraft defense system, but how effective it is against ballistic missiles is classified.  The PAC-3 upgrade, however indicates that it might now be quite effective.  This involved a new missile designed by the Strategic Defence Initiative specifically for BMD.  This missile is much smaller, with 4 fitting in each Patriot canister which used to hold one, it is more maneuverable and it has an active radar seeker, which means it can guide itself on to an enemy missile rather than having to rely on signals from the ground.  Observers guess that Patriot is a lot better at BMD than it once was, but not as good as the Pentagon would like it to be, as the development programme is still fully funded and a - 4 upgrade is being considered.

In short, right now, there are no US missile defense systems positioned to be able to protect Britain.",0,1379605280,null,0,false,0,ccbgafg,t3_1mmu6b,t1_ccbgafg,t1_ccbc5v0,null,1429410521,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,MrPoletski,uk,Essex Boi,"'real' lift, not aerodynamic lift, is caused by a difference in air pressure above and below a wings surface. This difference in pressure is achieved by making the path for air above the wing longer than the path for air below it. [see this](http://assets.openstudy.com/updates/attachments/4e1c50990b8bc227574857a3-jonnymca-1310498820194-airplanewing.jpg) This makes the air move faster above the wing than below it thus causing the pressure differential and lift.

Simply angling your wings upwards and 'slicing through' the air is using aerodynamic lift, literally turning drag into lift. An important thing to note: with a paper aeroplane, you can never cause it to accelerate skyward. The 'lift' produced by the wings is only apparent when it is thrown upwards (however acutely) but not directly upwards and vanishes as soon as the plane gets down to it's stalling speed, which will happen very quickly too.

Not only that, as soon as any appreciable level of aerodynamic lift would be generated, the wings will bend stopping that from happening because paper.",0,1379605496,null,0,false,0,ccbgd8b,t3_1mmxed,t1_ccbgd8b,t1_ccbf0w9,null,1429410484,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Well I don't know how it is in your line of business, but I certainly wouldn't say that it's *easy* to get a job here, or that there are lots of jobs on offer (although I guess London is a good place to start).

So if I were you, unless I had a lot of savings and time that I am willing to spend living in a very expensive city looking for work, I would start job hunting way, way in advance and try and set something up before you even get here.

I don't think being foreign will really count against you. If you have your own visa, and don't need a company to sponsor you, finding a job will be much easier since the company doesn't have to worry about immigration quotas and visas.

If you're in TV/entertainment, then you might also want to consider Manchester as an option (my hometown :)). BBC has a large presence there in a very fancy new development called the Salford Quays. Perhaps other TV companies also have stuff there.

Manchester is in the North West of England, and is I believe the 3rd largest city in the UK. It has all the benefits of a big city without being as busy and expensive as London, but obviously no city in the UK beats London in terms of sheer number of things to do and places to go. I love Manchester most because everything in the North is a hell of a lot cheaper and they have a great Chinese community and food. If you like the great outdoors, Manchester is also very near the peak district and reasonably close to the lake district.

Sorry, I don't mean to digress from the subject.

Why pay more tax? shelve pointless vanity projects designed to do nothing but convince people to vote the current gov back into power..

NAO is good site to obtain idea of projects currently under development that could be reduced or stopped to ensure housebuilding is done.

But if this is too costly then how about actually enacting the 'British bill of Rights' the current gov promised to implement that would prevent Criminal Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants from exploiting Section 3 or Section 6 or the HRA to stay in this country, costing us millions every year to fight these cases, how about refusing to house people illegally bringing over huge families and claiming benefits, or Eu nationals leaving children at home than claiming benefits here at a vastly enhanced rate to their native country, and simply sending that money back to them...

Other EU countries can do this, why can't we? Housing Associations are more than capable of maintaining hosuing stock, the gov needs to fund this, which is more important at the moment? more housing for the population, and enacting legistlation to prevent people from amss buying these off the books then turning round and renting them out for more than a mortgage would cost (but that is a whole other rant tbh....)

true,daveime,eng-lancashire,Lancashire / Philippines,"&gt; The rules say the family is entitled to 4 bedrooms.

Nope, 3. That is what the whole topic is about.

&gt; The council do not get to arbitrarily make new rules.

They aren't. They are just applying ALL of the existing ones, not just the ones that suit your agenda.

1. The mother cannot sleep in the same room as the children. Therefore she must have 1 room for herself.

2. The 16 year old girl *can* have a room of her own, but it is NOT mandatory. That is the 2nd room.

3. The 2 youngest girls already share a room. That is the 3rd room.

4. The remaining boy CANNOT share with the older girl, but CAN share with the younger girls. However, as there's already two of them in that room, this is not an option.

5. The remaining boy CANNOT have a room of his own, because he is not deemed old enough.

Therefore, the only LOGICAL conclusion is that he must share with one of the younger girls. He needs somewhere to sleep, he cannot sleep with the mother or then older girl, so that only leaves one of his two younger siblings to sleep with. Of course that means one of the younger girls now no longer has anywhere to sleep, meaning she has to sleep with the older girl.

Just because the older girl *can* have a room of her own, it's pretty obvious that the other circumstances do not make this possible.

Therefore the council have said she is only entitled to benefit for THREE rooms, and not the four in the house.

FUCK ME, is logic really so hard, or are you just stubborn as fuck ?

ALL the rules are being applied, and she NEEDS 3 rooms, not 4. This is what the council have said when they claim the house is ""underoccupied"".

3% of families require 4 or more bedrooms, but can't get a property of that size. Meanwhile Paul and Toni have a spare room. Seems pretty unfair on the parents sleeping in the living room of a three bedroom house. 

Is there a surplus of 2 and 3 bedroom housing? If so, great! Move a lot of those 38% of singles into it. I shared when I lived in London, and I was earning a decent salary. I'm sure other people will cope. The 22% of the families can move into 26% of the accomodation leaving 4% free. That leaves room for a lot of the single people in two bedroom flats, which leaves room for a lot of the 1-child families in three bed houses. Move Paul and Toni into a vacant 3 bed house, and an underhoused family of 8 into their 4 bedroom house. 

Whatever numbers you use, unless you tell me that there's actually a *surplus* of social housing, we can use the number of bedrooms more efficiently. 38% being single gives a lot of flexibility here because a good number of them can share *or* have a single room flat.

[Here's Glen's passes vs. Villa.](http://i.imgur.com/ehCEBLq.jpg)

[Here's the Wizkid's passes vs. Swansea.](http://i.imgur.com/Zj797JC.jpg)

You don't have to be a genius to see that GJ attempted about 80% more passes than AW and failed less too. When we're struggling to circulate (in both games to be fair) then you can start to see why when we're missing some of our best footballers at the back (Reina and now Johnson).

Mignolet's done really well and I think replacing Reina with him is and will be proved the correct long term decision but right now we have to live the loss of the extra man on the ball at the back. How often last season did we see Reina collect the ball from one half of the defence and quickly shift it to the other full back and open up half the pitch. 

You can go on Statszone yourselves and see that our most common passing combinations on Monday night were between Sakho, Lucas and Enrique. I don't know about you but I don't think playing it through Enrique can be considered playing to our strengths.

tl;dr: Loss of Reina/Johnson is hurting our ball circulation, losing Reina was just about alright in this respect but the two combined looks like it'll cause us some problems. Of course there's nothing wrong with being more direct and having less of the ball but it does mean we'll have to drop deeper and soak up more pressure, which we did well in the first 3 games to be fair.

How much are we talking in real world terms? 

&gt; Difficult to implement

Not really - The States implemented a *huge* set of measures on flights following 9/11 without any difficulties. How many passengers go through security checks daily before flying in the UK? A sizeable percentage more than those required to fly them. Assuming *whatever* check is used is relatively fast and accurate, it shouldn't disrupt schedules by more than a few minutes. 

&gt; Unlikely to be accepted by pilot unions 

Well there's a surprise. Unions with their own members best interests at heart vs. general interest. The UK is no stranger to that. 

&gt; flight crew intoxication hasn't been a major factor

The thing is it shouldn't need to be a factor in an accident before we decide it's a bad idea, right? It ought to be a no brainer and yet a [quick Google search](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-08/bottle-to-throttle-a-short-history-of-drunk-pilots) turns up a history of drunk pilots with the starting paragraph focussing on a drunk *American Eagle* pilot *this year*. 

(That pilot was also in the process of taking off before being stopped - the only reason he was stopped at that point is because airport officials [smelt alcohol on him](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/09/kolbjorn-jarle-kristiansen_n_3048073.html) ). 

Thousands of people fly daily.

The rules allow one bedroom for:

- every adult couple (married or unmarried)

- any other adult aged 16 or over

- any two children of the same sex aged under 16

- any two children aged under 10 

Now those are the rules, you agree those are the rules. Nowhere is it stated ""at least"" two children as you tried to sneak in to the conversation. The rule says ""ANY two children"", and it is very clear.

So count with me ...

- any other adult aged 16 or over

The mom, and the daughter aged 16 = 2 rooms.

- any two children of the same sex aged under 16
- any two children aged under 10

Both could be equally applied as the two younger girls are the same sex and both under 16 and 10. So three rooms.

And that is where the rules run out. Nowhere does it state ""if you have a kid left over, *obviously* he needs a room of his own."" Nowhere.

The rules have been written (I admit very poorly) on the assumption that you can either pair kids off, or they are over 16. I'm not making any assertion about whether the law is ""fair"", whether it makes some strange assumptions about family sizes, or anything else. I'm merely stating that the law, AS WRITTEN, states she is entitled to payment for THREE not FOUR bedrooms under those rules.

The fact she has an extra child left over is her problem, and as I've repeated ad-fucking-nauseum, there is a simple solution. It doesn't ""go without saying"", or any other appeal to emotion you care to vocalize ... she is entitled to payment for 3 bedrooms only, and her 4th bedroom is considered underutilized.

And now I'm done, because when you refuse to apply logic or common sense, cannot even interpret the law as written, and use appeals to emotion and other ""stands to reason"" arguments, there's nothing more to discuss.",0,1379609582,null,0,false,0,ccbhv1b,t3_1mpauf,t1_ccbhv1b,t1_ccbhi7w,null,1429409787,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

&gt;sunday trading laws ? bishops in the house of lords ? RE being compulsary

all a bit archaic, just like the queen and her posse really. Ultimately all of it's pretty harmless imo (maybe with the exception of sunday trading laws) and the RE laws aren't all that bad (iirc it's one assembly a week and it doesn't have to be religious, only ""spiritual"" or something like that). The way the church runs deep in UK institutions isn't perfect, but it's not like they have any real level of control over things.

&gt;This could have gone another way you know, if they had not been so persecuted and someone had taken the time to educate them they could have changed their opinions

there's an abundance of evidence homosexuality isn't bad though- you can pick up a book, or google it, or (assuming they aren't in some ultra-crazy cult-like congregation) just ask their vicar. The bible certainly doesn't say anything about kicking gay couples out of B&amp;Bs regardless of how you read it

There has to be some pragmatic leeway.

Personally I think it's one of the merits of a more private-buisness orientated NHS... and I'm not against this. Ultimately it will cost the public more - a lot more, but if they public are saying they want an NHS that is squeaky clean then the way to get there is probably to fracture it into a large number of medium sized private enterprises. The competition between the organisations is what drives quality. That said, I'm not sure the current arrangements will really achieve that - as in many ways they just cherry pick the worst parts of socialised provision with the worst parts of privatisation.

true,blueb0g,eng-durham,Durham,"&gt; How much are we talking in real world terms?

More than airlines would be willing to pay. 

&gt; Not really - The States implemented a huge set of measures on flights following 9/11 without any difficulties. 

I don't see how this is relevant. Yes, lots of security measures were brought in after 9/11, where several thousand people were killed. That doesn't mean that installing a breathalyser device in cockpits would be easy. It's a logistical nightmare and would be questionably effective. There's no way to make it so that you have to pass the breathalyser to start up the aircraft anyway, it doesn't work that way. It's a technically unworkable solution. 

&gt;Well there's a surprise. Unions with their own members best interests at heart vs. general interest. The UK is no stranger to that.

So? Doesn't change the fact that it wouldn't make it through the unions, partly due to fears of management spying. This is why cockpit voice recorders are limited to 2 hours of recording and are wiped by maintenance crews following a normal flight. 

&gt; (That pilot was also in the process of taking off before being stopped - the only reason he was stopped at that point is because airport officials smelt alcohol on him[2] ).

No they really weren't, that's just the useless media not knowing how to use terminology or write articles properly. 

Flight crew turning up drunk is very rare and when it does happen, it's caught by a cabin crew member or the other pilots. Installing a breathalyser in cockpits would be inexpensive, unworkable, and ineffective. 

&gt; however I would not trust the safety of one other persons life

You entrust the flight crew with your life every time you fly...

&gt; If air operators around the world are prepared to go to almost draconian measures to prevent passengers from causing a problem on board an aircraft - I would hope that same stringent approach is extended to pilots

Not the same measures, obviously. Passengers act like cattle and should expect to be treated as such, the flight crew command the flight and can be trusted not to cause problems. In the rare instances where they cannot be trusted, it's already caught by the current system before it turns into a nastier situation.

In other words, you don't know for sure. 

&gt; I don't see how this is relevant.

You claimed that it would be difficult to implement a system that tests pilots flying out of the UK. I pointed out that huge security systems have been put in place in the past - clearly if the will is there, it's not that difficult. 

&gt; There's no way to make it so that you have to pass the breathalyser to start up the aircraft anyway.. 

Perhaps not currently, that doesn't make it impossible - it makes it impractical. Someone else pointed that out and I accept that there are plenty of other ways to achieve the same outcome: that an intoxicated person is not allowed into the cockpit of an aircraft. 

&gt; So? Doesn't change the fact that it wouldn't make it through the unions, partly due to fears of management spying. This is why cockpit voice recorders are limited to 2 hours of recording and are wiped by maintenance crews following a normal flight. 

What spying are we talking about here? It's a simple yes/no test for intoxication - no more or less. I'm not advocating spying on pilots to any degree. 

&gt; No they really weren't, that's just the useless media not knowing how to use terminology or write articles properly.

So what's the true version of events and where is your source? As with your statement about the cost of such checks - you can't make blanket statements and *not back them up*. (Well... you can, but it doesn't exactly add validity to anything you say). 

&gt; You entrust the flight crew with your life every time you fly...

Yup, and if they were intoxicated I would not feel comfortable. The same could be said for someone in charge of *any* passenger vehicle that I am on board. Surely that's a no brainer? 

&gt; Passengers act like cattle and should expect to be treated as such..

Well that's out of touch, right there. Passengers *are treated like cattle* and *have no choice but to act as such*. What other option is there? If I stop allowing myself to be herded through security checks, passport checks, booking systems etc. then *I won't be allowed onto my flight*. Again this is a no brainer.

I do not propose we treat pilots like cattle. I have every respect for them - *however* a system to check for intoxication would not be unworkable if implemented correctly. Unpopular maybe - perhaps that's what you meant? 

&gt; You may well be armed with a few google searches, but let me assure you, the current system works and yours would not. 

Again, you *need* to dish out some cited information first. I haven't seen any with regards to the costs... the implementation isn't outrageously difficult - a checkpoint system would do it if it's truly impossible to base the kit on board the aircraft. I'm not hung up on the idea of a system that only lets you start the aircraft when you blow into it - but *a* system would go a long to way preventing the chances of any pilot or crew stupid enough to board a plane whilst intoxicated from doing so. 

In terms of safety, I'm right. In terms of costs - I doubt the equipment comes close to much of the rest of what's involved in flying so whilst there would be an initial hit, perhaps it's a necessary evil. Oh and hey - I just created some jobs for whoever has to conduct and supervise the tests. 

If you can come up with some hard evidence, please be my guest. Otherwise - again - blanket statements that 'it just won't work' hold no validity. I've looked at your past posts - plenty of relevant to the aviation industry. Are you a pilot or work at an airport? Are you so opposed because the proposal is a hassle to you at work? 

I've every respect for the aviation industry. Being a pilot was a childhood dream of mine - but let's have a little clarity in terms of the facts. Random checks and 'we've been lucky enough not to have any accidents as a result of drunk flying' don't really fill me with confidence and as a passenger trusting the aviation industry with my life and safety (as everyone does) - it should be all about providing that confidence and safety as mandatory.

Given the social and community based pressure of secular groups, as well as strict indoctrination from childhood, it's little surprise that there hasn't been much in the way of rebellion against this. 

But then only today I read about an 'honour killing' in India that took place because the marriage of a 20 and 23 year old wasn't approved by one or both the families - both husband and wife are dead now. 

Culture can be a fucking ridiculous thing. There was an article in The Independent recently about Sharia courts operating in the UK. Illegal? Quite probably - but the communities they influence sure didn't seem inclined to be brave enough to speak out. 

&gt; I'd also say if we assume that is established, how can we say it is a bad thing?

See above, really.. 

&gt; Some women want to wear veils... 

Have we established *why*? Is it a genuine attraction to how they look? Religious symbolism? Or perhaps massive pressure throughout their lives? Perhaps they're just *saying* that they wear them out of choice or religious preference because they are aware of what would happen in their social circle of they spoke out to say they felt oppressed by being made to wear them. Food for thought? 

Regarding the comic... good point well made, except IIRC there are watchdogs in place to try and protect children against over-sexualisation. Only yesterday France moved to ban child beauty pageants... meanwhile on the flip side religious indoctrination starts at youth. 

&gt; Also the problem of anyone being forced to wear it would not go away were they banned - they would just be forbidden from leaving the house most likely, arguably a worse situation. 

You might be right - but perhaps that's where culture needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. 

Gay marriage is starting to be legally recognized now. Women have the vote where they didn't before - indeed in medieval times there were special masks forcibly worn by women to stop them speaking if they had spoken out of turn.

I think this argument has become twisted slightly. We now seem to be arguing two different questions, so let me clear something up.

If the question is, ""should more be done by some carriers/regulators to discourage commercial flight crews turning up for duty intoxicated"", then the answer is yes.

If the question is ""should breathalysers be installed on aircraft that do not allow drunk pilots to fly"", the answer is no, and that was the point we were arguing. That solution is unworkable, due to the nature of the pilot workforce relationship with management, the way an aircraft works and is started up, and safety fears about such a system incorrectly immobilising flight controls in flight. 

Under the current system, flight crew members are aware of the importance of not being over the limit (a quarter of the drink-drive limit), are aware of the consequences, and are subjected to random testing. It would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming for a test to be made every flight, so random testing is the most that can be done. The last part of the safety net is reinforcing the importance to other crew members to take action if they suspect a colleague is intoxicated.

This system has been shown to work pretty well (bear in mind, the only reason we are discussing this incident is because it's news - a rare event), and on the occasions a pilot does turn up drunk, they're stopped from flying. Again, in less developed regions (and I remind you that this pilot is from Pakistan, and not a western airline) the system works less well due to procedures being less robust. 

In the West, pilots being drunk has not been a major safety issue for some time and when you hear stories of planes ""just about to take off"" when the plane is stopped, they are invariably false. There hasn't been an accident attributed to pilot intoxication in a long while and though you might argue that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action, without some bodies to show for it, the regulators nor the industry will be able to justify the several billion spent worldwide on certification and instillation of such a system you propose

What can be done is more emphasis on the subject in training, recurrent checks and check rides, and a more explicit threat of dismissal. Any response to this problem has to come from an airline training standpoint, otherwise it will be ineffective and expensive.

And again, this very rarely happens, and when it does, what happened in the article happens - the offending flight crew member is stopped and is not allowed to continue in his duties. The airline industry is generally risk averse and if they - or the regulators - saw a serious problem with pilot intoxication, they would do something more about it. The fact that they haven't for the last 10 years shows us that it is both not a huge issue, and, when it does happen, is caught before departure.

Now, I haven't done piles and piles of research, but if this is correct, we should expect times for the 200m to be less than twice the length of times for the 100m (because the sprinter should be going at full speed the entire time, put part of the 100m is spent accelerating).

(Usain Bolt's times pulled from wikipedia)
Fastest 100m:  9.58s; based on this time we assume that the fastest 200m should be less than 19.16 (9.58s X 2).  However, the fastest 200m is 19.19s.

Of course, these times are very, very close and I am making the assumption that Bolt was running ""the same speed"" each time he set these records, which is quite an assumption.  I am also making the assumption that he is able to hit his top speed before the 100m mark.  Also, wind is listed as +0.9 for the 100m and -0.3 for the 200m.  No idea how much that matters.

For more data:
Taking the splits from this chart of the 200m, we see that 50m-100m is the ""fastest"", with 100m-150m 2nd, 150m-200m 3rd, and 0m-50m the ""slowest"" of the 4 quarters of the race.  From this we can infer that sprinters hit top speed before 100m, and are *not* able to continue at this top speed for even the full 200m.

http://videosportsanalysis.blogspot.com/2009/08/analyzing-usain-bolts-1919-second-200m.html


Looking at this chart, it would appear sprinters hit top speed around 50-70m and start slowing down around 80m.
http://speedendurance.com/2008/08/22/usain-bolt-100m-10-meter-splits-and-speed-endurance/


Also, I am assuming these charts have accurate data.  They came up with I googled ""usain bolt 100m split for 200m world record"".

To answer your second question the only words out of his mouth are ""I didn't do it"" and that's all I've got to go on beyond the body on the ground.  I would enter the situation cautiously whilst summoning assistance.   Without being able to properly see the situation its hard to run a full risk assessment and guage what actions I would or wouldn't take. 

&gt; what about if he points the knife at you and says ""I'm going to kill you"", is he innocent until he gets tried for assault? 

Technically, yes. 

&gt; while he's stabbing you to death are you going to console yourself with the fact it's possible he's innocent, because he hasn't yet been found guilty of attempted murder?

You make the assumption that in this hypothetical you can run away faster than I can.  Given the proper conditions this may not necessarily be so. ",0,1379619947,null,0,false,0,ccblqb3,t3_1mp8v0,t1_ccblqb3,t1_ccblij4,null,1429407908,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If you fancy a little variation in your juggling then you should try bounce juggling, it's great! Except for paying for good quality bounce balls, which can be £30 or more *each*. Chuffin' ouch!

If you're treating someone differently because of something you think they may have done, then by *definition* you are not treating them as if they are innocent.

&gt;Technically, yes. 

so if the police arrived and asked if he'd assaulted you, you wouldn't say ""yes"" but rather ""well, it hasn't been proven in court so I suppose he didn't actually do it after all""?

I've been looking at engineering jobs and most of them pay not much more than the graduate wages in Australia and the US.

In fact some jobs pay less than I received when I first graduated - in 1995.

I've been looking at the prices of houses around the M25 and they blow my mind! I have no idea how you can possibly afford those places on the median salaries.

What irks me is that the companies in the UK are selling or making the same sorts of products as everywhere else, yet they are able to pay UK citizens LESS than other countries. Have a look on [glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.co.uk/index.htm). See what the equivalent wages are for equivalent jobs in other countries.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm almost right there with you, but there's an important issue with the position Aspas may be asked to play in Coutinho's absence.  I don't think he's bad, he's a really good player.  He was awesome against Stoke and Villa.  United really bullied him and he had a really unfortunate circumstance at Swansea where he was asked to play in a position that his skillset simply doesn't allow him to excel at.

I do prefer him over Sterling at the moment.  I'd be inclined to say I prefer him to Alberto BUT Aspas absolutely cannot play the role the Coutinho played and Alberto seems to also do really well in.  Aspas is more of a second striker or inside forward.  He doesn't do much to aid in the link up play between our midfield and forwards and he doesn't distribute the ball very well.  He can create chances, but his ability to move the ball about in possession is limited.  He does what he's good at very well and with good intelligence, but he's not good at the things Coutinho has been doing so well for us.

That said, I don't think Alberto is ready for the responsibility of starting quite yet.  I feel like we're going to need to change our attacking philosophy a little bit for the Soton match in order to better cope with the loss of Coutinho since the only other player who can slot into his type of role really effectively is Suarez.  Maybe Allen can do some of it (he certainly can do quite well moving the ball when we're in sustained possession), but I think we'd be transitioning a lot slower as he tends to not pull the trigger on risky/decisive attacking passes quickly or frequently.",0,1379621942,null,0,false,0,ccbmew5,t3_1mpwcx,t1_ccbmew5,t1_ccbim58,null,1429407590,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Yes, that was aimed at Torres and possibly Ba - And also aimed at Hazard on the wing, he's a deadly player in the central position, but he isn't consistnent on the wing, use him behind a striker and see how deadly he becomes.

We have a great striker now, he's called Eto, he should be playing whenever he is fit, and we got rid of Lukaku, it was his choice, but we should of kept him and got rid of Torres and Ba in the last transfer window. But as we have them now, use them in different positions, reinvent Torres into a CAM, do something with him because he isn't a striker anymore, but he is still potentially great with the ball (last season he assisted Mata many times to score)

At least, not with the way we're currently setting ourselves up.  Coutinho's defensive responsibilities are limited.  We need Henderson going box to box, pressing like a beast and being that engine.  If he has to do the link up play then he has to be careful about when and where he recovers defensively, which limits his contribution in that area (he needs to be aware that he's the outlet and basically always be the one making himself available when we transition, which he would need to be staying a bit higher up the pitch to do, otherwise he won't be where he needs to be when we look for him in transition play).  He covers an absurd amount of ground but he can't be everywhere at once.

I see what you mean. You're talking about options in general, most other commenters are talking about the legalitites.
Legally she is entitled to her own room.
That leaves 3 children.
You cannot cram 3 children into 1 bedroom. The rules that you quoted above state ""a room for any two children under 10"" - that doesn't mean you have to put in two children - it means _up to_ or _no more than_ two children under 10. Anything above and you 'start' a new bedroom.

The rules are quite clear and actually in her favour - she should not be classed as underoccupying. Frankly I'm surprised the council has even contacted her. They must be desperate to reach targets or something.

They're probably already living in social housing and on benefits. We know that new houses need to be built so building in urban areas especially if we replace low density housing with mixed medium density would allow costly services in rural areas to be shut down.

If you effectively depopulated large rural areas apart from agriculture you could shut down schools, hospitals etc. You could let the roads degrade as they'd only be used by agricultural vehicles.

Use mining villages for example. They only exist because there was a mine there. That is no longer true in many cases and unless there is another employer there is no reason for that village to exist.

Many people raise the issue that it's not feasible for people to travel 15 miles to get to a minimum wage job and I agree.

1. The point that Coutinho has been playing below-par and may deserve more scrutiny may be valid, but his below-par is twice as good as Aspas's regular play so far. [This article](http://squawka.com/news/2013/09/18/stats-analysis-are-liverpool-over-reliant-on-coutinho/2013091821781?) posted recently shows just how much better we were with Coutinho, EVEN THOUGH he has not been playing as he was at the end of last season. 
2. Bringing up Sakho's poorly timed sliding tackles. Yes, bad decisions. But I think that he had a great first game in a new league, with a new team, with the pressure of maintaing a 100% win record. If the author wants to analyze Sakho's game, then do it. Dont cherry pick examples of mistakes and make it seem as though they had been the defining momments of his debut. There was a great break down of his game [here](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1777312-analysing-mamadou-sakhos-liverpool-debut-vs-swansea-city). Seriously, this was posted yesterday. 
3. Jonjo. Oh, Jonjo. You my friend are many things, non of them being ""phenomenal"". Yes, while his goal was made much easier by the lack of defense from out ""defensive midfielders"", he did take it well. He also gifted us two goals. Phenomenal indeed.

true,formercedric,lincolnshire,Lincolnshire,"&gt;It's an acceptable policy

Clearly, in light of the way it's been applied here, it isn't. The only place this policy is acceptable is inside conservatives' minds. In reality, it fucks people over. The disregard for the suffering it causes is the very definition of callous.

This is what always happens when anyone trumpets ideological ideas over reality. Tories like to bang on about personal responsibility, and how people should be free to look after themselves, and how no one should be obliged to pay extra tax to help out those who won't help themselves. And that all sounds great, until you the see the effects of policies designed to do just that: poverty, homelessness, death and despair.

There was a thread on here the other month about the idea of changing organ donor options to be opt-out instead of opt-in. Studies were brought out to show that in countries with an opt-out system, organ donation after death rates were around 98% (whilst ours hover around 8%). This one simple change, that has _literally no effect on the lives of those who would be donors_, which could save potentially hundreds of thousands of lives every year at virtually no extra cost, was roundly lambasted around here as a _terrible_ idea. Because people didn't like the idea of the option being made for them, and had grievous misgivings about being expected to have the wherewithal to sign a single sodding form to opt out of it. This is ideological madness to the very extreme. People who would literally rather have thousands of people die pointlessly every year because it offends their sense of righteousness.

For me, the metrics of import for a creative/attacking player are goals, assists, chances created, and pass completion.  For goals, Coutinho and Aspas both have 0, but Coutinho has taken 9 shots only 3 of which were on target, whereas Aspas had one and it was on target.  For assists, Countinho has none in the league, Aspas has 1.  For chances created, Aspas is second behind Gerrard at 7, Coutinho is at 6.  Pass completion is a tiny bit higher for Aspas.  And all of that is with Aspas having played ~70 less minutes than Coutinho.

My point isn't that Countinho is poor, but that at the same time it's a very, very large stretch to say that Coutinho's play has been twice as good as Aspas.

It's utterly insane.

I don't go for stats so much because football contains too many variables.

For example; a player can be making tackles because he has been poor in possession and is giving the ball to the opposition and having to try to win it back.

Our midfield seems to be excellent until the opposition starts to raise its tempo and passing game - Swansea, Villa.

Then too often our midfield seems to be overwhelmed.

Lucas is especially culpable in this regard and has a habit of giving freekicks away on the edge of our box - Villa, Utd for example. 

Tl; dr Lucas is good alot of the time but under pressure has a tendency to go missing or give fouls away in dangerous positions.

It is an area we should look to improve in the coming transfer windows imo.

Are you totally unaware of how politicians use coded language to appeal to racists?

He just hopelessly runs to the 18 yard box. And what really pisses me off is all the corners he just wasted. Why is Mourinho not seeing this? We have players who can score goals on set pieces and our best set piece takers are either on bench or not taking it. Mata and Debruyne or even Oscar should be the ones taking corners and free-kicks on opponent half. Lamps surely score goals but in expense of neglecting his core duties. We have abundance of players who should be scoring goals and running into danger areas. The only time he did what he was supposed to do we scored a goal. The rest of the match, he huffed and puffed chasing shadows. Over the last two or three seasons, i have noticed something he does quite often. He escorts opponent players running with the ball. He just runs alongside the player all the way to the 18 yard box. If it was Ramires or MVG, they would at least try to foul the player in that occasion. And even Mikel, would try to out muscle opponent for the ball. If he were to start a match then let him play in his preferred number 8 role.

that quote holds no relevance. it reinforces my point that race is brought into things where it has no relevance, and the only possible link you can make up is proposing a sixth sense you have towards someone's ulterior motives, which haven't manifested themselves at all. you can't just attach an irrelevant word to a proposal and act like it's a legitimate criticism and anyone who supports it clearly supports whatever you misread from it.",0,1379630674,null,0,false,0,ccbphik,t3_1mp889,t1_ccbphik,t1_ccbp2mo,null,1429406157,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

As for Holtby.. I might be the only one who thinks this, but I just didn't think he played incredibly well today. Yes, he got the assist, but now when you watch him after watching eriksen(and even seeing them together) there's a big gap between the two. As a #10, I found holtby often struggling to keep the shape of the formation, and he was generally just drifting around the pitch(often up alongside defoe). This was the most frustrating thing for me. Also, on numerous occasions you could see him dribbling right at his own man (often Lamela). He played well today but against a stronger side he would not have looked so great in my opinion. You have to remember that Tromso are in a relegation battle in the Norwegian league...

If we didn't see results in a few years i'd be worried,  but after a few weeks i think it's ridiculous for anyone to be critical, considering that we barely won anything pre-abramovich. The obsession for success is the best and worst part about Chelsea, we win alot but when we lose we all want to change everything. Just let Jose work out who his best team is, let him teach guys like Hazard how he wants them to play.

We all forget that in the first iteration Jose said himself he couldn't play they way he wanted to until guys like Robben, Duff, and Joe Cole were developed properly.

Gary Neville put it best. This team is dramatically different from the first time Jose came to Chelsea, it's a team of young players that will take time to adapt.

Abramovich unrealistically expects us to compete with clubs that have entire squads of experienced, proven players...Bayern, Barcelona, Madrid etc. I respect the transition of outright splurging to buying younger talent, but it's too much, too fast.

2. Too many ""samey"" central-minded attacking mids. Hazard, Oscar, Mata, Schurrle etc all love going INSIDE. Lack of width.

3. Our striker situation has been dire for quite some time.

4. The transition of a strong, athletic squad, to a smaller...more technical squad. Constantly bullied in the air / unable to pick up long balls. This is a problem, especially in the Premier League.

5. Reinforcing the wrong areas of the squad. As it's been repeated over and over, too many attacking midfielders....when we should've looked for an experienced &amp; capable central / defensive mid, and perhaps a better striker (More aggressively pursuing...willing to spend more)

6. Financial mis-management. Torres for $50 mil and his wages (170k pounds per week?), on a 5 year deal. Willian, 30 million...overpriced, unnecessary attacking midfield surplus.

I'd highly recommend Brewdog on the Cowgate. It can be a little expensive but the beers are great (they specialise in craft beers that are brewed in the North of Scotland) and most beers are around 8% or higher so you shouldn't need more than a couple! For somewhere cheap the Three Sisters just down the road from Brewdog is not bad too and a good place if you want to watch sports on their huge outdoor screen.

Lebowski's off Lothian Road on Morrison Street is probably my favourite bar in Edinburgh. The bar is themed around The Big Lebowski film so there's a huge Jeff Bridges mural outside and so on, but the main appeal is their drinks menu. They have around 32 variations of White Russian, ranging from ones with tequila or absinthe in them. Again can be a little pricey but if you aren't planning to get absolutely plastered it's got a nice atmosphere.

Not far from Lebowski's on Bread Street is The Chanter, again pretty cheap place and not bad inside. Sometimes they play loud music when it gets late though (its a bar, no dancefloor or anything) which can be a bit annoying when you can't hear what people are saying.

What I see is that the NHS has just become too large to manage properly, partly because it hasn't invested in technology and updating business practices required to operate an organization of that scale, and partly because politicians have actively obfuscated the cost of the NHS from the public. So while people want to pay less tax, they also want to see the NHS do far more than it was originally setup to do. Neither of these things can continue.

So we have to make choices. Either the NHS is split up into smaller organizations, or we properly fund a huge scale reform of how the NHS operates and the technology it uses to mange itself. And secondly we start making healthcare costs a line item on payslips, rather than hiding it behind general taxation and NI. 

As ever, there is no conspiracy. What there is, is a big system that was designed over half a century ago to provide a very different type of service to the one it is now expected to deliver. And it is a system that has been used as a political football for much of that time.

1st: ""The First Doctor has been characterised as a crotchety old man but he was so much more, displaying childish delight, great charm, enormous warmth and a wonderful sense of mischief during his many adventures through time and space.""

2nd: ""The First Doctor may have had hearts of gold but he often came across as a stubborn and stern old man. The Second Doctor could not have been further from this picture… Overtly playful and eccentric he sometimes appeared to be a likeable but hapless buffoon. And yet his enemies often found out to their cost that this foolish facade concealed the keen mind of a genius!""

3rd: ""The Third Doctor cut a dashing figure. A man of action with a passion for gadgets and thrilling forms of transport, he was exiled to Earth for much of his era, deprived of a functioning TARDIS and the knowledge of time travel by the Time Lords. But he had his work cut out defending our planet from Daleks, Daemons and his cunning, charismatic nemesis - the Master!""

4th: ""The Fourth Doctor has been characterised as a clownish adventurer, eager to dish out jokes and jelly babies. It’s a notion that neglects so much about this fascinating incarnation – this Doctor’s remote, alien nature, his apparent coldness and the fact that his tomfoolery often served to wrong foot his enemies…""

5th: ""The Fifth Doctor was the Time Lord’s most youthful incarnation up to that point in his life. As the Tenth Doctor commented when meeting him in the TARDIS, ‘Back when I first started at the very beginning, I was always trying to be old and grumpy and important, like you do when you’re young. And then I was you. And it was all dashing about and playing cricket and my voice going all squeaky when I shouted…’ But there was more to this Doctor than youthful impetuosity…""

6th: ""The Sixth Doctor was a firework of a Time Lord. Loud. Explosive. Impossible to ignore. He had a wildly unstable start and many might claim he never really settled down…""

7th: ""The Seventh Doctor was an inquisitive explorer, revelling in adventure and investigations into the unknown. He might trick you into thinking he was a buffoon, playing the fool or muddling his words – but these traits belied a sharp intelligence and a shrewd judge of character…""

8th: ""The Eighth Doctor was an effortlessly charming, romantic figure. He was unguarded about his background and equally candid about what the future held for people he came into contact with. It seems ironic that so much about this open Doctor remains a closed book.""

The only relevant charge here is calling me a cynic, which I proudly accept.

true,Gettingworst,num26,,"Chadli puts in his shift too in all the games he played, but he hasn't really shown anything special either, but at least he's tall and strong and can hold the ball up on the left. Gylfi gets knocked off the ball too easily. So if you ask me to pick between the 2 of them, I'd pick Chadli for the time being simply because he's an outlet on the left and doesn't hide when the pressure is on. 

We all love a player who tries hard for the club, but that's only if he can actually play. I can name you tons of players who tries hard for us every game, but no one batted an eyelid when they were sold because apart from their tenaciousness, they're not very skilled and can't really play the style we want to play. 

Last season, he had 33 appearances, 12 of them from the start. We've seen plenty of him on the pitch but people still thinks he doesn't get played because most of the time, we don't even know he was playing cuz he goes missing so much, he scored 8 goals for us and had 7 assist. He took 70 shots and 34% of them were on target, so a good shooter? I think not, and the goal to shot ratio of 11%? so he needs nearly every 10 shots to score a goal, while it's not a bad return, I don't see that being a world beater. 

Same problem with Defoe, he had a goal/shot ratio of 12% last season, that's exactly why the reason he doesn't get picked for England because of such bad return if you compare the 36% shot/goal ratio Soldado had with Valencia last season.

Probably 4231 as Osvaldo hasn't been very good and we would probably roll them over if they played 4-4-2.

Either way their central midfield is pretty much purely destructive, they don't move the ball well through there (Wanyama in particular is poor on the ball) so their attack is based on long balls into Lambert in the first phase with the three attacking mids joining. That's why I'd really like to see Sakho start again, if he dominates Lambert in the air their game plan falls apart, and he's good on the ball to quickly release our wide players where they'll have space to run into.

Attacking fullbacks are also important here, there are big chances to get 2v1 out wide, either forcing their attacking mids back or pulling their DMs wide. Johnson will be missed much more than Coutinho, I'd seriously consider using Henderson or even Sterling at right back.

If this is wrong and needs updating please email me also with new address asap so I can change it in records.

np i do it all the time too.

&gt;A line needs to be drawn somewhere- I couldn't claim that for religious reasons the court had to ignore any evidence I gave not supporting my case, or perjure myself for religious reasons. I kinda agree with the judge, enacting justice is more important than religion here and religion gets in the way of justice so it's the thing that has to bend.

thants a may of looking at it i had not considered, the judges' primary purpose is to oversee the trial and ensure the truth comes out and to that end he allowed it, religion did indeed have to bend to the law in that case. still its bloody silly :/

&gt;all a bit archaic, just like the queen and her posse really. Ultimately all of it's pretty harmless imo (maybe with the exception of sunday trading laws) and the RE laws aren't all that bad (iirc it's one assembly a week and it doesn't have to be religious, only ""spiritual"" or something like that). The way the church runs deep in UK institutions isn't perfect, but it's not like they have any real level of control over things.

No the RE laws are not that bad but its far from perfect to tech our children not to question, esquire and look at evidence before accepting something as true. religion does not give you answers it stops you asking questions.

Granted the dont have control over things and that how it should be. we should ensure other religions do not dictate term to us either.

&gt;there's an abundance of evidence homosexuality isn't bad though- you can pick up a book, or google it, or (assuming they aren't in some ultra-crazy cult-like congregation) just ask their vicar. 

IRK what they are affiliated too either, maybe they would have been forced to question their prejudice with the gay marriage bill was passed ? they look of an age to remember when homosexuality was still illegal in this country and also of an age to have held this belief for a lifetime change with those people does not happen overnight. 



&gt;The bible certainly doesn't say anything about kicking gay couples out of B&amp;Bs regardless of how you read it

no it doesn't, and as i say this could all have been pointed out to them. i still believe that the persecution leveled at them was totally disproportionate to their infraction. Also they are people and as a culture we should not treat people like that, i suspect the perpetrators are actually more bigoted than they are. as i say, sad.

&gt;that's a good point, but religion/homophobia are in themselves intolerant whereas the things they're intolerant of (homosexuality) aren't. Should have phrased that better.

:) sadly there are activists and bigots on all sides of this, but that does not give people licence to persecute and take the law into their own hands and deal out vigilante justice. they were publicly named and shamed that in itself would most likely have sunk the business, the 'reprisals' only made the perpetrators worse than the couple involved :/

We will have bad results, as the team still need to gel. Okore's long-term injury won't help matters either. 

Granted, it was a bad result against Newcastle. However, we have got one of the youngest squads in the league and the fans need to show a bit more patience. The performances will get better as the season goes on, although I think we'll need to buy/loan another centre-back in January. 

In terms of the Norwich game specifically, we just need to tighten up a bit defensively. The problem with the majority of young defenders is that they don't have the experience of where the best position is for every situation, leading to disorganisation and errors.

But back to your ""philosophy"".  I if you agree with the sentiments

&gt;We all share in our Lord's cross and that, at times, may be very painful. This suffering, however, especially at the last moments of one's life, must be seen as sharing our Lord's sufferings. By uniting our suffering with our Lord's, we expiate the hurt caused by our own sins and help to expiate the sins of others, just as some of the early martyrs did who offered their sufferings for sinners. Sometimes, such suffering finally heals the wounds that have divided families. In all, we must look to Christ to aid us in our suffering and guide us from this life to Himself.

from [Catholic Culture](http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=307)

then you are a monster, and should fuck off from politic discourse.  This might be good for you adn your family but to try to force it on other people is wrong.  This religious justification for suffering is horrible, and if this is why you oppose euthanasia, then you need to engage brain and sympathy, and cut out the cancer of doctrine. 

I know where the religious are coming from here; it is not a nice place.
