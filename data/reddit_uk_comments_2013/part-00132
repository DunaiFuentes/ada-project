In the heat of battle, a shell falls near a waiting tank. It explodes and shakes the heavy armoured vehicle violently. Inside, two chaps are trying to enjoy afternoon tea.

""I say, what the bloody hell was that?"" Says the first, a cup of earl grey clutched in his gloved hand.

""Bloody hell..."" replies the other chap, looking down his lap where the tea has spilled and has left a large dark area. ""They've gone and made me spill my tea.""

A fury grows in the eyes of both men as they realize the extent of the devastation. In lockstep they put away the good china and place their helmets firmly on their heads.

""Old boy,"" says the first. ""I think its it's time you manned the turret... we've got manners to teach!""

I shan't go into detail as I need to go to bed, but needless to say, any guy who thinks he has first dibs on any woman because he goes to the gym more is a fucking idiot and is going to spend a long time dating women who look like they've just arrived from the Dior counter (with corresponding two-inch thick foundation) until they realise that there's an awful lot more to attraction than just an instant carnal reaction.

My guess is the £33 million is a HUGE underestimate, and the hospital costs are likely to be phenomenally higher.

The problem is (and this relates back to my original point about this being almost impossible to implement) is that the NHS does not have a mechanism in place to easily check peoples entitlement to care... instead they implement a 'just go with it and ask questions later... or more likely never' approach. In theory it should be done at the GP surgery or by the admissions staff at a hospital A&amp;E, but in reality it is amazingly easy to obtain fake documents to get access to the NHS or to simply fool staff into thinking you are entitled to care. I also wonder whether some NHS staff realise (you don't exactly need to be Sherlock Holmes to get suspicions someone might not be from round here) but simply turn the other cheek out of apathy for the extra work it would involve... after all, hospital units are setup like a conveyor belt to provide consistent care - not to deny it and fill out complex paperwork that would require the signatures of senior people and might even involve security or the police. 

Ironically, this is something where a biometric ID card would have been insanely useful - as it could just be swiped on entry to a hospital to automatically provide national insurance details and even access to the now scrapped national electronic medical records programme.

The entire reason these people come here is because the NHS is exquisitely vulnerable to abuse, since it is one of the only healthcare systems in the entire world where nobody will ask you for ID, cash or documentation before providing you with advanced care. The UK is also notorious for being a soft-touch when it comes to recouping costs - and whilst it is somewhat easier to recoup costs from EU citizens, it is virtually impossible if a person disappears to a country like Nigeria or Pakistan.

Because the world isn't ready. 

This article makes a lot of good points, but the writer is stuck in the fantasy fandom land and refuses to look at the television landscape.

Whether or not we want to admit it, television, cinema.etc is ridiculously sexist and racist, the fact that most shows feel they need a black character to appeal to the minorities is racist in itself.

So what would happen if The Doctor became a woman?

The show would crash and burn. Ratings would plummet and the fem-Doc would be ushered out the door and never spoken of again. Hopefully.

Steven Moffat is the current show runner, we know he can't write women (Amy in the Eleventh Hour is Identical to Amy in the Angels In Manhattan in terms of characterization. Despite finding true love, losing a child, having her child brain washed to kill her best friend and watching it happen, discovering she's sterile and nearly losing that love again).

But even if we had a better or different showrunner/head writer.

It wouldn't change, there is no reason to make The Doctor a woman other than to appease people like the writer of the article that want it to 'mix things up'.

Is the whole and time and space not big enough for you? There is no good reason to make The Doctor a woman, and that's why he should remain how he is.

Lets not fundamentally alter a 50 year old show over breakfast hm?

Actually this isn't really the case... Put yourself in the position of a healthcare provider... try to devise a relatively foolproof system to make sure people are entitled to NHS care **before** you provide it. Here's a few I can think of:

* Ask them to bring a passport... But this is difficult, because passports cost about £80 and not everyone has one -- nor are they obliged to have one. Will you turn them away if they don't have one? Few elderly people bother to update their passports - and these people tend to be the most needy from a healthcare perspective.

* How about some utility bills to demonstrate they are at least domiciled in the UK... because that wouldn't be at all difficult to fake, forge or borrow from someone right?

* Perhaps use the national insurance card as if it were ID? Because again - a red card with some embossed numbers would not be difficult to obtain illegally or to get a forgery?

These problems are compounded by the fact the NHS generally works retrospectively -- by providing care first, then working out what happened, to who, and how to pay for it retrospectively... often months retrospectively! So by the time they realise a person wasn't UK domiciled (if they ever realise which I suspect is a minority of times) - they've probably been back in their home nation for 6+ months.

All a referal to a specialist needs is an NHS number - or in some cases not even that, a local hospital ID number might be used. Getting an NHS number is not a foolproof way of demonstrating someone is UK domiciled either, as the system is pretty easy to work around since ti relys on methods like those above.

As I mentioned - this is where a compulsory biometric ID card would be have been extremely useful. I know, hard as it is to believe in this vast 1984-esque security state, we don't actually have a straightforward way of determining who is entitled to NHS care. There is no 'great central database' or ID system - just the NHS number which is far from foolproof.",0,1372642705,null,0,false,0,cati01r,t3_1hcsvy,t1_cati01r,t1_cathtn4,null,1430626199,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

All that will happen is that criminal services will crop up to provide one for each healthcare tourists, under the guise that the client has lived here for a while. 

If you want a ""better"" argument, why not focus on the benefits to others? Scrap talk of utility bills and passports and consider the benefit of a UK-wide healthcare database that actually works.

Least Favorite-Rose: She was a bitch to Rickey, and only cared about being with the Doctor alone, instead of helping civilizations with him. I was actually glad when she got stuck in Pete's world. But, she got better in Journey's End, she was more mature and was way more tolerable.

Unnecessarily Hated-Martha: The main reason people hate her is because ""She is not Rose!!!"". I liked her a lot, and I liked how she left the Doctor because he was doping over the loss of Rose still, pretty much saying ""Get the fuck over it,"" which is what the fandom needed, and still needs.

2. No, the Time War is time-locked, and it would be a paradox, as others have stated.

3. I actually liked the comics' version of the title: ""A War in Heaven."" Awesome.

4. The Seventh Doctor. He starts off as something you'd see at a traveling carnival, always pulling parlor tricks, being a bumbling oaf, and mixing up his metaphors. Then he and his companion Ace go up against the Daleks in ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", and he becomes this badass enigmatic puppetmaster.

5. No. 

6. Yes, in the penultimate and last episodes.

7. Both. He had a good run and was ready to hand the reins over to Matt Smith, and he didn't want to be typecast as ""that guy from Doctor Who"".

true,enanogigante,null,null,"Source - this is pretty much my day job.  Potentially, HMRC can pursue you for 20 years worth of unpaid tax and NIC.  Add in the interest and potential penalties for failing to notify them that you are self employed, and I would say that you have nothing to gain by delaying.  

philthehumanist is right to say that you have a personal allowance and that you can claim expenses for anything you bought specifically for the purpose of doing your job.  The rules on this will vary slightly depending on what you do for a living (if, for example, you work at the same place every day, you can't claim for fuel, but cabbies can as they absolutely cannot work without it), but it's very rare that someone will have nothing they can claim.  HMRC will probably want to see evidence of any expenditure, or if you use estimates they will want to know how these were calculated.

Regarding penalties, there are currently two regimes in operation due to a change in the law.  Before the year ended 5 April 2009, you would be looking at a penalty under S7 of the Taxes Management Act 1970.  In this case, I would be very surprised if the ultimate penalty ended up being more than 15-20% of the total tax due for those years.  From 2009, the legislation for penalties changed to take the behaviour of the taxpayer into account - you have to show that mistakes were made despite taking reasonable care to pay no penalty at all.  If you were careless, there is a penalty of 0-15%.  If you are considered to have deliberately not paid tax, the penalty ranges from 15-50% (iirc), and if you deliberately evaded paying tax and did something to hide the fact (false expense receipts etc) you could pay up to 100% of the tax due as a penalty.  I'd be surprised if you were considered to be anything above deliberate.  In all cases, penalties can reduced if you fully co-operate with HMRC, provide them will all of the information they need etc., but the minimums stated for 2009 onwards are statutory - the law won't allow HMRC to charge less than that for each category.

If you can't afford an accountant, and are lucky enough to still have an HMRC office in your area, it might be worth finding out the opening times and popping in to get some advice.  They won't complete tax returns for you, but they will give you all of the assistance they can, and it won't cost you anything.  Also, one you know what you have to pay, you can always ask for a time to pay arrangement if you can show that you cannot afford to pay it all in one hit - potentially, depending on how things are settled, they might give you up to 2-3 years to pay it all off.

Finally, as far as Tax Credits are concerned, you might well be due Working Tax Credit and possibly Children's Tax Credit if you have kids. the only wrinkle is that, again, the law changed recently and HMRC can only backdate claims for 30 days from the date your claim is made. Not sure how this will work once the Universal Tax Credit starts running, as details are hazy right now.

Tl; Dr version - better to get yourself on the right track now, and HMRC are often nowhere near as scary to deal with as you'd expect.

To be honest any good accountant will make 1000/month disappear in allowances and deductables - use of home as office/depreciation/mobile and home phone bills etc.  You could end up owing little to nothing.  I'd get an accountant - it will save you money in the long run.

true,Xaethon,cnty-uk,Manchester &amp; Salop,"I believe that because of when she was born, if she were to get British citizenship, she will have to give up her Australian nationality, although that may have changed since.

Normally she would just renew it every 10 years by sending in her passport, however a year or two ago, the government made everyone reapply after it expired instead of just getting it renewed. Had to spend quite some money requesting her mother's birth certificate and all that, going down to London as well I believe, and it was a real hassle to sort out. I looked into her applying for British citizenship on her behalf.

Quick edit: Appears it changed after 2002, on the Australian side at least. http://www.citizenship.gov.au/current/dual_citizenship/

Also there was a time when she couldn't do it because they would only allow it if your father was British, which has since changed it appears http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/eligibility/registration/britishmother/

I suppose it would be better for her to apply for British citizenship, either now through descent or naturalisation, since she would then get the full benefits of the EU.

Edit: Although regarding descent, it seems rather awkward going about it as we would have to see if she kept any old passports showing her British nationality, which would be rather difficult considering the distance between us and them.

Remember, most of the tram route out to the airport is on dedicated track, not mixing with traffic: it'll be about twice as fast as the number 22.

The other point is that the *original* plan for the trams had three phases -- or lines -- and would have given Edinburgh a comprehensive tram network, with a loop around the north, a spur off to the airport, and extensions into southern suburbs. In other words, a *real* tram network.

What we're getting is the first half of phase one, without even the couple of miles it would take to hook up Leith (and do I need to mention the pressing need for regeneration around Pilton and Leith and the docks?). 

Frankly, if we'd got all of phases one to three, even at the current 50% overrun on costs, it would have been worth it *because we'd be getting a full-scale, viable transport system*. But the current mess ... no. Just no.

I'd like to think in 15 years finances will have improved enough that we can begin to think about completing the network, but I might be being slightly over-optimistic here ...

(My preferred alternative would have been something like Boston's Silver Line. It's a combination trolley bus/diesel hybrid system using Czech-made bendy-buses, bits of which run on guided busways or just underground in cut-and-cover trench tunnels, but which are able to mix it with surface traffic where necessary. Because they're trolley buses one bus can overtake another if it has broken down -- so no huge excavation and relocation of utilities is needed.

&gt; **It is interesting to know your opinion about the behavior of Mkhitaryan. Who will you use instead of him?**


&gt;I wouldn’t like to comment on it and make any statements. It's his decision, his desire. I think that Mkhitaryan makes a huge mistake. Shakhtar is a strong club, which is always backed by 50,000 cheering fans. Henrikh plays in the team which every year fights for the championship, the Cup and the Champions League. I think he should appreciate it. The whole team helped him appear as often as possible in the penalty area and score so many goals. I want him to think very well. There is still time. I would not want him to dive into the level at which he was before he turned up at Shakhtar. At a different team with a different game organization, his qualities that he showed here may vanish. I just encourage him to return to the team and start working. This is his team. Nothing happened between him and the management, as well as between him and the rest of the players. He was helped by everyone. Maybe they helped him even more than the rest of the players. Both when he was injured and when he was playing in the league, I very rarely replaced him, helping him become a better scorer. If he still shows up at a club that is superior to Shakhtar, then, I guess, I will understand his wish. I'm talking about such teams as Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona. As the rest are of our level.
 
As you can see, in context the quotes seem a little less groundbreaking. I don't think this really tells us much: we already knew Mkhitaryan has gone missing from Shakhtar and wants to move, but that is all we know.",0,1372669726,null,0,false,0,catosuo,t3_1hf090,t1_catosuo,t3_1hf090,null,1430622923,19,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,19

My understanding of PFS is that you can break, it just means you need more than one of the keys.

The point is that Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc, have been quite hot on security on these things, it is very unlikely that P=NP has been solved and kept quiet.

And of course on average you'll need to walk further to your tram stop, with its comically poor design of shelter to protect you from the elements on those rare days that it's wet and/or windy in Edinburgh, to get on in the first place.

Yes, the original plan for the trams had three lines and a congestion charge to boot - obviously that got kicked into touch when the congestion charge was heavily rejected in a referendum.

But even that wouldn't have been a *real* tram network.  That'd have been a loop around north Edinburgh with one spur heading out SE and one spur heading out west.

Or northwest. Or east. Or indeed south (like out through Morningside).

We're never going to see a network that extensive again though - as we've seen with what little we're getting, they're extortionately expensive to install in Edinburgh for a very inflexible return.

Trolley buses would seem to have made a heck of a lot more sense, with a lot less digging up of roads and hugely expensive rerouting of utilities required, coupled with the ability to run 'off route' if needed (like if part of the route's closed because of a major fire, as Princes Street has been).

Long answer: Depends on their circumstances. As I said I work in recruitment and if I were to hand my notice in, even though it's a month contractually, I'd probably be out of the door by the end of the day as in our business there's a question of data security and they wouldn't want someone uncommitted having access to that. 

In a restaurant obviously it's a lot different - if they have staff to cover the gap then they might not have you stay as - 3 days in - you probably haven't settled in completely and would be a bit of a dead weight to them. 

If they haven't got staff to cover then they might hold you to your notice period and have you work until they can find someone to replace you. It depends on the scale of the business as well - bigger companies *tend* to be more inflexible than smaller 'Mom and Pop' places. 

The hours might be crap - but hopefully the job hasn't been - so make sure you retain integrity and work if it's asked of you. It might not seem important now but if you ever plan to use them for a reference or anything - you'll need to show that it was just a mistake getting into it, not that you were a poor worker.

true,Jayesar,flair8,,"&gt;Is Benny good enough for top 4?

On his day, yes, he is a very solid LB. Unfortunately, those solid performances are coming less often and as spurs ambition grows BAE's contribution is lacking in net worth. I remember specifically against Basel at home (mainly because I was sitting in the seat no more than 4m away from him) he was a liability to the squad and had to be subbed off with Vert moving to the left. Later in that same game Bale played LB (there goes our attack, thanks BAE) and after his ankle injury Dembele had to play LB. As a team that wants to compete for the CL and push deep in other competitions, having to sub a player for a poor performance and neuter your own attack is a big issue.

&gt;Should he be moved on?

Not now. The guy obviously is happy playing for spurs and he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who would kick up a fuss about losing a starting place. I can see the argument for bringing in a replacement, I just feel that after other (more pressing) areas of the squad have been addressed there won't be the time nor resources to replace LB. He will be able to compete with Rose for the spot next season.

&gt;Should we sign someone, or is Danny Rose a good replacement?

See above. It should be a priority next season, when other things have been addressed and we have seen Rose in action for a year. 

&gt;Is Rose's aggressive temperament and lack of experience holding him back?

Yes. He loves getting forward but many times he does so without tracking back fast enough to cover turnovers. I have seen a few to many goals for teams against Rose (Sunderland, England U-21) where he was caught way to far forward. That makes me worry (although the aggressiveness will fit AVB's playstyle to a tee, so perhaps it won't be such an issue). Rose needs to learn when to pick his runs and also needs to get his ass into gear when tracking back, until he can do those things consistently he is not good enough to lock down a position in the 11.

&gt;How much of a problem area is LB and how high a priority should a signing be?

Striker &gt; Midfielder &gt; Winger &gt; LB in my opinion. Midfielder looks to be Paulinho and striker is on the cards as well. Once a solid wing signing (e.g. Bernard) is brought in I see LB as the next big thing to replace. I don't think that it is such a problem that it needs addressing this window.

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","&gt; It is not good for businessmen, 

Not true. The great majority of businesses are small companies and in an astonishingly large number of cases, the directors are doing well if they can take home £30,000 before tax.

Obviously if they have a good year they can have more money, but if they have a bad year they're on their own.

The top guys at big companies - say, those in the FTSE100 - yes, they're earning a fortune. But most of the time there aren't very many other people even qualified to do their job.

&gt; lawyers, 

Not true. Oh, the lawyers taking on big commercial cases in London are earning well, but they're at the absolute top of their profession. The divorce lawyers, the conveyancers, the criminal lawyers who deal with petty crime - they're usually earning around £30,000 give or take, and that's once they're fully qualified. There's a hell of a lot of competition to get into the profession - mostly, AFAICT, from people who think the job is glamour and untold riches. By the time they realise that most people will earn money not too dissimilar to any other job that requires a degree, it's far too late to reconsider.

Lawyers charge a lot more than that, but that's because they're expected to write out invoices for three times their annual salary every year. Much of that money goes to running their offices; by the time they've accounted for sick days, holidays, training days and simply quiet days when there isn't much work coming in they need to charge 4-5 times their annual salary.

In terms of landlord, I imagine that as long as you have an offer letter or contract or something to show proof of income, you should be fine to do that first thing.  In general, they wont look at credit scores or anything like that from abroad so you kind of need to start from scratch (or at least I did) and thus the proof income is the only thing that really matters. 

Opening a bank account was not too difficult so you should be fine to do that.  It took an hour and they said that it was only so long because it was a joint account with my wife.  Normally it's 30 mins.  I recommend calling ahead and booking an appointment if you know which bank you are using just on the off chance they are busy.  If you are wealthy enough to be able to sit 50k in an account, go for HSBC premier as you get basically free international transfers and so on.  I went with barclays and have been super happy with them so far.

If by setting up the program you mean when your program is first installed/used that would a) require effort on the part of the user 
b) require the creator of the key to some how share is 
c) prove that the key is indeed theirs (e.g. certificate authority) 
d) require the receiver application to either check the public key or keep a copy of the public key locally (manual job).

&gt;Programs automatically share data on the internet all the time, so of course it is possible.

Can you give me an example? If you mean SSL then it is totally and utterly broken (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/11/state_of_ssl_analysis/) and still requires use of a certificate authority which means automatically setting up an encrypted connection for everyone won't work. **If you mean something else I am dieing to know.**

&gt;No, it requires the sender to use the receiver's public key, which the sender is not going to generate. If I encrypt using my public key, my recipient won't be able to read it.

My sentence was ambiguous/misleading, I was talking within the context of the program you are creating. Anyone using the program will require the creation of the public keys.

doesn't mean 'whatever DogBotherer thinks'. Like most things you like to spout - it's hyperbole and the reality is a much more complex situation. On the macro bold stroke measures:

- life expectancy is improving
- child death rates are falling
- war deaths generally falling
- poverty falling, average wealth rising
- huge strides being made in renewable energy

But there are big problems with

- rich/poor gap
- Internet helps citizen empowerment (arab spring) / but enables widespread surveillance
- rise of muslim extremism, westernising muslim extremism
- relatively minor drop in living conditions for developed countries
- global warming still not enough being done

If you look at clubs relatively close around us, I'd obviously take Van Persie and Rooney. Probably Hernandez and I'd think about Welbeck from United. Either of Aguero or Dzeko from City. Neither of Giroud or Podolski from Arsenal. Defoe and Adebayor are probably about the same level as Torres. Jelavic went off the boil massively. I'd take either of Suarez or Sturridge over him.

So overall, it's only really Arsenal that have a demonstrably worse striker situation than us and if they sign Higuain, then they'd become better than us, no doubt.

The goals scored is misleading too. The bloke played 65(?) games this year and padded his stats with goals against the likes of Monterray, Wolves, Leeds and the Europa League posse. The question is whether we could get someone in who would do better than that and if it's Cavani or Lewandowski (if we ignore the Bayern inevitability), isn't the answer undoubtedly yes?

For some, it's worse for others - America, a top tier and definitive capitalist nation, has large dead zones where life expectancy is now as bad as many of the countries in the global South.  The UK does too.  And it's growing worse.

&gt;child death rates are falling

See above, and particularly consider the US and UK are slipping down these leagues.

&gt;war deaths generally falling

Civilian deaths are increasing proportionately in many wars, and you also have to be very very careful of the games which are being played with who is and isn't a combatant, because many modern definitions are propagandist and bullshit.  Wars during the last century took a greater toll than in any other.

&gt;poverty falling, average wealth rising

See above, it really depends on how you are calculating this and for which populations and your definitions of wealth/poverty.  Also, see all the literature on infinite growth and what happens to capitalist systems when they can't deliver growth.  Also, expect growth to slow further in the West and be mostly in the developing world for your lifetime, just as it has already radically slowed under neo-liberalism (growth has nose dived since the '70s).  Expect all the economic discontent and social unrest which that will deliver in the West, also the increasing conflict, resource wars, etc.  The corporations are not coming back to the West, their production and increasingly their markets are elsewhere, most of their medium to long term planning indicates this.

&gt;rise of muslim extremism, westernising muslim extremism

This is mostly just imperialism coming home, I wish more Westerners would realise this.

This seems like political posturing on an emotive issue in Germany prior to their upcoming elections... remember hundreds of thousands of germans were victims of both the SS and later the KGB or Statsi who used invasion of privacy as a way to dredge up material on political opponents, so data protection is a sensitive subject.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"I'm trying to find the right way to explain this since you are missing my point...objectively you can say our squad isn't good enough to win the title without lowering your expectations of what is acceptable as a team.  Put it this way:  You are a player in the locker room.  Do you want them to go into the season thinking ""we just aren't good enough to win"" or do you want them to walk into every game with a swagger of ""f*** what people say, we can compete with anyone.""  If the players go into games assuming they aren't good enough, it's a self-fufilling prophecy.  Our goal every year should be the title.  The players need to have a belief that they can achieve that goal or they will fail.  The same goes for the fans.  Realistically we know we won't win the title every year, realistically we know other teams have more talent.  But OUR job as fans is to believe our team can achieve, to not expect them to fail.  Every season, every GAME we don't win SHOULD be a disappointment because the goal of the game is to win.  I'm not saying fire the coach, dump the players, ect when we don't win because we accept that it won't always happen.  But our expectation should be that we are capable of it because otherwise, what is the point?  The players should NEVER expect to lose a game, and neither should we.

Example:  I ""knew"" last year that we didn't have the talent of Man U, or Chelsea, or Man City, or Arsenal...but on gameday I STILL believed that our players had a chance to win those games.  Everytime we lost, it hurt.  And it should, losing hurts.  That's what makes winning feel so good by comparison.  :)

Rafa convinced him to give him at least another year while the Midget made it known he wasn't going to play in the Champions League qualifiers not to be cup-tied.

The situation was a bit different in 2005. After the Champions League win, you would have thought the Board would have a fresh contract with the ink still wet, ready for him to sign as soon as they landed at John Lennon. Instead, they sat on their asses thinking that Stevie would stay no matter what. So after weeks of still not getting a contract to sign, Stevie thought they didn't think he was that important so made it known that he wanted to move. At the 11th hour, he had a change of heart and stayed. I think he even went to London to speak to Chelsea. Personally for me, Rick Parry royally fucked that one up.

&gt;You also act as if the scarcity of some luxury car models is the same as the scarcity of housing in the UK. It isn't. Anyone who wants to own a car can do so really, it might be an old banger, but they can own one if they spend a relatively small amount of money. Anyone who rents a car can most definitely do so. The same isn't even remotely true for housing.

No, I'm stating that they are the same or would potentially be the same under different market conditions, just as you're saying things would be different if the market was different. If there were only 10,000 cars a year being built, people will capital would pay large sums to purchase those cars and rent them out, just as they do now with houses. 

&gt;Without the buy to let market, the only way to make money out of property would be to build some.

But you get the buy to let market *because* there is scarcity of housing so people cannot afford to buy so people with capital recognise it's a good investment. The latter part certainly exacerbates the problem, but you're mistaking a symptom for the cause. In any situation of scarcity those with capital will invest in the scarce assets in order to make profit. Houses are no different.

Build more houses and the prices will go down. Of course the base cost of building a house will always mean there's a large up front cost to owning one, so they will always be renters.

Holtby is the one I'm really keen on watching this season, but it'll be interesting where AVB fits him in.

It really isn't. Not to relocate to London through the week and endure the utter contempt of the entire country. Would I do it? Not a fucking chance. Would any professional? No. 

Remember that if you give up your career to be an MP and earn that 65K then you're very likely to be out of a job after 5 years, because the parties won't give you a safe seat, they'll give you a marginal which tend to flip over frequently. You then need to try to get back into your career having lost your length of service.

&gt;I propose this, if they can go 5 years without us finding another way they've been fiddling their wage, we'll let them have a raise.

You're saying that since there are a minority/majority of crooks in there that we need to make sure we can't get any decent ones in.

I'd suggest a different route. Pay MPs a very attractive wage, pay them a flat allowance to relocate, plus travelling expenses dependent on the distance and that's all. Make it an incredibly serious crime to be corrupt - think life sentence - and tell special branch to get the fuckers in jail.

It was super last minute (as in the plane took off less than 12 hours after we bought the tickets). We even felt slightly guilty as there were couples there that had paid over a grand for the exact same holiday.

When looking for a deal we had a couple of requirements:

* All flights &amp; transfers are included.
* Flight must leave from our local airport (East Midlands)
* Hotel/resort must be 5*.
* All food &amp; booze has to be included.
* Hotel must have multiple pools with at least one which doesn't allow kids.
* One of the pools must have a bar as part of the pool.
* Rooms must have A/C.
* Hotel must have a private beach.

I'm not a massive fan of sitting on a beach reading books, so while we were there we booked a four day diving course which cost as much as the rest of the holiday did. But many people are quite content with lounging around the pool/beach the entire time.

Two years ago, I remember thinking that Jack Cork would have been an outstanding signing, but Southampton had the financial muscle to beat others to his signature. Butterfield from Barnsley would have been another great option, but Norwich paid around £1 million for him. McEachran is also a promising player of that ilk, this time on loan, but Middlesbrough earned his signature.

However, we have **finally** spent big (compared to previous years) and got a highly rated player who can actually pass the ball. We haven't had a player like that since Clayton or Kilkenny - and what's more is that Murphy, in my opinion, has a lot more potential than either of those two. This is an utterly brilliant signing and has completely rejuvenated my optimism for the coming season.

... That means he's going to get crocked for the rest of the season after something like five promising games, isn't he?

On another note, assuming that Noel Hunt is incoming, where else do you guys think that we need to strengthen? I still think that we need two proper wingers and a centre half in order to challenge for the top six. I would also prefer to bring in a genuine goalscoring striker as we only have McCormack capable of filling that role right now.

true,JonBStoutWork,lfc68,,"I don't think anyone is saying 7th is good enough, but it's the blinkered attitude that we should be challenging every year against the billions of Chelsea and City and the massive revenue streams of Manchester United.

Our first order should be challenging Arsenal for a spot and then start working on the other 3.

When I say blinkered I mean you have to take other clubs into consideration and not just assume that you should be challenging for the league.

We don't have the resources to challenge the top 3 at the moment. If you take away the billionaire owners then yes we could realistically compete with Chelsea and City because of the revenue streams. But we cannot.

The new capacity at Anfield once complete will help us maintain a strong competitiveness against Arsenal and Spurs, but United have a massive supporter base in the Far East which, along with 30,000 more seats have made sure they are miles ahead of us with what they can spend on players and wages. They went East we went West to South America and lost out in the merchandising war. At the time we were two of the biggest clubs in the world, our supporter base was fairly evenly spread out, but now look at the United brand compared to ours. Yes we're still a huge club, but the amount of money we generate in merchandise is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of money United garner.

We have to get lucky with some of the players we buy because we cannot afford to squander money like we've done in the past. We don't have the luxury of City and Chelsea and to some extent United.

That's why Arsenal have been shrewd in the transfer market. Where United were spending 30 million on Ferdinand, Rooney, Veron, Berbatov etc. We couldn't do that season after season, neither could Arsenal. The only reason Chelsea and City are now competing with them is because of the billionaires. Arsenal (and Spurs and ourselves) are competing for 4th place, with the hopes that having a good season, being lucky with injuries and the rub of the green in the close matches along with hitting it right in the transfer market gets us closer to United. They are the benchmark.

So we need to compete for 4th place. Everton have been luckier in the transfer market and consistent which means they finished above us for the past two seasons. We should be overtaking them OK. Spurs have a better first 11 marginally than us and have sold off players for massive money in recent years so they have an advantage. There's another team to overtake. Then we start with Arsenal and then we consolidate 4th.

If you are delusional enough to think we can compete with:

1. A crowd of close to 80,000 every week and the lion's share of the Far Eastern (and worldwide) merchandising market
2. Two clubs with billionaire owners

then you are off your rocker.

We simply cannot think that Liverpool are anywhere near competing for the title once let alone with any regularity until we have 60,000+ seater stadium with bigger corporate sponsors and a massive boost in commercial revenue.

Just take a look at our sponsorship deals, for Christ sake United's training ground is sponsored by DHL!!

We are near enough half of United's gate receipts, official Premiership commercial revenue and TV revenue.

We don't have Arsenal's gates or TV, but commercially we can compete with them so that's who we target, not some pie-in-the-sky league which isn't attainable for us yet.

Notice Arsenal's trophy haul stopped when the billionaire owners came in? They cannot compete and neither can we, until we get the stadium and the commercial revenue sorted out.

United have 33 official sponsors. All of them lining their coffers. They are officially worth 3 billion!! Don't think for a second we can compete with that in the short or middle term. We need to be thinking long term and make investments now that we can reap the benefits of in the future. 

But if you think we can win the league and be competitive with them then you need to sit down and have a wee think about what you're up against rather than the history and where you feel we should be.

I want Liverpool back on top, but it's going to take a lot more than a few players and some shrewd on-field tactics. It'll take some serious off-field investment and knowhow from our owners.

Sorry I have to disagree with that assertion.

For a start of, capital expenditure isn't the measure plenty of businesses use for expansion, it certainly doesn't cover most of my costs of expansion.

In fact Capital Expenditure could be seen as a negative, for example France has a higher number than us.  It doesn't relate to efficiency, and that expenditure could be money to a non UK firm, almost all of my firms capital expenses are.

It is also un-cited, and doesn't reference the year.  As the CGT reforms, which also changes what amount of a company can be a CE didn't take effect until [2012 or 2014](http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5738), I also doubt the validity of suggesting it is due to the policies.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"I'm going to repost the relevant part of what I said to /u/TheElPistolero because you guys still seem to misinterpret what I mean by ""expectations.""

Objectively you can think our squad isn't good enough to win the title without lowering your expectations of what is acceptable as a team. Put it this way: You are a player in the locker room. Do you want them to go into the season thinking ""we just aren't good enough to win"" or do you want them to walk into every game with a swagger of ""f*** what people say, we can compete with anyone."" If the players go into games assuming they aren't good enough, it's a self-fufilling prophecy. Our goal every year should be the title. The players need to have a belief that they can achieve that goal or they will always fail. The same goes for the fans. Realistically we know we won't win the title every year, realistically we know other teams have more talent. But OUR job as fans is to believe our team can achieve, to not expect them to fail. Every season, every GAME we don't win SHOULD be a disappointment because the goal of the game is to win. I'm not saying fire the coach, dump the players, ect when we don't win because we accept that it won't always happen. But our expectation should be that we are capable of it because otherwise, what is the point? The players should NEVER expect to lose a game, and neither should we.

Example: I ""knew"" last year that we didn't have the talent of Man U, or Chelsea, or Man City, or Arsenal...but on gameday I STILL believed that our players had a chance to win those games. Everytime we lost, it hurt. And it should, losing hurts. That's what makes winning feel so good by comparison. :)

I believe the relevant ""inspirational"" quote is:  ""Always aim for the moon.  Even if you miss, you land amoung the stars"" - W. Clement Stone

Hoping you win the league and hoping you win the big game this weekend is different to expecting it. Expecting it means that you think you have the best team, squad, manager etc. We don't.

Once she has the interview, she will merely have to explain her current situation and if shje asks for help filling the relevant forms in they should do this there and then. My local authority has dedicated officers for this type of thing, I imagine your friends does too.

Worrying is a waste of time, it won't change anything. Speaking to the local housing officer will.

I'm not too sure about the catered options, but from what I hear the flats are pretty basic and not particularly great, though they are cheap. I do know that the small kitchens in catered flats are extremely basic, with only a microwave, kettle and a small fridge/freezer and other basic things but not a toaster.

Also it may be worth considering where you will be spending most of your time, as park wood is around a 10 minutes walk to Keynes, but more to say Rutherford. Generally speaking, lectures and seminars are centred around the collages where your Department is based. So Economics is generally based in Keynes, Politics is loosely based in Rutherford, architecture is based in Marlowe, etc. Generally the distances don't matter too much unless you are a) lazy like me b) going to be drinking on nights before lectures (which will happen a lot, trust me)

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"I would say that United won so many games (even games where they didn't have the best squad) because they expected to win.  How many times over the last few years did United come back and win at the very end?  How many times did they ""get lucky"" after everyone thought the game was over?

And how many times over that time period did Liverpool choke away victories that were ""in the bag"" or fold as soon as we went down by a goal?

Mentality is a HUGE part of the game.  Many times you don't have to be the most talented to win.  You can see it in our players (prior to last year) where we would fall behind and fold because we HAD no belief.  Our coaches didn't inspire it, the spirit of the crowd disappeared as soon as we fell behind because we (and I'll use this word again) EXPECTED to lose at that point.  To go back to the article, one of the biggest improvements is Rodgers started to change that mindset in the players.  Last year we fell behind but would keep fighting.  The ""transformation"" wasn't entirely complete, you could still see games where the maliase of hopelessness and frustration would dominate our attitudes after we fell behind, but it was a start.  The players kept their heads up and kept fighting for a win because Rodgers had convinced them that we could.

You can use the word ""hope"" if you like, but the problem with hope is when we let it disappear as soon as we fall behind.  The thing about expectations is the swagger that comes with it, the belief in yourself and your team that no matter what you have the ability to come out on top.  Maybe we don't have the most finances, maybe we don't have the most talent, but we have lost the swagger that made us Liverpool.  The swagger that let us come back from 3-0 down in 2005 when there was no ""hope"", the swagger that led to 18 premiere league championships, the swagger that made Anfield one of the most feared stadiums to play at.  Even baby steps, the mentality of saying ""we are at Anfield and NO ONE can beat us here,"" that expectation feeds off itself and leads to additional wins because we don't panic or get frustrated when we are down.  That ""expectation"" and belief in your team MAKES the team better simply because we expect them to be.",0,1372706424,null,0,false,0,caty1bo,t3_1hey58,t1_caty1bo,t1_catx87e,null,1430618559,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,syntax,cnty-scotland,Stravaigin,"That's just about possible; if a few assumptions about how the records system work hold (which I know that these do for other student record systems; but profess no knowledge about Spider).

It depends when the numbers are issued - if they are issued to all _students_ that that's unlikely to be a zero indexing problem.  On the other hand, if they are issued to all _applicants_, which is not uncommon, then that implies that there were 150 applicants that did not take up a place in the end.

That doesn't mean that there 1 student per 150 applications, it possible that there's some randomness in the distribution.  Another data point would be handy to check this (look to see if the change in number is the same direction, for one).  There's also the possability of a student dropping out, or trailing a year, hence not graduating right now, or being on a 2 year or 4 year course.

My gut feeling is that a gap of 150 is quite possible, but that the average gap should be smaller than that, if the root cause is an off by one problem.

Also, someone should be publicly flogged if that is the problem, as there is absolutley no excuse for that class of issue.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt; he's dressed like somewhere between two of the previous Doctors

Something he has never done. Besides, think about it, if the John Hurt guy was so terrible, then surely the Doctor wouldn't want to wear ANY of his clothes ever again? So the more likely theory suggests that John Hurt picks up some old Doctor clothes instead. As both 10 and 11 are wearing their clothes (supposedly) then the most recent costumes are of 8 and 9, which fits perfectly here.

&gt;And you've seen how much the Doctor suppresses the Time War, and his knowledge of it; did it not occur to you that he could have destroyed any of his enemies after the Time War, even the Daleks that escaped, with the Moment...which he still posses? 

Almost nothing is known of the Moment. We don't know what it is. It could literally be a moment. A point in Time and Space where you can do anything. In which case he can never return there and he would only be able to do one thing. 

We don't know if the Moment still exists at any rate, never mind if the Doctor has it. 

Other than that, though, the Doctor has told us a surprising amount about the Time War when you think about it. And he only seemed to shy away from what he did because he wishes he could have saved them, out of guilt. 

John Hurt is supposed to be his biggest secret, not worthy of being called the Doctor, but at the same time the Doctor admits to what he did to end the Time War, so I don't think he considers that as something the Doctor did not do. As the author of the article points out, he was ready to do it again in The End of Time. 

Saving all of reality by wiping out 2 species? That's exactly what the Doctor would do. It's not something he would be ashamed of.


Also, note how Trenzalore has been building up for quite a while now. There's going to be a battle there and it has been alluded to for a long time that the Doctor is not seen as good by all. But even more than that, his future has been discusses more often than his past. ""if you continue the way you are, what will you become?"", erasing himself from history because it was making his enemies stronger (thus fearing the future). He has always tried to avoid regeneration as much as possible, too. Which makes sense if he's trying to avoid his future from happening and/or he's trying to find a way out of it. 

From an out of show perspective: Moffat consistently attempts to put the user on the wrong leg and pull something unsuspected. He is aided in this quest with the use of red herrings. The only picture we have of Hurt is in those clothes. That's not a coincidence, that's planned. Just remember that last episode. Everything about it tries to put us on the wrong path. The Name of The Doctor turned out to not *really* be about his name, but about ""in the name of the Doctor!"". The prophecy turned out to be interpreted differently. River Song's tomb is there which is then suddenly a false grave! Jenny is dead, but now she's alive! Clara is dead, but now she's somehow saved by the Doctor! Oh and here's a new Doctor, John Hurt, by the way!

There are two benefits to universal benefit.

Firstly,  because everyone gets it, everyone feels like they are getting something back. Even though you don't really need the money, there is a principle here - that the government is there for us, rich or poor. It's also difficult to stigmatise a benefit that everyone claims.

But more importantly, it's very efficient. People seem to think it's more efficient to tax £10 than it is to tax £20 and pay back £10. In fact, the opposite is true. Consider these highly fictional examples:

The government spends £1 determining how much tax you should pay, and then takes £10 tax, and then spends another £1 to discover that you don't get any benefits. Net result: you lose £10, government gets £8.

But with universal benefit, the government spends £1 determining how much tax you should pay, takes £20 and gives back £10 (they don't need to check how much benefit you get because everyone gets the same benefit). Net result: you lose £10, government gets £9.

If we could make every single benefit universal, we would save billions.

I do however hope that they ignore that and simply select an actor who can do anger properly- one of my Smith pet peeves is that I personally don't think he does angry very well. Comes off as melodramatic to me. I wonder if they'd ever consider a Doctor of colour. Unlikely I know. But I'd love to see someone not totally white in the role.

&gt;u wot m8.

What does fam mean?

&gt;I understand why I just don't see why it is so important, it's like idolised. ""Yeah Jack is great in bed, is a rocket scientist and rescued two kittens from a burning house, but get this, he is an amazing listener!"". ""Omg he listents?"" **Swoons**

People are comfortable with what they’re familiar with. Navigating a heterosexual relationship is difficult enough given our differences; if you feel that you can relate to someone, then of course you are going to naturally be drawn to them – they are just like you, so you can understand them. This makes life easier, right? WRONG.

The sad truth is that in the majority of cases, it’s all a front. It’s like the honey trap. You’re drawn to it, and you die a slow and painful death because *you thought it smelled so good.*

In essence, this is where people lose their soul and end up in life-long relationships to which they aren’t necessarily suited for half the time. 

I blame history, stiff upper lips and the like. It’s still not acceptable within our society to leave your husband/wife or whatever on the basis that they changed when you settled down. But hey, that’s reality baby, it fucking happens, and whilst I can’t lay blame on either sex for this, I can lay the blame on evolution and survival of the species (not survival of the ‘fittest’, that’s something entirely different and is genetic and a whole different discussion). 

Study nature closely and you’ll know that it’s all about maximum reproduction. Study human nature and you’ll see that we have evolved far beyond any other species, but in so doing, it puts huge barriers in our way. The majority of men that I’ve met want kids, I do not, our planet is over populated and frankly I like my fun times and my enjoyment of life to be  all for me and not for some snotty-nosed, green pooed kid (I love kids, but the best part is handing them back). However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still very, very primeval urges out there, and you’re frankly daft if you ignore them and/or are ignorant to them. Survival of the species = procreation = sexing more than one woman = life-long relationships would be really rather nice but Christ, I * must sew my seed.*

Otherwise, how will man survive?! It’s probably not even a conscious decision, also, due to a few centuries of stupid Britishness, you’re deemed to be a lower class of person if you don’t get married and start with the baby making. I’d really dearly like society to wake the fuck up and realise that every time they give into these ridiculous primeval instincts, they continue to over populate our already bursting planet, they increase the pressure on our already over-burdened natural resources, and that they should just chuffing well donate the money they’d spend on their little mini-mes on feeding the starving population who are spread all over the world instead. 

Finally, I don’t think life-long relationships are natural. I think they are lovely, and I’d love to have one at some point (I worked with someone recently who met her true love at the age of 59, aww – there’s hope for me yet!), but I don’t inherently believe that they are natural. I’m afraid I think that the whole seed-sewing doo-dah is so deeply ingrained in our psyche that it’s going to take a couple of thousands of decades yet to remove it. And as to those who do have lifelong relationships (and specifically, post war days, this is important), then I wish them the best of luck, but often wonder if they settle down purely because settling down is more convenient than not settling down. Yeah, I don’t want to get to 70 without someone who gives a shit and who will wipe my incontinence away, but I’d rather that be another old croany female friend rather than some fella who has bored me to tears for the last x amount of decades. 

I forget who said this, an actress: ‘oh, he was my love of that decade.’ I absolutely understand this. I had my 90s and 2000s love, at some point the 2010+ will turn up. And if I get a good stretch with him but then split come the 2020s, I’m not about to go bitching about it. 

Relationships are great but enjoying life and friends are key. 

Until then Trotters, let’s just talk, yeah? :D

So look where your lectures might be, (eg law is all in Woolf I think) Also it's meant to be the ""party place"" but that seemed to have died down a lot this year, Campus Watch seemed to shut most things down fairly quickly.

Rutherford and Elliot are terrible. They're cheap as chips for a good reason, they're fully self catered, the kitchen has a microwave and kettle and that's it. So you have to eat in cafeteria which means you can't do stuff on your own schedule.

Darwin's nice, no ensuite but you do have your own kitchen.

Keynes is good if you can afford it, but 6.5k (probably more next year) is way too much extra for a double bed in my opinion, the single option is nice, and the kitchens for Keynes are really quite nice with extra living space

Basically, Keynes and Tyler are best for pre drinks in my opinion, Darwin's cheap and in an okay location, Parkwoods okay but locations terrible, Rutherford and Elliot beware.",0,1372713486,null,0,false,0,cau0ouz,t3_1hfx4g,t1_cau0ouz,t3_1hfx4g,null,1430617236,2,false,canterbury,t5_2sbso,2

Why do you not think long term relationships are natural? We've been doing it since we can communicate and build relationships. Yeah there is a lot of divorce now, both my parents have divorced twice each. Though my grandparents on my mums side met at 15 and when I see them together now at their early 70s, they still act like a pair of 21 year olds and are very much inlove still after all that time.

We're doing just fine on natural resources, maybe except for the gas and coal, but as far as everything else goes there is plenty to go round, it's the distribution that is fucked up, what with the 1% of the population ruling the 99% (hence my interest in AnonOps and #Occupy)

One is the tone Protokun7 said.

The other is that the universe is dying which presumably includes the creatures that showed up in Father's Day. So it's likely they were already erased at that point as only the Doctor, Amy, Rory, River were still alive by ""natural"" means. 

A third way to explain it is that in Father's day, there are two Doctors and Roses in the same place when they save Pete which creates a weak point in time, which is then fucked over even further when Rose creates a paradox by saving Pete. Her later touching herself (heh) is another paradox (damnit Rose) which aggravates the Reapers that had appeared due to the weak point + paradox.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"That it is a very complex topic, one which can not be simply indicated by a number.

For a start off, I can't believe anyone in any school of business would want to know a headline number of 'investment' without knowing what 'investment' means.  I mention because Capital Expenditure is mostly an accounting thing for large blocks of cost.  Now adays things are lower cost on the whole, if I want to, I can kit out an office for 40 people easily on £20k.  That is about half what it would have cost 10 years ago for instance.

What we are seeing is people cost more than things.  We have so many things, labour saving devices I mean.  Hell the march of smartphones and portable devices, so many companies now use these to replace incredibly expensive devices from just a few years ago.  Something that was £5k per unit, is now not even £200 and is even water resistant.

This is true with many areas of development, things as simply cheaper!  Meanwhile, commodities, such as energy, which are not a capital expense are higher.

What I'm trying to say is we've improved, we no longer have huge start up costs, but we do have higher in some ways running costs.

So this is why I'd pay an accounting term such as capital expenditure little regard.

Lets turn this question about a bit, try and drag it back to the original context:  **When is it good to borrow money?**

The short answer, is when invested it will lead to a return, that is greater than the cost of the borrowing.  

This in practice means that spending borrowed money on say welfare or something else that is noble, if it doesn't generate a return.  Because ultimately it is living beyond ones means, and pushing the expenses elsewhere.  This is risky, not just because you never know if it will rain tomorrow, but because you are making something which is a relative luxury at a completely un-known future cost.

As such I hope you can understand I consider investment to be something that has a very good certainty of being useful for the future.  This makes it hard to get accurate data for it.  It will also wildly vary between industries, some are naturally cyclic, some are Giffen goods, others just plain lucky.

A government can do basically two things, make it simpler for private ventures, gamble tax payers money.  The first is the one I'm in favour of, because ultimately it is only for people who are willing to take the risk, not everyone.  This means that sure, some rich will get richer, but the poorer are never exposed.  With state funded ventures its controversial to say the least.  A classic that I am familiar with is air travel.  Heathrow is a hub airport, we really want to keep it that way, and if possible make it more attractive, so more places can have links with us that are cheap and regular.  Yet nothing is happening because politically it is a better sell to say invest in HS2, that 20min reduction in travel time to Birmingham will make all the difference.  I am very cynical of government spending, simply because we seldom see it done right.  We have for example Cornwall, which is meant to be an objective-1 area, but lacks any motorway, it isn't even dual carriageway all the way down (thou this has gotten better in the last few years).  Yet at the same time there is a core brigade of people who complain if money is spent in London because it would provide the biggest ROI, meaning nothing gets done outside.  It is normally split in to pork barrelling activities in marginal constituencies that often provide no real value.  Or worse, vanity projects that provide virtually none (Olympics, Millennium Dome, etc.)  The joke is they don't even appear to buy the voter loyalty for long period at all, our elected officials really do only care about the very next term.

Which leads me to the conclusion that government should be doing only core things (our electricity shortage in a few years time will drive this matter home as prices shoot up due to buying from France!) and keeping clear of business.  We have actually seen them do this.  The £25k failure tax relief thing (effectively you don't pay £25k of tax on a failed venture) is a great example of this, it also acknowledges my point about drift from capital expenditure.  Say your starting a new business, your biggest costs are probably going to be personal, most people lease the biggest expenses now too, the aviation industry really set this trend at the ultra high end eg. few airlines own their planes, but have risk reducing leases with the manufacturer, this is a really useful win-win, and provides great incentives for the manufacturing and reliability side of things too.  Making *lean start-ups* more desirable is a really, really good move.  In fact its one that has helped me make a jump and take some more risks.  If everything goes to plan, that's 4 new jobs by December.

Warrior was pretty important, but even the article says she was built as a response to *Glorie* with a very similar design, and Warrior didn't even have the turret pioneered on the *USS Monitor* (which took part in the first battle between Ironclads).

Tell me about it. *That* story from the club will remain with me until my deathbed. 

&gt;Funnily enough I am drawn to the idea of having a kid in the distant future, though I'm not sure if handing down genetic depression is much fun for anyone.

We all have genetic dispossessions. My father was a raging drunk and beat my mum and sister silly, my mother is lovely but bordering on OCD and has to be stabbed to vocalise emotion; I have clearly gained a bit of both of these, but if you develop as an intelligent adult, you learn to deal with such genetics in a positive way, especially if you’ve had a supportive upbringing, and more especially so if you’re intelligent enough to not want to repeat your parents mistakes. Warning though: this can also be hugely detrimental. People can become so obsessed with not becoming whatever it was that they disliked about their parents that they live a life of permanent worry and stress. Fuck that. 

&gt;Why do you not think long term relationships are natural? We've been doing it since we can communicate and build relationships. 

Survival. Sewing sperm (eww, I hate that word) = survival of the blood line. 

&gt;Though my grandparents on my mums side met at 15 and when I see them together now at their early 70s, they still act like a pair of 21 year olds and are very much inlove still after all that time.

This is sweet, but really dude. People in war times were forced together. I guess you could align it with arranged marriages: I have very little choice and therefore I must just get on with it. That said, affection and love can *absolutely* grow under these circumstances. Saw an ex a few weeks ago who wanted to marry me, met his (arranged marriage) wife whom he was not attracted to in the slightest in the first year, they are happy beyond belief and have a lovely family. And to think, he wanted to marry me instead. Hahahahahahaha. However, on the other side, his own father who also had an arranged marriage never got over the fact that he wanted to marry the sister, and seems to be quite the twat to the entire family (they no longer talk). 


&gt;We're doing just fine on natural resources, maybe except for the gas and coal, but as far as everything else goes there is plenty to go round, it's the distribution that is fucked up, what with the 1% of the population ruling the 99% (hence my interest in AnonOps and #Occupy)

Self catered set up is good, well in keynes at least, 2 fridges, lots of storage space and 2ovens/sets of hobs. There's also 2 sofas and a huge table to eat at which you really don't appreciate until you move out. That's all to share between 8, which sounds a lot, but the communal space in Keynes is plenty big enough. For other halls I believe it's generally around 6 per ""hallway"" but this can vary by college and by house. 

I wouldn't worry too much about cooking, there are plenty of catering facilities to buy food, though I'm not so sure about that after 5, other than the pizzas offered in K-bar. However, any student quickly learns that, when in doubt, pasta and cheese is a safe bet. There are also a huge variety of microwave meals which are pretty good and dead easy to cook. Further, cooking is a great way to bond with your flatmates, and quite a few people begin cooking together to cut costs and spread the burden of cooking. 

As for sharing bathrooms, in Keynes you get an ensuite in all the self catered rooms, so that's not an issue in Keynes. However I do share a bathroom in my current accommodation and it's really not a problem, other than females' hair clogs up the showers. Apart from that, timing your showering can be a bit of a pain, just means you have to be early waking up really. But generally, as with sharing any space with others, so long as you all do your little bit to keep things clean you have no problems. 

Also, in any university accommodation there is a weekly cleaning by Kent Housing staff of all communal areas, which definitely comes in handy as you very rarely need to hoover etc. 

As for the difference between houses and flats, I'm not sure, having not set foot in one of the houses.

Yes, you can't be forced to work more than 48 hours in a week, but it's not any given week it's an average over a number of weeks. 

It also depends on the job. In your contract if it states that you can be based at various locations then travelling time isn't normally taken into account, for instance. 

Also, overtime is a grey area. Networking with clients in the evening can be classed as working and count toward the time, but of you're at a work event outside hours and clients happen to be there then it might not.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;Thank you for finally answering a simple question.

Which I answered a much in a better context above!  Of course it was in some rather lengthy text, with long words and the grammar of a dyslexic:

&gt;I am very cynical of government spending, simply because we seldom see it done right. We have for example Cornwall, which is meant to be an objective-1 area, but lacks any motorway, it isn't even dual carriageway all the way down (thou this has gotten better in the last few years). Yet at the same time there is a core brigade of people who complain if money is spent in London because it would provide the biggest ROI, meaning nothing gets done outside. It is normally split in to pork barrelling activities in marginal constituencies that often provide no real value. Or worse, vanity projects that provide virtually none (Olympics, Millennium Dome, etc.) The joke is they don't even appear to buy the voter loyalty for long period at all, our elected officials really do only care about the very next term.

Now if we had lots of proposals for things I think are a good idea, I'm massively in favour.  For example cross rail looks to be very beneficial.

&gt;Essentially, you hold traditional right-wing views on the economy and you're quite happy with the way things are going.

Views are far more complex than left or right wing, it isn't right to pigeon hole, as people don't often vote in such simple manners.

&gt;There's green shoots as far as the eye can see, eh?

No, we have a massive debt, that we squandered.  By this I mean we have used it on things which haven't added as much value as they have cost.  Take a step back, compare our education with that of say someone from Taiwan, we are not going to be winning in terms of our average education level.  Yet at the same time we have completely de-valued degrees, whilst making the cost massive for the individuals who have taken them.  These are really bad things, which no one is talking about.  Instead we have cries that people who have entirely subsidised lifestyles might have to house share.  As a Londoner, this just shocks me.  Most people I know under 30 house share, even if they are earning £50k!  Borrowing money to improve the lifestyles of someone who is economically inactive is to me incredibly shocking behaviour, it will have to be paid for, with interest, by someone else at an unknown point.  The elephant in the room is we know that 20somethings today will not be retiring by 70, they will work much longer years in life, with less subsidies.  Meanwhile we are demanding they pay not only higher tax (SLC etc) but also subsidise this other generation, with things they will not likely receive themselves.

So when someone suggests that we are failing by not having Capital Expenditure rising.  I think, fuck me, we let these people vote.  These are not simple measures you look at in isolation!  Want something simple to be upset at the economy, look at the employment **and** underemployment.  That shows why we are nicely-not-to-bad-but-not-great-fucked.  But of course those are complicated.

By manual job I mean in order to get around this man in the middle vulnerability the user would either need to rely on a certificate authority to confirm the certificate hasn't been tampered with (not realistic in the case of your program) or they would need to manually add the public certificate after you've sent it some other way.

Basically from what I'm understanding, you are saying your program will each time automatically generate a public key, send that to the recipient, the recipient will generate a symmetric private key and encrypt it using the originators public key (or just send replies encrypted using the public key), then they can communicate using encryption. Basically the same idea as SSL (minus certificate authorities)? Great idea on paper but as I showed in the link above, SSL isn't secure and this idea is especially vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. Let me know if I've misunderstood.

First I feel there is a good chance we'll sign a striker (Aren't we after Villa pretty hardcore... also if Real are really are partner I think we should try and  make a HUGE push for Higuaín I think he's exactly what the doctor ordered for us) this summer. Second Gareth Bale second the 3rd most league goals last year, behind only RVP and The Uruguayan Vampire. Third isn't there a whole play style around not having a real striker? I admit I don't watch the continental leagues much but there were plenty of VERY successful teams without traditional strikers.


Next I like Adebayor. Well I'm not sure I like him. But wasn't he not at 100% most of the season? I mean there some days he just looked like an absolute world beater. Although certainly not most of the time. AVB just needs to light a fire under his ass and we'll be fine

Defoe is fine as a super sub. Also a 4-3-3 with Bale Defoe and Lennon would be the fastest front in the premier league, maybe the world. This has absolutely nothing with the point I was trying to make. I just find it interesting. 


Ninja edit

That's the mentality I want to fight against and have come to hate. Fuck fourth place. It's nothing. 1st place is. Every team is in a time of transition. During the whole Primer league era we've never had a good as chance as this year to win the league. COYS

true,PeelianPl3b,null,null,"I would say get some experience on a 125. 125ccs are very easy and very forgiving. They will put up with abuse which a bigger bike would just throw you into a hedge for. The experience on the smaller bike will pay off. They teach you things like how to use the gears properly (its easier to be lazy about it on a bigger bike) How to corner etc. The more time you have to get used to how motorcycles behave handling wise the better. 

Don't worry too much about the cost. You won't lose much money on them. A decent Japanese 125cc will hold its value really well. 

In terms of gear, buy decent stuff. Buy a good helmet. These £30 things that seem to be turning up are shit. Shoei, arai, AGV, shark, HJC, Bell, all make decent helmets at various prices. A better helmet is a good investment, not only in terms of protection but comfort too. One that doesn't let rain in, is quiet and comfortable is priceless.  Have a look at sharp.gov.uk to make an informed decision. Go and try helmets on before you buy one. Go to a shop and buy it in person. Try a few on before you decide. The shop staff should be able to advise you on fit. Fit is ultra important. 50 people a year die simply because their helmet was not as safe as it could have been. If you want to save a bit on gear but still get decent protection have a look at textiles. They work (not quite as well as leather) but they are quite a bit cheaper. Motorcycle gear isn't cheap for the decent stuff but again if you're sliding down the tarmac was saving £50 by buying gear that fails on you worth it? Not really.

Nothing wrong with buying used bikes. Go to a decent dealer the first time though. That way you have some recourse if the bike is a lemon. You could buy new but, even if you drop it in the drive way (which for many first time motorcycle owners, that just happens. I've done it with a 125). You'd be pissed if you cracked a fairing on your brand new ninja.

Or, give your landlord shit and get him to sort it as your  are a renter and it's his responsibility to supply you with drinkable and safe water to wash in, and demand a new lid.

(Note that it is VERY unlikely that the kitchen tap will be fed from this tank, in 99% of homes I have worked in have a supply of mains 'potable'/fluid category 1 (safe to drink) water, and 'stored' water of any kind is cat. 2. Test it by turning off your mains stopcock, then trying your kitchen tap (which should have stopped) and running a basin in the bathroom (which should keep going for a while 'til the tank runs out). If that happens then your kitchen tap is perfectly safe to drink (and most likely healthier for you than the bottled stuff.)

I can see why it's hard to understand--England, Scotland, and Wales all have very old and unique cultural histories and traditions, and most people living there have had families living in that same cultural tradition for generations.. However, when the Irish, for example, arrived in the US, they kept Irish traditions, lived in Irish areas, etc. Same with the Italians, Scots, or Germans. 

Most Americans will identify as American; when someone who is clearly Americans says ""I'm Irish"", it is understood to mean Irish-American. And it is true that an Irish-American family will have a unique set of traditions and cuisine than, say, an Italian-American family.

I think it's part of being a ""salad-bowl"" immigrant culture. Most of the people who consider themselves ""Irish"" (Irish-American) will be grandchildren or great-grandchildren of immigrants.

true,rossryan,null,null,"Fairly certain, on one of the wikis, that the Moment is revealed as a modified De-Mat gun (considered the most powerful weapon that the Time Lords had, and The Doctor built one / took one, and modified it). 

And I am also fairly certain that, perhaps one of the Time Lords, has mentioned that the Doctor still posses it. 

But that's the thing, it is something the Doctor would be ashamed of doing: committing genocide. He's a healer, someone who fixes things...to resort to destroying something is to admit defeat, that there was no other way. It's the equivalent of a thief using dynamite to open a safe -&gt; if a thief has to do this, and in doing so, ruins everything within, the thief has 'won' only in a very empty way. And that's also what was driving him loony later on -&gt; the Doctor thought that he had mad a terrible sacrifice (his people, and those of his enemy), but that it was over and done with; instead, he finds out that he sacrificed his people, and many of the enemy...but that the enemy is still out there. 

You've probably watched Torchwood, and seen the episode where Jack sacrifices a few children to buy peace / freedom for Earth from unknown invaders; at the times, Jack knew it was morally wrong, but that was something he was wiling to live with...because the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few; well, those aliens came back for more...and Jack realized that the original sacrifice wasn't the end of things, but the beginning. The Doctor is no different here...he realized, like many have, that sacrificing leads only to more sacrifices. Or as Hans Christian would put it, that ash tree the other trees offered up to save themselves became the handle of the axe to cut the rest of them down. 

The Doctor does not want to be The Warrior, get me? But he often times gets dragged into the role. Remember Demon's Run, where that girl said that the name doctor didn't mean healer to her people, but great warrior? And the look of his face when he heard that? 

But I agree on Moffat's misdirection. We shall see what happens. ;-)

Your ethnic heritage can say a lot about your traditions, where you live, and worldview.

Note that it's not all Americans who identify this way. I, for example, have no recent immigrants in my past few generations, so I identify as just plain American. I am not a member of the very distinct Irish- or Italian- or German-American cultures. I think it's well-understood, among Americans at least, that when someone says they're ""Irish"" they're not literally claiming to be a denizen of Ireland.

true,DrStrangematter,null,null,"*I ended up on your page after the security clearance thing, but I wanted to answer this because I might have an explanation. Sorry for reading some of your comments in other subreddits.*

I am the first person in my family born in America. I grew up with Russian and Ukrainian spoken at home, Russian friends, Russian school, eating Russian food. All of my family's stories are from Ukraine. I listen to Russian music. Do I consider myself authentic Ukrainian? Of course not.

However, I am afraid what will happen in the next generations of my family. Will my children speak the language I spoke with my parents? What about my grandchildren? I have a proud heritage in Ukraine (hell, I'm a collateral relative of Ivan Sirko); how long will it take for that heritage to be lost?

Personally, this is something I have accepted will happen in future generations of my family. The United States is multicultural after all, and with each generation the culture from the old country is diluted. Statistically, it is highly unlikely based on the demographics of my surroundings that my children (if I ever have any) will have a Slavic mother. I accept this for what it is; perhaps I'm contributing to the formation of an American culture or sub-culture, perhaps a culture as unique as Gibraltar's!

However, many immigrants and children of immigrants don't accept this. They are xenophobic and afraid of losing their cultural heritage in future generations. It was much easier to ""preserve"" culture in the past, when it was expected that immigrants gather in neighborhoods together, each neighborhood being a product of one country of origin, and attempted to limit the dilution of their heritage by (trying to) ensure that the next generations stayed, wed, and bred in the same neighborhood. 

Of course, eventually, the culture dilutes anyways, but the identity remains. A person who's family had been in an ""Irish"" neighborhood for the past 75 years genuinely believe that they share a strong cultural heritage with the Irish, because that's what they were taught by their parents in a desperate attempt to retain their culture. 

My point in these ramblings is that the strange American predilection with distant ancestry is a product of the cultural and ethnic segregation of America's past and a fear of America's 19th and early 20th century immigrants being afraid of losing their cultural identities. It's a peculiarity of Americans which certainly is pretentious, but is likely beyond the control of most Americans—they were raised from the day they were born to think that they are X-American, not just American.",0,1372728129,null,0,1372732979,0,cau661f,t3_1hfy0t,t1_cau661f,t1_cau4ms3,null,1430614610,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

Paulinho and Dembele, both excellent dribblers of the ball, will lead many of our attacks with surging runs forward. 

When facing mid/lower table opponents, Paulinho/Dembele should be rotated out for Holtby/Gylfi. We will likely already have a good share of possession, and the opponents will look to put more men behind the ball, in which case we will need more creativity.

Of course, with the depth we have now (Paulinho, Sandro, Dembele, Gylfi, Holtby, Dempsey, Carroll, maybe THudd), there will be a lot of rotation, but I expect this to be the basic setup.

Seriously, it couldn't even come out that way, it wouldn't sound right.

&gt;When are people going to accept their national identity?

This is what you are not comprehending, to us (unless you are extreme) there is no issue regarding ""national identity.""  We are all Americans (and usually you Europeans are too busy telling us we are nationalistic, so this is a bit of a laugh), but Americans can have any ethnic identity on earth.  To us there is no conflict between an ethnic and a national identity, we are all as American as anyone else.  Why do you think there are always pic posts on reddit of some ""foreigner"" getting sworn in as an American citizen and American commenters fawning all over them.  We don't give a fuck if the guy is brown, chinese, speaks with an accent or whatever, that guy went through a lot of work to become an American, and we instantly respect him for it.  He doesn't have to like basbeall or eat hamburgers, he can do whatever he wants, but we are happy to have him because he chose to become one of us.

Moral of the story is that to us, we do not have a single ethnic identity that is linked to being an American.

So I guess when people in Louisiana say they are from the South, they mean the South of England, since there can be only possible interpretation of ""the South,"" which is obviously ""the South"" that you are familiar with.

It's almost like someone would have said we are two nations separated by a common language, but no one would ever say it, we just must insist upon your, correct definitions and usage of the English language.

I mean, it isn't like this has been common knowledge since Abe Lincoln was shot at a play about the misunderstandings between English and Americans that we could have problems communicating.

Because that goes without saying. Obviously. There's nothing to discuss there, of course everyone commenting sympathises with her and understands that she is the victim here.

 The point others are making is that rehabilitation should have a greater priority than vengeance. Even if you don't care what happens to the boy you should at least realise that imprisoning him without giving him the proper psychological help is just going to increase the chances of him reoffending in the future.

Moreover you seem way too quick to completely write the boy off. As is often pointed out many child molesters were abused themselves, its not like they were simply born evil and beyond repair. I've seen a few confessions in /r/offmychest by people who molested younger relatives when they were younger without really understanding what they were doing because they themselves had been molested, without exception they talked about how deeply they regretted what they had done.

For the record, both played in leagues that the average poster on this sub would not have seen. Some people could recite Mickey Targaryans stat line, even if they've only ever seen highlights. And the only reason is they and some other fine folks around the web did some google searches.

For the record, Paulinho is a DM and Henrikh is best suited for CAM. Paulinho is starting ahead of Lucas for Brazil, so he's at least considered better by the national side. There's some disagreement among fans about areas we most need to strengthen. Most, before the window, probably didn't imagine us going after a CAM, as we've got a number of creative fellows and just brought in Coutinho. That said, Mickey plays the position in such a way that he brings something to the squad we don't presently have.

Some people say we need to bring in DM cover for Lucas or to outright replace Lucas. At this stage in our summer recruitment (even if the window is early, we've done probably 1/2 our business at the minimum), it doesn't look like Rodgers and Co see a new DM starter as necessary. Hence, no Paulinho and a number of other potential targets. At most we have been linked with Wanyama, but he is likely to cost too much if we secure our top targets. And he could potentially fight Lucas for the starting job.

The only guarantee is that we'll be bringing in a CB, even if that hasn't been the news lately, and a striker if Suarez forces a move or Madrid force our hand.
