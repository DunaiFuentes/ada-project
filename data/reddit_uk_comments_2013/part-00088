I would propose that fines be laid for use of a non-standard language during important proceedings like those outlined in the article, and would be interested in that being passed onto other situations where necessary.

Personally, I'm quite happy with whoever and whatever living anywhere they like as long as they speak/understand the local *lingua franca*, *or have someone with them at all times who can translate*.

The point being that if you're resident in a country, the onus is on *you* to make sure you're capable of communicating. Most would insist on others having knowledge of the local language. I'm saying you don't have to, but you have to make up for it:

If you're first generation here and struggle with English, borrow someone from your community who *can* speak English every time you go out. If you're second generation, there's no excuse really, but if you've been stuck in a ghetto somewhere, the same rule applies.

If there's no-one in your community who speaks the English, then *that's* a problem, but I sincerely doubt it's that bad, nor will it ever be.

Same applies the other way around. If I was to move to, say, the Czech Republic to work there for a few years, I'd be off to classes to learn Czech before I set foot on the 'plane.

Obeyance of local laws also applies. This goes for Brits abroad as well as people who have imported a way of life from elsewhere. For those unaware, there were news stories recently about people believing they're still governed by British law in foreign lands because they're ""on holiday and not staying"".

Now, for holiday makers, be that Brits abroad or people coming to Britain to look around, there should be no insistence on learning the local language. It's common courtesy, of course, and you should at least have a phrasebook, but having the aforementioned local language speaking chaperone shouldn't be necessary. Locally provided translators already exist for emergencies and the like.

As to your comment, I think multiculturalism is a good thing, and the more the merrier. ""Why?"" you ask. Simple: If all these groups are to be able to get along, they're going to need a common language. English is quite handy for that purpose, regardless of your beliefs regarding cultural integration - or lack thereof.

The real truth is hidden between the lines, its really not what you know right now, but who you know.

luckily I was a matched skill set for the job at hand, but if it hadn't been for my dad, I would've never had the opportunity, and it wasn't exactly given, I still had to interview and prove myself.

My advice is ask people you know, if there is anything slightly relevant to your line of interest you could possibly take.

before this I was working in the council offices as work experience from the job centre, which did actually give me experience in a few different areas, luckily I got to go out on educational visits to local schools. 

before I got my job I was searching on all the major job websites, indeed, monsters, gov website etc.

I even contemplated jobs in fields I hated, in areas as far as manchester.

Even if you hate what is offered, it will pay a wage, I spent 4 years of my life doing a job I absolutely hated, and that I have no interest in but it did pay a wage, which in turn payed for housing and food. If you have a family that is important.

Even where I am now, I can't afford what I want, and I see people boasting daily about what they have, houses, car, computer etc. they are my motivation, they don't make me jealous, they make me work harder to get what I want.

It would because it is tied to house prices to some extent. The rental value has to be at least 125% of the monthly mortgage interest or a lender won't lend. And then the Landlord has other costs on top to cover as well plus they'll want a minimum return out of it. 

&gt; and say for example we lose some percentage of of the tenants because housing benefits get scrapped. You've then got a situation where there are more houses available and less people able to afford them.

Not really. Demand is outstripping supply in most areas and there will always be people who find a way to afford the rents.

Yes, but words used as slurs are typically re-appropriated by the people who are the targets of the slur. That's why some black people get mad when white people say ""nigga."" They were the ones using the word to hurt, not the ones trying to reclaim it.

Especially in terms of ""faggot,"" it's almost always meant as an insult (except, arguably, on 4chan and the like.) It's not reclaiming a negative word and trying to make it positive, like ""nigga"" or ""queer,"" it's taking a negative word and applying [this argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-V2sqhIYL2k).

true,TitoTheMidget,null,null,"&gt;Yeah, but thinking offending somebody is a crime or worthy of silencing speech is another thing all together.

Who is talking about silencing speech, here? Is anyone saying ""Hey, the government should totally step in and make laws against these words?"" Or is it more along the lines of ""Hey, I'd appreciate it if people didn't use these words this way."" Because I'm seeing more of the latter. Of course you CAN use those words. It just makes you an asshole, that's all. And people generally don't strive to be assholes.

&gt;Sometimes offending people is the right thing to do.

Sometimes, sure. One generally should try to avoid it when it's NOT the right thing to do, though.

&gt;Christians get offended when I tell them creationism is bullshit, but that doesn't mean I should hold back because it offends them - does it?

Well, firstly, this is a bad analogue to the use of ""faggot."" Christians try to push creationism as actual scientific theory, which it isn't, and trump up a debate that really isn't there. So that's harmful to public discourse and education, and yeah, saying ""that's bullshit"" is the right call there. You're arguing facts. Calling bullshit is what you DO when you argue facts. Calling people a ""faggot"" and pretending that it doesn't make you sound like an immature, homophobic child is a whole other thing.

To get this analogy more precise, the situation would have to be Christians just sitting around, minding their own business, maybe at their church or whatever, and then you bursting in and yelling ""CREATIONISM IS BULLSHIT!"" apropos of nothing. In THAT situation, you're being an asshole, because they're not really doing anything to anybody and there's no sort of moral obligation to stop them.

Obviously it's possible in Doctor Who, because she's alive and well. Obviously erasing her memories was enough to quell the timelord mind, because that's what the Doctor did.  If you watch Doctor Who long enough and pay attention, you'll find that a huge amount of things the Doctor says are impossible, actually happen a lot.

Look at Clara for a good example, she's died several times and keeps reappearing, and he very clearly states that she is impossible.

Also, Donna Noble only absorbed a major part of his memories, and a lot of DNA, but there's no way that the separation was 80-20.  Meta-crisis doctor was at least half human because he only has 1 heart, can never regenerate, and will age exactly as a normal human.

Donna Noble was called the DoctorDonna because she is part timelord and part human after the meta-crisis.  When the Doctor erases her memories he erects a mental barrier to keep her from remembering and keep the timelord mind from overloading her.  He doesn't remove timelord dna, or the timelord mind, if he could have done that he would have.  He wasn't saying, per se, that it is impossible for her to ever exist, but that it is impossible for her to remain both because she was originally human.

He made some cruel mistakes in the past as CB and lots of people started to write him off, especially after the west brom-game so I don't think he's a world class defender, nor do I think he's world class in midfield but he plays with passion and physical presence and that's what we're missing the most imo. Also he isn't afraid to play the risky pass forward which Mikel or Ramires never play. In CDM he makes our offense harder to read for the opponent while still being very solid in defense.

I can't find the government figures for long term youth unemployment, but I found a report from the work foundation. See the graph on page 20. http://www.theworkfoundation.com/DownloadPublication/Report/314_short-term%20crisis_long_term_problem.pdf

The figures given for long term youth unemployment were around 264,000 people in 2012 which is much worse than the 73,500 that the Mirror reports, however this graph also includes some students. based on the trend I assume that long term youth unemployment is still rising. However the major upsurge happened in 2008 and the upwards trend started in 2005. If the trend is projected to 2013 I'd say an increase by 50% since 2012 would be the best you could get (still a major problem).

I'm not sure where the Mirror got its figures, most of the political conversation centres around who is defined as unemployed, it makes a big difference which groups you count.

Smith's new clothes are boring. They lack the quirky zazz of his last outfit, and the slick style of Tennant's.

The new TARDIS interior is boring. It belongs in a Syfy original series. Flat, grey, snazzy touchscreens... it looks like an Android device contained in shined aluminum.

Much to my dismay, Clara is boring. She's doing things that companions typically don't, and that's refreshing. But when she spars with the Doctor, it's typically only when it relates to the mystery of her, or it's a failure of writing. The latter can be seen in last week's episode, when they're trapped in the burny burny room. ""What are these things? You have to tell me!"" There are crazily more important things to think about, more things to be angry or distressed about, and she's asking that... but she has to, because in order for the Doctor's solution to make sense to the viewer, what those things are has to be explained.

The usual small inconsistencies are getting particularly sloppy in this season, too. The extended stays in the ""pocket universe"" with no repercussions, the sitting in the burny burny room for minutes at a time... both of these were supposed to be fraught with danger. But nothing. How can we be in suspense if it seems the Doctor can flout any danger?

In the same vein, how can we feel any danger associated with Clara? She's a character, and so a fictional person, but also just a character. If she dies, the Doctor meets her again. It's what happens.

Don't get me started on the resurrected reliance on the Screwdriver... Tennant's run had some episodes with a similar ""say some sciency stuff (magic words, essentially), fiddle with something, sonic it, and problem solved."" But the entire temple sequence in Rings (from the start of the rescue until Clara retreats with Mary) was so, so lazy.

It could be argued that I'm noticing some of these more because there's less to distract me. No impending doom or intrigue holding fast to the whole series. A single companion instead of a half-dozen faces popping in and out of the TARDIS. This last point might be especially powerful-- I noticed myself finding the TARDIS rather empty since Rory and Amy have gone...

I still love Doctor Who, and Smith is my favorite Doctor. I'm just not enthralled with how 7b is going so far. They are doing some very clever things, I think.

An independent Scotland could recognise the complex shared history of Scotland and the United Kingdom by offering shared or dual citizenship.

And a lot of new people who have just started watching come here to be a part of the ever growing and (most of the time) fantastic fan base that Doctor Who has. They want to be a part of it, so they seek out others like themselves. 

I myself am caught up, but I, like many others, don't like things being spoiled. Sometimes there are spoilers weeks in advance and sometimes spoiler tags are not used, and, in extreme cases, someone has access to a major spoiler and posts it in ambiguous links to ruin it for everyone (Like The Walking Dead subreddit had before a major event in season 3). A lot of people come here for questions relating to certain past episodes in an effort to gain more understanding and they have every right to do so. Not everyone was introduced to Doctor Who at the same time and if I were just getting into the show, I would love a place to come to discuss the current episode i'm on, companions, ect..., and that is one of the many things that makes this subreddit great. 

Majority of people know to avoid this subreddit a few days after a new episode airs and some, like the OP, decide to avoid the subreddit all together because of the potential spoilers. And its comments like yours that inspired me to leave this subreddit in the first place some months ago; I just recently decided to come back because I missed the general discussions, but i'm not sure why I thought things would be any different.

From what I read, Moffat is consciously rejecting the large story arc approach from the previous season, and trying to bring in a story-to-story kind of model.  So far, not so good.  This week's episode wasn't as bad as some of the others, but I actually thought ""Rings"" was absolutely abysmal.

Aside from some writing gaffs in this season, I think the high production value throws a wrench into things for trying to take on a story-to-story direction for this show.  I liked 9 and early 10, partly because the episodes were occasionally too campy to take themselves too seriously.  They could pretty easily re-hash existing villains from the EARLY days, and not bat an eye at how out-of-place (and/or campy) a Dalek or a Cyberman might seem in today's sci-fi.  Part of what made series 1-4 great were  that the production value matched the eccentricity of the doctor - there were some quirks you occasionally rolled your eyes at, but you **really** liked what they were getting at.  On the flip-side of this, part of what made ""Blink"" such an awesome episode, in my opinion, is that it contrasted very sharply with the rest of what that show had done - you didn't ever have a moment where you had to ""see through"" the campiness to get at the writing.  The episode was well-written and suspenseful in-and-of itself, no strings attached.

  Eleven had the advent of a new direction in the writing - a large story arc, as well as a budget bump, etc.  While he maintains the whimsical eccentricity of the Doctor, he's developed over 2 years with a very different-from-Tennant-and-Eccleston writing base.  The production value in this show can be taken a little more seriously, which has somewhat affected the writing, and I would call this show more ""serious"" as a whole in the last few years.  The Doctor has similarly adapted to this new ""seriousness"".  Matt Smith's Doctor needs a big story arc with recurring characters and a persisting drama to do well.  I don't think you can go back to a Tennant-style Doctor without actually getting a new Doctor.  Matt Smith's character is too embedded in the previous seasons to make a left-turn like this properly.  Moffat should either go big with the storyline again, or find a new guy for the job so he can start with a clean slate.

**tl;dr- Moffat's trying to redefine this Doctor, and go back to the ""old"" structure of the show - I think he needs to get another Doctor (for the sake of having a clean slate), or needs to go back to the large story arc model of the show with Smith.**",0,1367730009,null,0,1367730708,0,c9snskx,t3_1dpa89,t1_c9snskx,t3_1dpa89,null,1431320803,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

The early dialogue missed many opportunities to be interesting. It was actually boring. And Strax has been turned into a one-joke pony. The Matrix outfit and Tom-Tom references were too overt.

The last 10 minutes was a mixture of bizarre and laughable. 

We laughed out loud when the old lady revealed the chest sucker, and again when she pulled a gun. 

At no time did we worry the Doctor would have any difficulty stopping the slow, weak old lady... whose religious fervor to create an apocalypse was unconvincing (especially by this unusual technological means).

Then we had the shootout, the splat, and the second splat. 

And gosh, the Doctor cured himself and Clara, but couldn't cure the daughter's blindness? We didn't even get a passing remark about the Doctor lamenting that fact.

As far as River/Melody aging backwards, that's not how I understood it.

(2) We've seen River Song as a baby, as a small white child, a small black child, a college-age black woman, and as Alex Kingston.

true,letheix,null,null,"&gt;The touching of her face is a big clue. That is a very intimate thing to do, let alone the smack on her bum which is very personal and flirty.   


Flirty =/= intimate. It's not so much intimacy between them as it is chemistry. After all, how intimate can it truly be if he doesn't even know what she is? Clara is herself someone who shuns intimacy. The fantasy that Oswin invented for herself was alone and Clara I rebuffed of the Victorian father. Clara II at present is sort of a rebound, a way back into the game. Plus, the Doctor was just very physical and flirtatious all around in this episode.

&gt;It is the excitement of not knowing who or what she really is I believe.  

I think that there's some additional factors.  

1. The Doctor tends to pick up the tenor of his companion's personalities. Clara is loveable and flirtatious--perhaps to contrast with the familial dynamic between the Eleven and the Ponds. Maybe he even unknowingly chooses the companion that he *needs,* who will match his frame of mind (and I could speculate forever about why Clara is that). The companions always have something to teach the Doctor, and him being him, he has to learn it by experience, so he imitates.

2. River. He got a lot more comfortable with flirtation after everything that happened with her. I

3. It's ""safe"" to flirt with Clara because it seems unlikely that she will fall in love with him^in ^my ^opinion .

I've owned both 11 and 10's toys from thinkgeek.

10's got a UV and and Ink nib that fit into the bottom. Over time, it loosens, and could require being glued into place to prevent any falling apart you may encounter during use. the slider switch (where the Sonic SHOULD be activated from) has a cap on it, that also gets loose. Don't lose it though, it covers up the phillips head that holds the thing together. The UV effect is cool, but come on. Tennant never did that shit.

11's is probably the best bet if you're on a budget. it has 4 sounds that you can use, as well as being able to extend on its own. The cap that covers the red button gets so loose, so fast that sometimes, you'll hit the button to extend the sonic, and it'll pop that end open. Ended up gluing that shut too. Over time, the clasp that keeps the sonic closed will erode from constant opening/closing making it almost impossible to keep closed on a shelf.

11's also got the Universal Remote Control Sonic (Which I recommend for any fan of 11 who's not necessarily got the strictest budget) It's a full metal replica, that doesn't open, but it DOES turn your TV on/off, change the channel/volume/input. It's not quite *screen accurate* but it's close enough. It's got an FX mode with all the Classic Sonic sounds, as well as a few others. (it also blinks in morse code, secret messages from the TARDIS - Pretty cool shit, 11 messages in all)

Eventually, I decided my love for Who was worth the money, and I bought [THIS](http://imgur.com/a/tlwf9#3)

That's a Celstial Toystore *Replica* Sonic. 11th hour Variant of the 10th/11th Doctors Screwdriver. Used only in Matts first episode.

true,DaGreatPenguini,k9,K-9,"Underwhelming is an understatement. The episodes seem...childish. There's a lack of complexity and depth, and it seems as if the stories themselves aren't going anywhere in particular. Perhaps it's because the Doctor is merely trying to understand the whole Clara issue ( which seems a bit forced) and not trying to solve a time-space crisis (e.g., the crack in the wall, the Master, Bad Wolf, etc). 

I think it's also because the episodes are beginning to seem a bit formulaic, with little tension as to whether the problem will be solved, without any negative side effects, or significant impact on the story arc. They don't seem ""big"" enough to warrant a Time Lord's attention. 

And Wi-Fi stealing people's intellect? Really? I want to go back to the time where the show runners thought I was an adult. Actually, I was a bit insulted and embarrassed to have my wife watch the Rings of Akhaten, with the angry soul sucking sun with the big, mean frowny face. I felt like I was making her watch Teletubbies, reassuring her it was brilliant sci-fi.  

To that point, did anyone think that the Doctor destroying these people's FUCKING SUN and then just popping off in the TARDIS was fine? He left those poor people stranded in a solar system with NO FUCKING SUN. It's like destroying the second Death Star with no concern of collateral damage to Endor. Who does that?

Then there's the little stupid things that just bug me. The opening titles have changed, not for the better. The opening theme has changed to something more akin to the Tom Baker days, again not for the better. Plus, it sounds muddy. The overall scoring is less heroic and compelling (although every episode's use of ""I Am The Doctor"" with the Doctor shouting some blather like ""there's one thing you never, ever, ever do to a Time Lord who's holding a carrot and a wearing a fez...and that's threaten to blow up the universe, not on my watch!"" was getting tiresome).

The Doctor's clothes aren't cool anymore, either; he looks like he's that sad, lonely kid who comes into high school CosPlaying a Victorian steam-punk character, aching for attention, silently hoping people will think he's intellectual and erudite. 

Matt Smith's acting is off, too. He's playing the Doctor in a goofy slapstick manner, and not with the dignity and steel that becomes a Time Lord Victorious, the Oncoming Storm, the One the Daleks call ""Predator"", the man who ended the Time Wars by viciously and cold-bloodingly destroying two entire races - one of which was his own. It's like he's tired and has given up, just phoning it in.  This is not the man who earned River Song's undying love and respect. I want him back. 

And what's with his face? He looks like a caricature if himself, not the young, handsome guy he was just a year ago. It's as if his bone structure has decided to keep growing; he's all forehead, eye sockets, and jaw now. I hope he's not sick. 

At the end if it all, I feel like I'm watching it just to get that special feeling back, the way I felt when things clicked. Coming back after the break makes it seem like I've tried to pick up a relationship with a girl I've just stopped calling for no reason, and trying to pretend that nothing's changed. Yet things have changed. The Doctor's changed. I've changed. And the chemistry just ain't there in the way it used to be.

It keeps me more engaged because I love the slow buildup of clues and knowing that there'll be a big pay off at the end of the season. This season has been just a bunch of self-contained episodes.

Yeah no-one was into it before 1707.

But seriously, England *had* a national identity prior to the act of union at least. It didn't just disappear, and I find your point that Britishness is somehow an extension of Englishness on other nations offensive.

While you could argue that warmongers like Cromwell extended Englishness upon the other nations (in particular Scotland and Ireland), this was way before the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and after the expulsion of Scottish members from the English parliament following the restoration those same members wanted to keep the union. The Union itself was something that Scottish and English political classes chose, not a result of some final victory over the Scots. Anything before that, sure it's English influence but anything afterwards is British.

&gt; Can you really think of any examples where Welsh culture has influenced England?

Tom Jones, Welsh Choirs, Dame Shirley Bassey, Dylan Thomas, Ryan Giggs, Manic Street Preachers, Charlotte Church, Duffy, Joe Calzaghe, Rob Brydon, Anthony Hopkins, Christian Bale, Matthew Rhys, Jonathan Pryce, Ruth Madoc, Laura Ashley, Tommy Cooper, Paul Whitehouse, Harry Secombe, Edwin Stevens (inventor of the portable hearing aid), Aphex Twin, Aled Jones and Bonny Tyler.

Other than that, nothing material, but that's because of Henry VIII's integration of Wales into the English kingdom *500 years ago* which is why you probably thought a fair few of the above were English.

&gt; I can think of some small examples of Scotland influencing England, but the weight of the balance is the other way by a damn sight.

I'd argue against it but I really can't be bothered, I wasted all my energy on pointing out Welsh cultural influences, and given that I was talking about the denial of English nationality, other nationalities don't really come into it.",0,1367739809,null,0,false,0,c9sptgu,t3_1dong0,t1_c9sptgu,t1_c9sforh,null,1431319848,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; An independent Scotland would be seen as a separate state under international law, legal opinion published by UK ministers has said.

I think that much is clear; that would be the purpose of independence.

The report itself says ""The UK’s EU membership would continue automatically. For an independent Scottish state, negotiations would be needed"", which also seems correct. Some of those negotiations would be with the rUK, some with the EU, some with NATO.

However the more important question is that of timing: would those bodies be likely to start those negotiations while Scotland was part of the UK (but committed to leaving), or would they refuse to enter into any discussions until it had left? The latter seems improbable. The link I gave to German re-unification is quite interesting: the attitude was very much that, once it is clear that the process is happening, those involved in making it happen all took a constructive attitude towards it.

&gt; Also, in my search for it, I discovered this which seems to contradict your point about those who were not born/have familial connections to Scotland being given citizenship:

I think there's a difference between being given and applying.

I would expect that every household in Scotland would be written to with information on how their new citizenship would work (or how to opt out if you wished to decline).

I would not expect every household in the UK to receive the same information, although I would not expect there to be any reason why they should not be able to apply for and receive it.

If you're willing to offer citizenship to someone who's never set foot in the UK, simply due to the place of birth of their parents or grandparents, then I think it's very unlikely you would refuse anyone with actual British citizenship.",0,1367739838,null,0,false,0,c9sptn4,t3_1dmdk9,t1_c9sptn4,t1_c9sexpo,null,1431319846,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There's no reason why we can't do this stuff while still being the UK and not becoming independent (unless of course these economic claims are sensationalist but I won't go into that now). And it's not like The rest if the UK is stopping us from revamping our industries. The Scottish government is already subsidising a lot of new industries. There's no reason why we have to be independent to grow them. And if its about oil then we have to realise that will run out one day, maybe in a hundred years time, the oil will run out and Scotland's economic future will be a lot less bright. The main reason I see for becoming independent is that we can decide our own laws, and move towards a more socialist country as Alex Salmond likes to promote. If we became independent we could move towards socialism at a much faster rate. But I also feel a rightish Conservative party could do quite well in Scotland if we were to become independent.

Then there was the double episode - Rebel Flesh/Almost People - which set up the story for A Good Man Goes to War, but in itself wasn't really part of the overall story. Apart from those episodes we had The Doctors Wife, The God Complex, Closing Time, Night Terrors and Curse of the Black Spot (in order of decending awesomeness :P) as stand-alone stories. 

Personally I thought season 6 had a fairly good balance of stand-alone stories and ongoing stories.

Season 7 I've enjoyed, but Moffat's rule of no double episodes has really hurt some of the stories. Hide and Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS in particular should've been double episodes IMO, and each episode has felt a little rushed to me apart from the Xmas special and The Crimson Horror.

true,Grumbillz,null,null,"I think the confidence placed in Ba, Torres and Lukaku is a bit optimistic. As much as I like Torres, he hasn't really played consistently game-changing performances against the top teams. A few good performances here and there, and not too many goals in the actual PL. 

People say we don't have a style that supports an out-and-out striker, just someone who plays a holding role upfront alone and creating chances for our talented midfield to run onto. I think both Ba and Lukaku do this better than Torres. Torres' main problem is: he does not create chances BY HIMSELF out of not much  like Drogba used to, he merely latches onto chances created by others, and scores goals that in truth could have been scored by whoever was playing there at the time, and not only this, but his poor first touch often screws those chances up as well.

What I like about Lukaku is not only his immense strength in being able to play that upfront holding role, but he also has the pace and strength and vision to play in a more traditional striker's position, running onto throughballs, beating a defender and scoring - how many of our goals this season have been like that? Not many.

Ba was in my mind only ever a temporary solution. He's good, but not great. I really think that a club as good as Chelsea should have a striker that can be considered one of the top six strikers in the world. 

I would like us to bring in a proven striker, and have Lukaku challenging for a spot as well / providing a different type of option. What we haven't had, is our amazing midfield creating chances for a world-class striker - if we try this, I'm sure we'll convert some of our near-miss games into victories.

So to answer the question do we have a back-up plan if we don't bring in a top striker?

Clara has been around for a while now and, sadly, I don't care who she is. We know little more now than when we first met her. She is not a particularly interesting companion in comparison to the other post-reboot companions. 

Likewise, we are not getting any hint about the fields of Tranzalore and the Ultimate Question.

Sadly, DW has become more of a slapstick buffoon rather than the ultimate Time Lord. Riding a motorcycle up the Shard (which wasn't using an antigrav motorcycle but one that changes the direction of gravity; having his screwdriver get erect in the last episode; having the TARDIS go to the South Pole and asking for a lift there from the North Pole. This gets old fast.

The Doctor is supposed to make surprising moral choices that require a human companion to mediate. In this last episode, he was going to take the Red Leech back to the Jurassic era where, one assumes, it could start its attempt to kill everything all over again. Seriously? And while we're on the topic of the Red Leech, what sort of symbiotic predator wants to kill 100% of its food source? IF the Red Leech was intelligent enough to design a rocket, why the slapstick killing of it at the end instead of the Doctor making his famous: ""Let me take you somewhere safe in the Universe"" sort of speech? A better ending would have been if it tried to attach to Clara but dies when it does. 

DW is becoming a kiddie show. Next week's show apparently has the Doctor taking the children to the ultimate Disney World that is apparently broken and abandoned. What sort of doofus would put children at risk? Apparently, the Doctor can and will. And, I am guessing that Clara (companion and nanny) won't put up a fuss either. Is she just Mary Poppins?

This claim is clearly wrong, regardless of the merit of your other claims. I said, ""Show me any science that suggests [my claim] is not true"" should not count as a good argument towards establishing the strength of your claim. And it should not. Show me any evidence I have never seen a unicorn!

&gt; I'd dare you to find one study that suggests boys and girls develop similarly if you alter culture/environment

Well, I'm a sucker for a dare, so I went away and found [this](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540259721268#.UYYhOrUp98E) in about 0.27 seconds (according to Google). It makes me think maybe you didn't do a basic google before you 'dared' me to go looking? It's an absolutely lovely piece of research, using a neat qualitative battery to explain some pretty robust regression analysis, and the key finding is on page 290 (don't worry, it's a journal article which 'starts' on page 283), which are the results of a regression analysis comparing educational attainment under two conditions and the tables on page 300 comparing belief in mathematical ability. Boaler finds that in a school which does *not* reinforce the notion that maths is 'too difficult' for girls, there is no statistically significant difference between boys and girls, whereas the difference remains at a school which teaches maths 'traditionally'. The difference in absolute attainment between the two schools is not statistically significant, and - lest you need remaining of the way statistical significance works - arguing that the sample is 'too small to be representative' is pretty silly when the sample can find a significant difference we know exists. Perhaps the innate gender difference you believe exists is too small to be detected at the classroom level, but I expect you to apply the same level of scrutiny to your own sources.

I don't like Boaler very much because she tends to be overprotective of her data, but you could cite [this](https://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/11/researchreport-1988-9-sex-differences-sat-scores.pdf) study that your apparently 'innate' gender differences are diminishing over time, [this](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/tmp/Applications/WomenMath.pdf) study that exposing women to scientific theories makes them better at maths, or [this](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3174058) study that ""social forces shape math aptitude and performance"".

Actually, I'll tell you what, ignore all that and read [this](http://rhig.physics.yale.edu/~nattrass/WomenInPhysicsArticles/ReviewAmericanPsychologistSpelkeDec2005.pdf) critical review. It synthesizes all of the evidence in the field, so you can check for yourself you claim that ""almost every study that has ever set out to prove the cultural impact on early development usually ends up giving evidence to the contrary"". If you want me to save you the bother, you are wrong.

&gt; If you'd like, I'll link you multiple studies that suggest men are born with innate engineering and women are born with innate social skills

That, all by itself, would result in flat and unsatisfying episodes. But the episodes have also been plagued with basic errors of craftsmanship (poor pacing, poor characterization, hamfisted exposition, etc.).

(2) Both meta-arcs have been poorly handled. First, we have the long goodbye of Rory and Amy. They actually had a very beautiful send-off in ""The God Complex"" last season. But then they just repeated that story three or four more times without actually doing anything with it. It didn't get any better from the repetition. (The fact that it occasionally toyed with potentially interesting ideas -- like the Doctor having a family and the Doctor having to stay in linear time for a year -- but then didn't do anything with those ideas just made it worse.)

(This might have been saved if the resolution of ""no, really, this time they're gone and there's no taking it back!"" had made a lick of sense. ""I can never go and talk to you again because at some point in history you die!"" That's not how time travel works. In fact, ""you die at some point in history"" has been true of every single person the Doctor has ever interacted with.)

Second, we have Clara: The mystery it's impossible to care about because they haven't established any reason for us to care about it. ""SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE!"" Okay, sure. But just repeating that over and over again doesn't make it interesting: We cared about the Cracks because they were destroying the universe. We cared about the Silence because they murdered the Doctor. I'm *mildly curious* about Clara.

(3) There's also a lot of dissatisfaction with the number of loose threads that have been dangling in the last two seasons. In both of the previous series I've cut Moffat a lot of slack for stuff that appeared nonsensical on the theory that everything would be revealed as part of the master plan. But in rewatching those series, I've realized that a lot of that nonsense is, in fact, just nonsense. Which mean that when I see nonsense in the current series, I'm no longer cutting Moffat any ""I'm sure it'll make sense eventually"" slack.

""What makes Frisbee Ultimate?"" ""We don't know."" The beginning of my reportage on the games was off to a shaky start as I began to get to the bottom of Ultimate Frisbee. I turned up slightly late to the Women's Ultimate Frisbee and entered a room full of shouting and the squeaking of trainers. I was not expecting it to be such an energetic game, or for it to be so well-attended (though a large number of the attendees were members of student journalism societies). Whilst trying to find out the ins and outs of the game, I got a bit confused as the player with whom I was speaking kept using technical terms such as 'over the head push pass' and 'feinting' but I managed to soldier on. An ultimate frisbee player, is, incidentally, called an 'ultimate frisbee player'. York and Lancaster Women's had a tense game, most of which was stuck in a gridlock of 5-all. However, in the last few minutes, Lancaster managed to score a goal (if goal is the correct term) and therefore won. The squad were very chuffed and said that they were happy to have won. The game was very tense. I had higher hopes for the York Open team as they all seemed slightly more confident, and taller, than the Lancaster lot. However, to cut a long story short, they lost. York started off in the lead but soon they fell. It was like the Somme. But instead of bayonets and guns they had their spirits, trainers and a small plastic disk- which by the way, was very disappointing in a game entitled 'ultimate frisbee'- and instead of dying they just lost 6-5. Ultimate frisbee is unlike any sport you've ever watched. York mixed was a slightly happier game for us. It was tight, as they all were, but York won due to tactics (which is at least what I was told) which included hoarding the frisbee when they were in the lead. Sneaky. We won 6-5 and it was a massive struggle, and again very tense. So at least that's 1/3 in wins for us. It was a very competitive game which involved a lot of running about and throwing things. Yeah, sorry, I never pretended to be knowledgeable about sports, which is probably why I was told to review Ultimate Frisbee and not Rugby.""",0,1367747928,null,0,false,0,c9sqvj4,t3_1dowyr,t1_c9sqvj4,t3_1dowyr,null,1431319350,5,false,UKUltimate,t5_2spct,5

We're one clean sheet behind Man City even though they won several more games than us. 

Reina is the only keeper to win the golden glove and team finish outside the Top 2. He's won it 3 times, 4 if you count the year he drew with Cech on clean sheets. The only reason why he hasn't got it last couple of seasons because we have finished 6th,7th and 8th and have lost a hell of alot of games more than the Top 4 teams. 

If we were in the Top Four for the last 3 seasons, there's no doubt he would've won it.

We should be worried that Barca want him because it will be hard to find a replacement. Also he's not rubbish if one of the best sides in the World want him.

We're talking about Churchcliff beach, Lyme Regis (actually Church beach, they've confused it with Guncliff). This isn't the main beach at Lyme, it's hidden round a corner and only locals really go there:

* It's underneath an old landfill site which pre-dates any legislation on what you could and couldn't dump. Any seepage and leachates run down the cliff from this dump onto the beach.

* The whole area of cliff containing the dump is degrading and the erosion regularly dumps old litter from the 80s and older down onto the beach.

* The old town sewage system released a lot of untreated effluent into the beaches bay and this system is still used as the overflow for the town.

* The sewage overflow from Charmouth (next village along) is bought into this bay due to the local inshore currents.

* An old jetty/ groyne (too old to properly identify) traps lots of old seaweed and other crap against the shore where it decomposes making the whole area smell horrid (and this can have a significant effect on beach scoring).

Extra info - It's really good for finding big fossils in the winter.

Apparently no-one would ever want to swim there anyway, so she's a bit surprised it was ever declared to have safe swimming water.

At a stroke this reduces the theft offences but also the violent crime associated with organised crime groups as this would severely reduce the income available to them. Legalise and licence other drugs and prostitution and what are the gangs then controlling?

The law enforcement savings would be huge and many of these resources could then be put into robust management of licencing and dealing with the Friday and Saturday night alcohol fuelled violence making the streets much safer. 

The prison population would be greatly reduced further cutting costs and freeing up space to house violent offenders. 

Further resources can then be put into education to about drugs and alcohol - in my view this should be dealt with at school in an open and honest manner. This aoproach has helped to cut the number of smokers enormously in a relatively short period.

There's often rubbish there and seaweed grows very easily (something I'm tempted to connect with - but am not certain of - with regards to my next example.

* Worthing in Sussex - the sewage outlet for Littlehampton (some miles to the west along the coast - was built about a mile out to sea and the resulting sewage drift (thanks to the channel) lands it straight on Worthings doorstep. Seaweed grows *very* easily there because there's plenty of nutrition in the water / sand / dirt that gets pushed up onto the shore. 

Not much can be done about Southsea and its marine craft (a big port is a big port, after all) but no attempt has been made at Worthing to help with the problem.

Initially we'll be using the NFC cards, but over time we'll add our debit and credit cards to our phones to use.

I love Moyes and I think long term he is my pick for a manager who will be with us for a while, but I truly feel that we'd benefit from a few years with Jose again, to instill a winning, champion's mindset. Then we'll be primed for a committed man like Moyes to come in.

 - Many firewalls and routers do most of their work in hardware. Hardware that cannot do IPv6. Sometimes you can upgrade them so that IPv6 is handled in software, but that will probably be 10x or more slower.
 - Your ADSL router. There's millions of out there that were built as cheaply as possible and discontinued within 12-18 months of being released. The manufacturer has long dropped support and will never release an IPv6 capable firmware even where it's hypothetically possible. Every one of these will need to be replaced. Where the customer is using an ISP provided router, the ISP is on the hook for shipping out a new one. Expensive. Where the customer is using their own router, they must upgrade at their own expense - on switchover day, expect tns of thousands of support calls swiftly followed by tens of thousands of people leaving you because you're forcing them to buy new hardware.
 - Interoperability. Even with something relatively straightforward, it's common to find that hardware from manufacturer A simply won't play ball with hardware from manufacturer B even though on paper they both support the same standards. This is most likely where the standard is not in common use.
 - Legacy devices other than routers that will likely never get a software upgrade. Printers are one of the most obvious examples. We still need to be able to talk to them.",0,1367758521,null,0,false,0,c9ss4jv,t3_1dofy6,t1_c9ss4jv,t1_c9sddtd,null,1435560700,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,RPage94,null,null,"Howson hasn't been brilliant but he's simply not someone that can play the defensive midfield role. His decline has been one of Hughton's biggest failings this season, under Lambert in a more attacking role last season I thought Howson could overtake Hoolahan as our best attacking midfielder, however he's never really gotten the chance to play there this season, I don't think Howson's poor season can be blamed on him, Hughton has seriously misused him.

In terms of other players, I wouldn't mind if I never saw Holt in a Norwich shirt again, lethargic play, technically and mentally he's no where near the standard a Premier League striker should be playing at. Throwing his weight around, winning the odd free kick or scoring a tap in just isn't enough at this level. Again failing to replace Holt in the summer/ January was a big mistake from Hughton.

Garrido is another player that seems to have regressed as the season has worn on, again Hughton has to take the blame for this. When he came in he looked elegant on the ball, confident going forwards and was as good as any left back we've had defensively. Now he's been restricted when going forwards, looks very uncomfortable in possession and has made quite a few mistakes over the last couple of months. Whittaker should have replaced him outright by now, he's not a natural left back but his few games in the position have overshadowed anything Garrido has done of late.

Bunn simply isn't good enough to be playing 20-30 Premier League games, he's made some pretty costly errors but by the same token he's done as much as he could have done in Ruddy's absence.

I'm a naive user.  I've only had one experience before.  A trial run (£100) figuring how to get Bitcoin using TransferWise and Bitstamp.  It was convoluted (which increases the room for error), but worked with low cost. But, no longer an option.

Anyway .. i had another test run of Bitcoin using SpeedyBitcoin (£50 limit for unverified account).  

The site shows strong signs of coherent, organized thinking.  (Though it could do with some big-button idiot proofing for such as myself.)   The process using SpeedyBitcoin is direct. Money transferred to SpeedyBitcoin is immediately (i assume) used to acquire Bitcoin that is assigned directly (i assume) to the designated address.  Outside the transaction money/Bitcoin does not lounge around in remote accounts/wallets (i assume).

At the point in time when i transfered money from my bank to SpeedyBitcoin, MtGox spot price was £71.55549

Maybe you are right, maybe I am - or we are - now used to the greater story arcs since Series 5, and I can honestly say I think Series 5 was the best series in my opinion so far, but first it's still the same headwriter and yes, of course I now have standards/expectations of Moffat's series that he barely reached until now.

I don't think the biggest problem with this series is the missing storyline itself (because, like you said, older series like 1 or 3 were also without many clues), but that this series always ""waves"" in your face with this storyline it think it has and hasn't. When I think about series 3, it was a really good season, with awesome adventures (most of the time), but I neaver really asked me while I watched for a ""great story-arc"" because there was no need to. The series might have hinted something, but not in the same way as now - not waving in the first episode ""WOHOO LOOK STORY-ARC THERE!!! LOOK AT THIS! DISCUSS ABOUT IT!! THINK ABOUT IT!!! IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE WHOLE SERIES!!"" and then let you standing there alone in the rain, waiting for something that won't probably come. And I think this is what series 7 is.

But like I said, I still like Doctor Who. I still like what it does. I even like the (imho) bad episodes, and I will always love the good episodes. Just because I think they way the story is told this series is more or less not good writing/planning, I don't think I should stop now and start watching something else (which probably would let me feel very unsatisfied, because like I said, I even like the bad Doctor Who episodes, and I don't think there will be any series which will ever manage this.).",0,1367761487,null,0,false,0,c9ssm39,t3_1dpazg,t1_c9ssm39,t1_c9sq9ge,null,1431318531,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

If the new standards cover how safe it is outside of water quality her thinking was that it may be more to do with the nasty currents that can happen of the edge of the rock ledge out to sea making it a bit hairy for swimmers in certain conditions.

true,polostring,null,null,"I think Everton's success today was due to two things:

**Winning battles in midfield**  and **taking Enrique and Johnson out of the game**

I think a lot of people are going to say Johnson and Enrique played really poorly today, but I think Everton's strategy going into the match was to take these two out of the game.

Liverpool like to play with Enrique and Johnson basically as wing backs; they have free range to play down the wing and join the attack.  This has led to a lot of Liverpool's goals and scoring chances.  The wing-backs speed up counter attacks by allowing another player to get forward; they add an extra man--who usually comes from an unusual position--into attacks; and it forces the opposing defense to constantly adjust how they defend (they have to play differently against he fleet of foot Coutinho than against the bull-like Enrique).

Today Everton really was able to take both these players out of their game.  I think it was strategy more than the two of them just having a bad day.  Everton was winning a lot of battles in midfield and constantly forcing the backs to defend.  On the flip side whenever Liverpool tried to build of from the back Everton was really quick to close down on Johnson and Enrique and force Liverpool to play up the middle.  Almost every time Johnson and Enrique tried to join the play, they were quickly closed down upon and forced off the attack.

Edit: I thought it was particularly telling how many double-teams Johnson and Enrique drew.  They were constantly surrounded by several blue shirts.  In contrast, when LFC tried to hold-up play, Everton gave people like Sturridge/Coutinho/Downing a bit more space and time.  More 1v1 defending up top.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think Enrique and Johnson played well today--I just think Everton worked really hard to make sure they couldn't get into the match.",0,1367763977,null,0,1367764680,0,c9st46a,t3_1dqcxu,t1_c9st46a,t3_1dqcxu,null,1431318224,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

2:15 - When the man faints at the sight of Vastra (and the fainting itself being a running gag in the episode is painful)

3:52 - As Strax is talking about storming the building, he is portrayed as a fool.

16:45 - As the doctor heals himself and emerges from some shower thing.  Also, Matt Smith has to bounce around like a hero of hyperactive children everywhere.  

22:40 - More buffoonery soundtrack reminding us it's now time to laugh at Strax because he said ""Horse you have failed me"".  

And on and on and on and on

It's not that I don't like the Doctor's or Clara's theme.  But the underlying musical track is just too heavy handed.   It's as bad as the laugh track in The Big Bang Theory; is the musical equivalent of the laugh track telling they audience when they should be laughing or when they should be scared.  

Now go watch an episode of Game of Thrones.  They don't play the buffoon bassoon every time the fat guy is on the screen, or some type of happy girl pixie music whenever Arya Stark is on screen.  Most scenes don't have any underlying soundtrack, and when they do it's usually pretty subtle and not some major orchestral arrangement that is impossible to un-hear.  In fact the best scenes are the one that have the subtle SF/X in the background, like the chirping of crickets when a hushed conversation at night, or the marching of soldiers in the background.

But to the original point.  Compared Dr. Who to Lost, Battlestar Gallactica, or Game of Thrones.  It is very very clear Dr. Who is not targeted to the same maturity demographic as the other three.

Now Chelsea dont need to beat Spurs to clinche 3rd for themselves since they now only need 6 points from a potential 9 to get 3rd. They will probably be looking at their games against Villa and Everton as wins (neither team has much to play for). So Spurs will be the hungrier side since we will NEED the win on Wednesday night!

Also cos Chelsea now only need 2 wins they might rest players on Wednesday in light of their Villa game on Saturday (their 3rd game in a week and surely easier pickings than Spurs and Basel!)

But Chelsea are everything that is wrong with football these days. Oil money, plastic fans, overpaid, cheating, irritating players... They won the CL playing the worst football imaginable and certainly house the nastiest, most anti-Semitic fanbase we play against in England. They started this new trend of bringing in a corrupt oil baron to bankroll synthetic, vacuous success and with that they have developed the most pathetically entitled fanbase conceivable. 

Every season we play them and we get fucked over. It's never the other way around. Karma *never* bites them in the arse. And then all of our Chelsea supporting friends act like pricks, refusing to admit that the ball didn't go over the line, that he was miles offside... And the worst thing is, even when we beat them I'm not happy. It just feels like we've finally rebalanced the justice-deficit by a fraction.

The thing is, I hate Arsenal, and I love that. The North London Derby is the greatest sporting fixture in the world because of that intense, mutual hatred. But Chelsea? They could get relegated and dissolve as a club and I wouldn't care. If anything, it'd piss me off because we'd never get retribution.

He very nicely put it that its crucial for a GK to be able to communicate w/ all the players. And being a senior member of the team it becomes very important. Mostly all speak english ( tactical prep. ) but in game its a spur of the moment. So they keep simple terms like pass, stay, move etc etc to keep it simple.

Anyways Cech said he speaks most of the languages, 

Czech, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese for sure. 

He can speak Italian, Russian and Serbian football terms to communicate with specific players.

She'll be applying for the [SET(M)](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/partners-families/citizens-settled/spouse-cp/) visa. The requirements of this is that one of you currently holds a job that makes at least £18,600/year. So if you have a job that makes that much, then that's fine. If you have a job that makes £17,000/year and she manages to get one that makes £10,000/year, then that's fine because it's combined to over the required amount. However, if you only make, say, £18,000/yr, you'll need to have £1,200 in your bank account. This is because any amount lower than the required amount has to be made up by savings in your bank, but doubled whatever the missing amount is.

This visa lasts for 33 months if she applies from outside of the UK, or 30 months if applying from inside. When you're towards the end of this period, you apply for further leave to remain (FLR). FLR lasts for another 30 months, which when finished would bring your wife's period of time spent in the UK to 5 years. At this point she can either apply for settlement (ILR) or citizenship. Either of them would let her stay in the UK forever, but for citizenship she can not have been out of the country for more than 270 days in the preceding 3 years before you apply and no more than 90 days in those final 12 months before you apply.

Take the ones we want and keep out the ones we don't. Simple. That is what UKIP propose in the long term. The 5 year freeze is just to control the flow and allow time for legislation to pass.

You are correct that I want out of the EU. I completely agree with UKIP on getting out. /u/wobblewagon explained incredibly well and far more articulately than I ever could how and why it is the right decision, and how it won't fuck over our economy and whatever else those opposed to it say, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/1doath/if_cameron_announced_a_binding_inout_eu/c9s8h37).

Education is a big thing I also agree with them on, this is directly from their manifesto:

&gt; Build more grammar schools, reinstate the student grant and educational reinstate the student grant and educational
maintenance allowance, encourage vocational apprenticeships, 

I am a grammar school student. I firmly believe that the tripartite system is the best educational system possible in a country with limited state-intervention. If we were in a country more similar to China, I'd advocate complete streaming from an early age - where children are aptitude tested at a young age and streamed into particular careers from there (of course semi-regular checks to ensure they are still on course would be required, but that's a different debate). I went to a state school initially, but transferred to the grammar school, and I can tell you, I wish I had started at the grammar school. I don't think I can really describe how different the atmosphere is. It's incredible how different student's attitudes are to work. I used to get made fun of for getting As, at the grammar school I get made fun of for getting Bs in any tests. 

Democracy: I don't really know much about their policies on this but having read their manifesto, I agree with this:

&gt; Introduce local referenda on major planning decisions, such as out of town or large scale supermarket developments, wind turbines, incinerators, solar farms, major housing developments and transport schemes like HS2.

There is more too, but I don't want to bore you. If you have specific areas you're curious on, I'll be happy to comment.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Just saw this, on my phone so it's quite difficult to read every post so hopefully I'm posting *something* new...

First off, and I don't mean to pry, feel free to keep it to yourself, but it would probably help to know why you got kicked out of Manchester Uni. The universities you apply to may well contact Manchester and ask about you anyway, so best to be honest from the beginning.

I looked into applying to the US ""colleges"" very seriously over the last few months, but my parents refused to fund me (mainly due to my insane health insurance predictions because of a heart condition...*sigh*.) So hopefully I can provide some kind of insight...

I would assume just as there is in the UK, there are all ages at university. Obviously the majority will be 18/19, but I would also expect that there may be a few late starters as well as ""mature"" students. 

Your A levels sound fine, but honestly, the US colleges don't really give a fuck about them. You'd probably be better off with AAA but they honestly put *a lot* more emphasis on your SAT/ACT scores and application. They look a lot at what clubs/societies/teams you participated in and if you did any volunteering etc. It's not nearly as academic as the UK system. The system over the pond seems to be far more about having well-rounded students who will be successful for the school not just academically, but also creatively or sportingly or whatever else. So, if you just sat in secondary school for 7 hours a day, got As &amp; Bs and then went home, you've lowered your chances a lot. If, on the other hand, you were captain of the football team, in the rugby team, did debating, volunteered at an old people's home and was a senior prefect, then you've probably heightened your chances a fair bit.

So yeah, you'll have to take the SAT or ACT. It's really down to you which one you want to do. Look them up, do a few practice/mock papers and see which one suits you better. Both are really pretty simple (in my opinion, and I'm only in year 12), it's just the time pressures that make them ""hard"", but if you do a bit of practice and get the timing sorted you'll be fine. A lot of it is GCSE-standard, maybe AS-level for the hardest questions, at most, because the US system is always 1-2 years behind us academically (they start school later than us). If you get a very good mark on the SAT/ACT, you'll probably get into most schools regardless of your A levels, but again, you'll also need a lot of extra-curricula. 

From what I found, you have to fill the ""Common Application Form"" - I'm on my phone so can't link to it, sorry - and then you send it off individually to each university. There are admin charges for each university that vary between about $40 and $60. But yes, you can apply to as many as you want.

The expense is your biggest hurdle (which I think you realise). People do really underestimate how much this will cost them. There's the tuition (anywhere from maybe $5k/year - $50k/year, although this is often means tested to see how much you can afford, and there's sports/academic/performing arts bursaries available), health insurance ($1k+ assuming you have no health issues), living costs, rent, flights...it does add up. If you're going to a top uni you could be looking at close to $70k/year (assuming you're paying full tuition). 

There's loans available for US students I believe, and if they're in a state school in their home state, it's free. But for us? Not much, really. I think the 2 ways I found was either get a shit ton of bursaries/scholarships/sponsorships, or get a loan signed by a US citizen - a normal loan from a bank though - not a reduced-rate government-to-student loan. I have family over there who could've signed the loan for me, but the loan would've put me into debt well into my 40s, so I decided against it.

Erm, I'm not sure what other people have said so I'll stop here. Any more questions just ask. I may not have gone through with it, but as I said, I did research it a lot and was dead set on Harvard until my parents said I couldn't go.

Sorry, I should give a more in depth answer. Absolutely no fucking way.

1) Economics is not zero sum. Virtually all those quangos do a job which would either need to be brought back into Whitehall or out sourced or the legal proceedings that it was designed to avoid will have to be handled at cost.

2) Even if we could get rid of the and it cost nothing, the government only spent [£38.4 billion on them last year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quango#United_Kingdom) and the deficit in the UK budget is [£121 billion.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt) You do the maths.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yea but remember that the original BSG was targeted to kids and the rebooted version wasn't. 

The first couple of seasons of DW were good, but it's really gone down hill.  Moffat's story arcs very rarely make sense and he opens up questions but fails to answer them.  And the direction he takes them in are always retarded.  

Take the most recent instance where Rory and Amy leave the show.  It's some technobabble bullshit that made no sense about him not being able to visit them ever because they are time locked or some bullshit.  MOFFAT SHOULD HAVE KILLED THEM OFF.  People die on that show all the time, they should have done a death that really hit the audience hard to show how much death really sucks.  

And everything is always fixed by the sonic screwdriver.  Never because the writer can write a clever solution that the audience hadn't thought of.  It's a children's show, fine.  But then try to teach children something.  Why not actually include real science.  Ugh, I don't even consider DW to be science-fiction anymore.  It's just pure childish gibberish fantasy.

Oh but they do try to teach children some things.  For instance, nobody on the show likes any alcohol I've noticed, but everyone loves gay people (and almost half the people they meet seem to be gay).  The not-so-subtle morality slapping me in the face without even a hint of an opposing viewpoint is painful. 

And all the while it's got that musical laugh-track that's levelled at twice the volume of the speech.

I'll watch the final two episodes.  I have hope for Gaiman's episode (but the two kids is a terrible terrible sign), and with the title of ""the name of the doctor"" i expect some more stupid direction towards DW mythology that I've come to really hate in the new series.

I've seen probably 7 or 8 stories from the 1st Doctor, one each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors, which has 2, 3, 5, old stock footage of 4 since he didn't want to return, and a recast 1.  If I had to choose one favorite, it's probably 2.  He's a lot like 11, my first and favorite overall.  Troughton is just a load of fun.  Hartnell's pretty great as the 1st, but he's just so completely different from the others that I hesitate to rank him with them.  Pertwee as the 3rd hasn't really gotten me in the little I've seen of him; he comes across as a bit too serious and not very nice.  Plus, the idea of a Doctor knowing and regularly using martial arts (his Venusian aikido) is more than a little jarring.

I finally saw The Pyramids of Mars with the 4th and Sarah Jane, and I really enjoyed it.  I was hesitant towards the 4th Doctor, as he is held in such high esteem by fans of the classic show.  I didn't want him to end up underwhelming me after all that, but he was great there.  I intend to seek out more with him for sure.

I only saw 5 in the Five Doctors episode, but I really liked him as well and want to explore his run now too.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Arsenal will always be Enemy #1. I sincerely can't stand Spurs losing to them more than any other team on Earth. Their fans are also cocky, insufferable and gutless, especially for a team that's not all that successful besides top-4 finishing. But this more of a product of a historic rivalry––hating Arsenal is a part of Spurs fans' identity. 

However, since Arsenal and Tottenham have similar wage structures and strategies for building a squad, I can give them a begrudging respect. Spurs and Arsenal, rivalries aside, try to develop young talent and don't get the big money transfers like certain other teams we all know. Chelsea, however, were just some shit team that found a sugar daddy. There's nothing inherently wrong with spending money if you've got it––I'm sure we'd be happy for Spurs' ownership spending more in the transfer market––but Chelsea and their fans have been so shameless about it that it's really hard not to see them as nothing but the EPL version of spoiled rich kids with advantages and resources others can only dream of. And their fans don't seem to realize this––if not for Roman, Chelsea would be just some team from london with 1 league title and 3 FA cups in 100 years––nothing special. And, of course, John Terry is a horrorshow and any attempt to suggest otherwise involves an absurd amount of mental gymnastics and denial. Footballers aren't supposed to be perfect role models all the time, but christ alive has John Terry been a piece of shit human being or what?

So, because of tradition, Arsenal are the worst IMO. But if i take a step back, Chelsea seem more repugnant and arrogant when you consider their philosophy abt how to win.

If you want some cash too, they also have an exchange rate comparison tool.

I don't have any pity for the fact that a band of shit-chucking apes could come up with a more sensible wage structure than Arsenal's. 

And furthermore, as much as I hate RvP, he should've stayed at Arsenal. As a result of the trade, Man U ran roughshod on the league. City didn't stand a chance, with or without Kün. The dipshits in their front office precluded the title race from happening, which is unforgivable as a fan from any Premier League club other than United. 

Then there is the issue of how they spent their £70 million. Cazorla. great. Giroud and Poldolski. not even close. They picked up two slightly above average strikers on the wrong side of 25 when they could've been gunning for youth or Higuain/Jovetic/a proper player.

Hell yeah. oh that's good. fuck yeah. don't stop.

If I've understood it correctly something like that.

Generally it should be a ""feedback"" issue but not all rapes are the same.  I think most victims have some sort of relationship with the abuser or at least know there attacker. This can lead to people add masses  of social baggage that makes it more difficult to assert yourself in that sort of situation.  He's also a powerful man in a position of authority which people may be used to obeying.  Some victims freeze and just tolerate it perhaps they're just confused, perhaps they thinking have given enough of the sign and there's nothing they can do, perhaps they're afraid they might make it worse, perhaps they don't know how to assert themselves in that situation, perhaps they blame themselves for what happened ( Oh I must have come across like I lead him on etc etc ).  It's all very depressing.  

If this guy is guilty then it's most likely the bullying or taking drunken advantage sort in my opinion as opposed to outright physical fight type.

Which is kind of frustrating since she is also a BAMF in her own right. Although she does gain a lot of respect eventually, by showing just because she's a woman doesn't mean she's not a good soldier... it then gives way to a love story. As soon as she goes back to ""being a woman"" love becomes the top priority.

You have no idea how old I am, nor where I live.  For what it's worth, I'm well aware of Lockerbie.

&gt;""""Largest"" is not a badge to band about as your own personal philosophical stance.""

Not very clear on what you mean.  In the context of what was being discussed it is clear that we were talking about Islamic/IRA terrorist attacks.  Regardless, I noted that I was talking about 'modern' attacks.  Granted, this word is open to interpretation, but bringing up the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan rather pushes the definition to its limits.

Re your last paragraph - you suggest that because we have prevented a lot of attacks recently this somehow makes recent terrorist attacks less relevant with regard to the word 'largest'.  This word is entirely relative, so if we lived in a utopia a large attack would encomass the death of, say, two people.

I've no interest in getting into an argument with you, and you clearly care about the various atrocities that have happened across the globe, but in future you might want to have a wee think about not debating like an arse.

the anti semitic comment came from a supporter not a official

the disable comment resulted in immediate ban on the member. 

the gay marriage article explicitly states that they were pro marriage equality just anti the current legislation as it they believed it would force churches to carry out marriages that went against their beliefs and hence be unworkable or atleast divisive.

now lets look at the other parties

The lib dems have sexual harrasment from prominent officials and corrupt members lying to police. 

Tories have tax avoiding donators

The labour prime minister was employing his brother and have had a wealth of donation sleaze.

AND they were ALL involved in the expenses scandal.

No smoke without fire?

They are a new party stretched for members so obviously a few bad ones are going to get in but I think UKIP deserves to be listened to without prejudice from the start as does every other party.

The main question I ask myself is 'is it worth me working x hours of overtime to own it?'  That makes me act sensibly quite a lot.

Remember many offers aint so great if you have to borrow to buy them, cos you're going to pay 30% apr on top of the sale price.

Also, if you can put your ego aside, you can save a lot of money shopping in Lidl/Iceland etc, and then going to the usual supermarket to fill in the gaps.

My original comment was basically to call out a guy who /might/ be making a inappropriate comment to a /possibly/maybe/ underage girl. Assuming things makes an ass out of you and me but better safe than sorry so eh. Just wanted to clear that up. Wasn't meaning to be a full on ass to /u/manicmangoes, but I feel like my comment was justifiable. Just wanted to throw that out there. 

Moving on...

In all honesty I am a huge Doctor Who fan that line would at least make me laugh if nothing else, andd yeah it probably would have started a conversation between me and said pickup line giver-person-guy-thing. However, I still would also be much more socially involved in a conversation with someone who gracefully commented on my dress and struck up conversation that way. An example: ""Wow awesome Tardis dress, it looks great on you! Did you make that yourself?"" Not only are you complimenting her dress and appearance, you are opening conversation about her skills/talents and a topic (such as Doctor Who) that she obviously is very passionate about. Now unless the girl is shy/doesn't want to talk or just some all around stuck up snob, you are at least gonna get a few minutes worth of conversation. 

To wrap this up, yeah usually if you treat women with respect you will get something back. This doesn't mean you're gonna get laid, no, but you will get a nice conversation with someone. Laughing and bonding over mutual interest. You might never see that girl again either and she might never remember your name or what y'all talked about, but I can guarantee she is gonna remember the nice guy from _____ that took the time to compliment her. She is going to remember how she felt if nothing else. Take pride in knowing you made her laugh/smile/whatever. And you know what, you might actually see her again, she might give you her number, etc. Heck one of her friends might be watching and start talking to you instead! So to summarize: respect goes along way. And if a girl doesn't respond back to your respect why would you want anything to do with her anyway?

What I would like to see is the panel show format properly introduced in the US. I think something like mock the week would do fairly well; it could be pretty popular with the Stewart/Colbert fans, I think. After the format gets a foothold here, then we can talk about selling something like QI. At that point you already have a viewership who are fans of the format and what would likely be some the recurring guests between shows which gives you your hook, just like how many of us here started watching other panel shows due to our love of QI.

All of that being said, I still think QI itself should stay on the BBC. I don't think an American studio could do it justice. I just want some panel shows over here, dammit.

Not by itself no.

**The Crimson Horror:** Nice banter, rather cheesy towards the end. Not a particularly strong episode, but not bad. I hope the kids don't ruin a cybermen episode. 

**Journey To The Centre Of The Tardis:** Fun and exciting, This was better than some of the other episodes. Although it was wibbly wobbly and never actually happened. 

**Hide:** Ghosts/monsters aren't so bad after all. One of the better episodes this season, is actually kinda creepy.  

**Cold War:** It was Ok. Decent, but formulaic. Not much to this one, kinda standard. 

**The Rings Of Akhaten:** One good emotional scene. The rest is cringe worthy. Also who cares about a stupid leaf? not me.

**The Bells Of Saint John:** I thought it was a nice reintroduction of clara, It was interesting and fun. Made me think about how there would be some sort of great intelligence cropping up more often. I kinda was disappointed by one or two of the special effects though.

**The Snowmen:** Some fun scenes, nice villain. Other parts about the doctor are a bit over played.   

**The Angels Take Manhattan:** Good episode, nice drama. Some parts a bit over the top, statue of liberty could have been done better. least creepy angles episode thus far.

**The power of three:** One good heart to heart chat between The doctor and Amy, the rest is terrible and boring.

**A town called mercy:** great episode, good characters good effects good ending. One of the best episodes in the season. though all aliens are just humans with tattoos.

**Dinosaurs on a spaceship:** despite discouraging reviews I found this episode to be better than expected. It had fun adventurous bits, and a slightly darker doctor towards the end.

**Asylum of the daleks:** Very strong episode with good effects and story. nice introduction of Clara. Overall it excited me.

true,MrLime93,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"To give you an idea of just how lucky you are I'll tell you about my past 3 years with multiple ISP's all using BT phone lines and cabling.

My current setup is 1.3down and 0.2up. It's been like this ever since I moved in to my current house. In late 2009 I was told that BT would be upgrading my line to fibre optic by early january 2010. This did not happen. I waited several more months until their rollout map was published. The official map said that I would have it on the 31st of December 2011. 16 months passed and I was ready for fibre optic. 1st of January 2012 and... No fibre optic. It had been pushed back further to the 31st of December 2012. On the 2nd of january 2013 once I'd cleared my head from all the new years celebrations I awoke to find that it been pushed back to the 31st of July 2013. My internet speed is outright pathetic and it's an example of just how far behind the UK is when it comes to modern communication systems. BT need to answer for this. 

I am absolutely infuriated with BT. They have a monopoly on the broadband market and it's pathetic that people are willing to put up with it.
Changing ISP won't help as all of my local ISP's rent the line from BT. This is what happens when you don't allow healthy competition in a market. The end user suffers. If other broadband providers were allowed to install the cabling it's very likely that a huge portion of the UK would have FTTC or FTTP broadband at a reasonably cheap price because of competition in the market but unfortunately that's not the case and nobody is willing to do anything about it.",0,1367801380,null,0,false,0,c9t4hj4,t3_1dr2jb,t1_c9t4hj4,t3_1dr2jb,null,1431312854,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

For someone who's only seen the current revival of Who, going back and watching the classic episodes would be akin to having only seen J.J. Abrams take on Star Trek or The Next Generation and then going back to watch the original series.  A lot less money went into the production of classic Who and the original Star Trek, so there's a lot of cardboard sets, amorphous aliens, and in many cases more emphasis in telling the stories with dialog than visually.  

My 9 and 6 year olds tried watching the Three Doctors with me recently and were confused and bored by a lot of it, a lot to do with the differences in what they are used to seeing in modern television compared to classic television.  The few things that stuck with them are when the electric guy (Omega) makes the yellow car (Betsy) disappear and the soldier guys shooting at the blob guys - visual/action stuff.  The really don't remember any of the story and the dialog didn't spark my bookworm of a 9 year old's imagination the way it did mine in my childhood.

All in all, there are a lot of great stories and a lot of background to current Who in classic Who.

His comment exists by itself.  It is not an example of misogyny.  At worst its an example of a (pretty darn mild) inappropriate sexist comment.

The fact that ""the internet"" can be pretty hostile towards women in many cases (which I don't deny, and nor do I support) doesn't magically make *his* comment into something more than it is on its own.

&gt;If the internet doesn't like the word, maybe they should stop saying misogynist things? ... Imma just sayin'.

If the word is used when it applies (such as your characterization of how women are treated online in many cases), not as a heavy handed over-reaction to a mild double entendre, you won't hear a peep from me.

Checking out Amazon reviews of the DVDs (the DVDs are released by story arc, not season) might give you a sense of whether that particular storyline is worth a go.  Here are my recommendations:

The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1st Doctor) - the best dalek storyline

The Time Meddler (1st Doctor) - one of the first early forays into ""comedy"" stories

The Mind Robber (2nd Doctor) - the only complete surviving 2nd Doc story worth watching at all

Doctor Who and the Silurians (3rd Doctor) - long, but pretty good

The Green Death (3rd Doctor) - Pertwee's era got really into Leftist politics by this point - the villain is a corporation destroying the environment (with help from aliens)

The Ark in Space (4th Doctor) - a very early 4th Doctor story, serious and dark; makes a strong contrast with the later, goofier 4th Doc stories

The Robots of Death (4th Doctor) - a good episode with the awesome Leela companion

The City of Death (4th Doctor) - a later, goofier, 4th Doc episode edited and re-written by Douglas Adams

The Caves of Androzani (5th Doctor) - this is a weird one if you haven't seen much of the fifth doctor, but it's also 
sadly his best

Terror of the Vervoids (6th Doctor) - um...the sixth doctor had a tumultuous run, and after watching this you might understand why

Ghost Light (7th Doctor) - incomprehensible but fun! The seventh doctor had some really weird storylines.

I don't agree about the Sontaran taking down Gillyflower. A man should be able to take down a woman without it being a reflection on gender. Though I do acknowledge that in a society where men rule (especially in that time period), it can have unforeseen connotations. I think this one is perhaps reading too deep.

But I definitely agree that forcing a woman into a kiss is not okay. It is technically sexual assault. People think that sexual assault is when a boogey man jumps out of the bushes and violently rapes a woman. But sexual assault is any unwanted sexual advance. And this definitely counts. If that happened to me in real life? I would immediately feel sexually and spatially violated, I would feel unsafe, and alarmed. I would not want to be around any man who thought it was okay to just grab me, pull me off balance like that, and kiss me. Maybe people don't understand this feeling, but most women are physically incapable of defending them self against a man (as men are usually stronger than women, especially in the upper body). That means we're always vulnerable in ways most men aren't.

And this is rape culture. More specifically, this is entitlement. When a man thinks he is entitled to just grab people when he feels like it and engage in sexual activity.

Now I don't think this means the Doctor is suddenly a bad person. No, I don't think this is a reflection of the Doctor at all. I think this is a reflection of our culture and how writers write tv shows. I have been concerned at the increasing number of slaps and spontaneous kisses. Though to be fair, most of these slaps aren't for comedic effect (but could be construed that way if one wanted to) except for the one in this episode.

If you will bear with me and allow this controversial (yet I believe, true) statement, when Amy Pond comes onto the Doctor at the end of *The Beast Below*, she is also technically sexually assaulting the Doctor.

Imagine a man was trying to hint to a girl he liked that he liked her. He wants to hook up with her. So the two of them are talking and he tries to imply that he is attracted to her, but she's not picking up on the social cues. He then, while talking, pushes her up against a wall and starts to take her clothes off. She is obviously unwilling and tries to put her clothes back on.

That sounds like a rape unfolding right there. And it's exactly what Amy does to the Doctor. Now granted, it's a little different as Amy Pond probably does not have the physical strength to force the Doctor, but that doesn't make it okay.

Do I think that makes Amy a terrible person? Nope, I blame the writers. **edit** no, scratch that. enough with the blaming of writers. I blame rape culture.

**Edit**: And you know what else? I'm now pissed that I have been downvoted. Not only that, but these people are apparently too lazy to rise up to the challenge and actually write a response as to why they disagree with me and my post (which I have put careful thought into).

&gt;Really? Your attempt to substitue my actual communicated (and explained) opinion with one that better fits your worldview and assumptions about me leaves me doubting there's much point to discussing this.

I meant that a lot of people claim that the term ""misogyny"" is overused because they believe that it doesn't happen as much as it's claimed, rather than actually bothering to honestly assess whether what is happening is misogyny or not.

The terms not overused; it's just that subtle or passive misogyny just happens *a lot*.

&gt;I am not *the internet*

I worded it like that because you did originally in your comment:

&gt;**The internet in general needs to lose its love affair with that word.**

People on the internet get all tied in knots and divided over terms like ""misogyny"", ""patriarchy"", ""feminism"", ""misandry"" and ""men's rights"". In my opinion, these debates are kind of stupid, because it sort of implies that there are organised 'groups', rather than just people with opinions, and people get hung up on attacking other people by labelling them as ignorant or wrong, when they should be attacking the ideas themselves.

&gt;His comment exists by itself. It is not an example of misogyny. At worst its an example of a (pretty darn mild) inappropriate sexist comment.

 I disagree on the point that inappropriate sexist comments aimed at women are *different* to examples of misogyny.

Misogyny doesn't need to be explicit to be called misogyny... It just needs to be treating women as something *other*, something inferior, something weaker, something not-as-valid-as, or something of a more specified *purpose* or *roll* than everybody else.

For example, if a woman gets angry, it is an example of a misogynist sentiment to comment ""She was probably on her period"". (i.e. female emotions are less valid).

""Tits or GTFO"" (i.e. your body is going to be inherently viewed as sexual regardless of setting)

A comment can be misogyny, even if the author didn't mean it as such, because 9 times out of 10, they obviously didn't *mean* to be sexist... They just were. Just like people can *accidentally* or *passively* be homophobic, heterosexist or racist.

&gt;If the word is used when it applies (such as your characterization of how women are treated online in many cases), not as a heavy handed over-reaction to a mild double entendre, you won't hear a peep from me.

Hm, I've heard this sentiment many times on the internet, and to me it is fairly bizarre. All I think it does is add some sort of taboo over using the word. If something is misogyny, I think we should call it that... even if the author didn't *mean* to be sexist, and even if the author *isn't* themselves misogynist.

Jokes can be sexist, internet comments can be sexist, *anyone* can be sexist, even you or me. But we don't always realise it.

Calling a comment an example of subtle misogyny is **NOT** a personal attack or an attempt to start a fight. ... If that's what it is, that's what it is.

It helped to keep them both on the same sort of rough edge - pining for someone they couldn't have.

true,ljuki,sontaran,Sontaran,"We can't say whether it's lacking yet, not with any degree of accuracy - there are still too many unknowns. Character and plot development in Clara's tenure is much subtler than Moffat' usual, sensational in-your-face, 'adore me, I'm brilliant' type of characters, a-la River Song, Hitler-slapping Rory or mini-skirt wearing hottness that was Amy. This time it all goes in in the details and you have to pay attention. Like how the Doctor had been subtly harsher and more reserved towards Clara than the other companions up until Journey To the Center of the Tardis, when he realized she was just a girl. Remember how she'd tell him she was scared and not happy in the haunted house and he barely batted an eyelash? Now remember how he was with Rose or Amy - whenever they would say something like that it was always ""No, don't worry, I'm here, I'll never let anything happen..."" and such. 

It's in the details, mannerisms and woven into the dialogue. Even with the music - Clara's theme played for the first time (after her introduction episode this season, that is) in the Crimson Horror, when the Doctor found her again, indicating that he was actually glad to see her for HER, and not because he thought he'd lost his mystery. 

I for one really love this kind of development. It moves the characters along while also not focusing on them TOO much and letting us enjoy the monster of the week episodes (which has been nearly every episode this season, by the way, and people used to complain we didn't get enough of them).

And that's all I have to say 'bout that.

I'd guess most American TV execs believe that they have no chance of getting the maximum audience for the UK versions so they try to do their own pathetic (for the most part) versions which don't attract anyone. 

Our public television (versus television financed by advertising) has been showing popular Britcoms for years, and many successful UK dramas have been very popular such as *Upstairs, Downstairs, Pennies From Heaven, The Singing Detective, The Jewel in the Crown, I, Claudius, Prime Suspect, Jeeves and Wooster* and most recently the enormously successful *Downton Abbey*.

But I feel *QI* cannot be copied. If something happened to Stephen Fry I don't see the program continuing successfully without him, and America simply does not have his intellectual/comedic equal to do its own version. There's a Yank called Dick Cavett who in his day might have made an interesting go of it, but his day was in the 1970s.

But it would need to feature significantly better writing than the last two episodes they've appeared in. Vastra, for example, is a ""Great Detective"" that has yet to actually be *shown* doing any detecting. Classic case of telling instead of showing.

A show that actually showed Vastra being a clever detective? And that dealt meaningfully with both her existence as a lizard-person and a lesbian in Victorian London (instead of just treating it as a shock-based punchline that can be repeated over and over again until it's no longer funny)?

There's a really interesting potential there for a show which is basically Sherlock Holmes + a female version of Oscar Wilde + zany steampunk adventures.

In other words, there's no political ground to be gained from helping heroin addicts, and much to be lost, and because the positive effects for the general public aren't completely direct and immediate (in the way arresting an addict and locking them away is), there's no emotional satisfaction for the voting public either.

His tenure as showrunner has been very disappointing: Wildly inconsistent quality in the scripts. Meta-arcs that have been poorly handled. And a real tendency to repeat himself: Oh look, it's another enigmatic figure in a spacesuit. Oh look, it's another sight-based bad guy. Oh look, the Doctor is faking his own incapacitation to fool the Silence into thinking he's harmless (again). Oh look, the series 6 finale is the exact same story as the series 5 finale (only it didn't make any sense this time).

And series 7 is, frankly speaking, *bad*.

(1) The scripts are terrible. The gorilla in the room are the stories that violate their own rules or are solved by deus ex machina (or both). That, all by itself, would result in flat and unsatisfying episodes. But the episodes have also been plagued with basic errors of craftsmanship (poor pacing, poor characterization, hamfisted exposition, etc.).

(2) Both meta-arcs have been poorly handled. First, we have the long goodbye of Rory and Amy. They actually had a very beautiful send-off in ""The God Complex"" last season. But then they just repeated that story three or four more times without actually doing anything with it. It didn't get any better from the repetition. (The fact that it occasionally toyed with potentially interesting ideas -- like the Doctor having a family and the Doctor having to stay in linear time for a year -- but then didn't do anything with those ideas just made it worse.)

(This might have been saved if the resolution of ""no, really, this time they're gone and there's no taking it back!"" had made a lick of sense. ""I can never go and talk to you again because at some point in history you die!"" That's not how time travel works. In fact, ""you die at some point in history"" has been true of every single person the Doctor has ever interacted with.)

Second, we have Clara: The mystery it's impossible to care about because they haven't established any reason for us to care about it. ""SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE!"" Okay, sure. But just repeating that over and over again doesn't make it interesting: We cared about the Cracks because they were destroying the universe. We cared about the Silence because they murdered the Doctor. I'm mildly curious about Clara.

(3) There's also a lot of dissatisfaction with the number of loose threads that have been dangling in the last two seasons. In both of the previous series I've cut Moffat a lot of slack for stuff that appeared nonsensical on the theory that everything would be revealed as part of the master plan. But in rewatching those series, I've realized that a lot of that nonsense is, in fact, just nonsense. Which mean that when I see nonsense in the current series, I'm no longer cutting Moffat any ""I'm sure it'll make sense eventually"" slack.

In fact, if it wasn't for a Neil Gaiman-penned script next week I suspect I would be done with Doctor Who at the moment. ""The Crimson Horror"" was the absolute worst episode of nuWho. In fact, it would fairly highly on the list of the worst episodes of television I have ever watched.

I personally love the banter between Jenny and Vastra. I think the idea of them being like a pre-Torchwood team that solves mysteries in Victorian London is splendid. Plus the inter-spieces lesbian relationship thing really fits with the recurring theme in the show (where we see that neither of those things are a big deal in the future/alien cultures). I like their chemistry, premise, and setting. And Strax is a humorous side character as well. I think [this short](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xylsfe_the-battle-of-demons-run-two-days-later_shortfilms#.UYdG8-BrqpE) shows that all three together is a great combination.

There's no way we should be starting him. I think we should focus on all our healing powers and send them to Dembele, he's the one we're going to be relying on if he's around.

If he's not around - it should be Holtby in there with Parker. Yes, against Chelsea - Parker is a better fit than Huddlestone guys.

Also, I think this is a game where Dempsey should be left on the bench and Defoe + Ade should be starting together. Ade can hold off the likes of Cahill and Luiz while Defoe will 100% draw cards from the likes of Luiz and Ramires. 

The line-up that would work:

Lloris

BAE

Vertonghen

Dawson

Walker


Parker

Dembele (Holtby if Dembele's not fit)


Bale

Lennon

Defoe

Ade

That would work.

What he couldn't do is go back to before he became involved in what was happening in 1974, the year he and Clara arrived at the mansion, and free the time traveler from the pocket dimension since that would negate the whole sequence of events that led up to him landing there in the first place.

What I'm saying is, the TARDIS can't be used to prevent them from becoming part of events, since that would mean they were never involved in those events and so they wouldn't go back in time to stop themselves from becoming part of said events.

But that being said I've loved Chelsea since I started watching. Weather we're winning trophies or having one of our now famous November meltdowns, I turn on the early morning live stream and cheer my ass off for the club I love. And the Texas fans I know in general are the same. I can't speak for the fans everywhere. I think every club has their less dedicate supporters. I know Man United ""fans"" who can't give me their most current scores and NEVER wake up for the early morning matches. But i'm positive there are fans that sure as hell do. Calling us all plastic depending on when we got on board is ridiculous. As an American fan we aren't all so privileged to be at the matches every year and to have grown up around it. We kind of have to pick a team that gets coverage(though it's getting better all the time with decent quality live streams) often who our friends support, or who has a good following in our given city. It drives me crazy how hated we are by everyone as a fan base. But I think it makes the victories that much sweeter. Some say we have no history. To that I argue that it's great to be alive whilst my club is making history every year. I'm also noting that at least in Dallas I don't know any supporters of any other club that are as dedicated as myself and some of the Chelsea lot I know. Most of these fans wake up at noon and watch the highlights, don't know when or if their club is winning in Europe, and can't really ever tell you who played the most recent matches or who won. So what, I like Chelsea. No, I love Chelsea. I don't feel obligated to apologize because we have some shit fans somewhere and we have money. And believe me friend, we see more than our fair share of shit officiating. This subreddit shows more disrespect to other fans and clubs than any fan base i've ever seen. It's football.

- Buy a new striker. It's painfully clear Borini isn't Champions League material, and the jury's still out on Sturridge. We need a player like Soldado, Chicorito, or God forbid, a Bent. An uncomplicated player who's there for one thing; putting the ball in the net. Bentekkers would be fabulous.
- Runners from midfield. I don't like Henderson playing out left. He's a box to box midfielder, and he's shown he's great at making those runs from deep.

But, I don't like him as a showrunner. Someone else needs to take the reigns and make sure the show stays on track, not silly plotlines not copypasted characters. Moffat works best with someone telling him what to do, like RTD or Mark Gatiss with his work on *Sherlock*. 

Out of Moffat's series's, Series 5 is my favourite. 6 was horrible, and 7 has so far been just 'meh' with glimmers of brilliance in *Hide* and *The Crimson Horror*.

Someone else should run the show. Personally, I was very excited to hear rumours of RTD coming back. But we'll have to see.

true,hamlet9000,mcgann,McGann,"&gt; I don't think series 7 has been as bad as series 6 was

I would actually rank every single episode of series 7 to date as being mediocre or worse. (And many of them have been much worse.)

By contrast, in series 6, I enjoyed: ""The Impossible Astronaut""/""Day of the Moon"", ""The Doctor's Wife"", ""A Good Man Goes to War"", ""Let's Kill Hitler"", ""The Girl Who Waited"", and ""Closing Time"". (I also liked ""The Rebel Flesh"", but the second part fell apart.)

I think the only legitimately *great* episode of the season was ""The Doctor's Wife"", but nothing has come even legitimately close to that in series 7.

Hmm... Now I'm curious.

If I go back to series 5 the good-or-better episodes would be: ""The Eleventh Hour"", ""The Time of Angels""/""Flesh and Stone"", ""Amy's Choice"", ""Vincent and the Doctor"", ""The Lodger"", and ""The Pandorica Opens""/""The Big Bang"".

I would rank both ""The Eleventh Hour"" and ""Vincent and the Doctor"" as being legitimately *great* episodes. (I might also include ""The Time of Angels"" and ""The Big Bang"", but not the other half of either.)

So:

* Series 7 = 0/13 (0 great episodes)
* Series 6 = 7/14 (1 great episode)
* Series 5 = 8/13 (2-4 great episodes)

Wow. That is not a good trend line there.

true,AFarewellToScott,null,null,"The Positives:

-He brought us Matt Smith, who can make even the weakest scripts glimmer with his wonderful performance.

-His standalone episodes in the RTD era were all very good, so at the time the idea of him being showrunner was very appealing.

-Big ideas. For better or worse, he's put a lot of huge ideas onscreen. Even in some of his 'eh' episodes like Asylum of the Daleks have some really cool insights into those characters (Daleks have a concept of beauty, etc etc).

-The Eleventh Hour is simply a wonderful piece of television. 

-All of his invented villains so far have been rather well received and are pretty clever. There's a reason 'Blink' freaks the shit out of people. That being said, the Angels can go away now, they've become a little tired. 

- The series took a big step forward in terms of visual look and general production design since he took over. That being said, series 7b looks really muddy to me for some reason.

-He's written a lot of LGBT characters into the show. Go tolerance!  

-He brought on Neil Gaiman. Good stuff.

The Negatives:

-He's really bad at writing female characters.

- His sexual/sexist jokes get really out of hand. Seriously, dial it back a bit. Cheekiness is fine, but he clearly tries too hard.

-He's said himself he's no good at the science aspect of science fiction, so he tends to treat Doctor Who's universal logic/physics a little fast and loose. It's largely not too big of a deal, but stuff like 'The Wedding of River Song' just makes absolutely zero sense and leave you scratching your head

-He's severed a lot of ties from RTD's run, and on some levels that's healthy, but one often gets the feeling he wants nothing to do with the RTD stuff. Hopefully this gets rectified in the 50th anniversary.

They've been friends for longer than we've seen on tv and it might be appropriate for them in their obviously playful and caring relationship. The slap is obviously for comic value and if we were to guess at Jenny's intentions it could have been ""don't do that spontaneously without asking"" or it could have been ""I'm a married woman"" or it could have been ""pull yourself together there's more important things to be doing"". I agree that Diana Rigg's death did jar somewhat with the tone of the show I'd have rather that the leech sent her mad, enfeebled or something (making more parallels with Thatcher).

I asked my missus what she thinks, she votes for a bit of fun not rape culture. The Doctor acts most violently against Solomon in dinosaurs on a spaceship, a man who threatens sexual assault. I'm sure there are other examples of the doctor fighting rape culture and for women generally.

If this was a stranger then I'd agree it could be interpreted as sexual assault. But as it is I think it's more just a playful use of dramatic tropes &amp; shorthand. The show goes some way to showing Jenny as powerful and able to look after herself. She's no Bond girl getting snuck up on in the shower.

Career politicians have no idea what real life is like, they have never had to live in the real world and think they can some how relate to it and what needs to happen. But the reality is they are all rich and come from the same small class of people who aren't being hit by any of these cuts in any noticeable way and never will be.  The 80s made some people think greed was the only thing to live for, the people who grew up in that mentality are now the ones in power. They are psychopaths of the highest degree, and because enough people bought into the mentality of ""greed is good, win at all costs"" we let them take over everything. So we have soulless politicians only concerned with how much they can get out of it and soulless companies handing them money to twist the world in their favour, so they can make even more profit.

It bloody well annoys me it does. I don't expect the world to be perfect, but I expect a bloody lot better than one right wing twat running the media to the point where no one with any power will do anything out of fear for him barking at them.",0,1367832984,null,0,false,0,c9tcbsp,t3_1ds6ao,t1_c9tcbsp,t1_c9tc8c6,null,1431287288,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I did my expedition in 1998. No one had mobile phones let alone GPS, Google Maps etc. Hahaha we had badly photocopied maps and a compass then sent out into the wilderness.

true,jubbergun,null,null,"The problem is that the characters start off as a clever idea, but quickly become unrealistic, even for a sci-fi fantasy that already requires a great deal of the ol' willing suspension of disbelief.

Imagine what would happen to a lone non-human in today's society then crank that up to 11 for the Victorian era.  Passing unnoticed would be a primary concern for such a being.  Suggestions that Strax is some sort of foreigner that is not commonly encountered or Madame Vastra has a skin disease should be embraced.  The smug satisfaction Vastra demonstrates in the second prequel clip alone would not have been accepted in Victorian society, and God knows what might have happened upon the announcement that not only are she and Strax not human, but that she's a lesbian as the cherry on the top.  In a prudish, devout, xenophobic culture not being human would likely be a death sentence if you were found out.  They'd be locked in cages and put on display at best, or lynched as servants of the devil at worst, and with the homosexuality tossed in Jenny would probably hang or burn alongside the other two.

And that's leaving aside the gender issues, since it's doubtful that Scotland Yard would retain the services of a woman during this time for anything other than cleaning.

Another thing I found bothersome about the idea of a Silurian in Victorian London was the temperature.  Aren't they cold blooded (I infer this from the *Cold Blood* episode, since #1: the title of the episode implies it if it doesn't firmly state it, and #2: Eldane negotiates for use of ""places humans can't inhabit,"" which based on the map present are deserts)?  How is Vastra walking about in London during Christmas?

Aside from the trio seeming to be an obnoxious indulgence of Moffat's Sherlock Holmes obsession, they're basically a collection of unnecessary anachronisms that exist solely to impose modern morals/ethics/philosophy on the past with a melodramatic degree of you-go-girl-ism or lesbian pride or whatever-the-hell-you-care-to-call-it.  It's bad writing because it doesn't allow circumstance to show who the characters are.  The characters should be reacting in a believable way to the circumstances in which they find themselves, but in the case of the Vastra ~~Gang~~ (why do I feel like this is a Scooby Doo reference, and why can't we have an investigative team anymore without some Scooby Doo reference?) Team the rules that should be in play are bent or ignored to allow the characters to behave in any fashion the writers desire.

And how much funnier, more poignant, and longer lasting would the inter-species lesbian romance angle be if it were subtly hinted at and not bluntly beaten over your head like a mallet?  How long could that have dragged out before there was any confirmation at all?  Less is more, leave some mystery for God's sake.  You have nowhere to go with that particular subplot once it's out in the open.  The only real questions remaining are the kind you can't really answer on a show that kids watch.

The whole bit is borderline-juvenile, prurient bilge with a wee bit of politically-correct evangelizing thrown in to make it even less palatable.  I'd like to be surprised that so many people are going ga-ga over these characters, but I'm not.  I'm going to hate myself for being condescendingly purist, but I think this is just a symptom of the way the new series is handled.  I like that the show is reaching out and building the fan base the way it has by having some pretty boys in the key role and adding some romance so that the ladies take more than a side-long glance (and I think we can all admit that the show really took off when the ladies started swooning over Tennant), but I don't like when that outreach morphs into bungled story-telling that is so obviously patronizing.

Okay, so you're using a headline as the basis for your argument? You realise to back up a point of view you need actual evidence, right?

&gt; It's not really that big of a conclusion when nothing has been confirmed or denied in concern to the use of these places

If you had done any research past reading a headline you would realise how that simply isn't true. Places like this have been used in Britain, across Europe, in North and South America and in Eurasia. With varying levels of regulation and success. I have posted this evidence for you.

&gt;And there are hardcore pot addicts, surely they might be allowed to use the rooms as well, otherwise people would complain that only heroin, cocaine could use the place when there are other drug addicts not allow to use them as their conditions is not deemed bad enough.

Actually, if you read some of the evidence I posted you would see that this kind of treatment is very successful for hard drug addicts, and not successful for cannabis addicts. It's a different drug and a different form of addiction; they require different treatment.

This is the problem with people, they reach a conclusion *before* they do any research or find any evidence. I agree this is not a perfect fix-all for the situation, there never will be. And there are always flaws with any drug treatment policy, but if you're not going to back up any of the flaws you've mentioned with any evidence then why should I take your points seriously?

It is also worth noting that work patterns have changed and that modern offices are a lot more efficient to rent than older buildings.

Finally, the main reason why so much construction is going on right now in London is that an awful lot of 25-year leases are coming up for renewal at the moment, and that's a lot of office tenants considering upgrading their office space.

Modern western gay rights as we know it now dates back to the Stonewall Riots in 1969, when, tired of being raided constantly, the LGBT patrons came out swinging (trans people were first, by the way, as the start was NYC police checking the genitals of patrons to see if they were consistent with the gender they presented as). Up until then the main forms of gay rights were groups like the Mattachine Society who preferred to be 'respectable'. You probably haven't heard of them, and there's a reason for that. 

Pride parades are so outrageous because it is still necessary to challenge conformism and the expectation that everyone should behave ""normally"". This is especially true in the case of trans people and people who are not gender-normative, as those expectations remain very strong. It runs alongside other forms of activism and conveyance of political message. Pride parade is only partly about a message. It's also for LGBT people themselves - that their lives and freedom is not about conveying a political message at all.

I appreciate what you mean, and LGBT pride parades can be afflicted by many of the problems that otherwise afflict parades (noise levels, traffic disruption, etc). But a lot of people who complain about pride are, whether wittingly or unwittingly, propagating the view that we'd all be better off if we just behaved 'normally', or that we'd convince more people, or whatever.

Learn the dialect before the accent. If someone says nah'mean bruv? If you can reply with 'yeah man!' rather than 'what?' you're on your way.

The next step is to actually use the dialect, so say 'off licence' (or offy if you are brave) rather than 'convenience store', pub rather than bar and so on. These will mark you as an immigrant rather than a tourist.

The final tip I would give is to be able to use the accent when putting on an accent. When describing the chavs on the bus, you might reviel how they were all like 'innit bruv! I's got bare choon on my iphone y'get me?'.

First, you spat out the usual, American Women's Studies pseudoscience term 'rape culture'. This term is an assault on men, it's used to shame our achievements and place guilt on men who have never harmed a woman or anyone else.

Then you said Amy kissing the Doctor is only 'technically' sexual assault. No, sorry, it is or it isn't. She did the exact same thing the Doctor did to Jenny. If you want to call one sexual assault then you must apply that term to both. But then, Amy gets a free pass here, doesn't she? The woman who can do no wrong. 

It's highly frustrating to see people complain about this episode in this context. Look at the way men are portrayed in this episode.

Jenny beats up three of them. Strax is portrayed as an idiot. The Doctor misses the chimney and has to have it explained to him by Clara Sue. And then there's the guy who keeps fainting. 

Yet, after all of that, people complain about Strax shooting a woman who was trying to wipe out the human race? 

This is the point where I forget about trying to have an intelligent conversation with people. You won't get many people discussing this with you properly because using terms like rape culture causes people to switch off. People who believe that's a thing that exists are not worth talking to.

This isn't the first time this season that this show has stooped this low. ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" gave us a new exemplar of the term 'straw misogynist' and then there's Clara Sue being portrayed as smarter than the Doctor in every single episode she has appeared in so far.

It's a real shame because Doctor Who was the last show on TV with a male lead I would encourage boys to watch.

I agree that the site does have good coverage of a wide variety of sports but I'd like to see more active promotion of them from the site for a couple of reasons.

Firstly because I think it's good for kids to be interested in more than one sport to increase their chances of staying fit and healthy.

Secondly because we're doing well in a number of sports outside of football and I think we should take time to celebrate that, and not just every 4 years when the Olympics rolls around!

I'm not suggesting a massive re-vamp of the site, or for other sports to have the same amount of coverage as football but I do think they could make one small change that could have a positive impact on other sports.

At the moment, the main story on the BBC Sport site is static, and I think a good way of keeping football at the forefront while promoting other sports would be to make it dynamic. So for example, you log into the site and the Man Utd report is on there, and the box says 1/3, and a few seconds later cycles to a link to the snooker final, then to the cycling, then back to the football. This is what they do on the nfl.com website and I think it works well.

People might say it won't make a difference because the content is already there on the site somewhere but I think there's an important psychological effect to be considered. If people see that there are 2 other stories coming up, I think they're likely to wait and see what they're about before deciding whether or not to follow the link. Now for the majority of people I would assume they still aren't interested and won't click on them. But there could be some people on the fence about a sport or who just want to read about British success in whatever capacity who do follow the link, thereby increasing exposure of those sports.",0,1367842529,null,0,false,0,c9tdjps,t3_1dr84l,t1_c9tdjps,t3_1dr84l,null,1431286712,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

This is show is supposed to be about the Doctor, not some sassy northern woman. Previous companions were terrible enough but she's got to be the worst.

I know the BBC likes to think it's progressive and everything but having a show with a male lead who is actually good at things is not a bad thing. 

I also know that most successful TV in 2013 is all about how hard done by women are in INSERT SITUATION HERE, but again it was nice having one show about a genuinely good man who doesn't solve his problems by killing people. If I wanted to watch a show with a supposedly 'cool' male lead who's just really a scumbag designed to make the women look good I'd watch Sky Atlantic any night of the week.

Now, if you're a man in Doctor Who you just exist to make the women look good.
