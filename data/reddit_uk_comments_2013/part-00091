Barbara Hewson's proposals would however damage the rule of law, and would mainly benefit abusers:

&gt;As for law reform, now regrettably necessary, my recommendations are: remove complainant anonymity; introduce a strict statute of limitations for criminal prosecutions and civil actions; and reduce the age of consent to 13.

Complainant anonymity is an important right which we should not be prepared to sacrifice. The idea that serious crime can be swept under the carpet after a set number of years is absurd. The age of consent is fine where it is now, because people gain an understanding of consequences at different rates.

The real problem for those accused of sexual abuse is that the shit sticks even if they are found to be innocent. This is especially a problem if they have previously worked with children. For example what primary school would take the risk of employing a teacher who had been accused of abuse?

I don't think that those accused of abuse should be given anonymity, but there might be a place for some serious reporting restrictions unless they are found guilty.

""He's perfect for EPL. He's an excellent striker but what always impressed me is that he has almost unlimited stamina, I think he would be great in the role where Dirk Kuyt played.""

""He has a lot of skill, don't be put off by his injuries. Most Roma fans were upset that he was sold, but we were appeased by buying Destro who has similar upside. He's on the national team radar already and Prandelli knows youth talent, that's his thing. He's not a superstar but you'll be pleasantly surprised next year and beyond."" Me: ""What's his ceiling?"" ""His ceiling is probably a top ten in the league scorer, or more or less 15 goals a year. He's not flashy, he puts himself in position to score and finishes, so I don't think he will be frustrating to watch but he may disappear at times.""

""As long as he does well, I am happy for him, he has had a rough time with injuries and what not.""

""Personally I hated selling Borini, I much prefer him to Destro.

The kid has soo much heart, and it seemed like no matter what, even if he got only 10 mins on the pitch, he was able to get himself involved. Whereas other young players like Bojan/Lamela (last year) would get 30 mins and be non-factors.
Plus his goal celebration is wicked, may you see if many times in the future!

In short, the last player I felt this sad about losing was Cassano, and Roma has lost some really great players, Menez, Chivu, Mexes, Vucinic, Aquilani etc...""

""I liked him. At first I was a bit annoyed with how they bought him and almost immediately sold him to bring in Destro. But, he is definitely a good player that never stops running, and apparently did pretty well while playing for Chelsea (mainly their reserves) and Swansea.""

Anyway, I'll try out a theory I have on you. It's accepted now that the 70s were a different time, age limits were less adhered to, and lots of famous people were well known to have slept with young girls, Jimmy Page and Bill Wyman spring to mind, but it seems like everyone famous was at it then.

But we aren't hearing about any complaints about them. The people we *are* hearing about are people who had complaints made about them at the time which were ignored, and complainants who, 40 years later, still feel bad about what happened.

So I would suggest that while lots of underage sex went on then, it was mostly consensual by both parties, and the young people involved don't feel like they have anything to complain about. The reason we're hearing about Savile, Hall and others is because they were not having happy, consensual, but slightly illegal sex, it's because they were abusers, predators and rapists.

Their actions weren't just a result of the morals of the time, they were doing deeply unpleasant stuff which should have been taken seriously at the time. They were no different to rapists we have now. Trying to handwave it all of as a part of the era is ignoring this and trying to diminish their actions.

That's an almost impossible question. Despite the role of the companion being mostly limited to cute, young females who will flirt with the Doctor in nuWho, the possibilities for the companion role are almost endless.

For example, dynamics I would currently find very interesting right now:

- The Doctor with a young child
- The Doctor and River traveling as man and wife
- Those previous two items in combination
- Someone with legitimate technical expertise (who is allowed to use that expertise)
- Someone considerably older than the Doctor
- An alien

And depending on which of those you chose to explore, the list of actors/actresses would be very different.

So if I had to pick one specific person, I would say: Georgia Moffett playing Jenny.

Young girls who had consentual sex - even if it was coerced, persuaded and the like - in other words it wasn't physically forced, but it was most likely an abuse of trust... 

Have they over the years gravitated towards a position which is dependent on their view of the celebrity.

Let's say, for example, that Mick Jagger while smashed met a 14 year old fan, and groped her without consent. She was petrified at meeting her idol but didn't in any way encourage him but was too timid to do much more than faintly say no and freeze up while he put his hands all over her. 

Later in life this grain of sand turns into a pearl - she's still a Stones fan and the story she tells is that Jagger was so drunk he didn't know what he was doing, but she was so shy she froze up. 

What if it's someone like Saville instead, and someone that she grows up to see as a fool, someone who garners no respect or credibility. Does that grain of sand become an infection? When she reads that something very similar happened to someone else does she then re-evaluate what happened to her and find it was much darker than she had imagined?

Obviously I am speaking hypothetically, I've picked Mick Jagger because he's still around and highly thought of (I'll see him in July in Hyde Park!), and Saville because he was a creepy old man who nobody would see as a sex symbol. It also seems likely that Saville toured youth detention centres and abused children in Jersey among other places and that doesn't seem to lend any credibility that what he was doing was an abuse of trust but not physically forced.

That would make for a pretty crappy detective novel.

It really depends on what you're into though.  Going to sporting events, probably not the greatest city for it.  I think the Bristol City FC is currently last.  For me, that was unfortunate, but minor.  If you want to play, like any university, there is a wide variety of intramural sports to choose from.

If you're more into vintage clothes, shops are literally all over the place.  Nightlife, you can't walk two minutes without passing a pub, and there's any number of clubs around Park St. (right by UoB) and Harbourside (on the river).  It's also a scenic city, with the river, Avon Gorge, the Cathedral, etc.  If you get bored, London is always a couple hours away.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We've got *good* players but very few exceptional ones. Coutinho, Suarez and Gerrard probably the only three that could be considered ""world class."" That being said, not every Champions League side is made up of world class players. The fact that we won the Champions League in 04 is proof of that. 

When you compare the squads of City, United and Chelsea with ours it's easy to see why we are where we are. Having said that I firmly believe on our day our starting 11 is capable of beating anyone in the league.

The main reason to be hopeful is our youth development. We can't compete financially with the others but we can instil a playing philosophy that will hopefully breed success when those players eventually make the first team. We've officially got one of the top five Academies in Europe. Alongside famous ones like Barcelona, Ajax, Dortmund and AC Milan. Players like Wisdom, Kelly, Ibe, Sterling, Suso, Sinclair, McLaughlin, Texeira, Adorjan all look the real deal.

The key is Champions League. It's not just the extra money it brings in, it's the ability to attract the highest quality players. Champions League really is the be all and end all. 

Do I think we can achieve Champions League? Definitely. Brendan will have a whole preseason with his players. They're all used to what's expected of them. I'm sure you all saw the stats last month. If the league had started in December we would have been third. That's *proof* of progress.

With the amount of money and resources available to a few of the top clubs (namely United, City &amp; Chelsea), I would imagine that success would shift between them season after season. The era of one club dominating is over.

Our goal should be to get amongst them, but in a sustainable fashion. This requires grassroots development, which is already in place. I'd hope that over the next few seasons we'll see players coming through to add to our squad, with our commercial success providing the financial backing to buy the odd player where needed. Continuity is key to this, which is why Rodgers should be given the time and backing to fully develop the squad.

This is what's worked for United. Admittedly they've had the advantage of greater funds in the PL era, due to their savvy commercial development, but we should hopefully be able to compete with them in time.

true,XisanXbeforeitsakiss,eng-essex,Essex,"it is only my opinion as an ex smoker for a year and a half who likes to think of themselves as pretty savvy with their application of common sense.

its a malicious attack by anti smoking campaigners on cigarette manufacturers. that is all it is. i guess they just cant be happy with banning smoking indoors, banning smoking outside unless it is in the designated area (work places), massive tax raises, health warnings on the box (50% of the box design anyway) etc. raising the ban hammer and making smoking ilegal isnt a measure the uk will ever take up. criminalising smoking cigarettes is more trouble than its worth and is the flood gate for making more criminal things like binge drinking, obesity or whatever next health trend there is.

the difference between cigarette brands is the same difference between vegemite and marmite. different package design and different flavour. you wont be buying marmite over vegemite because marmite has a different box.

theres no such thing as an expert on tobacco products unless they work in the industry and anyone in the industry will tell you the reason why they make sales is not because their product looks better it is because their product tastes and smokes better for the user.

the thing about plain packaging is that if it is introduced, the affect it has is not measurable. so if anyone is an expert on the subject it is the long term smokers and ex-smokers that you should be asking, they are the ones that will tell you how and what for.

imagine if all supermarkets were given the same treatment. asda, tesco, sainsburys, co-op and morrisons had plain store names of white background with standard font and size text. how would that influence your decision to shop at tesco or sainsburys? i imagine that it wouldnt, the same way that plain cigarette packaging wont affect consumers either.

In my experience, this is a matter of upbringing. Most people I know who don't give little pecks on the cheeks when they meet ladyfriends came from a household where there was/were parent(s) who considered this ""too sexually loaded"".

I've gotten in to situations where I meet up with a friend, I give her a peck on the cheek when we meet up and someone freaks out, saying you can't just do that with a ""regular"" friend, only your girlfriend/wife.

To which the 2 girls in question with whom this happened made a reply along the lines of ""you're the only one having a problem with this"".

I believe in both cases it were guys saying it was inappropriate. And upon closer questioning, they were raised that way: to believe you may only kiss your girlfriend/wife and your own mother/grandmother. And nobody else, ever.



As for The Doctor, his unbridled enthusiasm at his rescue is perfectly understandable and the kiss is mischievous at most.

You say:
&gt;I don't think the Doctor and Jenny are at the same level of friendship. 

It seems like you're projecting your own moral values and experiences on to other people, whom have in fact their own sets of values, different, perhaps opposite, from yours.

The concept that, because someone is male, any touchy-feely thing they do must somehow be sexual, is insulting and degrading.

What I do find on Reddit is that you try to make one point and people assume it's your entire argument and attack you for it - thank you for not.

I very much enjoy Devil's Advocate positions. 

Taking my last idea forward I suspect in the purely hypothetical situation, if it was to somehow emerge that Mick Jagger was to lose favour in the public's eye, he was to have turned out to do nasty things I expect people would come forward, and it would cause more to come forward. Again that perhaps plays into the date rape cliche where the morning after the girl decides she's embarrassed she got drunk and slept with the ugly guy so she cries rape. I'm no longer in my teens or twenties and it wasn't a problem when I was, so I'm probably too distant from it to make a judgement if it's a real issue or just a paranoid fear.

I have just clicked on something that does annoy me - ""friendzone"" that's where guys pander to a girl who doesn't find them attractive and get rather annoyed when their pandering friendship doesn't eventually buy them sex. I have seen that on reddit a few times, I wonder if that's one of the things you mean.

Here is the essential part of the OP:

&gt;We're a team that has fallen in recent years, lost out on Europe and isn't performing to our expectations of just a few years ago. The only team I can think of would be Inter, who currently sit at 8th in Serie A.

* Liverpool last won the league in 1990. That was 23 years ago. 

* This is not about when Liverpool last won the league.

* This is about Liverpool, formerly a ""Top 4"" side, becoming slightly less than a top four side. 

* Comparisons to Villa / Leeds / Blackburn / Newcastle are completely irrelevant to that. They haven't experienced anything of the sort recently, if ever.

* There is literally no way you can make any connection between the question and these teams. They are completely irrelevant. Not a single one has been in the top 4 of england in the past 10 years. None of them are comparable to Liverpool. So basically, you're confused as to what we're talking about. It's NOT that fall from grace. It's the smaller, more recent one.

* The 'fall from grace' that you and this original responding poster were referencing is the 'fall from grace' represented by zero league titles since 1990. Even in that regard, none of those teams are comparable to Liverpool.

So what I originally said was that none of those clubs are relevant at all. You confusedly arguing that the reference to these clubs is some sort of way to say ""No, we cannot be compared to anyone"" is bizarre. The first dude thought of some teams that won the English league decades ago and now are below Liverpool, then decided he couldn't think of any other relevant teams. Basically, he didn't have an answer, and you haven't a clue what you're on about.

We had two strikers who we would expect to be dependable, but I have always felt our midfield has been weak, and that is something that Levy hasn't necessarily addressed.  Once we lose Dembele, we don't have someone we can really count on to play the same style.  It's the same as when Modric was injured last season really; once he was out, we went into a lull and that is where the season slowly ended with hopes of Champions League fading away.  Granted I think Levy has done a fantastic job with his spending, but we know that Tom Carroll/Huddlestone can't truly fill in for Dembele and that Parker is a very different player from Sandro.

true,Metallicar,null,null,"Since the Premier League started there have been 13 teams that made it into the top four (I know European entry changed throughout this period, it's merely for arguments sake).

Of those teams, 4 have reached double figures for number of top four finishes. Man United (20), Arsenal (17), Liverpool (12) and Chelsea (11). The rest include Villa (2) Blackburn (3), Newcastle (5) and Leeds (3). With Newcastle being the 5th most consistent top 4 finisher.

So the teams that we can really compare Liverpool to are Chelsea and Arsenal, to an extent. They have been in the top 4 a similar number of times. However, the problem arises that neither Arsenal or Chelsea have had a period of time where they have been out of the champions league similar to Liverpool. They are still in their prime. So we cannot compare Liverpool fighting back to the top 4 with Arsenal or Chelsea, because they haven't needed to do that.

So we look at Newcastle, Blackburn, Leeds and Villa. (The 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th best ranked teams for top 4 finishes in the Premier League era). Again, whilst they did have some success in reaching the top 4, they weren't consistent enough and were rarely top 10 contenders, nevermind top 4. So they cannot be compared to Liverpool either.

Read his comment again, he says this. We are unique. You can't compare us to Leeds, Newcastle etc. And you can't compare us to Arsenal or Chelsea. We are the first of the double figure teams to drop out and struggle to get back. There is no example to follow in England and there is no comparison to our situation. We are the first.

&gt; There have been plenty of teams that have fallen away. Leeds, Villa, Blackburn, Newcastle. But none of them have had the success we've had. We're truly unique as up until a few years ago we were the most successful English club in history and now we struggle to make sixth place. That doesn't happen regularly.

true,MrBobaFett,null,null,"&gt;There are different variations of Silurian

No that's costume designers justification for changing the design which is backwards. Design changes need to be driven by story or plot. There is no good reason given to suggest that a single species would have that divergent of a variation in it's anatomy. It was driven by they thought the Silurians looked silly. Again the people running the show hate an awful lot of the source work, which is infuriating.

&gt;What's wrong with any of those?

Ice Warriors are huge bulky strong dudes. Not skinny lizards, seriously this is going into George Lucas Greedo Shot First Territory, stop fucking with the source material. Why make the floor glass? That as a designer is the question you have to answer first, especially when there is existing source material. There needs to be a reason besides, ""well now we can just green screen it."" Because that's how Lucas has been destorying Star Wars. Because we can isn't a valid justification for design changes. Why did the old design not work? If it did work, then why change it? Peristance of design is a good thing, maintainging continuity is a good thing.
We seen several TARDIS control rooms and none of them before were giant cathedrals with glass floors. 

&gt;There's nothing wrong with introducing new designs.

There absolutly is if the designs aren't well justified. Matt Smith's costume design is new, I don't have a problem with that. The new Cyber-Man design is well done and pretty well justified. The new Dalek design from ""Dalek"" was good, the new fat Dalek design from the end of ""Victory of the Daleks"" is terrible, it's just terrible and ugly design tho the justification might have been good.

2) I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that not only was Scott Parker the worst player on the pitch today, he put in the worst performance I've seen from any Spurs player this season. He was responsible for both Chelsea goals, lagged back on defense all match (which is supposed to be his specialty), and was literally less than useless in attack. I'm pretty sure Chelsea's defensive strategy all match was to let Parker get the ball. When he wasn't turning back towards our goal, he was giving it to Chelsea players. I said it the other day and I'll say it again, if Sandro never gets hurt, we have CL locked up by now.

3) I think Mike Dean did a decent job at managing the match today, except for anything having to do with Bale. I feel like he just decided before the game that Bale wasn't gonna earn any fouls. There had to be like 3 or 4 times where Bale just got clobbered with nothing coming.

Two examples:

* Elizabeth II became queen on 6th February 1952, her coronation was nearly 18 months later (2nd June 1953)

true,milpool90,null,null,"Things are a lot different at school. I'm 22, so I left school 6 years ago and I hope things have changed since then, but I did receive a lot of stick for being gay. 

Fortunately I was well liked at school, so I had a great group of friends who would stick up for me whenever anybody made any comments or said anything negative about me, plus I didn't really give a shit what randomers thought because my friends didn't care, but there was still an issue with people making remarks etc. about my sexuality. 

Since I've left school, my sexuality hasn't really been a problem - although I do tend to socialise in a very liberal, gay-friendly part of the UK so I think it helps massively. However I've returned to my home town (the heart of middle England) with partners before, and you still get funny looks and stares when walking down the street. I also don't particularly 'look' gay, so ironically I've had people start conversations with me about how being gay is wrong.

I have noticed in recent games the selfishness that was talked about before he came. He tends to go for the incredible rather then the intelligent. Whether it be a simple back pass to a teammate or a flick to a lad with a better position in the box, Sturridge needs to smarten up.

What this does is widen that to people who have a tendency to repeat short-term stays in prison. Over a decade, a petty criminal could easily spend 2-3 years in prisons/custody, and would if sentenced to that as a single lump sum already be subject to post-release monitoring.

The vast bulk of reoffending rates take place amongst short-term prisoners. Long term prisoners rarely commit a crime once released as their crime was usually a one-off event of some particular significance (murder etc).

What is needed is something to deal with the reoffending rates of habitual criminals who are basically ignored by the current system that just locks them up for a few weeks then dumps them back outside the prison afterwards.

I have concerns about how effective and well funded the programme would be, but the underlying principle of putting more money into dealing with petty criminals -- who make up the bulk of crime -- sounds like a very good one.

At last, a policy aimed at reducing crime rates, not just locking people up.

For me it was always more about personal qualities, rather than ""rigged"" systems. If a person is willing to learn - current free education is more than enough for your day-to-day activities. Especially in the UK. 

Dangerously simplifying things once again, the whole capitalism is based on a concept of a public contract. If you (due to lack of education, common sense, cultural context or other factors) don't have that crucial skill of ""don't get into a contract you don't understand 100%"" - you are pretty much fucked. 

Currently, you can still sidestep the consequences of your poor judgement if you're willing to do that actively (e.g. max out your credits and move to Asia), but I don't think you can live INSIDE the system, have no fucking clue on how it is working and be good. It's just too predatory for that.

No they don't...even between *Doctor Who and the Silurians* and *Warriors of the Deep* there were variations in appearance with differences in colour, suckers on their fingers and different builds.

&gt;Ice Warriors are huge bulky strong dudes. Not skinny lizards, seriously this is going into George Lucas Greedo Shot First Territory

In their armour they are, and their armour enhances them. We haven't really seen the rest of them except a face and arms, so there might not be much else skinny about them. Can't say I understand why you've likened it to Greedo though.

&gt;Why make the floor glass? That as a designer is the question you have to answer first, especially when there is existing source material. There needs to be a reason besides, ""well now we can just green screen it."" Because that's how Lucas has been destorying Star Wars. Because we can isn't a valid justification for design changes. Why did the old design not work? If it did work, then why change it? Peristance of design is a good thing, maintainging continuity is a good thing.
We seen several TARDIS control rooms and none of them before were giant cathedrals with glass floors. 

There doesn't *need* to be a reason at all. The TARDIS is infinitely configurable, so if the Doctor wants a glass floor? Just add one in.

There has been an undisputed player for Tito Vilanova in his first season as a first team player but has participated in 29 games-but his good performance in the times you played, and its clause, € 10 million have turned Cristian Tello in one of the most desired players of the current club.

After last season already tempt Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Valencia, among others, now have joined the bidding Ajax and Tottenham.

The Dutch club, however, is ruled out because its cash boot is not for many joys. Not so Tottenham, yes that has money and eventually sold this summer if your big star, Gareth Bale, which aims to enter about 60 million euros.

The London sees great footballer Tello to keep overflow on the left if finally ends up selling the Welsh.
Barca does not want to sell

Although they know that has a big sign, the club has no intention to dispose of Tello. The youth signed on December 17 renewal by the club until June 30, 2016 after several weeks of negotiations between the club and his agent, Josep Maria Orobitg.

Tito Vilanova said in his last appearance in the evolution that has taken the player ""may have had to do the management that has been with him"", although it is true that hinted at the possibility that ""perhaps deserves more minutes.""

Tello also for the work to continue at the club and try to fight for a spot in the starting lineup, despite a salary must renounce much greater than currently perceived Barca. In fact, if the club could not put a higher buyout clause was precisely because his agent thought he would not go in line with the pay received by that.
In fact, one of the clauses in the contract established for the benefit of the club and of itself Tello is that when he reached the 50-game-playing at least 45 minutes per game-but his buyout clause would increase to 16 million euros and automatically record would be enhanced.

At the moment, between last season and this, Tello sum 51 games, but he needs to play seven more its clause becomes 16 million.",0,1368090225,null,0,false,0,c9ve5n3,t3_1dzpgu,t1_c9ve5n3,t3_1dzpgu,null,1431251782,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Interest rates for debt are considerably lower in the US than in the UK.   There are no usury laws here.  Credit cards for people with average but not poor credit can have 30% interest rates (and beyond).  Things may have changed since I moved over here, but even now my US credit cards have a much lower rate than my UK ones.  

Once upon a time, a British loan was a more personal process.  You would speak to a bank manager. You'd need someone to vouch for you.  Your debt was less of a private matter then than it is today.  You still do have doorstep lenders here who'll knock on your door to collect repayments, in front of your neighbours.  Older people in particular may feel debt is a shameful thing.  

Let's say you don't repay your uncollateralised loan or credit card debt.  In both places, the default impacts your credit score.  In the US, this debt is resold to a collections agency and you receive phone calls and letters from some service centre a few states away.  Here, companies are much more likely to take you to court for much smaller amounts.  They may secure a judgement against you that may impact your future chances of employment.  They may send in bailiffs to enter your property and take any goods with a resale value in line with your debt.

For the most part, English and British have often been interchangeable, and people not from these shores still struggle to differentiate between the two. Krishnan Kumar, a historian in the field, even entitled an article 'English, i mean British'.

The idea of England, and Englishness, very much has its roots in the 19th Century. HV morton's 'in search of England' painted a very stylized picture of what Englishness meant. It was countryside, chocolate box cottages, village greens and cricket on a Sunday afternoon. It was gentlemen in hats, and a quintessential 'gentlemanly character'. England was more than a physical place, it was a mindset.

Kumar stated: ""Englishness embodied the aspiration and self-images of a particular section of society - for much of the time, those of the dominant upper and upper-middle classes. It was their politics, their church, their sports, their manners and ways of speaking, [...], their view of history, that provided much of the content of the 'national character"".

Due to the widely accepted perception that England was Britain, and Britain was England, it became clear to the Scottish and Welsh, and even those of the North of England who didn't associate or felt like they belonged to such a portrayed image, that their own national identity had to be formed. Not preserved...formed.

The individual countries began to formulate their own national images. The Scottish projection just so happened to be the that of the Highlands. They also used imagery of Kilts, Porridge, Shortcake and the like. It was there way of differentiating Scotland from England, or Britain. Gradually, it became more and more common for people to differentiate Welsh and Scottish from British, whilst England, English, Britain and British remained interchangeable. To this day, we still see the English referred to as the British, whilst the Scottish and Welsh are clearly separately identified as per the Wiki article.

When i was last in Scotland, the missus was taken to Falkirk A&amp;E, and was asked when giving her details how she identified herself...English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, or British. She said British, but the majority of people who came into A&amp;E that night said simply 'Scottish'.

IANAL but I believe in the case where both parties are below the age of consent it remains an illegal activity (Perhaps even parental negligence?) as neither party can consent, but these cases are rarely prosecuted.

And as for condoms for kids, that's just pragmatic. Kids develop differently, some sexually maturing at 10 and others at 16. They are going to have sex when they're good and ready and no number of laws or overbearing parents are going to change that... So at least we should do what we can to ensure they're being safe.

BONUS ROUND: Did you know children can be held criminally responsible for their actions as young as 10? They can fuck and smoke openly at 16, but can't buy porn or fags until 18? There are a lot of mixed messages, I get why it's easy to be confused.

As cool as the episode was there were several things off in it.  That, the human Daleks being tolerated at the parliament, that the Daleks are even having a freaking parliament (implying voting) instead of a more authoritarianism government usually depicted.

There has to be a great story there.  Maybe once the New Paradigm dug into their ship's history files they realized if they recreated the Daleks in only their own image they'd get swatted down no different than any of the other ""pure"" Dalek groups.  

Maybe the New Paradigm (I could be wrong here, been ages since I've seen the episode) are/were more concerned with purity of Dalek mentality than genetics/form.  The Daleks that revived them were very un-Dalek in they had sunk so low that they served humans instead of trying to create a more active lure for the Doctor.

Or probably the funnest scenario, a good ol' Dalek civil war among scattered survivors of each of the groups who all rebuilt over the years.

* I would tell her that her classmate said something very rude, explain to her what the word means and discuss with her the use of appropriate vocabulary

* I would ask her if she thinks it was a joke or if he was genuinely being mean - i.e. how she felt about the whole situation; maybe also try and gauge what their friendship is like. I would ask her exactly what happened, when, who was there, what the mood was like before, during and after that remark - this might be important if only to get an idea of the whole scene. Doesn't need to be a hysterical interrogation, just a few questions. 

* I would say to her that we would need to speak to their teacher and possibly the headteacher and the boy's parents - it's not about punishment or getting people into trouble, but there are certain standards that we need to adhere to, and that includes appropriate language and behaviour for children. We would need to find out where her classmate picked up that phrase and remind him that he needs to adhere to those appropriate standards - we can't go round being rude to each other, whether it's for fun or in seriousness. And if somebody is teaching him rude words we need to stop that as well (while I wouldn't infer it from the remark in the original post, it's good to keep in mind that very inappropriate and/or violent language may be an indication of abuse)

* I would reassure her that she **absolutely did the right thing** telling us and that we will make sure that her friends understand this as well (to be honest - the daughter's expression of fear of being ostracized opens a whole nother can of worms really and there are a few red flags in regards to the parents' attitudes in the original post)

* then go ahead with that meeting - I would have to ask the school how to proceed really, because I'm not 100% familiar with the system- probably phone the school office - or possibly Dad would know. Btw this was written from a mom's perspective as in the op's shoes (ie. daughter comes home to me - if both parents are there obviously we would both talk to her.

Attend meeting together as well if possible).

true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"This entire piece is based on two falsities. We did not fight to oppose fascism, imperialism or to prevent genocide. And the public did not choose to fight.

When we dismembered Czechoslovakia to 'ensure' peace it was the most popular action ever undertaken by a British Prime Minister. The public in 1935 only voted for parties advocating appeasement and disarmament. The public would have sacrificed Poland, France and everyone else in order to preserve peace. They continued to want peace throughout the war, and it was the government repressing opinion polls, public protests and elections which ensured they kept fighting. The Unions used the opportunity to demand higher wages and went on strike on multiple occasions, crippling the war effort at key times. The amount of theft during the blitz was astounding, and the solidarity people felt was only ever within their own community, not to the wider nation.

We fought on not because we valued freedom or human rights or because we wanted the 1945 settlement, but because we had no option. It was surrender, the transfer of the colonies to German control and the destruction of Britain as an independent nation that was at stake, not a future utopia worth fighting for. The writer of this piece has believed too much propaganda.

It should also be noted that Labour were kicked out of office less than a decade after the war and didn't regain it for almost fifteen years. Furthermore, the post 45 consensus was only achieved because of American capitalism and the Marshall Plan.

Finally, on universal healthcare, Beverage allowed for private healthcare, local trusts and above all localism and insurance. He advocated something akin o the Canadian system where you have a baseline for everyone but above people contributed to their own forms of insurance.

I'd rather see more money put into helping people once they leave prison as free men and women in finding work and reintegrating with society, not treating them like second class citizens. But instead we'll fund more private companies like G4S on payment by results, because that's worked out so well in the past /s.

The OED defines pavement as being any paved surface.  Use of the word is quite limited apart from when it is used with the definite article: THE pavement.  ""The pavement"" always refers to a necessarily paved footpath that runs alongside a highway.  Even a paved footpath built to the same specifications that doesn't run alongside a highway would not be called the pavement.

Footpath has both physical and technical/legal meanings in the UK.  A paved path that is not the pavement is generally called a footpath (for example through a park, and often it will be THE footpath).  Usually when a non-paved way is called a footpath this is because of a legal definition.  In England and Wales there are public rights of way.  These are lines drawn on maps that local councils maintain.  The public has a right to use a public right of way at all times and landowners have a legal responsibility to keep public rights of way open at all times.  A public footpath is a type of right of way on which you are allowed to walk (there are also bridleways which are for horses and bicycles too, and byways for motorised vehicles).  PROWs are mostly in the countryside and are usually unpaved.  In fact a little used public footpath might be completely invisible on the ground (there is an association called The Ramblers who walk PROWs with the purpose of keeping them open and well used, though).  To further complicate things, private organisations like the RSPB often designate footpaths on their own land which you are supposed to stick to.

There's a difference between banter and being a cunt though, and many English I've met have crossed that line and then some, yeah?

Banter ""Ah you tight bastards"", being a cunt ""We should get rid of Scotland and enjoy watching their country collapse because they're leeches and don't deserve England"" (I have actually sat and listened to this from an otherwise lovely English chap - you lot can say some pretty fucking nasty stuff when it comes to Scotland). I think I'm probably more exposed because I'm not so typically Scottish as the average - but I've had to sit through dinners where one or two English people will go on and on about independence or the Barnet formula, clearly lacking any real knowledge of the issue, and clearly packing a lot of vitriol. You could call it a chip on the shoulder almost ;)

&gt;big nasty Englishman

This parody in and of itself is annoying, and trust me, the shit that appears in the papers doesn't exactly make us happy either.

I really wish you lot would understand more clearly that banter = cool, but just generally being a cunt and calling it banter = being a cunt. A lot of the attitudes I've encountered from English people in the last year or two are the sorts of things that push Scots toward independence where they were on the fence beforehand, it's petty smug maliciousness and it's as fetid and detructive as Scots who think all English are evil 'cos of some 800 year old war which we won.",0,1368102489,null,0,1368102816,0,c9vfpxm,t3_1dyqam,t1_c9vfpxm,t1_c9vfh8w,null,1431251044,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Because it's not your choice we are talking about. You still have those choices, they aren't restricting your choice, you can still buy tobacco. Are you also concerned with the lack of cigarette advertising? Growing up in the 80's and 90's the Silk Cut adverts stick in my mind, is it any wonder I most associate with Silk Cut? I don't even smoke cigarettes.

What they are doing is trying to balance against the massive weight of power which the tobacco companies have at their disposal. Do you believe that tobacco companies should have free reign to market as they see fit? Because that is what you are defending in the name of your own personal choice.

Give you another example in another industry, baby milk. It's against the law to promote or market baby formula in the UK. Why? Because such promotion is harmful. Nestle spent 30 years promoting baby milk and discouraging breast feeding in Africa and using many questionable marketing tactics to do so, and they get away with it because no such restrictions existed.

The question is whether a 13 year old has a sufficient understanding of relationships, sex, manipulation, risks, likely outcomes etc etc to meaningfully consent to what they're accepting. At the end of the day, when there's that much disparity in understanding and life experience it really isn't possible to give meaningful consent.

It's also worth noting that the age of consent is not simply the age at which we think legitimate consent can be given. If that was the case, we could just go without a strict rule and let the courts decide on the facts of the case (as with many other types of consent). It's because we don't believe there are sufficient benefits to allowing somebody below that age to consent to sex with an adult as compared to the risk of exploitation if it's permitted.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage

By the way, have you ever tried to define what it means to be Spanish or French or German? Cause if you have, you'll only end up with caricature and stereotype. There is no point in defining a whole people because everybody is different. However, each nation has a cultural heritage that is slightly different and unique. This is something you can be proud of. 

If you have no love for history or what England has achieved and given to the world then sure I understand you might have difficulty coming up with anything concrete. Or maybe you don't like living in England and are just trolling this thread? 

Being proud of being English is the same as somebody saying they are proud to be from any other nation on Earth. Just because you personally have difficulty defining it doesn't mean others don't have their own definition and views. Many people are proud to be Muslim, Asian, Jewish, American, Chinese, etc whilst the only thing they've done is be born into the religion or born into the culture. They are proud to be a part of it. 

I daresay one of the reasons England has been sidelined recently is because of people like yourself confusing national pride with personal pride and making everybody else think that being patriotic is something dirty. It isn't, and it is perfectly normal to be proud of where you have come from. In historical and cultural terms.

She can also refuse to appoint the person given the majority of the vote by the public, and appoint who SHE thinks should be PM, though this has not happened in living memory.
When a cabinet reaches the end of its 5 year term, the queen is responsible for dissolving the last government to enable a General Election to be held.

She has to give ""Royal Assent"" to any law wishing to be passed in the UK.

If a motorist is also a repeat motoring offender, then yes, they damn well should be treated like any other repeat offender and measures taken to stop them repeating.

Jailing people for not paying fines, where they are too poor to pay the fine is an area where I have serious concerns about its effectiveness.

Then again, the numbers of motorists jailed for not paying motoring fines I understand to be vanishingly tiny -- people who can afford to drive, generally speaking can afford to pay the fine, and the few that are jailed, are more usually due to contempt of court because they feel the fine is unjust.",0,1368104116,null,0,false,0,c9vg1ii,t3_1dzggi,t1_c9vg1ii,t1_c9vfi8w,null,1431250892,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Teams who have recently fallen out of a regular champions league spot in their league. As the question asked. Chelsea didn't finish in the top four last season, by the way, another error. But they seem to have returned to it this year. That's one thing we can look at and discuss. Tottenham have moved into challenging for the top four in England for the past number of years with more success than Liverpool and the spending is obviously a lot more comparable than with Chelsea.

""In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes.[65] The former Austrian ambassador, Count Albert von Mensdorff-Pouilly-Dietrichstein, who was also a second cousin once removed and friend of George V, believed that Edward favoured German fascism as a bulwark against communism, and even that he initially favoured an alliance with Germany.[66] Edward's experience of ""the unending scenes of horror""[67] during the First World War led him to support appeasement. Hitler considered Edward to be friendly towards Nazi Germany and thought that Anglo-German relations could have been improved through Edward if it were not for the abdication. Fellow Nazi Albert Speer quoted Hitler directly: ""I am certain through him permanent friendly relations could have been achieved. If he had stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severe loss for us.""[68]""

"" Lord Caldecote wrote a warning to Winston Churchill: ""[the Duke] is well-known to be pro-Nazi and he may become a centre of intrigue.""[71] A ""defeatist"" interview with the Duke that was widely distributed may have served as the last straw for the British government: Prime Minister Winston Churchill threatened the Duke with a court-martial if he did not return to British soil.[72] In August, a British warship dispatched the Duke and Duchess to the Bahamas, where, in the view of Churchill, they could do the least damage to the British war effort.""

&gt;Currently, the stewards in the SU are employed by the SU, however a decision was made behind closed doors that this role would be outsourced to G4S.

&gt;G4S currently work as door staff and as a back up for the stewards - this was decided in 2011. The structure proposed was that stewards would be 'in-house' (employed by QUBSU) and this has been continued, however in the last few weeks, those stewards have been told that they can either sign a 0 hour contract with G4S or lose their jobs.

&gt;The stewards currently comprise both past and present students, however if G4S are allowed to take over these roles, they can hire anyone they like. In the future, this could most likely mean that no students are employed to work in their own students' union.

I absolutely agree. I just don't think that cigarette packaging has anything to do with them trying to stop you from smoking. What they are trying to stop is the influence with which tobacco companies use to sell more cigarettes. They aren't banning tobacco are they? You will still be able to buy it.

I believe the same thing about alcohol, sweet drinks, chocolates etc.. It's a problem with marketing.

Allow people to do whatever they want, just don't allow companies to do whatever they want. Your freedom of choice is still there, you just have to make it on your own without any suggestion from fancy packaging or a seductive advert.

The Doctor knew at that point how it works and that getting a new body means a new mind and the old one fades away into memory. He really liked who he was then and didn't want to change, but was basically getting told by the universe ""too bad.""

Eleven has always been more childlike and...not spastic, but more energetic and playful. You have to remember at this point he's about 1200 years old. Not really a spry young man anymore. On the other hand, his body is. It'd be like giving a man in his sixties the body of a 25 year old. They'd go and do all sorts of crazy and fun things.

At the same time though, the weight of the years regardless if the body will start to show on your mind. As we've seen a lot with 11, he's just sort of getting tired of all the universe's bullshit. He just wanted to travel and have fun, but instead he gets his best friends leaving or dying, the Time War, and all the other horrible stuff. 11's more serious attitude isn't him ""growing up"" it's him getting FED up. After what happened with the Ponds, he just gave up. Said he was done.

That's why Clara is so exciting to him. It's a new enigma; it's a new thing for him to figure out, a new adventure to go on. She's really rejuvenated him.

Sadly too often.

I don't have the figures to hand, but jailing, mainly of single mums for none payment of council tax or community sentence fines is something that does happen.

Eventually, the legal system runs out of options for repayments and the like -- and jail is all that is left to it as an option. Personally I would like to see a method of converting a fine into community service on a per-hourly rate, but equally, a lot of unemployed people in that state of poverty are not just unemployed, but unemployable.

In that situation, community service orders etc simply dump the problem elsewhere without fixing it.

true,Awittysaying,null,null,"Well I doubt there allocated rooms yet you probably won't hear until August which is when the majority of offers go out. 

Glen is the most popular, though not the best I was a Monte boy myself. But as you're a postgrad and you've gone for a standard room there is a good chance you'll get your first choice. I think anyone with a unconditional offer or any postgrads already meeting their entry requirements ended up at the top of the pile simply because they know you're definitely attending Southampton. But don't hold me to that the system was chaotic and each halls manger had a different way of allocating rooms, also the Glen manager was a bit of a hag but she might have been kicked out / left by now. 

They won't stick you with undergrads unless they are really tight on rooms. Southampton guarantee you an offer if you apply before the deadline so you'll definitely have somewhere to stay.  

We got loads of emails and phone calls asking when a person would get an offer and the copy paste reply was that so long as you applied before the deadline you would be made an offer before the move in date, which was the first weekend of October or last weekend of September. All offers had gone out by early September at the latest so just wait it out. 

I would suggest you keep a close eye on your junk/spam folder as we had a lot of problems itch Microsoft filtering our emails and if I remember right there is a two week window in which you have to accept your offer or lose it. 

If you need an update you can always drop the accommodation service an email asking when they start allocating rooms, they might just tell you to be patient or they might be able to give you a date offers will start going out. 

I hope that answers your questions, if you have any more about Southampton feel free to pm me. I was heavily involved in both the union and university, I built the union department that oversees the student committees who run the social side of thing in halls and still know a lot of staff there.

What matters now is the 2 games we have left and winning as many points as possible from those. If it's not enough then so be it but mulling over other teams' fixtures never helped anyone.

true,MrBobaFett,null,null,"&gt;No they don't...even between Doctor Who and the Silurians and Warriors of the Deep there were variations in appearance with differences in colour, suckers on their fingers and different builds.

The minor variations in the original appearances fall within reasonable expectations of variation within a species. Canis lupus shows a variety of colors, lengths of snouts, heights, coat length. No subspecies of dog however have retractable claws, or four ears. No species even in the family of Canidae have four ears or retractable claws. The variation of the head alone between the original Silurians and the new ""Silurians"" is way outside of what would be normal variation within a species. They might be from the same order or maybe family, but then so are the Sea Devils. The things in the new series are clearly different species from the Silurians.

&gt;There doesn't need to be a reason at all. The TARDIS is infinitely configurable, so if the Doctor wants a glass floor? Just add one in.

There has never been a glass floor or cathedral ceilings in any of the Doctor's control rooms before, nor the Master's nor the Rani. Why? Why have they never had that before? There is a precedent and existing art style. Why change it, you need a reason for change. The console has changed over the years and even the room has. However there has been a fairly consistent set of parameters that all of those changes have fit into. Those parameters may have originated from budget and studio space limitations, however that translates into some form of limiting parameter in the world of Doctor Who.
Unlike in the original series we saw no evolution of change over time, it was just BAM totally new art style. WTF?!
Again for people who supposedly like Doctor Who, part of which is the art style, they sure threw the original art out the door.

In the movie Almost Famous about a 1973 rock tour, Kate Hudson's character Penny Lane has **retired** as matriarch of the groupies at age 16. Do we now have the right to say ""That was wrong, that was bad,"" and try to punish people for doing what was entirely normal 50 years ago? People who preyed on vulnerable young girls such as Saville should expect no mercy, no matter how long it's been. But people who simply indulged in a widespread phenomena - that of sexually active but under-aged girls freely offering sexual services - should not be judged by today's standards.",0,1368121162,null,0,false,0,c9vldvj,t3_1dzui7,t1_c9vldvj,t3_1dzui7,null,1431248302,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Imagine that your homeland has fallen under the power of multiple bands of roving bandits. They come and steal your food. One of the bandits says to the bandit chief: Leave the peasants some food. If they starve over the winter there will be nothing to steal next year.

But the bandit chief is more concerned about rival bands. ""Leave food that other bandits might steal? Never!""

One year the the biggest, baddest, meanest, bandit chief decides that he is tired of roving and sets up camp in your village. Did your life just get even worse? No, it just got better. Now it makes sense to leave the peasants some food for winter, because the stationary bandit is close by to stop rival roving bandits stealing it.

Now the villagers have a future and can ponder it. It seems to be closely tied to what the bad mean bandit chief expects as his personal fate.

If he expects to be poisoned or fall in battle in the next five years he will just revel in irresponsible power. If he expects to establish a permanent regime he will put on airs and call himself King. He will look at his sons and his grandchildren and try to build a rich and powerful Kingdom for them to inherent. That means harbours, roads, irrigation, well fed peasants capable of working hard building the castle and later the palace,...

No, Britain was a major force in the creation of European human rights law following the second world war. The main thing that has changed relatively recently is that you don't have to go to Strasbourg to have your case heard any more.

Once, that travelling requirement helped reserve human rights for the relatively rich. Now, human rights are much more accessible - they would be even if the need to travel hadn't been removed. There's some wealthy people who don't like that, and some of them control the press or are in government.

A lot of people will claim that they distrust the press, yet virtually every opinion they express is the standard Sun dogma, often based on stories that are easily proven false.

A lot of the problem is from trucks.

Yes, they're overpriced because people have been able to borrow more and more over the last couple of decades and people think that that is how much they are worth. The increase in prices was mainly down to credit availability not because the rest of the economy was doing well. 

Now the credit has dried up, prices started to correct but we don't want that to happen. The squeeze is starting to manifest itself in increasing rent prices (this is partly inflation catching up with property prices) whilst property prices are starting to stagnate. People buy property with money they borrow, but pay rent with money they earn. The economy has to correct either by correcting property prices in real or nominal values. Either is painful, but one must occur, there isn't really another choice.

The root problem is that we want to fix housing, there are a number of simpler ways to do this but has to start with the fact that over the last decade or two we have over inflated property prices and they need to correct. I think this won't happen for at least one generation, maybe more.

The lords are unpaid industry experts, and are not under control of the party whips. It's an extra house with insignificant power filled with industry experts who act like a teacher to the HoC; if something isn't done right they tell hoc to take it back and look at it again. 

If The Lord were democratically elected they'd need to be paid, they would have a mandate to hold extra powers and you'd get situations where both houses were of the same party and a whip would cause it to be an expensive rubber stamp, or if both houses were held by different parties you'd have a deadlock.

You are looking at one, fairly weak aspect of the US system and trying to state that there is some sort of oligarchy and completely ignoring the state and local governments out of an ignorance of how the American system works. American democracy is more complex and multi-tiered than most European democracies and to criticise it you need to understand those tiers.

Secondly, are you suggesting there isn't just as massive a lobbying system in existence in the UK's national government? Indeed if you are so worried about America becoming an oligarchy are you not massively angry at the UK's clearly already existing oligarchy? Not to mention that least the American lobby groups are transparent and the Americans are constantly trying to do something about them whilst the Windsors and their subsidiaries are arguably just another lobby group that are protected by tradition and are allowed to lobby behind closed doors? Not even bringing up the house of lords. You seem to be arguing that the American system even at the federal level is far superior to the British one, which I wholeheartedly agree.

It would see to me that you thus prefer the American federal system/democracy over the British national system/democracy.

Having said that, he doesn't have the ability to change the game. He's a great player yes but he should be coming on when we're comfortably up and need to close out the game.

It's very frustrating to try at something and just continue to suck at it, definitely. But if I'd gone by my drawing abilities before taking a class, I'd assume I was bad at it, too. Honestly you can't really know until you give it a decent try.

We've stigmatized effort in our culture. We think if you have natural talent, you should be able to do something easily, and if not, haha, you'll never be as good. Reality is the opposite. 99.999% of the time, talent will only get you so far. And it won't make things easy. It shouldn't. Your IQ changes between breakfast and dinner, and every time you struggle to learn something new, your brain forms more connections, making you literally smarter. Likewise, most research on the subject shows that how much you practice something, not how good at it, determine the level of skill you'll ultimately achieve. Which is why you'll ultimately make more money pursuing the career you love over the one you're good at but couldn't care less about. Practice &gt;&gt; talent.

true,Mordisquitos,lancashire,Manchester,"I'm not saying that welfare itself shouldn't be on the radar, as it is indeed an ""enormous"" number. 

The trouble is that welfare fraud (unlike welfare itself) isn't an ""area"" of public spending that can be controlled at will. It is the end result of an equilibrium between how hard the Government can make it to defraud the system and how much effort the welfare fraudsters are willing to put in.

The situation is similar to supermarkets and loss prevention. There is a point of diminishing returns, where the effort (money) that can be put into preventing fraud (or shoplifting) is less than what is gained when fraud (or shoplifting) is prevented. In the case of preventing welfare fraud, there is another point to consider: how many legitimate claims will be rejected for a particular level of fraud prevention?

Case in point, specifically with regards to disabilities fraud: the contracts given out to date for the purpose of Personal Independence Payments (PIP) testing (ATOS &amp; others) have been [£540 million pounds for five years, which will become around £700 million pounds once the final contract is awarded](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240160775/Atos-and-Capita-win-540m-in-controversial-DWP-disabilities-testing-contract). That makes a total cost of £140 million a year. However, if you look at the official estimated fraud in Disability Living Allowance (DLA, was replaced by PIP) [\(page 15 of the .pdf\)](http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd2/fem/FEM_1213P.pdf) it only amounted to £70 million pounds in 2012/2013. 

I assume (hope!) a similar figure to the ATOS contracts was already being spent beforehand to test for DLA, because if not that would mean we have blown through the point of diminishing returns and are spending £2 for every £1 lost to fraud. More realistically, it is the approx. £140 million a year spent on fraud prevention that has managed to reduce fraud to £70 million a year. In that case, how likely is it that we can make a significant dent in what's left of disabilities fraud without spending more than we could ever hope to save? Not much.

In any case, I'm sure you agree that the amount of attention given to welfare fraud in the media and amongst certain politicians is completely out of proportion to its relevance. According to the linked article polls indicate that people estimate on average that 27% of the welfare budget is lost to fraud, which is nearly 40 times over the true estimate of 0.7%.

*DISCLAIMER: I had no idea about any of the figures in my comment before I started typing it out, so I am willing to admit I may have made a ridiculous calculation error or used the wrong figures to prove my point.

Some land revenue and hypothetical tourist trade aren't good enough reasons to give up on those principles.

A lot of the other arguments for it (that it brings people together, that it's a long-standing tradition, that most people like it and that the Queen is quite charming really) seem awfully similar to the kind of arguments people use to defend the benefits of faith and I'm not really convinced by them.",0,1368130390,null,0,false,0,c9voqxw,t3_1e03cx,t1_c9voqxw,t1_c9vohrj,null,1431246718,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I've got Maths tomorrow but had a French exam today. I think the most important thing is to relax so long as you think you're ready to take the exam. There are only two scenarios for each exam: 

1. You know the stuff well enough to take the exam (i.e. you have revised)

2.  You do not know enough (i.e. you haven't put enough work in)

Regardless of your situation I'd advise against cramming the night before or on the day. Get to bed early. Little of the information is going to stick in your head at such short notice and it is likely that you will do better in the exam if you are calm and collected rather than flustered and frantic. Relax on the day. Briefly look over the topic(s) you feel the least confident with and before the examination, and once in the exam room take deep breaths. 

Do the best you can, and once time's up, it's in the past. There is absolutely nothing you can do to change your answers once time's up so don't spend time worrying about your performance. Move on to the next exam.

sk8r2000 speaks the truth. It's hard to not get stressed, everybody, myself included, gets stressed out. The most important thing is to continue to be productive when you do get stressed. And remember life goes on after the exams- as time goes by they will eventually mean jack shit and you'll wonder why on earth you got yourself so worked up.

If I had to say why and I know this is flame material but, Smith's Doctor to me comes across as that kid who tries to hard at school to be different. Look at me! Fezzes! Stetsons! Bowties! LOL MOP. GERONIMO!

Oh, I'm in a sticky situation, let me pull out my magic wand... Uh, I mean Sonic screwdriver.

RTD had some absolutely terrible writing, best example being the resolution to Journey's end being Donna pulling a few levers in a Dalek basement.

Daleks can't even use levers. That said, the writing was so much better, the resolutions were ridiculous but stuck within the established rules, the humour came naturally and there were more British jokes rather than British for America jokes. 

Tennant's memes usually feature him wearing the 3D glasses, which had a plot reason and were worn for all of 3 minutes and him saying Allons-y (About 4 times over his 4 series (counting specials as a series)). Smith had to remind us that bowties are cool every other episode, or shout Geronimo while jumping into something.

Also, less power of love endings.

true,Blob_of_Goo,null,null,"I actually agree with this, and not just because I'm a massive pervert. Girls, like boys, want sex as soon as they hit puberty, and we are fools to try to litigate against it. Criminalising the behaviour merely forces it underground, allowing teenage pregnancy and sexual disease to flourish.

Also, girls mature faster than boys and frequently prefer partners who are more than a couple of years older than themselves. This partnership would be a closer match, in terms of physical and emotional development, than with a boy their own age. It is natural, therefore, to expect to see a thirteen year old girl dating a seventeen year old boy.

I would still leave open the option of criminalising any pairing beyond, say, ten years age difference, because I believe this to be a reasonable cut-off point. A sixty year old man, for example, has no business trying to get into the kickers of a thirteen year old girl, and for one simple reason - she would not desire him. To preserve fairness, I believe that the girl herself would have to be the one to make the complaint. If, then, a 26-yr-old and a 15-yr-old were to fall in love, it would be nobody's business but theirs.

Stop trying frantically to defend your daughters - you will only push them away. Instead, love them, teach them, support them, then let them live their lives. Girls can look after themselves, and to try to rescue them from making the mistakes everyone makes in their youth, the mistakes you yourself made, will only stunt their development.",0,1368132239,null,0,false,0,c9vpg7r,t3_1dzvgj,t1_c9vpg7r,t3_1dzvgj,null,1431246388,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Here's some perspective. If we win our final two games it will put us on 72 points. Since the Premier League began, there have only been two seasons where 72 points was not good enough for at least 4th place. TWO times in TWENTY seasons has a team finished on 72 or higher and not earned at least 4th place. 

We will be a part of a very small unlucky minority if we win both games and miss out, which fucking figures because we're Spurs. Whether it's food poisoning or Martin Fulop losing his shit or being the 3rd team in two decades to get screwed on 72 points or actually finishing 4th but STILL getting screwed, we will find new ways to suffer.

It is quite obviously Gallas who has a contract expiring in the summer [source](http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/william-gallas/profil/spieler_3156.html).

We need two DM (especially if AVB is to make it to 4-3-3). Sandro is obviously first choice, I imagine Livermore will go with Parker hanging around (AVB has shown a fair bit of faith in him already). However, if a club makes a semi decent offer for Parker I can see Levy cashing in (around the 10m mark). 

If Carroll goes on loan, Huddlebro stays. If Carroll stays, Huddlefro moves to Fulham for 6m. That is my opinion, But I think 2 x DM, 2x DLM, 2xCM, 2xACM, 2xRW and 2xLW is a healthy midfield. Of course, if spurs get linked to someone like Eriksen or another player that would fit neatly into a 4-3-3 I can see that logic going out the window.

I think BAE isn't too much of an issue right now. Maybe Rose comes back and they can battle for the starting spot next season. 

Loan wise I think Falque (who has been shopped around) will either be sold or loaned to a La Liga club. Smith could be recalled with a a PL loan attempt made (or some movement with Naughton as Walker, Naughton and Smith is overkill). Kane can hopefully get a PL loan (maybe for Watford if Vydra moves on), I would like to see Coulibaly punching a little higher, Mason too. Luongo (sp?) should aim for a championship loan next season as AFAIK he is impressing. 

AVB has said before that in his systems (4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1) he only ever uses one striker. He also said that it is too hard to keep 3 top strikers happy with only one spot to play for and so his preference is to have 2 main strikers and a youth player. It seems obvious a striker is the key target, and either Ade or Defoe will have to make room. Due to his age, I can see it being Defoe (and also it will be easier to move him on for a fee close to his actual value, where as after this season I feel Ade is severely undervalued). This would leave a strike force of Ade, New guy, Youth guy. 

I don't buy into the need for wing cover with Siggy performing so well on the left and Townsend on the right. I see the basic team looking like this next year.

Starting (backup):

Lloris (Friedel)

Walker (Smith or Naughton), Vert/Kaboul (Caulker/Daws), Rose (BAE)

Sandro (Parker), Dembele (Carroll or Huddlestone)

Lennon (Townsend), Bale (Holtby), Siggy (Dempsey)

Ade (new guy)

Of course the 3 behind the striker should have the freedom to chop and change a bit. That team is very 'good', but not 'amazing'.

Also the austerity vs. investment argument depends an awful lot on the value of the multiplier (as seen in such phrases as 'the multiplier effect). If the multiplier is low, and the govt invest a ton of money in the economy, it makes shit all difference. If they've borrowed that money, they have to pay interest on it. The multiplier is often low in times of recession (depending on your economic theory). This means it's better to bring in austerity measures now, as they will have a less crippling effect on the economy.

If the multiplier is high, as it is when you're booming, invest then, and it will have a more significant impact.

I hear you say 'OK smartarse, how do we get to another boom if we're not investing?'

Good question. The thing is, this is a global recession (stop laughing China), and we're reliant on other countries stabilising their economies before ours will improve. It's not like we can do it all on our own by building houses.

Since that half time break, I feel okay to say it, without getting downvoted to hell. He is a good manager, but still not meant for us. We need someone who love the club after all we have been through. Hopefully, we will get that someone this season. 

Although, I will always wonder what happened during that halftime break. Maybe it was the time Rafa realised he can be sacked earlier. Maybe Roman scolded him too much.

Together we're an economical powerhouse bigger than even the mighty USA. 

Alone, well... We're a world power in decline. Brazil will be past us in no time at all if they're not already. 

Also, our bailouts in Europe are about on par (A little less, actually) with the bailouts that the USA handed out to avoid their economy going down the drain. They're just something that need to be done unfortunately. They can't be helped as the damage has been done. All we can do is learn from our past mistakes.

To sounds like a right cunt, we just need to keep calm and carry on. 

One criticism I have is that we should probably be doing a bit more bailing out.

true,fameistheproduct,null,null,"Okay, off the top of my head some simple ways.

1- All government tax breaks and subsides for private property development stops. Any property developed using public funds or land must stay in government (local or national) hands and cannot be sold off, ever. All these properties should be rented out to people over short to medium term periods. These should be priced in direct competition with private landlords that currently provide a long term unsustainable public/private partnership housing solution. This ""partnership"" should be phased out.

2- Remove the loan interest tax relief that mortgage owners benefit from and tenants do not. It was introduced in 1997/8 I think and it's one of the key causes of our bubble economy. In fact, this law would really help businesses too. This would do two things, crash the property market and get whichever party is in power out of power. It will also correct the property market by equalising the purchasing power of renters and landlords. 

3- Am stealing this one from Steve Keen. The problem is that there's too much debt in the system, and the solution that economic advisors like to give is lower interest rates and quantitative easing via the banks. The problem with this is that this is the way the banking system works it's why we have too much debt in the first place (it would be nice if the politicians had the balls to say, if you lend money to someone who cannot pay it back, ""welcome to capitalism pal"") and by giving the banks money we're not holding them to account for the risks they have taken. Steve's idea is to give quantitative easing money directly to the public with the caveat that money should go to paying off debts first. If you don't have debt you get a cash lump some.

Yes this devalues the currency, the reality is that we're already doing this by keeping interest rates low while inflation (even the ""official"" rate has been above 2%) erodes savings and salaries.

I don't want to wait another 10 years. The current attitude to fixing the housing problem is more of what created it. Any solution is beset with the problem that it benefits one group at the expense of another, but what that group fails to realise is that they may have benefited already at the expense of someone else to get in this situation anyway.",0,1368137112,null,0,1368137324,0,c9vr720,t3_1e0gef,t1_c9vr720,t1_c9vn3ny,null,1431245565,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I also found [this ""definitive"" DW page with some more addresses]( http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/doctor-who/articles/128098/title/definitive-doctor-who-guide), most of which seem to be taken from the .biz site. 

You could also look to see if there are any official fan clubs for the stars. There are bound to be many fan clubs, but official ones will have direct contact with the stars themselves, and may offer some special perks.

This is inevitable, its going to happen whether we like it or not. This country hasn't seen nothing yet, or the global economy. 

&gt;If they've borrowed that money, they have to pay interest on it.

Why? and from whom?

&gt;This means it's better to bring in austerity measures now

Cant you smell it??,, the austerity measures are engineered and lobbied for by monied interests to snare public sector cuts, and probably the same leaches we borrowed money from in the first place either directly or indirectly.

The rest of your points IMHO can be answered through taking control of the UK money supply. Which currently the banks digitise 97% of it, totally under their control, creating debt for individuals in the form of easy credit. Easy credit leads inevitably to higher prices in all commodities. The only way to counter this is to flood the market with commodities. 

We need houses, agreed, prices are artifically high because government is willing to pay private landlords huge sums of money to rent their properties. These people are never going to voluntarily reduce their profits. If rent controls are brought in thats a different matter. Even then the market would become flooded with cheap properties. 

Flooding the market with government built properties with our own money, employing citizens of the United Kingdom, through training, education and work paying decent wages, you would enrich the nation eventually.

&gt; Out of all the other countries in Europe, why the UK?
 
I literally grew up with English (Jabberjaw, Scooby Doo, Pixie and Dixie, Snaglepuss etc. ) and I'm am quite confident in my ability to speak and write it.

It has helped me tremendously all throughout my life and still does every time I study a topic, follow the news, and communicate with people abroad.  As for the people you've met, if they really thought that the government would give them free money/stuff and they were disappointed, I wouldn't feel bad for them.

&gt; We are very very short of jobs in the UK at the moment, services are being cut, benefits are being cut, and you will likely meet huge resentment from many who are struggling to find work that you have come here to compete against them.

As I understand from necrois, richardjohn and  LordAnubis12's posts there could be some demand in IT depending on the sector and which part of the country we're referring to. For me at least it's not just about getting a job but more about being able to be myself around people and not hiding or avoiding silly questions as to whether I have a girlfriend or not, or when will I get married.

I understand the jobs shortages, as we also have them here. The main reason given by potential employers is 'lack of experience' even though no one cared to explain to me how in the world do you gain experience if no one hires you in the first place, and if another foreigner took the same job position I was applying for here in Romania, I would just take it as a sign that I need to learn/prepare more for the job I want.

At this point we're at the high end of what I expected going into the season but it hurts so much because we could be much better off.  I applaud AVB because he's gotten the most out of our players (aside from Ade until yesterday), but there are still some decisions he makes that give you hesitation.  At many points he's perhaps played it too safe and just hoped Bale will save the day when there's other creative players left on the bench.  That strategy has worked but it's often by the skin of our teeth. 

Finally, as someone who's loved Andros Townsend for more than a year and wondered why he hasn't seen more first team action, I'm glad to see him do well but goddamn could we have used him to fill in some of the holes.

It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty or justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.

I don't think it needs to be capitalists for there to be conspiracy. In fact some of the most left leaning people I've ever met are grafting perk taking dishonest scumbags, and while they've not been in any position of power I've no doubt how they'd abuse it.

Human nature is the enemy, not the function of the market. In fact the function of the market (when it's not being gamed by people) is to drive prices down, to prevent oligopolistic behaviour among companies and create choice and innovation.

Sadly we live in a country where large corporations lobby and lobby and lobby for barriers to entry, and for work schemes that allow them access to much cheaper labour.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt;I don't think it needs to be capitalists for there to be conspiracy

I'll readily admit that the when the Left is in government it is as poor a keeper of other people's labor as anyone else. That much wealth under the control of a few is prone to theft and exploitation. The traditional Left never really held true to the belief that an individual should control their own labor and benefit equally from the technological progress that humankind has made. They only insisted that the state should be the master, not the landed class. Maybe better in some respects, but does not get away from the original problem that an individual lacks freedom and is forced to dance to someone else's tune. 

&gt;Human nature is the enemy, not the function of the market. In fact the function of the market (when it's not being gamed by people) is to drive prices down, to prevent oligopolistic behaviour among companies and create choice and innovation.

And like the dreams of socialism, it is exactly that. A dream. The free market does not encourage innovation, but moves towards cooperation of the wealthy, monopoly and exploitation. And whilst the states exists, able to sell the labor of future generations and claiming some sort of legitimacy to legislate, they will be prone to lobbying. It will seek to establish a class of individuals that lack the bare necessities for their survival. They will be forced to sell their time, labor and lives in order to exist. It is little better than slavery. 

&gt;The problem isn't that the working week is too long, it's that the working class are squeezed to the point that they need to do the full working week to subsist.

My experience has been that it's very hard to get into administration/secretary/PA without prior experience, which you'd get from an unpaid or low-paid internship.

Very common vacancies are ""customer service"" (which means call centres), and sales. Both are relatively unreliable - they may turn out to be more commission-based than advertised, and despite their clients may be run by unstable companies.

My problem is that RTD had a habit of blowing up the universe in the season finale, and Moffat has somehow managed to make him look restrained.

At least when RTD had a temporal paradox, he started the episiode by screaming ""there's a paradox machine, what do you think is going to happen?"" and it resolved itself in a moderately consistent manner. When Moffat wanted a paradox, he just stole the ""bill and ted"" approach to getting out of a locked box. To be fair, he did blow up the universe, and then had a little girl remember it back into existence.

I just want Moffat to go back to what he's clearly brilliant at - and leave the season-long arcs to someone else. Doesn't have to be RTD, but there has to be *someone* out there with the skill to pull it off.

For a while, it actually looked like Moffat was going to pull back from the ""the entire universe is in danger"" approach, which made me (briefly) happy he was in charge. The thing is, we know the Doctor will save the day. When the entire universe is in danger, there's no suspense. But when it's just a village, he can stop the monster, yet there can still be consequences. There's room for tension and suspense if the danger isn't ridiculous.

But Moffat has blown up the universe, blown up time, and now somehow knowing the Doctor's name is going to be the awful and terrible outcome at the most dramatic battle in the history of the multiverse.

They've become incredibly strict recently, to the point where they've blocked/restricted access to a lot of sites (including reddit hence why im hardly on anymore) and im almost certain that everyone (i know i do) in their contracts have clauses forbidding them from talking about any going on at the club that could be considered confidential or revealing..basically dont talk about the club on our behalf, same thing goes for players although they just need to speak to the PR team and get the all clear but most dont because its a lot of hassle and paper work and with all the negative publicity we've received in the last couple of years (chang/suarez) the PR department are having break downs trying to put us back in peoples good books

----------------------------------

**Now honestly**, I was trying to work something out like this a couple of months back in time for the end of this season and it was one of the series I mentioned a number of times and wanted to get going on this sub (a player/staff member answering questions once a month/week in an ongoing series hopefully ending up with either Stevie or BR), I did ask around and did have a talk with a couple of the PR guys and girls, the problem the PR team had with Reddit (cutting out all the BS) is the unrestricted questions.

they have no control over what people might ask or say, its the same reason they've stopped or dont let players view live twitter feeds when doing Q&amp;A's because they dont want players revealing information or reacting in a negative manor to shit people tweet them, we've all seen some of the shit people say, hence why they use print screens of selected questions instead.

on reddit they'd see all the questions, uncensored, and we wouldnt be able to stop people coming from outside the subreddit and trolling or posting shit about them, their families, friends, team mates, you get the idea...Im 1000% nobody here would do anything like that, nor would the majority of people, but it just takes the odd few to ruin it 

Im sure i could have structured this better or shortened it down but at half 1 in the morning its the best i could do, so sorry guys, but I will try and ask people directly that way all they need to do is get permission and then we can work things out with the mods and figure it out, just theres only so much i can do",0,1368146395,null,0,1368146699,0,c9vuakj,t3_1e08yw,t1_c9vuakj,t3_1e08yw,null,1431244034,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

The average adult viewer can appreciate these things and a lot may enjoy that humor but a lot appreciate the emotional crap fest that has been going through his mind. He is the happiest and youngest looking old man in the galaxy and that is what the adult viewers tend to watch him for and that variety is why I like him as a doctor because he is truly a Doctor for everyone (by everyone I don't mean everyone likes him I mean for adults and children).

The sonic screwdriver has been a crutch I will agree 100% and I don't think it is because terrible writing everything just seems more character centered rather than the fights against whatever enemy there trying to defeat. The sonic screwdriver is just something to move the story along more quickly and have like 25 minutes of character development and 15 of actual fighting/running. 

For journeys end that was Darvos's prison and he had hands so I guess he could have used the levers to do something which turned out to be a pretty bad decision for daleks. If Darvos wasn't in that episode or he had no hand I would completely agree but since he is I'll let that one go down to bad design kind of like the big hole in the death start that could blow the entire thing up.

I haven't really seen as many Smith memes as Tennant but that may be because of not subscribing to DoctorWhumor or whatever but I see a lot more repeats of the same thing ""timey wimey"" ""allons-y"" and all of that stuff. I already said what I wanted to say about the bow ties but Geronimo was a whole other thing at one point. In the beginning it was just a catchphrase just like ""gotcha"" when it was first said but every time it was used over time as a catchphrase it became more and more meaningful to him. Geronimo became a way of saying goodbye just in case I die and gotcha was used as the same thing but kind of let go as it was an inside joke between Amy and The Doctor.

Anyways through all of that I do like Smith as the doctor because of his variety and through his faults there is a childlike wonder that I love to see because it reminds me of the older doctors (I haven't seen many but I've seen quite a bit) before the time war when he became so very sad and so very angry all of the time. He finally has a distraction from who he is because he is tired of him, he went around and deleted himself from the universe. So if I have to part with one thing it is this, Smith is a good doctor who portrays complex ideas simply in order to pander to all people.

Eric Roberts as terrible lame master. Seriously is he playing the Master or T1000?
Motorcycle cop in and out of the TARDIS door gag.

I don't hate people for not liking Doctor Who. But it's dumb to say you love Doctor Who when you haven't seen it. It's like saying you like Oz and you've only read Wicked and not anything by Baum.
