She was literally in the most physically/emotionally/hormonally chaotic time of her life when *the* Doctor whisked her away and she fell in love.  She made horrible decisions.  She made selfish decisions.  But so do most people at her age.  I know I did.  She just made them in an entirely unique situation.  

But she also saved lives, was courageous, kind, and above all, loyal.  She didn't follow directions, and if she had, she wouldn't have been as good a match for the Doctor.  Even though he was hundreds of years older than he was, she held her ground when it was important to her.  Also, when she was separated from the Doctor, she kept improving herself and helping others.  

To be honest, she had nothing going for her on Earth.  If her relationship with Mickey had been serious/solid, things would have never unfolded the way they did.  They were never going to be forever.  She handled it badly, but when are break ups ever beautiful? She had no job, and was practically directionless.  She loved Jackie, but it was time to leave the nest.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; mutilate their body

how does it mutilate the body? It changes a male body into a female body, and it often looks exactly the same as a female body. 

&gt; And what SRS can do is mutilate their body and make them look similar to a woman, but they will never look exactly like one, and they will certainly never be one, because they weren't born female. Maybe in 100 years, but when they become better at the physical surgeries, they will just be creating better fakes.

If a trans* person was unfortunate enough to have been born in the wrong body, and has possibly suffered years of discrimination and a lack of acceptance, not just from others, but from their own internal struggle, and they then transition and their brain and their body are finally aligned, why should someone say to them that they are not a ""real"" man or woman. How hard is it to accept that they are, both neurologically, and physically, the gender they identify as. 

&gt; It was the worst sexual experience I've ever had. A frankenstein of body and mind. That kind of surgery should not be allowed. That's just my emotional reaction, and that's the only one I have related to this topic. I feel like all I am getting in my responses are emotional reactions, but I'm not arguing based out of emotion. But when I remember that...person and what they looked and acted like, oh god I want to.

I'm sorry you had an unfortunate experience. You cannot say that that surgery should not be allowed for anyone though because of your bad experience.

true,robertemmett,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I think there is some truth in what you say. I think there is some selfishness, you make some very valid arguments. Especially disheartening was the initial moment when the Doctor asked her to come along and mentioned he could also travel in time, and she thanked Mickey. ""For What?"". Exactly. And ran off with this, realistically, stranger. 

And she is not one of my favorite characters, far from my favorite companion, so I find myself in a strange predicament when I defend some of her actions. 

In the end, isn't much of life the choice between doing what we want, what we see fit, and trying to placate others? Sure, we hope to strike a balance and make everyone and ourselves happy. But, sometimes this just isn't possible. Sometimes the hard choice has to be made. Follow our dreams or muck about in someone elses standard of life. 

Look at what he showed her, the times and places and experiences she had never dreamed possible. It is not completely surprising that she came away with a sense of 'anything is possible if you fight for it, and you have to fight for what you believe in even if the whole Universe is against you.'

So, no hate here, you make some valid points and arguments, and I won't say everything she did was alright or justified, but I can understand it in some ways. Sometimes life hands us very hard decisions, and we either follow our heart and chase our happiness where ever it leads, or we try to conform and fit the mold and eke out whatever contentment we can find in someone elses definition of life.

And side note: I don't feel all that bad for Donna in the end. It was terribly sad that she had to forget the Doctor and everything that happened and what she learned and went through.

But, somewhere in the vacuum of empty space where those old memories used to live; a new life, a new identity sprang forth, and called herself Nellie. And one day she awoke not as Donna Noble any longer, but as Nellie, and on a whim chased a crazy paper executive across the ocean to America, where she found a home as a projects manager for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

Anyway, on Will Self's intervention on terrorism.  He has an unfortunate delivery style, and he didn't have much to back up his points beyond snark, but he's not wrong that terrorism is a hugely overblown political issue which has way too much impact on people's wallets and lives given the objective risks.  It's also wholly wrapped up with our very abusive foreign policy in parts of the world and we could do more to counter terrorism by changing this than we will do with our endless war on it, which will probably exacerbate it.

true,ShotFromGuns,tardis,TARDIS,"&gt; I think Rose is a petulant, selfish, conceited person who is willing to risk her entire family just to be with a madman in a time-travelling box.

I think this is a drastic overreaction.

The story of Rose in *Doctor Who* is a story about growing up. Is Rose often immature, and does she leave people behind? Yes, because she is still a teenager, and she's written like one. Most people, especially in Western society, eventually leave their parents. It's not Rose's job to keep Jackie company for the rest of their lives; Rose could have stayed with Jackie and stagnated, but instead, she chose to travel with the Doctor and grow. There's a reason we make jokes about people living in their parents' basements; in societies where it's expected for children to grow up and move out on their own, to stay at home being supported by your parents is a sign of immaturity. Rose was ready to leave, but she didn't know how until the Doctor offered her the opportunity. The only way Jackie was ever going to hold on to Rose was if she never realized her full potential and spent the rest of her life pulling down a tiny wage as a shopgirl.

As for Mickey, it was his own choice to keep pining after Rose for as long as he did. Sure, she didn't make a perfectly clean break (the implied hookup during ""Boom Town"" being the worst example), but even from the start, it was clear that he viewed the relationship sort of like a comfy piece of furniture he took for granted more than anything he was passionately devoted to. Mickey, like Jackie, needed to learn to take care of himself. And indeed, when he, too, came to travel with the Doctor, he started living for himself instead of putting his life on hold for someone who's clearly no longer interested.

Part of being human is that sometimes your own development requires you to leave important people behind; and part of being a child is that you don't always know how to do that without hurting them, or at least while minimizing the damage. One of the common tropes of the RTD era of *Doctor Who* was exploring how companions' travels affected the people they left behind, and Rose was an excellent introduction to the idea.",0,1380247926,null,0,false,0,ccg6ecl,t3_1n6twh,t1_ccg6ecl,t3_1n6twh,null,1429329760,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

The reason gender norms seem so important to you and the reason you can't explain why is that subconsciously, you know you benefit from them. The problem is that you fail to empathize with others and don't realize that the system you value doesn't benefit you because its objectively beneficial - it benefits you at the expense of people who don't conform and at the expense of people who do conform, but on the wrong side. In this case, those groups are LGBT people and feminine people respectively. (Note that women can't win either way - either they're non-gender conforming, or they conform to the ""weaker"" gender, and trans women/feminine men are at the absolute bottom of the totem pole, being both non-conforming and feminine.)

This is what feminists and social justice advocates are referring to when they talk about ""the patriarchy."" Its purpose is not to create a better society - its purpose is to create a power structure that benefits one privileged group at the expense of another un-privileged group. It's no surprise that it tends to be more fiercely reinforced by the privileged group (straight people, gender conforming people, men) - they are the ones (in general although not 100%) not being dismissed in job interviews, not being bullied and murdered, not being exploited sexually, etc. It creates a gigantic ""in-group"" that is in fact to nobody's long-term benefit.

I've never been kicked off the subway at 12:30 AM because the entire system is closing, I've never melted while riding the subway because there is no air conditioning, I've never had to ride for hours because there is no express service, I've never had to pay more on the subway because I am visiting my grandparents at the end off the line, while Zone 1 yuppies pay the cheapest fare.

I've lived in NY and London, and while the tube is cleaner (because you shut it down every single night), there is not one other thing better about it.  Making poor folks further from the center pay more to go to work than rich people living in central London is ludicrous.

Not to mention the scope of the tube is tiny compared to the subway.  Greater London is 607 sq miles in area, with 249 miles of track.  As far as I can tell, the only water area would be the Thames.

NYC is 468.9 square miles, but as it is a coastal city, 164.1 sq miles of this is water, and only 304.8 sq miles is land.  So for about half the land area, we have 660 miles of track, well over twice as much as London.

But yeah, the tube is better, right.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"First I'd like to preface that I love Donna and Martha. I think both characters were written as strong and independent women and are given great opportunities to showcase this. I don't want my criticism to seem like I actively dislike these characters, merely that I'm trying to make a point.

Martha had help. Hell, *The Last of the Time Lords* opens *with Martha getting help*. I'll admit that travelling the world under the Master's reign is one hell of a feat, but let's not act like she did this all by her lonesome. She picked up help along the way. 

&gt; Donna did a hell of a lot of amazing stuff that she did, once again, without help

Like what? Barely holding down a temp job, making frenemies with Neriss and nagging anyone who shows her a modicum of romance to marry her? 

Or maybe you mean stuff Donna did as a companion. She sure accidentally liquidated that poor overweight woman without any help. She got trapped in a virtual reality without any help. She whined to the Doctor about breaking the laws of time and honestly thought Nobby might be real. 

The biggest things Donna did by herself were figure out dates in *The Doctor's Daughter* (which really didn't do much to solve the mystery, as the Doctor was literally just about to figure things out by himself anyway) and *commit suicide* (which was only done by the instructions of who? Oh yeah, Rose).

Every other big thing that she'd done was the whole shenanigans as DoctorDonna, but if your most useful form is half a different character, there's clearly something wrong.

Amy and Rory had a whole life going? If my ""whole life"" you mean Amy barely able to hold down a job then congrats, that's the Ponds' life. Even Rose was able to work in a shop steadily, Amy could hardly make it as a kissogram.

&gt; Clara already had her life going before the Doctor arrived, and a lot of the stuff she's done so far was without help.

Ah. Clara, Clara, Clara. Artificially perfect Clara. She can tend a bar among the saltiest and still be Mary Poppins by dinner. She's a super-genius, a hacker that bests the Doctor, and all-in-all little Ms. Impossibly Perfect. She finds the Doctor's biggest secret by just wandering in the TARDIS. Her life story is more emotionally moving than the Doctor's *entire centuries of existence*. She's so spunky and feisty and ever-so-plucky.

I don't know why people constantly think Rose ditched her family when she did not. We see she regularly visits her mom and has a phone to call her when needed. I would say she constantly juggles traveling and visiting her mom really well.

The only time Rose 'ditches' her mom is when she chose the Doctor over staying in the parallel world. But why isn't she allowed to make this choice? 


&gt;She looked into the heart of the TARDIS-I could do that too-and then got trapped in a parallel universe which she had to leave just so she could see the Doctor again.

Looking into the heart of the TARDIS and absorbing the entire time vortex was no small feat. Heck, the Master even mentions how impressive that is. Yes, she got help opening the TARDIS console, but everything after that was all Rose.

Rose knew looking into the heart was dangerous as was shown to her previous by the Slitheen woman being reverted to an egg, but she risked it as it was her only option. The TARDIS looked into Rose and together they saved the Doctor and luckily Rose didn't die.

Now, the only reason Rose got trapped into the parallel universe is because she let go of the bar she was holding onto to make sure the void stayed open. 


&gt;Oh, and did I mention that she did that all with help? 

Come on now, every single companion has gotten help when they do their part to save the world/Doctor in some way. I guess the question she be what do you consider help to be?

Martha had loads of help from people on Earth when she walked it. You see the opening scene with her getting help from a rebel and help transport her and house her.

Donna gets lots of help from the Doctor in all of their adventures, the same as pretty much all of his companions.

Amy &amp; Rory's whole life happened with help from the Doctor &amp; everyone they encountered. After they left the Doctor is the one who set up their needs for life.

And yes, once she was in the parallel world she came back, but we all know it was to warn the Doctor that all of reality was collapsing. 

&gt;If Rose was the amazing thing she was made out to be, then why do I find it so hard to like her character? 

You don't have to like a character to acknowledge that they were capable and helped the Doctor. Some people don't like the Ponds, Martha, or Donna but they all had moments where they were a necessity. Disliking a companion doesn't mean you should discredit their importance.

One reason I dislike her is because I'm not a huge fan of love stories. She was also terrible to Micky practically forgetting he exists and lets 9 be rude to him. When she decides Micky isn't the one for her she doesn't really tell him and lets him go on waiting for her.

Another reason is because well I don't quite know how to explain it but she reminds me of those people who like go into the same profession as their father to get his respect and attention. She's trying to show off and be all time/space travelery to win his attention when the reason he picked her was because of her humanity. When Jack and Micky are around she has to show off.

The episode when 9 regenerates is probably why I dislike her the most.

There is a saying that goes something like it is easy to hate what your enemies did, but it is truly difficult to understand why they did it.

I feel Rose felt pity for the Dalek. Here is one of the most fearsome creatures in the universe succumbing to emotions that not only has it never felt before, but has never even known and these emotions directly contradict the Daleks reason to exist.

She realizes that killing the Dalek is pointless and its death won't avenge any of the people it killed. The Dalek wasn't shown love it was shown the ability to feel what humans emotions are like and it completely destroyed its will to live.

&gt;I feel like anyone could open the TARDIS, and then all you have to do is look in it, something we all do naturally.

Anyways, I think we can definitely win. We've won two league games in a row, we're on a roll. Newcastle, definitely a beatable side. Although you're right, we need to stop coming close to these shit sides if we want to be elite. 

First off, Deulofeu can clearly hang with the big boys. I know Fulham isn't that great this year, but they still beat us and he was a huge influence in that match. 

Secondly, gotta try Kone or Vellios alongside Lukaku. Naismith is a great sub if his work ethic is still there, and he can give us fresh legs and won't give up kinda attitude.

Cons:

* Wages? (Possibly why wolves released when they were relegated)
* Recent injury problems - broken fibula.
* Has he got any pace left?
* Bit of a loose-cannon in his social life.

I like the idea though. I imagine he is being courted by a few clubs? Will agents fees be an issue?

I personally would be happy if we signed him. We still need a winger badly though.

&gt; Sensing that I'm getting sucked into a pointless argument with someone who's just rehashing stuff he just Googled, but anyway

You couldn't be more wrong. This is an anonymous handle I created because I don't want to post under my real name since it conflicts with my work. I'm sorry that my real life experience doesn't match up with your fantasy characterization. 

&gt; So how exactly does that argue against ""Liverpool traditionally were never the biggest spenders in the English game""

Chelsea and City also spent big to get themselves back to the top as well. You can be more traditional and organic in your growth once you have a great team setup and you can attract players with your ambition. There is a direct correlation between the amount of money a team spends on attracting players and their wages and their performances on the pitch, if you don't have the later then you need the early. Every team that wants to grow invests in the squad, it is economics 101. 

Before Rodgers Liverpool didn't have a single academy graduate make it into the first team for over a decade. So much for that 'tradition'. All supporters of all clubs like to refer to the homegrown method as the traditional method and ignore the 50% of the time in their history where they spent large sums of money. City do (Hart, Kompany, SWP, Sturridge), Chelsea (Terry, Lampard, McEchran). No fans of any club like admitting that their team at some point in history has had to fall back on spending money, especially not Liverpool and United fans (each who at some point invested a large portion of their total net worth into purchasing players, at a scale far larger than Chelsea and City have). 

Liverpool weren't even in the first division. What changed, was it the new ownership and investment or something else? (since you are such an avide and knowledgable fan, surely I don't need to fill you in on the details here, right? *surely* you know what i'm talking about, since you have watched all the games in the last 120 years).

All you are doing is attempting to excuse the periods of spending by saying there were other times where homegrown players were graduated. Well, every club can make that same argument. 

I don't know why you would be so critical of somebody who goes out and learns something via Google or Wikipedia, it might explain why you are blind to facts, do you think it is beneath somebody to actually learn something and the only way to learn something is to watch games? I think you should take some of your own advice and read some of the football economics books, or some of the excellent blogs on the topic, because IMO it is embarrassing to call yourself a fan of 30 years and not know that all clubs have gone through periods of having to spend money. 

It is going to be amusing when in 15 years time City and Chelsea fans who are like yourself will complain about how Leeds' or West Ham's rise to prominence isn't ""traditional"" and that they never had to spend money in that way, they always built their clubs from the ground up with youth etc. Your argument today is exactly that, and that is exactly how it would have been laughed at 20-30 years ago from other fans. 

Someone will say ""but they spent £35m on Aguero in 2011 and a fan like you will say ""stop googling things, that is nothing compared to the £170m West Ham just paid for Junior Neymar - City and Chelsea have *always* traditionally built from the academy, that team was already good! blah blah blah"", etc. etc. etc. and on and on the cycle continues.

true,Randommook,null,null,"&gt; look at comic books that often retcon changes

actually comic books are rather obsessed with continuity and go out of their way to give explanations for why things happen within the story.

As an example: When they decided to retcon Spiderman's marriage to Mary Jane they didn't just one day have Spiderman no longer married to Mary Jane for no apparent reason. They had an entire storyline about how Spiderman had to make a deal with the Marvel Universe devil and in the deal had to give up his marriage as part of the price. The storyline was consistent with the established rules in the universe and the writers didn't just change the world with no explanation.

EDIT: To further explain what I mean...

When you are writing a story and you give a character a gun and tell the audience ""This is a gun. It shoots bullets"" you cannot then have the gun shoot flowers 4 chapters later without giving the audience an explanation. Your explanation could be something like ""Doctor Reality was altering reality those times"" but there needs to be something there to clue the audience in to the reason for the sudden change in established behaviour.

With Captain Jack the problem is that they were very specific about Jack's immortality and then suddenly they start saying ""oh yea Jack is aging very slowly"" at which point the audience is now scratching their head saying ""Wait but earlier you were very specific to stress the fact that Jack was now a universal constant"" and the audience is never really given an answer and then while the audience is still mulling over that the show goes ""Oh yea and he's also going to turn into a giant head in a jar"".",0,1380265415,null,0,1380266001,0,ccgau07,t3_1n7was,t1_ccgau07,t1_ccgahbv,null,1429327690,0,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,0

Because if psycho is allowed on the understanding that it means psychotic. then why not allow 'mental patient' - as apparently there are quite a few mental disorders that can lead to psychosis. If you're expected to read the implication that ""psycho = psychotic"", why not expect people to understand that ""mental patient = a seriously psychotic patient and not just suffering from a mood disorder""?

that obviously doesnt really fit with the hobbitish mentality, but to live in communities like that you just cant really have any globalisation, globalisation which is largely the result of those same peoples consumerism. so really the collective choice is do we continue to live a consumerist lifestyle with all the luxuries that entails, or do we get rid of it all and return to localism and close knit communities, i'd choose the latter, but i think generally people prefer the gadgets and mod cons of consumerism. even if people wanted to, i dont think they could get away from it now given that we live in a service economy and so many people's livelihoods depend on other peoples consumerism.

still, a lot of people here have no hope of both living a decent life and affording to pay off a mortgage/save enough to retire and keep paying their rents, getting priced out of the entire country and cant see any escape because they dont see that europe is now open to them too, that there are countries where it is far cheaper and more feasible to buy/rent and live comfortably.

even working in unskilled labor in the uk, save your money and you could go to eastern europe and live pretty well, get a house and just take it easy only having to pay for utilities and sustenance, hence why there are so many eastern european folks working in the UK, back there it's a lot of money. again its that hobbitish uncomfortableness with moving out into a new culture, people here dont seem aware or willing to take advantage of the parts of globalisation which are in their favour.

Seriously though: I'm amazed that it's gone on as long as it has.  It's only because grave sites are subsidised that this is even possible.  If you want use of your grave from your death until the end of time, then you should have to stump up a fair market price for that rental.  You're getting exclusive use of it after all.

true,RedPartridge,eng-warwickshire,Warwickshire to Rotherhithe,"As a side point, and acknowledging this is perhaps not what you were getting at AND being a little bit devil's advocate here AND totally using this to tell a great story... But British lack of integration doesn't make it alright for people coming to Britain to not integrate. Just because there are examples of people re-creating little, idiotic English faux-pubs in Spain does not mean it's excusable to do the reverse here. Although it does make it more understandable.

A bit of back story to my attitude on this. My incredibly conservative, proudly working class, all Englishman Granddad is an utter inspiration to me. He was a driving instructor in the Army just after the war, then joined GEC in the 50's as a salesman. They wanted him to sell off the Bedford Lorries he once drove in the army, as they had a massive surplus and he knew them well.

Edward B. Partridge has never left Britain in his life. Neither has his father, nor his, nor his and so on. Before the war Ted had never left Warwickshire and, even during, he'd never even been to London. My family had been in the midlands for hundreds of years and it showed. He spoke very accented English, spat his nut shells into his warm bitter (then drank it), distrusted every Frenchman and American immediately (apologies), and used to take apart cars (British only) on his weekend for fun. Englishman through and through. So, obviously, they shipped him to Turkey. 

Here is Ted Partridge dropped in post-war Turkey. Suit, hat, briefcase, off the ship. The heat hits him first, then the dress, then the language. He is blown away. Something snaps in his head, I like to imagine.

He bins the suit. First suit he ever owned, simply binned somewhere in Istanbul. Why? 'Too English'. Next, he went to pay his respect at the mosque (after finding some more suitable clothing). Not that he understood Islam or Muslims in the slightest. He wasn't even allowed inside, so he sat on the wet floor outside the mosque in silence while the Muslims prayed. He did this every single day for the three years he ended up there.

He ate no English food (his language got colourful about the initial results of that), didn't touch a drop of drink and forced himself to learn Turkish over a long, painful period. His translator found this mad Englishman’s obsession with the right etiquette a little difficult. He certainly sold more cars than anyone else, partly because of the buyers finding a man white man screaming incoherent Turkish while wearing a fez a novelty. 

But he tried and, eventually, fitted in. He did well, so they kept shipping him around. My Granddad proudly continued the trend. Wearing only the best suits in Rome, being a good Catholic in Poland and even keeping his mouth very shut in East Germany. Spent years in each place and always tried his best. Even got his other English friends to join in. I remember finding this hard to believe, until I asked him why, and he simply went, with a grin of two teeth, ""Common courtesy"".

We British have a long, long way to go before we can be better Europeans, better Ex-pats or even better world citizens. Our fellow countrymen in foreign countries sometimes set a bad example but not always. The recreation of home environments is an easy, comfortable thing to do. But it's not the right thing. My best friend from University was first generation Bangladeshi and you couldn't tell him apart from fifth or sixth. The horror stories he told, as his family rejected him for wanting to go to Uni or dating a white girl, were plenty and heart-breaking. 

All I am saying is that, while Tebbit might be over-exagerating, we should always work towards the healthy balance of respect for land we live and respect for the land we come from. I do think that, living in London, I see that balance skewed a little too often. Still, we can make it better. I keep a little Warwickshire flag tucked away in my London flat to remind me of that, placed on top of a Bedford truck model. Common courtesy.

I think of it like this. if one person ends up with all of the world's money then the money is worth nothing even to the person who owns it since everyone else would start helping each other out in exchange for commodities or invent a new currency. Businesses can't make 100% for very long because society would crumble.

conversely a communist society always ends up working out badly for the people since the state holds all of the money and it either ends up being used by corrupt officials or rescources end up being hoarded and people are only given what they need to survive, which seems like a futile existance to me.

my initial comment was in response to an tongue in cheek sarcastic comment, but to answer you.

&gt;If you're then wondering what halal kebab shops have to do with street beheadings, I can ask what street beheadings have to do with pubs.

as i say glib comment in response to glib comment.

&gt;I used halal kebab shops as an example of Muslims affecting The British Way Of Life.

kebab shops are halal everyone knows that if you don't agree with their prehistoric and barbaric forms of slaughter vote with your wallet and don't eat at them, and campaign to overturn the bullshit religious 'get out of jail free' card that all religion plays to carry on like its living in the middle ages.

Absolutely....But looking at the long term, a more active population would lead to less health and mobility problems. Sitting in a car to travel what was once a walking distance perpetuates problems like this.

You're points are valid, and I agree with them, but also, those points are solvable. Only thing that's lacking is the will.

Rossco has superb movement but keeps having to come so deep to get the ball because no-one else is capable of those creative flourishes (or at least, no one else on the pitch at that point).

He'd work the ball wide, put in a good cross, but no one would be attacking the far post.  I'm not even talking about set pieces, just open play there's very little happening in the box.

I do think we should be playing Diouf at the moment; his ball control is exceptional and he does have the vision (and flair) to make openings.  We just need someone other than Ross to be on the end of them.

For me it is and always would be Billy Sharp.  I've always been impressed with his movement and ability to find a yard of space.  

If we don't get someone in, I'd be interested to see Varney, Diouf and Ross playing up top.  Rely on Diouf to be the provider, Varney to chase balls down and Ross to be our striker.

I would hope that we do get someone of proven quality in.  Shane Long would be nice, but given his prospective £5m tag and Brian's statement about only bringing in players he wants long-term, I suspect that wouldn't be an option.

The reason these places exist can be attributed to Blair's policies for Academy schools.

I went to one of these schools, and it was funded by an extremely devout Christian who runs a well known car dealership in the North-east and Scotland. 

He chooses who to make principal, and by extension the entire ethos and attitude of the school. 

These kinds of freedoms create and environment where religious teachers are more likely to work at the school (not through discrimination, just through religious teachers WANTING to work there), and because of the good funding and good choice of teachers, usually pretty good teachers, meaning they become successful schools.

Genetic studies

In 2008, a study was performed to attempt to find a link between genes and transsexuality. The researchers compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cis-gendered male controls. The male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than non-transsexual males to have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male to female transsexuals. The authors say that it is possible that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might result in incomplete masculinization of the brain in male to female transsexuals, resulting in a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.[102][103]",0,1380282770,null,0,false,0,ccgcxcp,t3_1n0xxi,t1_ccgcxcp,t1_ccfnna4,null,1429326715,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"This is astounding. I can't believe it's gotten this far. I thought we'd already gone through all this with the joke called Workfare. Put people in job roles to earn their benefits, there's an opening for paid employment gone.

And anyway, isn't benefits paid out of national insurance? We pay money for National Insurance, it covers for when we need benefits, healthcare or pensions. Those that haven't paid yet probably eventually will, and on balance, the vulnerable get the safety net they need, everyone gets the healthcare they need and when we're old we all get a pension. That's how welfare should work.

The way I see it, benefits aren't something that should be earned. They should be a safety net for the most vulnerable members of society, to allow them to function and give them what they need while they are in need. For those with illnesses and disabilities that are long term, then the benefits are long term. For those unexpectedly unemployed, it keeps them alive while they're in the rut until they can get another job.

Having said that, there's certainly something to be said for the routine and sense of purpose of working while unemployed. I don't believe 30+ hours is the right way to go about it, and I don't believe it should be for for-profit organisations, but I do think it's a good idea to get out of the house, meet people and engage in productive activity while unemployed. I should think 8 hours a week sufficient, in two shifts of 4 hours or one of 8 - to demonstrate willingness to work and to gain experience, make friends and keep a routine, not to mention a connection with the world outside your house.

When I was unemployed two years ago I worked two or sometimes three 4 hour shifts in the Cancer Research shop in town. I really enjoyed it and looked forward to it every week. There were people to talk to, it was the runup to Christmas so there was a great atmosphere, and it got me out of the house. Plus I was helping an organisation that does great work.

That's the sort of thing I would like to see jobseekers encouraged to do (not required, at least not in the first few months, but actively encouraged; I was not encouraged by the job centre. They told me if I did more than 16 hours a week at the Cancer Research shop it would count as me not being available for work and thus ineligable for JSA, even though I could ""quit"" at the drop of a hat).

There are numerous charities and community initiatives that would really benefit from having volunteers helping them out, and there are a shortage of volunteers. Surely that's the answer: request that jobseekers find somewhere to help out for 8 hours a week that could really do with the help. Charities are helped, local community events are helped, the community as a whole benefits, and the jobseeker benefits - and it doesn't cost the government extra ""subsiding"" training at for-profit stores.

Oh, and the jobseeker can pick what they help, provided the job centre is happy with their choice and a suitable supervisor (store manager, teacher, Akela etc) signs a piece of paper each week to confirm they've been there and helped.",0,1380282860,null,0,false,0,ccgcxu1,t3_1n8l8h,t1_ccgcxu1,t3_1n8l8h,null,1429326708,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35

Interestingly, it was Great Western stock used on the Metropolitan line for the first few years. The Tube had three classes for ages, and were required to offer third class transport by law. Eventually, second class was abolished (the companies hated the expense of running three classes) and third class made the equivalent, so trains were running first and third class. Then, at the start of the second world war, first class was removed from service...so strictly speaking, every tube train is all third-class.

As of [1844](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_train#Nineteenth_century_usage) by law all third-class carriages had to meet certain standards, including ""the provision of at least one train a day each way at a speed of not less than 12 miles an hour including stops, which were to be made at all stations, and of carriages **protected from the weather** and provided with seats; for all which luxuries not more than a penny a mile might be charged""

Congrats IDS, you hit the nail on the head.  Even people with full-time jobs can't pay the rent.  You have successfully identified the problem.  Now how about trying to fix the problem, instead of papering over the cracks?

This mandatory work stuff is flawed from the start.  The jobs won't be meaningful and lead to full-time employment.  Any company that needs an extra pair of hands and can afford to hire someone, will hire someone.  They want to be able to choose their staff, not get a bunch of people (and more than a few chavs) which they would have to hand-hold every day.

So the only companies taking part will be those that either A) can't afford to hire anyone but have too much work (no chance of being hired afterwards then), or B) the sort of scumbags that would replace their low-tier staff to get cheaper labour, or C) charities.  Except even the charities will back away, just like they did with the Mandatory Work Assignment scheme we have already.  It's too much bad publicity for charities who get volunteer help anyway.  So it'll be shit, meaningless, unpaid jobs that don't help to train or improve people, but will certainly help to demotivate them further.

IDS' constant attacks on the poor is nothing but pandering to a certain class of person. A person who has enough money not to worry about it, and sees the poor as a blight, instead of a problem to be solved.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"Immigrant integration when talked about in the negative always shows a one-sided view without addressing how integration is supposed to work and I will go on to say HAS worked and is working!

The basis of immigration, we have a country of people and more people want to come in.

Now my first problem in this comment is how should I refer to the existing population of Britain? I can't call us natives or indigenous people because that would be very inaccurate. This country already has a diverse population, most of whom HAVE integrated. So in real terms we're talking about a very small population of non-integrating immigrants.

The second problem is that integration works in 2 directions. Integration isn't just something 'outsiders' do, the 'insiders' have to accept, welcome and help the 'outsiders' integrate and this recently is where immigration is hitting a big stumbling block. Given time these pockets disperse and the insiders and outsiders merge. It has always been this way, there's even evidence in the Bible of cultures colliding and while this book isn't known for its historical accuracy, does give some indication. Integration is about all of us, not just them. So Tebbit mentions these pockets like it's a new thing. There are pockets of immigrants here in exactly the same way British ex-pats form pockets abroad. It isn't new, it's always been here and it's a natural transition when two cultures collide.

Right now it seems that a small proportion of UK nationals are standing in the doorway, arms folded saying ""Come through then, I'll stand here and not budge, it's your job to walk into the doorway and integrate, but you mustn't touch me"". Organisations like EDL, BNP and many individuals who share some of their beliefs feel unjustly victimised and help put up this resistance. The media shares opinions about why immigration is a bad thing while only pointing at the small pocket of immigrants forgetting the immigrant doctors and nurses who save lives every day. Immigrant fire fighters, immigrant police who save our sorry asses. Immigrant posties who work alongside British National posties and make sure we receive our bills on time (and cheques 2 weeks late)... immigration has worked, and is working if only we stop cherry picking our examples from those small pockets.

It has always been this way, Louis Armstrong fought hard to be accepted and was only allowed to even consider integrating because of his musical talent. He was however always treated like an outsider, and despite his fame was never truly accepted into white society. A thousand years ago it was Brits vs the French, a hundred years ago, it was the Brits vs the Blacks, today it's the Brits vs the Middle East. I foresee in another 50 years it will be Brits vs the East Asians. Who knows. It's not acceptable but the situation has always been here. There is one factor I've ignored of course... The rate of migration is much higher due to the affordability of travel. Flying by jet is now very easy, quick and relatively cheap. This has helped migration greatly, but we have to remember, ""they"" are not all coming here. Opening up this tunnel-vision view of how immigration works we see people travelling all over the world. We're mixing faster so pockets are forming faster, but they are also dispersing faster hampered only by the Muslim/non-Muslim clash which is facing resistance from both sides. Once barriers are broken, pockets will disperse more quickly. Tebbit's comments sadly keep the ""us"" and ""them"" separate reinforcing the view that it's ""their"" fault and there is nothing ""we"" can do to stop it.

My final point is that this kind of societal divide is not restricted to immigration. There are pockets of mansion houses and enclosed British villages who don't like outsiders and refuse to integrate. We have definitive class divides in this country which are being made bigger by the day thanks to the current and past governments. Poor people are being forced out of London by hefty taxes while the Rich are drawn in. The fact that immigrants appear in each and every one of these pockets, suggest the immigration divide isn't causing as much of a problem as Tebbit suggests. The barriers between cultures are always breaking down slowly allowing happy integration. The barriers between classes are being reinforced and made bigger and stronger every day. More people move from cultural pocket into full integration more quickly than poor people break into the upper classes.",0,1380284266,null,0,false,0,ccgd5v7,t3_1n8j0i,t1_ccgd5v7,t3_1n8j0i,null,1429326604,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

true,newpathstohelicon,scot-lanarkshire,Glesga,"&gt; It's a good question. It could be that our culture is just naturally difficult to integrate into or that, like you said, we aren't every welcoming or a bit of both, or a combination of that plus unwillingness to integrate at the same time.

I think there is an element of both. There are unquestionably people who come here and look down on our culture with disdain, but then there are also native Brits who believe every word about immigrants that's printed in the Mail and regard them with suspicion or outright hostility.

It **can** work, though. Where I live in Glasgow, the population is about 1/2 South Asian, 1/4 Eastern European, 1/4 white Brits (mostly Scots of Irish descent) and a relatively small number of Africans. People get along. They recently opened a new Gurdwara for the Sikh community, and at the opening there were Sikhs, Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, etc. all mingling and enjoying some (damn fine) food. The Eastern Europeans hang out on the street corners at night in groups, chatting to the Scots (who are there because there's a pub on just about every street corner).

It's a very community-minded place, and even the gruff old bastards who inhabit the pubs are surprisingly tolerant (sort of). Ended up in a conversation one night about high crime rates in nearby areas, and was told ""Aye, they'll try and blame all the immigrants for that, but it's a load of pish - they work harder than anyone else here. It's us Irish pricks that are doing all the robbing.""",0,1380284602,null,0,false,0,ccgd81q,t3_1n8j0i,t1_ccgd81q,t1_ccgczlt,null,1429326575,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

The tax used to 'create' the government job would have been used by the consumer elsewhere if the government hadn't taken it. The difference is that when the consumer spends the money themselves the job that is created is of direct benefit to them (they would not spend it otherwise), whereas a government job is unlikely to be of greater benefit and may well be of far less benefit. Another point worth noting is that by spending the money through government, additional bureaucracy is required to distribute the money. This reduces the total spending on productive labour and moves it into unproductive bureaucracy.

I am long term unemployed (2 years), but have kept my hand in my field during that time on a voluntary basis, alongside voluntary work for different charities.  I've also kept up to date with training courses (an advantage of doing voluntary work).  This all helps me a lot, both in terms of reducing the negative feelings and in hopefully keeping my CV looking respectable enough for the jobs I do apply for.  If compulsory work (what? some shitty mindless, meaningless task?) would probably remove the opportunity I have to do what I have been doing.  It would certainly make it much harder for me to spend the many hours I do tailoring my applications and experience for a particular post. I also suspect it would make me feel like shit.  I certainly do every time I go to the job centre to be told I'm not trying hard enough to find work.

For what you suggest to work resources need to be ploughed into providing opportunities for people to find their own way out.  Whether through training, voluntary work or whatever.  Providing opportunities allows empowerment and hope.  Making this compulsory will destroy people's opportunities, self-belief, and self confidence.

You have a good point.  But for it to be addressed would require HUGE investment.  This isn't going to happen.  This policy to me just sounds like a way of getting cheap labour for the big noises.

But - phone bills being cheaper than they were in 1984 is not really an achievement - consider what's happened in the telecommunications industry since then. We can't be quantitative with what-ifs, but I don't think a hypothetical non-privatised BT wouldn't take advantage of cheaper tech.

Privatisation only works (= delivers better service for less) if you have a genuine free market. This is extraordinarily rare. In the case of the Royal Mail, the capital expenditure for Private Competitor to buy post offices, sorting offices, vans, lorries, planes, staff, and Compulsory Purchase postboxes means that the market is essentially impossible to enter. The only area where we can get genuine competition is in parcel delivery and couriers - and we already have it.

The way the current privatisation has got round this restriction is by allowing private companies to 'buy into' the Royal Mail delivery network - so UKMail et al. can do the (cheap and easy) hub-to-hub lorry traffic, while paying RM a pittance to do the last mile delivery. This is an absurd distortion from a free market and would be cancelled the instant as soon as RM is privatised - leaving them with a huge natural monopoly.

BT Wholesale have a private monopoly, hence why they're terrible. TalkTalk, Sky, BT (phone service) et al are all acting in something close to an actual free market - which is why they're much better.

There's not enough jobs available, so why the obsession to make everyone work?

Would everyone REALLY be so much happier if all unemployed people were made to build little towers out of lego, send them to the next room, where another group take them apart, and deliver it back to the first room?

It just seems like we want people to work when the work's not there, because we've been told over and over to feel angry about those unfortunate enough to not be able to support themselves as technology and efficiency, and the globalisation of labour has eliminated jobs.

Perhaps we should ask why we're not all doing well on a 3 day week, and instead we're struggling on 40-60 hours a week, and there's select few sitting on billions and employing people to make sure none of it slips away to the taxman to fund welfare?

EDIT: I agree that voluntary work should be encouraged, and I'd actually allow people to stop being made to look for work so constantly, if they're doing a certain amount of voluntary work, and I don't mean 40 hours.

I do, and my 'boss' says she was approached to take some 'volunteers' from the Jobcentre, but as she couldn't give them 35 hours a week, she wasn't allowed any.

Shes a 19 year old girl, with no father, who works in retail, with a clearly promiscuous mum. 
Psychologically speaking, when an older man shows up, takes her away from all of that, changes her life, her views on the world in a matter of hours, that can have an effect on a person...I'd think. There is danger, but he rescues her. This is important. A female with, lets say 'daddy issues' is put in a situation, normally she feels she has to rely on herself as men have not been a permanent fixture in her life, and yet, she finds on she can rely on in a quite literal life or death situation. (I'm talking the impending doom of platform one) This is going to have an emotional pull on her. Mix that with her mothers natural promiscuous nature and you have a learned recipe for disaster, fleeing, and avoidance of her original situation. 

You could say initially she was 'acting out'. However, it turned into a genuine emotional bond, someone thought she was more than just some chav, which led to what I could assume is a stronger emotional attachment than any. She WAS with her father who died, whom she had no real relationship with, the Doctor had forged a friendship, a kinship, and romantically there was obviously something going on.

I'd imagine being stuck with your dead father instead of your boyfriend, wouldn't be unlike someone who wanted to meet their birth parent, and then having someone with them for years ripped away from them, and being stuck in a two bedroom flat with this stranger they THOUGHT they wanted, but come to realize quickly, they don't actually know. They just have a romanticized notion of what it COULD have been, had they been a part of their life the whole time.

My problem is that I am over-qualified but under experienced.  Feedback from job interview is repeatedly that they would give me the job if it wasn't for someone with more hands on experience.

I think it will be building experience (or rather contacts....) in different areas that ultimately enables me to get a job.  I can only afford to do this because of practical help from those close to me.  The way I see it the best way to help is by enabling people to get experience (read contacts) by providing training, work opportunities, child care, assertiveness training, psychological help, whatever it may be.  In my experience the only help that is offered is fairly pointless training in something like basis IT skills.  This would not help me in the slightest.  I have good IT skills.  And anyway, nobody is going to offer a low paid filing or typing job to a PhD whatever the lady in the job centre says.

However it would seem that it is an example of a moment in history in which the short term effects of expanding governmental employment (the effect of shrinking jobs in the private sector tends not to be seen until signals in the market filter through) were worth the long term detriments. It is not a good model for a permanent economic situation.

It is probably worth stating that jobs created by government can and do have important purposes. In the case of the New Deal, the level of unemployment following the great depression was so high that providing jobs at the cost of overall future productivity was likely a good decision. However it should be understood that whenever government expands there is always a trade off between employment and growth.

Of course it's not a particularly useful term unless you're a white nationalist, my point was merely that it's not 'very inaccurate' to say that many of the people of this country are 'indigenous' in some sense - in this instance a genetic one, as many people have a link here which is thousands of years old, as old as many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. 

Of course that doesn't mean I believe that immigrants and their descendants can't be British. Most people will also have some ancestry from ancient or more recent migrations. I consider myself English, but of my 32 3xgreat grandparents one is Italian, 3 Scottish, 4 Ulster-Scots, 12 Irish and 12 English.

true,slicksps,welsh,Swansea,"Because for the sake of the integration argument, I have to combine the very small true indigenous population of Britain (assuming there is a genuinely pure line) with those distant immigrants who can be called nothing but British despite physical appearances.

A [DNA study published in 2012](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22560092/reload=0;jsessionid=E12V1YvRRgYHudMU7WFJ.14) shows that the oldest current British lineage migrated here from the Middle East at the height of the last ice age.

However evidence has been found of a hominini settlement over 700,000 years ago. Although these aren't strictly homo sapiens, they are still in the human branch and therefore more indigenous than the Middle Eastern immigrants.

If we want to focus on pure humans and not complicate the argument with the fact that evolution happened, the first anatomically human population was the Cro-Magnons 29,000 years ago. These must therefore be the true indigenous human population.

However...

There is a reported absence of human beings for about 5000 years during the last ice age. If the Cro-Magnons died off or left Britain, then the only true indigenous population of Britain are long gone.

So as the ice age was ending, a tribe of Middle Eastern travellers settled here in Britain. From there the [Beaker People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_people) continued the influx of migrants. Do they inherit the title of 'indigenous'? or are they now invades? In the Iron age we had an influx of [La Tene people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne) reportedly travelling from Belgium and settling again. All this is without invasion or war.

Then we have mass invasion from the Romans, Germanic wars, Viking invasions, Norman Conquests, the Danish invasion of 1069 and so on and so on and so on.

So from that list, who are the true indigenous people of Britain? And how can we find a true, pure indigenous person?

Shall I complicate things to suggest that human beings are highly sexual animals. With each migration, invasion, colonisation, genes were shared. And thank goodness too! Over 19,000 years we're talking around 800+ generations of human beings in Britain, and if there is a surviving pure line of Brits, they would probably be the least healthy creatures on the planet...

So no, I don't believe Britain has a living true indigenous population and hasn't done for a very long time. I can see skin colour, hair colour, eye colour... you tell me genetically which are native to this country and which aren't. If the indigenous population really are from the Middle East, then the BNP and EDL's opinion on what looks British is very wrong indeed.",0,1380289962,null,0,false,0,ccgef49,t3_1n8j0i,t1_ccgef49,t1_ccgdh7t,null,1429325956,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

The bays are incorrectly marked with double white lines at the end.  These should only be used when individual bays are marked.  Parking bays that are long and continuous, for multiple cars, without individual marked bays, should be terminated with a single line.  Many councils make this mistake.  Leeds council agreed that their bays were unenforceable and cancelled the ticket.  They've since been repainted.

Second time was here:

http://goo.gl/maps/Ous2r

Exactly the same issue.  I'd paid for a parking ticket but from a machine on the opposite side of the road.  I didn't realise each side of the road had different regulations.  Luckily for me, the council had fucked up the parking bays and couldn't enforce the ticket.  They gave me some bollocks excuse about ""losing the paperwork and it wouldn't be fair to pursue you"".  Note how the bays have been repainted since this photograph, which I took on the day:

Third time was in a council-run car park at a popular country location.  It was completely full and there was nowhere else to park (not for miles), so I parked out of the way, but not in a marked bay.  I was ticketed for some kind of obstruction.  The ticket was incorrect in the number of days it specified I pay within, so I went to the adjudicator, who ruled that the car park's traffic regulation order made no provision for ""obstruction"", and that the ticket was therefore unenforceable.",0,1380291097,null,0,false,0,ccgeqwg,t3_1n8ixw,t1_ccgeqwg,t1_ccgcdhs,null,1429325803,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

There may be a few problems getting a reasonably paid job in theatre as many (all?) have lost a large proportion of government funding due to the austerity measures. However, there are still venues, and they still employ people.

I work at music festivals and they tend to employ people who have first worked as interns/free volunteers - with the exception of the security, bar and technical staff. So it's likely you'd have to find other work to start with. There are vacancies, so just keep sending applications and something will turn up.

My local theatre, the Marlowe in Canterbury, employs quite a few people and what they look for is flexibility - someone who can work front-of-house, help the lighting riggers, serve coffee etc - they want people who can lend a hand where it's needed. The pay isn't great but the work is fun, and it's certainly enough to live on.

More technical jobs such as stage electrics are difficult to get, but once you're known in the industry it shouldn't be such a struggle.

&gt;Oh, I can't afford a flat in London, but I can afford three in Derby. I'll buy them for cash, then not live there, and force up the cost of living in Derby, and force people to move out of the town. That sounds healthy.

That sounds like a good investment*

if housing in derby is cheap, that means it's cheaper to buy a house in derby. If you want to cry about the fact you can't afford to live in a 20000m^2 penthouse in the square mile, yet you're not willing to actually move further out, I have zero sympathy for you.

I'm confused here, do you literally believe there is enough room in central london for everyone employed there? do you seriously believe that foreigners are buying property in the city then intentionally leaving it empty, or do you actually understand that it is going to be occupied whether the owner is euro-sceptical anglojesus or mao zedong? 

Everyone wants to live in central london. There is not enough room for everyone to live in central london. Therefore the price of housing rises until the number of people who can afford to live in central london roughly matches the number of spaces they can live in. It doesn't matter if you subsidize housing for some people, you're *still* kicking some other people out.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"Of all the ""I am moving to the UK"" posts I have seen, this seems like the most realistic I've seen for a while. 

You absolutely must move in with someone and live for free on a couch or whatever when you arrive if you can. This is a huge benefit. There is no way you could live in hotels while looking for work really, even cheap ones. The only alternative to this would be to save 6 months rent in advance and move into a prearranged shared flat/bedsit when you arrive. 

That said you should save as much as you can anyway because you'll probably need it even without paying rent the first month or so. When you arrive I would suggest just looking for any work you can find at the start, bar work, restaurant, supermarket. There's a bit of a jokey stereotype here that Aussies and Kiwis are naturally talented at bar work. Even then you probably won't be able to get the hours you want, but it's only for the meanwhile. 

Then you'd have to slog around trying to sniff out work in your chosen field, seeing what staff local theatres and productions are requiring, sadly it's not the type of area that is begging for labour. If you really want into it, you'll probably have to volunteer to work for free in your spare time for a while to try and get a leg in.

An alternative could be to apply for technical theatre roles while still in NZ once you have your British passport, with an intention to move as soon as you confirm the job. This would be ideal if you were older and were already highly experienced but sadly I think your age will harm your prospects of that. I'm not knocking your current experience, and the fact you've worked for production companies before will count buckets, but in the minds of most people there is only so much experience an 18 year old can possibly have. You're still quite a risk as an employee at that age simply because the fact that you've done something before isn't so much of an indication that you won't change your mind. 

As for the property market, you're not a buyer so all that really matters is how property is effecting rental. I wouldn't worry too much about this if you're looking outside of London, since even swankiest parts of most provincial cities are no more than 30 minutes bus ride from somewhere more reasonable. It's only really London where even poor areas are expensive for buyers/rentees for miles around since everyone wants to be as central as they can afford to be. That said you'd do well to research heavily before signing anything and you'll be able to do this ten times better when you can physically look at rental properties. 

Although that brings me to another problem which is transport. The UK has really good public transport, and that's great for the daily commute. But the type of work you're looking at is rather sporadic in demand. It really helps if you can jump in a car and travel 60 miles to help with a production at the drop of a hat, and this is going to be very hard without a car, especially if you're going to be working around Bristol and South-Wales. 

My advice to you would be do you your research, and then agree a length of time you can stay with your relatives, then use that time to diligently search for work and establish yourself a job with regular pay asap. Once you've got an income focus on moving out before you overstay your welcome and find a 6 month / 1 year rental contract you can afford. Once you're at that stage then you can work on finding a technical job in theatre, and if you need getting yourself sorted with a vehicle of some sort. You should bear in mind if you need a car then you'll have to resit your driving licence after you've been here for 12 months and for this you should budget hundreds of pounds. Finally you must realise that the more money you can save before you come here, the easier you will find the transition and and the more likely it is to succeed. Good luck.

true,notnotcitricsquid,cnty-uk,Stafford,"I pay a bunch of taxes (my deductions are greater than the average person earns per year...) and I've dealt with that bullshit attitude from my own family. They complain about people feeding off of the tax payers taxes... while they're earning very little which means they're not even paying any damn taxes, or the amount of tax they pay is inconsequential. 

It seems there's 3 types of people: 

1. People earning nothing and are happy to have the benefits available to them (but wish for more) and are thankful
2. People earning &lt;= average salary and whine about how all their taxes are going on scroungers
3. People earning a good salary... who are happy to see a small amount of their taxes used to help people

The TOTAL DEDUCTIONS for someone earning £20,000 per year is £3,579, of that £1,299 goes towards benefits and pensions and of that I think £520 is pensions (don't have the figure to hand but it's around 40% if I remember correctly). So a person on £20,000 per year (an *okay* salary) is contributing under £800 towards the entire benefits system, so let's say that's £200 to JSA. If a person earning £20,000 per year goes onto JSA they will consume their entire yearly contribution in... 3 weeks.

It's the stupid egotistical need to feel like their taxes are super important and that their taxes could be better used changing the world, except they don't and they won't. I bet half the damn people complaining on that Dailymail story are people claiming child benefit or working tax credits. Nothing wrong with claiming them (they're there to help!) but to take help and criticise those also using help is bullshit.

Genuinely angers me when people act like those on JSA are leeches making it so ""honest tax payers"" are unable to feed their families, when the reality is JSA is so inconsequential the government could raise it to £100 per week and nobody would really notice.

Cameron's bad but the rumours around Boris are becoming rife and Ed's in the process of ripping his own campaign up with what can fairly be described as economic vandalism.  Ed couldn't have done himself more harm with his energy policy than if he'd taken a machine gun to the hull of his campaign.  His energy policy is going to be his Gordon Brown *'selling the gold'* moment, and it's going to run and run.  One sentence and he undermined nearly every argument for major outside  investment in the UK for the next 2 years.

The one concern people had with Labour was trusting it with the economy again.  All fears have been confirmed.  He completely overshadowed his earlier gaffes on apprenticeship.

I felt like the stuff I was doing for the jobcentre was box ticking so I could afford to feed myself, and the actual job hunting I was doing (not to mention researching PhD opportunities - which takes a fuckton of time) was what was really helping me, and they didn't care. And the week I only applied to two jobs, because every single other job available was either (a) a welding job nearby, (b) an underpaid internship in London where I wouldn't be able to afford to live and have no friends (c) something I'm grossly underqualified for (directorships and so on) or (d) a two hour a week cleaning job in two shifts, far enough away that the pay was less than it would cost me in fuel getting there.

Meanwhile, the two jobs I'd applied for were suitable for my qualifications and I'd spent two days that week putting together a PhD proposal, which they didn't want to count towards my efforts jobhunting but I managed to persuade them to.

Edit: oh, and in the end, I didn't get work through the job centre, I got it at the company my Dad works for - he happened to chat to a couple of the people on his floor, both of whom were looking for people in their teams. He made me apply for the business development internship (requiring a business degree - I don't have one) and I was resistant to applying for the other one as a result but I did anyway and I got it. But because of a hiring freeze right that took effect right after my interview, I had to wait. My now-boss suggested I come in for a week's work experience while they were waiting for the hiring freeze to stop. Job centre said no, I couldn't do that as it meant I would be ""unavailable for work"" for that week and I wouldn't get benefits. My boss would have to arrange it with the job centre. This caused delays and I had to do two weeks in the end.

But yes, it was clearly slanted, all the more so from the perspective of a left winger.  The journalist has been praised by the Daily Mail and expressed staunchly right wing views, so it's not just me nor even a random someone from the centre who would view her as hard right (doubly telling given how far the centre has drifted).  Gove obviously is right, given he's a Tory without much moisture in him.  UKIP are to the right of the Tories.  Labour, these days, aren't remotely left, a centrist might see them as left of centre, but that's only because the centre has shifted substantially over the last few decades.  They're not socialist, nor left wing, nor even remotely anti-capitalist.  Christ, they're embarrassed to even be seen as Keynesian or (shock horror) pro worker.  And this guy, who's name I never knew and though I heard it I instantly forgot, was a supporter of David Milliband who was not close enough to be purged when the Blairite right winger didn't win.  So let's call him a centrist at best.  Then there was Will Self, who I'll give you is a bit left - though far from uniformly so.  He's more of an iconoclast.  He's written for some moderately left wing rags (Guardian, Observer, New Statesman), written some ""shocking"" books, done a working class job, and done class A drugs, but he's still establishment (Oxford educated).  He was also the least trained/eloquent of the panel, though he writes better than he talks in scenarios like that.  There are much better presenters of genuinely left wing viewpoints they could put up as opposed to someone like him.  As it was, he looked a bit like a Fox News Aunt Sally.  Sorry, I kind of like some of his books, but that's the truth.

A lot of people are concerned about the amount of immigrants we have, but are scared to debate it for fear of being labeled racist.

Eddie Gray was saying how he would like to see Diouf playing more central and I feel that we wouldn't lose too much work rate because we know that McCormack can be both industrious and creative, even when playing in his favoured position on the shoulder of the last defender.

However, I think that when Diouf is on the pitch at the same time as McCormack, McDermott tries to play Diouf up front or change into a 4-3-3 formation. I guess that this might be because Diouf is simply losing mobility as he gets older and McDermott wants someone with more energy in the proverbial engine room.

Nevertheless, I think that the long-term answer is to get a more prolific goalscorer to play in a front two (or three) and we won't progress too far without one.",0,1380304892,null,0,false,0,ccgjnzq,t3_1n6r9v,t1_ccgjnzq,t1_ccg87kd,null,1429323441,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

It is true that the ex-pat community there are somewhat intolerable, and they are VERY cliquey; it's also so incestuous as to almost be alarming.

They are dripping with money which they don't know what to do with, and it's so boring that they have to pay people well over the odds to stay (probably a third/half more than salaries in Dubai). But it will give you 1) immense wealth and 2) access to travel to some amazing places.

As it happens there is one area that has been cut (in order to move money to other areas): local council budgets.  _All_ the austerity people are feeling comes from those cuts.  Central government always cuts local budgets because the local council always pays the political price for the cut.  I'd guess your wife worked for local government.  It wasn't an overall cut though, because that money went to other departments.

That being said, the overall picture is as I said, just look at the spending figures -- government spending is up.  There is no arguing with that -- so I'm not sure how that's ""delusional"".

(I enjoyed your ad hominem attack, but do feel free to fuck off you stupid, spendthrift, lefty twat; one of us is delusional, and I nominate the person who thinks money grows on trees and we can just borrow more and more because our children will all live on space planes made of gold).

It's interesting to note we spend more on Debt and management of it, than we do on Education or Defence.  Heck we spend about a third of what we do on the NHS just managing that debt! (You can see more figures here: http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/dailybread.html)

Now that isn't a problem.  Debt isn't a bad thing really, I've a lot of it, and I'm trying to get myself further into debt at the moment.  The reason is that my company (well I believe) will generate more income, than the cost of servicing the debt.

If we use the debt for things that make money (ie invest it) it's fine.  The problem is, does a shiny new School or Hospital make for increased tax returns?

I assume Northampton is not that expensive, you can apply to live there through holidays if you're not going home to the U.S. but you will have to move out during the summer.

Housing in Northampton is not expensive at all, but student housing isn't always in great condition (anywhere in the UK). In some cases it will be cheaper than halls. It's best to apply for student housing with friends (whom you will no doubt make) for your second year. Split costs etc.

Generally Northampton is good value for money and a pretty good University. Everything from nights out, food and shopping to your accommodation should be affordable and there are always job opportunities around Northampton.

How do you do that with drugs, where the dosage and severity of impedence not only varies massively between different drugs, they vary between different purities, forms, the way it was taken etc.

To expect the government to spend a fortune doing various expensive and inaccurate trials for dozens of different drugs is stupid.

“The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers. And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

By Allah, we swear by the almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone.

So what if we want to live by the Sharia in Muslim lands? Why does that mean you must follow us and chase us and call us extremists and kill us?

Rather you lot are extreme. You are the ones that when you drop a bomb you think it hits one person?

Or rather your bomb wipes out a whole family?

This is the reality. By Allah if I saw your mother today with a buggy I would help her up the stairs. This is my nature…

Through many passages in the (Arabic) Koran we must fight them as they fight us.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

I apologise that women had to witness this today but in our lands women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove your governments, they don’t care about you.

You think David Cameron is going to get caught in the street when we start busting our guns? You think politicians are going to die?

No, it’s going to be the average guy, like you and your children.

So get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so can all live in peace.

So leave our lands and we can all live in peace. That’s all I have to say.

Allah’s peace and blessings be upon you.

If we're looking at the facts, let's remind ourselves that modern 'American' football was largely a Canadian invention.  Although the Americans were playing something called 'football' already, it was something much closer to soccer until the Canadian contribution was made.  This is perhaps where the confusion over the name comes in, as it is at this point that they should have changed the name of the game to something more appropriate, but didn't.

&gt; Harvard University organized a football team in 1873, but it had trouble finding an opponent. In 1874 Harvard invited McGill University of Montreal to send a team to Massachusetts for a game in May. As the teams warmed up before the game, they realized that they were not practicing the same game. The McGill players were running with the ball, because for them, “football” was a form of rugby. The teams agree to play one game of each of their two types of football. The Harvard team ended up liking the rugby version better. Harvard took its revised game to Yale the next year, and the popularity of the new form of football began to spread.

[source](http://www.electro-mech.com/team-sports/football/who-invented-american-football/)

McGill University in Montreal can proudly claim to be inventor (or at last partial inventor) of Basketball, American Football, and modern Hockey (really, the only truly homegrown 'American' sport is baseball, and even that finds its roots in Cricket and the general British team sport tradition).

Keep in mind, too, that these were people who would've described themselves as 'British' at the time.

Canada's CFL pre-dates the NFL by *78 years*. Also, our balls are bigger.

I also wonder why being gay is not a choice, but choosing your sex suddenly is?  That seems like irrational logic to me.  Which is it?  Is gender and attraction a quality from birth, or is it socially constructed, or is it totally up to the individual, or what? Make up your minds.  

And I don't think it is as simple as a choice, I think they feel compelled to, much like schizophrenics feel compelled to check to make sure there are no listening devices in their house, or people with that disorder that makes people want to cut off their arm end up doing so.  My point is, it seems like a disorder where the person's thoughts about themselves are at odds with reality.  And that kind of way of living should not be normalized, society should encourage the most truthful ways of living possible.  

And people say that transexuals feel like they're trapped in another sexes body, but all of the people like that that I've ever met very clearly act like men who are ""trying"" to act like a woman.  There is a distinct difference between a woman who is just being a woman, and someone who is trying to act like a woman.

Long story short, I think it is a neurotic behavior, worthy of some attention, but ought not to be normalized, although it's popular to think it should be, but mostly because people can't think for themselves and just repeat what is told to them, as evidenced by the almost religious unexamined repeatings of feminist canon I have gotten as responses to my posts.

In a war called ""The Welsh Revolt"" it was the last battle of independence until the English took full control of Wales and destroyed the legacy that was the King of the Britons.

Rarely talked about, it's a legacy that went back as far as the Celtic tribes during the Roman Invasion. Within a 15 year war, that 1500 year heritage, was stomped out by the English and it's something they managed to keep quiet about.

Also the term ""Sheep Shagger"" actually comes from a thing called ""The Englishman's Habit"", where Welsh people would steal herds of sheep from the English and if they got caught, they would claim to have sex with them. Thus avoiding the death penalty and able to continue stealing more sheep. So in other words, it was a gigantic joke against the English, to continue being able to steal from them.

Cameron's position is that it is ""a debate between different people in Scotland about whether to stay or separate and that's where you have to hold the debate"".

Darling is a back-bench opposition MP; he's clearly not Salmond's counterpart, any more than Dennis Canavan is Cameron's counterpart. The six individuals who you might want to see debate are:

In terms of keeping their jobs we all know private business will attempt to cut costs. This will mean job losses and streamlining of the business.

true,dick-clegorand,null,null,"&gt; But even so, you're admitting a problem ""not longer than 1 hour"", with the D-Lock solution.

It totally depends where I am. But, yeah anything from Halfords isn't worth the money.

&gt; Why do we accept secure parking is an option for cars, but don't ask for equitable provision for bikes?

I can see once it becomes a business that they might then lobby local governments to enact local bylaws prohibiting lashing bikes to what ever is handy. Practically, the joy of a bike and it's utility is being able to travel from door to door, and that's potentially eroded if we have centralised depots as a norm. I'd much rather public space be made available in many places, and it would be a shame if money was ""invested"" in secure parking ahead of cycleways.

My major opposition comes from the very idea of asking for paid services: it's one more pointless/boring job and money in the pocket of the rentier class. Alternatively, there is ample space inside train stations for just an example. I'm thinking specifically right now of Manchester Victoria or Piccadilly where literally the platforms could be one long row of free to use bike loops, all overseen by CCTV and rail staff at zero extra cost because it's already there. There are a few already, and it's actually one of the few places I'd leave a bike all day.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Many people could live quite happily the rest of their lives earning under £21k. If they have a partner earning equivalent, similar or slightly higher amounts then they are barely paying back anything for their student loan - if at all. Even if you factor inflation into the situation if you're not paying back the loan then you essentially received a degree for free. The government is counting on people earning above the threshold but big business is trying to keep costs down and this results in wages being pushed down. 

Keep in mind I graduated this year. I am all for students. However from the research I did before my degree and subsequently I know that this problem is going to come back and bite every single student in the arse one day. Whether it is in a years time or 30 years time I know it's going to happen. The current situation is unsustainable. 

It's quite funny that as I student I didn't 'get' the student protests during the fee rise riots. Students themselves aren't paying back much at all. It is the government paying up front and footing the bill for up to 10-30 years. Students only pay back 9% of anything they earn above £15k on the old rules or £21k on the new rules. The protests were mainly about the new rules where you have to earn over £21k before you begin even considering paying a penny back.

His aim appears to be just to get his head on it and anything after that is gravy (I'm sure that Pearce has the same attitude, which explains why he's never scored for us despite countless chances). He often mistimes his jumps and leaps too early - and I actually thought that his header over the bar against Burnley was worse than Smith's missed chances on Wednesday.

I agree that Varney is still ahead of Smith, though, because he's a more well-rounded player with more pace, mobility and is actually capable of running with the ball at his feet against opposition players, but Varney's strength is in being able to chase balls into the channels and create openings for himself, while Smith is more of a traditional no-frills target man.",0,1380321135,null,0,false,0,ccgpelu,t3_1n6r9v,t1_ccgpelu,t1_ccgb0cj,null,1429320764,1,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,1

I think this is a way that the government is promoting marriage, and while it might not keep people in a bad marriage, it might push people together who aren't entirely committed. Two people who have been together could be pushed into marriage earlier because of these incentives, while they may not have been together long enough to really see whether it would work out.

I also think this is a not very indirect way of the government pushing 'traditional family values' and trying to make them seem like the correct way, further putting social pressure on divorce.

Workfare ended up being taken for a gigantic ride by Tesco's at least and probably others as well, using Workfare people to outright replace NMW'd employees AND they also in all likelihood had a per head per month sweetener to boot.

Upsides:

* The Uni is split into many different colleges, with each having their own separate accommodation, societies, bar and support services. Of course colleges intermix and some are larger than others but this gives you a smaller community to fit into and get to know people.

* Durham is a relatively small town, which given the large student population makes it very much a 'student town'.

* The centre of town, colloquially known as the Bailey, is ancient. The streets are narrow, winding and cobbled, and many of the colleges are located here. The Cathedral and Castle date from Norman times (~1100 AD) and are both UNESCO world heritage sites. The castle is actually a functioning halls of residence itself, and, even if you don't live there, all students are welcome to use the bar there.

* Newcastle, the largest city in the North-East of England is only a 15 minute train ride away, if you ever get tired of the small town atmosphere.

Downsides:

* It is a small town. Amenities are fairly poor, shopping is virtually non-existent, and though the nightlife is vigorously supported by the student population it might be a bit lame compared to what you're used to.

* It is fairly isolated. Trying to get a terms-worth of luggage to Durham without a car can be quite a challenge. Even though the town is situated on the London-Newcastle mainline, the station is up a hill and quite a distance from most of the colleges.

* Speaking of hills, they're everywhere, and given the small nature of the town public transport isn't really an option. Plus, as mentioned, many of the streets are cobbled and it can become difficult to get around if the winter is especially cold.

Overall, there are some practical downsides to consider, but if you think you can look past these then it'll likely be a great choice.

Economic liberalism refers to getting the government out of the economy through deregulation and policies to improve the supply side. People are self-reliant, and should help themselves to get on in life rather than depending on others.

Social conservatism refers to keeping society and the norms and values within it from progressing by funding things like religion, marriage, discipline and traditional roles.

That is the theory, but there are advantages and disadvantages to it which would take a longer to explain.

Obviously there are a lot missing too, because of the English and of course the Romans destroying many of the records over the years.

But they all lead back to a Welshman as King of the Britons.

Also Merlin was a Welsh legend and many historians believe that if King Arthur existed or not, He would have been one of the Welsh Kings of Briton. A decent of Celtic and Roman heritage. We'd have been known back then as the Romano British.

The ""Welsh"" as we know today didn't just occupy Wales before the Saxons arrived. We occupied most of Northern England and up to Scotland. The Welsh language was supposedly founded in Northern  parts of England and Wales, but as the Saxons mingled and started expanding territory, The Britons were pushed back, with the Welsh language into what we today call Wales. This would have happened about 1200 - 1500 years ago.

It's unclear whether it was due to war or just the Saxon culture spreading causing the Britons to fall back to Wales.

So you can proudly say that the Welsh are the oldest Celtic people to survive throughout history in Europe, and the Welsh are the oldest people to occupy the UK, along with the Irish. Some of the Britons that moved North of Britain Mingled with the Saxons and the Picts (a fairly savage Celtic people that somewhat resemble the tribes of Africa in appearance and dress. Except White with Blue tribal paint.), effectively creating the people of Scotland today.

It's also why Scotland, Wales and Ireland have got on pretty well through out history. Our common difference to the English. The history is facinating.

Yep - more or less, it runs from York Place to Haymarket along the roads, after which it's all off-road; it shadows the train lines out to Hermiston Gait, at which point it turns north inside the city bypass up to Gogarburn (where the depot is), and then turns west and parallels the A8 out before finally turning north into the airport.

However, the big difference between the trams and buses on the roads, is that buses share the road space with other vehicles.  The tram (arguably more accurately described as a light rail system) **removes** that road space from common usage - once you put a tramline down the middle of Leith Walk, you'll have to lose the bus lanes because there's not enough room to have those plus the tram lines plus enough road for any other vehicles.",0,1380325661,null,0,1380326256,0,ccgqqkg,t3_1n85gm,t1_ccgqqkg,t1_ccgby1l,null,1429320130,2,false,Edinburgh,t5_2rffi,2

&gt;Similarly, you may not modify any pre-existing work.

So let's take game modifications.  Obviously, if I throw a pilotable TARDIS with custom model/textures/etc. into... say, the videogame Fable... 3 (I won't be doing anything with that game but it's just a stupid example) it's going to not only USE pre-existing work (the game engine itself -- not art, but still pre-existing) but also DEPEND on whoever is judging to have access to the game.  So my first question is... assuming that no art assets are used in what's actually being submitted (a TARDIS interior/exterior/whatever), but that it does rely on a game with its own art assets already in it, to even exist, does that break the rules?

Secondly, on a related note: whether or not a game mod is acceptable, what about an actual short game ""demo"" (to hell with creating a complete videogame based on someone else's IP, just for the fun of it) or... whatever you'd call it?  Essentially would be the same thing except -everything- would be custom-made.  I assume this would be okay, but again, this is an art contest -- while I consider the final product art, a large portion of it isn't going to be art.  With that said, would it make any sense to submit something like that?  Would a video OF that working be better? (that way you don't have to run some Reddit user's code to see what's been made and so on)

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"The first, second and third postal directives passed in December 1997, June 2002, and February 2008.   

The first set a limit on the national universal service provider opening the door to competition and the subsequent directives opened the door further and further, limiting the reserved sector more and more.  This essentially allowed private firms to underbid the Royal Mail on profitable routes without the overheads which the Royal Mail faced because they were using them to offset less profitable routes as a universal provider.  Essentially private companies were cherry picking, or in some cases even using Royal Mail subsidised routes to their own depots.  The first reduction of the reserved area was in 1999, the second was in 2003, then 2006, with the process completed in 2012.  Each time the competition were allowed to expand and apply more and more ratcheting pressure.


Private firms were out competing the Royal Mail on lucrative routes and leaving them to cover the more costly services denying them needed revenue streams.

It's only a matter of time before a haemorrhaging patient bleeds out, and the RM had gone through a death of a thousand cuts.  The government had taken on their pension debt, and the coalition has made billions available to keep Post Offices open which would feed profits into the distinct Royal Mail, but it was only a matter before the situation became an ever growing millstone and/or terminal.  Had it been allowed to keep together with service protected from competition it would have been manageable for all, self-sustainable even.

In the 2011 Postal Services Act the coalition allowed the patient to be sold off or broken up, effectively retaining the right to switch off the life support whilst there's something still worth breaking up and selling.

The Norwegian government essentially went through a decade of threats resisting these directives, until finally they felt their hand was forced, the damage imminent, and for the first time the exercised their veto - which the UK currently does not have.  So it's not a case of hindsight.  Others saw this coming.  Rather than pussyfooting around discussion of reform that may never materialise and resigning itself that whatever happened it would be too late for the Royal Mail the government could have simply reneged and repealed the three directives.  That might have even been enough to have forced the hand for real reform.  Arguably it would have to force the issue if they stood firm in front of the ECJ. A member state saying enough is enough and forcing renegotiation.

The lads out there seeing horrific sights and struggling adjusting to civvie life when they get back need our support, not little pricks like you thinking you're smart by making nasty comments. You disgust me and you know you think vermin thoughts which is why you'll only share them here. They are our lads over there who are decent men who have joined the military because it's a good career, builds up people, keeps our country strong, and they're doing the right thing when they are over there. They're greeted by locals who are happy to have them there because the taliban rules with an iron fist and they want greater freedoms. 

So you should stop chatting shit when you don't know what you're talking about. Two of my good mates have been in Afghan, you really do not have a clue about what is happening over there. And saying my mates deserve less respect when they've fought to free people from militant islamists who STRAP BOMBS TO CHILDRENS CHESTS AFTER KILLING THEIR PARENTS and also RAPE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY'VE HIT PUBERTY shows just how much of an ungrateful cunt you are. 

You'd get grilled in real life and walk away with your head down for a reason, it's because you're wrong and you're talking about something you know nothing about as if you do. 

Put yourself in the shoes of the people who are forced via islamic ideologies to do what they want. When they know this is why their country isn't as great as the Western soldiers who are invading and understand that they are there to help free them and put systems in place to help build the country up. You seriously should be forced to live in Afghanistan, then you'd be welcoming intervention and those men who 'deserve less respect' you'd be waving to crying as they drive past your village.

true,Adonia,null,null,"I've had mixed feelings on this subject for a while now... gonna try and type up my feelings in ramble-format.

Yes, Rose has a very flawed character throughout her time, even though she grows... and everything she's done that's listed here is (I think...) a valid reason to dislike her.  Her attitude toward Mickey is especially bad.  But... so is Mickey's toward her, a bit, in response.  Judging by their interaction they probably never would have worked out either way.

It's a very human thing to not realize what you want in a relationship, be it with your family or with a potential lover, or whatever kind.  I don't blame her for running off from her family (and at first she only expected to be gone a day) because everyone leaves to start their own life one day.  How she treated Mickey on the other hand is more complicated.  Neither one seemed to consider each others' needs and feelings very well (Mickey does more so, though) and that's an easy thing to fall into for any reason.  Just try marrying someone who you love but don't necessarily get along with, for example.  Not gonna turn out well.

BECAUSE she was so young (yeah, still old enough to recognise this stuff, but) and she was just sort of thrown out of her old life and into the Doctor's, I can see it potentially being very confusing for ANYONE in that kind of scenario... especially without time or obvious reason to properly introspect on what it is she's looking for.

For me, it's not just that she's realistic because she's got some flaws that she can help, it's realistic because she's got some very serious flaws that, unfortunately, quite a lot of people have and don't even recognize as a problem until it's too late (if then).  I don't like how she treats Mickey (or her mother but that's another story) but I also don't see it as something I could necessarily blame her for.

She DOES grow, during and after knowing the Doctor.  Fighting for her people/whoever else rather than just turning away and waiting for someone else to, and so on... but she also stubbornly clings to the same bad traits -- very flawed but very human.  From the outside that may just seem all bad.  And it does for me too, until I realize I've been in the same situation (er, relationship-wise with Mickey, not... yeah I never time traveled or fought aliens or whatever.) and it took YEARS to work through it.

Want to know whats embarrassing? I'll tell you. Not having a clue what the other chap is saying (because you can't read plain English), making up strawman arguments, responding to those strawman arguments (concocted by yourself), and the patting yourself on the back for your supposed ingenuity.

**Thats embarrassing !**

From a quick glance at some of the other posts on this thread, it seems you have previous on this. You have a fundamental inability to actually parse what others are saying, and instead invent your own words coming (supposedly) from their mouths. I'm going to take this slowly, and break it up into small bite-sized chunks. Like feeding a noisy snot-nosed toddler. Open up wide, here comes the spoon...


**BITE 1**
&gt; All you are doing is attempting to excuse the periods of spending by saying there were other times where homegrown players were graduated. Well, every club can make that same argument.

No. At no point did we completely overhaul our team with a short sustained bout of spending big on big names.

Dalglish? Yes, we bought him. Yes, we payed a good chunk of cash for him. He was already a superstar. We were the defending European champs, our leading striker had just left, and we had noone who could replace him adequately. So we went out and got the best.

Outspending our rivals? **NO**. In that same period (late 70's), Francis and Birtles (to name 2) went for over a million. Thats **DOUBLE WHAT WE PAYED FOR KENNY**.

And that was 1 player. **ONE**. There are 11 on a team, and more on the squad.


**BITE 2**

I never said that Liverpool **didn't** spend money. We did when we needed to. Every idiot and his dog knows that. What I said is ""Liverpool traditionally were never the biggest spenders in the English game"". Thats not the same thing.

As I painstakingly tried to demonstrate to you (what a waste of time that was), Liverpool's sides were mostly constructed of players we had bought on the cheap and groomed to play our way.

Emphasis on **mostly**. This is one of the part you seem to be constantly **FAILING** to grasp.

This would work for the majority of the squad. And for a couple of key positions, we would identify the player we thought was best for that, and got him. If that meant big money on that signing, so be it.

Break up our dominant decades into 5 year chunks. You'll see how the team seamlessly morphed from one set of players to another, while continuing to win everything in sight.

And how did these transitions occur? Mostly, by bringing in unknown young (or older but unappreciated) players from smaller clubs, and grooming them. For not a lot of money. Not because we were trying to save a copper or two, but because **THIS WAS THE SYSTEM THAT WORKED**. Shanks was a a bit before my time, but I'm intimately aware of how Paisley did it. Which is why I tried to describe **that** earlier. Replacing the 76-81 side (4 League's, 3 European's, 1 UEFA, 1 domestic cup) with the 82-85 side (3 League's, 1 Ueropean, 3 domestic cups). Yes, I'm lumping Fagan in with Paisely. He was just tiding things over for Bob anyway.

So how did he manage that transition? The City and Chelsea way?

- we're the biggest club in the world (we **WERE** then)
- we have load'sa money (we had a bob or two)
- any player would have died to play for us, so recruiting would be easy (mostly, **yes**)

So yeah. Bob got established players like Lawro. And Robinson (being from Ireland myself, I liked Michael from before in a green shirt). But he **also** got, and relied heavily on:

- Whelan. Who? Some young kid from Cork. For 5 quid and a packet of crisps.
- Rush. Who? A Welsh striker signed from ... Chester. For ... not a load of money.
- Grobelaar. Who? To replace the great Clemence? (Like replacing Schmeichal or de Saar). We got him from where? Canada. CANADA? What?

Thats **NOT** the hallmark of a club who relies on spending big to retain dominance. We spent money **when we needed to**, and only then, for a couple of key positions we weren't able to fill otherwise.

What we **DID NOT** do is go out is flex our muscles, identify the highest profile players and buy 2 players for every position, as is the current way.

You seem to have a hard time grasping all of that.

**IN A NUTSHELL**
**We weren't the biggest spenders. And the majority of our squads weren't big, high profile names UNTIL they came to Liverpool and made it there.**


**BITE 3**

Apparently, I'm complaining about how City and Chelsea are buying their way to success

&gt; It is going to be amusing when in 15 years time City and Chelsea fans who are like yourself will complain about how Leeds' or West Ham's rise to prominence isn't ""traditional"" and that they never had to spend money in that way, they always built their clubs from the ground up with youth etc. Your argument today is exactly that, and that is exactly how it would have been laughed at 20-30 years ago from other fans.

Utter bollocks. You're just making it all up. I did not attack City/Chelsea et al. I never implied it. Again, your imagination getting the better of you, and filling in the gaps which your poor English reading skills leave behind.

As it happens, I can't stand Chelsea (for other reasons), but I quite like City. And thats got the square root of f--- all to do with my posts on this thread.


**BITE 4**

&gt; I don't know why you would be so critical of somebody who goes out and learns something via Google or Wikipedia, it might explain why you are blind to facts

You silly little child. I'm not being critical of somebody who's trying to learn something. My original post was itself a response to a question from someone who was ASKING about the clubs past.

I **am** being critical of someone who:

* can't read simple English

* feels the need to make up stuff, and pretend the other person said *that* instead

* insists that his reading &amp; researching skills mean that he is able to debunk all the rose-tinted myths propagated by supporters who are giving 1st hand accounts from actual memory

* while at the same time, demonstrating that he can't read properly. Which also calls into question his ability to properly research, well, anything ...

And thats not even bringing up your puerile attempts at lecturing me on ""football economics"", with your insistance that Evans buying Collymore was like Real buying Bale, and that our purchase of Dalglish was ""the equivalent of double Andy Carroll"".

Seriously, if you didn't exist, I wouldn't be able to make you up. I don't quite have **that** much imagination. Ok, weekend's coming up, and Sunderland are next up. You've outlived your short amusement value.

I could go on. I'll ruin your night a little more I guess:

Britons that join ""the other side"" so to speak at least have more bravery than the home armed forces. As an ex-militant you should admire them actually, they go to fight for the losing side knowing full well they are out-manned, out-gunned, out-teched and will likely die. You on the other hand go fight wars you expect to win and that smacks of bullying. Some might have odd religious beliefs but some fight because they see death being cowardly dropped from the sky on man, woman and child. As an institution the army has my complete disrespect, ex-soldiers can regain my respect once they ""repent for their sins"" so to speak, those that are unashamedly pro-militant despite all the information available remain disrespected. Any institution (ie' MI5) that gave that pedophile *Sir* Jimmy Savile clearance to work at the BBC is going to be especially disrespected.

Let's not forget that the UK/US partnership has been the greatest terror threat for 70 years: supporting islamists in Afghanistan in tho 70s, over throwing democracies like Iran 1950s, and presently are funding and arming Syrian extremists. How fucked up is that? And of course at home militants have set up totalitarian surveillance now outed by Snowden.

&gt; You seriously should be forced to live in Afghanistan, then you'd be welcoming intervention and those men who 'deserve less respect' you'd be waving to crying as they drive past your village.

Just listen to yourself, you as extremist as the average brown militant.

&gt; free them

Nonsense. It was nonsense in Vietnam, it was nonsense in Iraq, it was nonsense in Libya, and it's nonsense for those drone striken in Pakistan. While Afghanis are being freed from their lives, Cameron and friends are selling arms to any Saudi despot. There's a contradiction there even the most puddled khaki wearing unionjack waving militant can't ignore, but I'm sure you'll try.

You are a violent class, not a heroic class. You are a bully. You fight for oil fields. You do not fight for me. You're as guilty of war crimes as Tony Blair, and he's a dead cert. I'm statistically more likely to be violently assaulted by home militants or police than I am by any terrorist, islamic or otherwise.",0,1380329704,null,0,false,0,ccgrvls,t3_1n50dr,t1_ccgrvls,t1_ccgrhqf,null,1429319598,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What in the holy hell are you talking about? Go to a few particular places that are not suited or designed for welcoming immigrants? One point raised was that immigrants can come in and immediately resume their previous life in a community like that of their native country without making any attempt to integrate. Generally, you'll find a damn warmer welcome here if you're an immigrant than a lot of other places. *Arguably* too warm a welcome and easy a ride that doesn't promote integration, respect for laws, and incites disapproval from some parties.

You can sit here and be all freedom fighter with your half baked quotes of ideals and revolutionary fantasies you've been told to believe in. As typically nowerdays, anything established or common is evil and oppressive, and stating that anything, under any topic is anything other than racist or intolerant is to be seen as ignorant.

At a basic level, you can attempt to appear as superior as you like, but the opinions of someone else, whether they be higher class and seen as snobby, or lower class and seen as scummy, are still valid.

true,pool92,lfc68,,"*So as not to give DM more traffic, here's the content of the article*:

&gt;Pepe Reina is resigned to the fact he will never pull on the Liverpool shirt again and a trace of bitterness lingers about the nature of his exit from Anfield but the popular goalkeeper is thriving again in Italy.
Reunited with Rafa Benitez, Reina has been key in their impressive start to the campaign and last weekend became the first goalkeeper to ever save a Mario Balotelli penalty as Napoli won in the San Siro for the first time in 27 years. It has helped convince Reina that some good may come from the ignominy of being forced out of Liverpool while on holiday and despite finishing last season with seven clean sheets in 10 Barclays Premier League games.


&gt;'It did come as a surprise,' said Reina, who has three years left on his Anfield deal. 'It was the club [Liverpool] who made the move. I was on my holidays and nobody told me anything. Suddenly Napoli called and said they were agreeing terms with Liverpool and Liverpool just rang me two days later and said the same. They probably had their own reasons.'

&gt;It all happened quickly and the 31-year-old signed on loan for one season. Benitez will work on him to make it permanent, but accepts there will be competition, possibly from Barcelona, who expect Victor Valdes to leave when his contract expires next year.
Reina is unsure what will unfold but he cannot see a return to Merseyside. 'No,' he said, shaking his head. 'At the moment it's difficult to think about being a Liverpool player next year. They have a young goalkeeper in Simon Mignolet and the manager prefers him to me.
'That's the reason why I'm here and he will be at the club next year as well. There's no reason to think I'll be a Liverpool player from now on but we'll see where the future takes us. It's been a good move so far and I don't regret what happened. I would have preferred to say goodbye in a different way.'


&gt;Oddly, the loan move came six months after Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers assured him he was No 1. 'His best years are in front of him, not behind him,' said Rodgers, in December. 
'He is working harder than ever, he has lost weight, he looks fresh, he looks bright, he is doing extra work and it is a great step forward to him and his commitment in terms of him staying at Liverpool.'
On Wednesday, at Napoli's Castel Volturno training base, he was  recovering from a training run in the Mediterranean sun, the morning after a 1-1 draw at home to Sassoulo.

&gt;'I want to enjoy this year,' said Reina. 'It is such an important one for me with the World Cup around the corner and returning to the  top flight, playing in the  Champions League and fighting for the title, is something I have missed in the last two or three years. I'm happy to be back at this level. I never expected it but it's been a great decision. I feel invigorated by the move.
'Mentally, I'm fresher, I have more hunger. It is not like before I wasn't, but a change can be good for your mind. You have to show the people even more and you have to be ready. The tactics and the managerial skills of Rafa are getting the best from me and that's one more reason.'
Napoli fans have embraced the Spanish goalkeeper and there is tangible excitement in the city that this may be a special year as they target their first Serie A title since 1990 and the days when Diego Maradona ruled the Stadio San Paolo.

&gt;'It's been a magnificent welcome,' said Reina. 'It's been brilliant. My family have adapted well to Napoli. The kids in the school are happy and my wife is making some friends. It is very similar to Liverpool. 
'It is a humble city and very, very passionate about the team. It is almost a religion, like in Liverpool. That's always brilliant for the players. It is a positive pressure. It is a healthy club, that's for sure. 
'Along with Borussia Dortmund it is probably the healthiest club in Europe. The squad is being built little by little with room to improve but it is going the right way and everything is good.'

&gt;His brilliant save from Balotelli (his first miss in 27 penalties) preserved a 2-1 win at AC Milan and is evidence of his positive mood. 
'Just lucky it wasn't right in the corner,' smiled Reina, but he has a knack. He saved seven out of nine conceded by Villarreal in the season before his move to Liverpool.
'It goes in waves,' he added. 'There was a time at Liverpool for about two years when I couldn't even smell it. When you're on fire you're on fire and when you're not you're not. If there's a secret, I'll keep it to myself.'

&gt;Reina will be in London next week when Napoli take on Arsenal, another club linked with him in the past. 'That happened in 2010,' he said. 'Since then, nothing has been going on, no direct contact with me or my agent.
'He has given the opportunity to Szczesny and Fabianski to prove themselves once again. I have a lot of respect for that club and they have great goalkeepers right now. All I can say is that it happened once and never again.
'But it is a great feeling to be going back to England to play at Champions League level. 
'It is the famous group of death but we have started with a win. Arsenal are a really tough opponent at home but we have a little bit of confidence.'

The discussion on this topic seems to be a complete and utter ignorant stance to the fact that these types of racial attacks don't exist on the mainland, which is just *wrong*.  This has nothing to do with British values, or a sincere protection of cultural identity.  This is uneducated youths that believe that immigration is the cause of high unemployment, because they don't know how else to explain it.  It's possible you've been out of touch with Northern Ireland for some time now, but I can assure you, no one is worried about losing their cultural identity to immigrants.  It's just not something that is a factor.  This is about social insecurities and the economy for both sides.

I study in a predominantly republican area, that has countless murals and drunken youths chanting pro-IRA slogans through the streets.  To claim that the Loyalist area's are worse than the other in their fear of a loss of cultural identity is just rather silly.  For the British people here who are so eager to turn their backs on the people of Northern Ireland, I honestly have nothing but resentment for that action.  You can't invade and occupy a country, and decide to disregard the inevitable consequences.  Like any report on Northern Ireland, you'll have a number of people from the mainland claiming how anti-British their actions are, or how this wouldn't happen where they live.  Well, I call bullshit.  The truth of the matter is, we don't even know if these morons were Loyalist or Nationalist.

&gt; For Labour, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves said: ""David Cameron's so-called marriage tax break won't even help two-thirds of married couples, let alone millions of people who are separated, widowed or divorced.

Right. It only helps people who are basic rate tax payers. But we all know that if it did help higher rate payers, Labour would go crazy complaining about it.

And ok it doesn't help divorced people. So labour are saying that the tax cut isn't given to enough people, right?

&gt;""He's so out of touch he thinks people will get married for £3.85 a week.

I don't think he said that.

&gt;""And even for the minority who might benefit, it will be far outweighed by what David Cameron's government has already taken away in higher VAT and cuts to child benefit and tax credits.

Is that the child benefit and tax credit cuts for higher earners? The same ones Labour went crazy that they were still getting child benefit of they earned £50k/yr?

I do agree about VAT, but again it mostly affects higher earners who purchase more luxuries. Poor families spend a greater % of their budget on essentials.

&gt;""David Cameron also needs to explain how this policy will be paid for. Will he be raising taxes or making cuts elsewhere to fund this?

Oh ok, so now we can't afford the tax cut? But just earlier they were saying that it should apply to more people.

&gt;""At a time when millions of people are facing a cost of living crisis we should be helping all families and not just some.""

Oh... hang on. I thought they JUST said we can't afford tax cuts? But now we need to help ALL families!! Fuck, that sounds expensive. I mean, it sounds great doesn't it - ""we should be helping all families""! But I do notice that the Labour person didn't suggest where they would raise the money either.

And let's be honest, Labour DON'T want to help all families. If this tax cut applied to higher rate taxpayers, we all know they would be going mental about it. They're happy to help just some people when it suits them.

Disgusting. All of it is shameful.

You see 'no one has definitive proof we are wrong' - we don't need it, that is the default answer.

Your answer is 'we can't tell you, trust us'.

No. Earn my trust.

Until then people don't see what you see in your posts, they see: NO ANSWER HERE, TRUST US.

The Bitcoin community has trusted the wrong people too often to get burned that way.

By the time someone cares enough about you to bother, a company not using a template site will have replaced you because it'll be open season on new exchanges.

true,amongthewolves,lfc99,,"I made a thread regarding our situation with playing too defensively and I've gotten one or two negative responses with the Lucas/Gerrard combination in our midfield. We have potentially the best defense in the premier league right now, yet we're playing defensively in our midfield as well? This doesn't make sense.

From what I saw from the ManU game, the only clear chances we got were when Toure and Hendo were in the box, which both weren't even part of the the front of attack. We had a terrific start to the season, but look at our wins: all 1-0 and having an exhausted midfield at the last 20-30 minutes of the 2nd half. We need to be pressuring and creating chances early in the game, before we can rest on our laurels and start playing defensively when we have the game in the bag. My thoughts were to move Gerrard in a deeper position to make the play from the back, while having Henderson and Allen/Lucas make surges in the final third to link up with the front 3 to get more chances on goal.

Yes, I understand Gerrard and Lucas are key players and I understand their abilities and stats in their current position. But the fact of the matter is that BR is trying to create an unstoppable team for the next upcoming years and we're playing our aging captain and a CDM who isn't completely fit yet. Look at the 2008-2009, we had Gerrard/Mascherano/Alonso in our midfield. We need that tenacity, energy, and passion back in our midfield. I really hope Allen and Hendo start making a lot more appearances this season and Gerrard and Lucas are rotated depending on whether we want to take more of a defensive or attacking approach to each match.

Hopefully, we'll see some sort of tactical/personnel switch in the Sunderland game on Sunday and we start putting out consistent performances for the full 90 minutes. ",0,1380343514,null,0,1380364596,0,ccgvczh,t3_1n8nhe,t1_ccgvczh,t3_1n8nhe,null,1429317973,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Do up all buttons and especially zips and turn everything inside out (it means any minor mistakes will be on the inside of your clothes where nobody can see them). Separate into three piles, light coloured things, dark coloured things, and towels and teatowels. Put in washing machine. Bold has a built in fabric softener, which will keep your clothes feeling nice. Put in wash powder (there's a guide on the box telling you how much, look up if you'll have hard or soft water online). Set machine to 40 (warm) with pre-wash; towels and teatowels should be washed at least at 60 (hot) for hygiene reasons. When washing finishes, remove all woollens and synthetics, i.e. anything that gets static, and put it on a hanger to dry. Put everything.else in dryer with a dryer sheet. Wear. Enjoy.

The only thing you really *need* to iron is cotton shirts. The creases will fall right out of t-shirts and hoodies and jeans. Never iron the stuff you didn't put in the dryer. Turn items inside out. Turn knob to appropriate material. Run iron over clothing. Don't miss any bits. Turn off iron.

true,floatoonflickr,null,null,"Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister at a time (1979), when the balance of power was beginning to favour the working class. Unions were strong, many large companies were owned by the state, and demands for fair wages, housing, better benefits for the unemployed, access to higher education, good workplace reforms, a balance of power between authority and ""citizens"" were all much more in the hands of ordinary, non-wealthy people than they had been before.

There was a serious conflict going on between those who favoured the power of the few (wealthy and rich) against power based on values where traditionally less powerful groups, workers and poorer people also had an influence and stake in society.

This conflict led to strikes, demands for higher wages, and a breakdown in worker/employer relationships across many huge industries. Incidents such as the lack of availability of fuel (i.e. coal industry) causing power cuts; car manufacturing being brought to a halt; [lack of waste(garbage) collection leading to waste being piled high in the streets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent);  all bringing the country to a standstill when workers went on strike. 

Margaret Thatcher did not believe in equality so much as she believed that if the rich and powerful got business right, then the benefits would [trickle down](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trickledowntheory.asp) to the less wealthy and powerful in society. This meant ordinary people having less power and things such as the rights of workers, good housing provision, unemployment benefits etc. took second place to industry and profit.

Thus the conflict: some people agreed and thought it was better than the country being in disarray. Others felt that it undermined all the reforms that workers had gained over many years.

Personally I would like to see a country where The People had power to change things for the better; wealth was not greedily swept up by the few; reforms were based on referendums not powerful overconfident unions; and citizens, not money, were the priority.",0,1380346784,null,0,1381468096,0,ccgw13c,t3_1na26w,t1_ccgw13c,t3_1na26w,null,1429317661,12,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,12

If you don't get in, you can apply through clearing.

Firstly I want to say I've enjoyed reading your posts on the design process! Great work.

However, I feel that the brief set by Everton was clear about keeping everything whole so things would not be missed off / excluded.

Only 2 of these crests feature the word 'Everton' within the crest opposed to underneath it. This would make it very easy to exclude the word 'Everton' from the other three crests.

This would mean (personally) that the only two viable options are C &amp; D.

I like the designs overall however I think the dark blue on light blue would be difficult to see/read when reproduced on a smaller scale.

All things considered I'd have to say D was the crest that was most successful in meeting the brief.

I've enjoyed your crest journey! Thanks for your effort.

I don't think there is any magic bullet to this.  The entire economy has dug itself into a nasty hole through decades of wages not keeping pace with the cost of living.  Add in the housing boom, and it's just not feasible to live on minimum wage.  Upping minimum wage will just result in more part time jobs and other loop-holes to avoid paying it.  Forcing companies to pay minimum wage for everyone will result in companies out sourcing as much work as they can to cheaper countries.

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Well, what is it? Is there no austerity, or have there been austerity cuts to local budgets?

Since we're talking about what George Osborne can do, we're discussing the total budget.  The fact that he (foolishly in my opinion) moved money from the local budgets to some other pet departments doesn't change the fact that he increased spending.  If anything the local budget is where most of us _feel_ austerity, which is why there is such furore about austerity, even though it has gained us (in terms of a better looking balance sheet) nothing.

&gt; ""total government spending is not shrinking"" = ""there is no such thing as an ideology of austerity"".

""ideology of austerity""? that's an even more wishy-washy term than ""austerity"" itself.  Go and have a look at a dictionary about what ""austerity"" means.  It certainly isn't ""10%"" cut.  And there hasn't even been the tiniest cut, let alone 10%.  There is no way of twisting what we have had -- increased spending -- to fit the word ""austerity"".  What measure other than spending should I use that is a measurable fact?  Some guy's wife getting fired (while sad for him and her) doesn't tell us anything about the national situation.

And my ""nasty little coda"" was entirely in response to being given not an argument against my point, but being told to ""blow it out my delusional libertarian arse"".

true,fidelcabro,,Yard of overproof rum.,"Okay this is going to help any student or person wanting to eat cheaply but wants more than pasta, this base using mince with a couple of changes will do so many things.

Chop and fry an onion, carrot and garlic, then add 1kg of mince fry until its all brown. Then add a good squirt of tomato paste and stir this around the mince and stuff until everything is coated and cook it for a couple of minutes. Now what I do here is let it cool and portion it into four freezer bags and use it when I need it, you then just defrost one and make any of the following.

This is your mince base and from this you can go three ways, any kind of pasta be it lasagne or spaghetti or any other pasta you want. To make it into a pasta sauce add some passata, (this stuff is less then 30p a carton in aldi/lidl) add some dried herbs of choice and season with salt and pepper. This is a basic sauce, you want more veg in there add it, making the sauce from scratch is easy and much cheaper than a jar of ready made stuff.

Cottage pie, this is easy just add an oxo cube and some water until you have the amount of gravy you require and thicken it with a little cornflour mixed with cold water. Put into an oven proof dish, top with mashed potato and put into oven until its crispy on top. 

Chilli. Once again the friend here is passata or tinned chopped tomatoes. Add these to the mince mixture with some kidney beans and as much chilli flakes as you like, or if you have then chop up a few fresh chillies and add.

I will also say if you know how to do it learn to joint a chicken up. You will get four decent meals out of a chicken if you can do this, the two breasts and then the legs and thighs. 

Another food tip, buy a slow cooker (£8 Wilkinsons) before going to uni in the morning or before going to bed throw stuff in there and turn it onto low. This is great especially in the winter, you can come back home to a nice hot bowl of stew.

If you are near a butcher use them get to know them and just tell them your a student and you want to eat well what can he recommend, the cheaper cuts of meat need more cooking but this is where the slow cooker helps. Ox cheeks are cheap, less than a quid a cheek lots of meat there. Also pork will be your friend it is cheaper than other meats and once again go for things like shoulder or leg. As they are cheaper cuts. And if you cook pulled pork, people will love you and bring you wine/beer if you invite them around to eat.",0,1380358245,null,0,false,0,ccgxp0r,t3_1na3dr,t1_ccgxp0r,t1_ccgrjc9,null,1429316872,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

true,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"The ""policy of austerity"" that people care about is the cutting of government spending.  That's the only way they can themselves be austere.

The fact that they haven't cut at all and have instead raised taxes (which are borne 100% by the private sector) is a demonstration that it is private sector austerity that's going on -- not public sector austerity.

&gt; it's fallen since the election as a share of GDP

Of course it has -- we're pulling ourselves out of a trough.  They are lunatics, but they're not so insane as to kill off any economic growth at all by spending it all.  That doesn't mean the spending isn't too large; it just means the economy is recovering.  What matters is that they have not cut -- when you have to resort to ""well it's fallen as a percentage of"", you really are scraping the barrel for your evidence of ""austerity"".

But have you actually looked at the chart you cite as evidence?

 - It's used the standard PR-spin trickery of not starting the y-scale at 0.  Making the 1% change from 2010-2012 seem bigger than it is
 - It's got a point for 2013 -- which must be a prediction.  These, strangely always tend to get revised unfavourably after the year has passed.
 - It's got points for 2014, 2015 -- which must be a prediction.  Governmental track record on predictions is woeful.  What a surprise that the predicted points are showing, eventually, ""we'll carry on as we are from 2013""

So -- your chart has three usable data points on it, that show fall-as-a-percentage of 1%.  The ONS revises figures by more than that all the time, so we can certainly consider that as having a margin of error on it.  In short: we learn nothing conclusive from that chart.

Even with those dodgy points in, it's still only 2.5% of GDP change -- _that's_ what you're claiming is austerity?

I know some answers to my questions would be that non-married couples (friend, romantic or family) can't guarantee a mortgage provider for example, that they'd stay together.

I've actually stated quite a lot of times over the last 3 months the current status of your questions, as the issues you raise I had sorted out (for the most part) before IBWT existed.

It is fully understandable, your mistrust and uncertainty.

I encourage others to ask for an FOI, because they keep asking me the same thing, repeatedly, and I keep answering the same thing, repeatedly. But obviously people keep their own opinions and thoughts on the subject.

What questions are you exactly asking? Because its been answered oh so many times. If you can define your questions in numerical format I shall do my best to answer (from a personal PoV).

PLEASE bear in mind, that men in suits, otherwise known as the Government, have expressed that some conversations and discussions are CONFIDENTIAL.

This means, I am not at liberty to tell you EXACT details.

1. Yes IBWT has an approved business banking account.
2. No other UK 'exchange/means of getting bitcoins' has a valid bank account, as all others use personal accounts, which are liable to be shut down within an instance.
3. Yes we have what you could say is government 'approval'.

I have repeatedly answered these questions, but if you can present them in a format that is more conceivable to yourself as a viable answer I will attempt to answer such questions as fully as possible (again, from a personal PoV).

You are of course free to NOT use IBWT services, and IBWT encourages other means of transaction to get into the Bitcoin world.

IBWT does not want to replace every single other means of getting into bitcoin within the UK. It exists to provide a viable alternative to the current methods, IF people so choose to use it.

Keep in mind IBWT (full) users must be verified, and IBWT works with government approval. So if you want 'cash in hand bitcoins', its not the service for you.

I am (on behalf of IBWT) also fighting for extensive multiple access to the bitcoin economy (for the variety of other methods that people can buy Bitcoins in the UK), as tbh, even though (some of them) are blatantly trolling and throwing abuse in mine (and IBWT's) general direction.

Their customers aren't going to bother, their competition will.

Given they don't want to give out any details because they think that is all they have on the competition everyone should just wait until a more cooperative company comes forward.

They are clearly asking people to do something that no standard customer is going to bother doing - that has the effect of not answering those questions period.

Of course people will use it anyway, people have used all exchanges that were closed.

Until then, all they've not given out any information at all and until they do I'll assume they just don't have anything to give out because that is the default - the burden of proof is on the people making the claim.

TL;DR I don't think that Cameron will lose many votes if Scotland leaves but, because of Scotland's MPs disappearing, he will gain a lot of influence. 

That's one way of looking at it, but I don't think that Scotland leaving the UK would make many hard or even moderate line Conservative voters change their preference for voting. Heck, if I was a Conservative it wouldn't make me change my mind. Even if it does make a few people change their mind, the Conservatives the Labour Party would suddenly lose *41* MPs in Scotland where as the Conservatives would only lose one. Not only does that mean that the opposition has less MPs but also that the number of MPs in Westminster will be fewer so less are needed to create a majority. It would be like the Conservatives magically getting 60 or 70  (there abouts) new MPs. They definitely wouldn't be in a coalition of Scotland was gone.

Yes, and only those resident Scotland will have the final say.

No.  It absolutely matters what the UK says as it's fundamentally about deciding whether to be governed by them or not.  To not have the UK represented at all is ludicrous.

&gt;Since it also effects the Scottish peoples relationship with the EU (since they'll be out and will have to join)

That's not true.  Scottish people have gained rights as EU citizens for 40 years and cannot have that revoked (there is no legal clause or precedent to do so).  Scotland will not instantly be independent after the vote, there will be a period of transition which has been estimated at 18-24 months during which negotiations will be held to keep Scotland in the EU and other bodies which it has been part of as part of the UK.

Decision to remain in these and other international bodies would follow on from the question of political independence.  During the first election post indy the Scottish people will choose who will represent them and it is here that they will choose people who are pro/anti EU/NATO accordingly.

true,SilencedDragon,null,null,"Hi mate,

I did a similar thing to you but in reverse (in Melbourne - great city by the way) from Feb-July of this year (I normally study at the Uni of Manchester).
The main thing I would emphasise is that Melbourne is a large city, similar in size to Birmingham and to a lesser extent Nottingham. Now, I haven't studied in either of those cities, but from what I've been told the Uni experience in those cities is similar to that of Manchester, which in turn I found quite similar to Melbourne - i.e. large city, large student population, good nightlife etc. Whilst I had a great time in Melbourne I wasn't exactly out of my comfort zone compared to when I'm in Manchester.

For that reason I would recommend Durham or one of the London Unis. Durham is a beautiful city with quite a high proportion of students, but is a relatively small city (obviously a contrast to Melbourne), and I understand that it is very traditional (in terms of colleges and such like). London, on the other hand, is a huge city, way way way bigger than Melbourne and I can imagine the Student experience there would be vastly different too, but for different reasons to Durham.

I guess it depends what you're looking for, and all of those universities you've listed are great academically and reputation-wise, so you can't go wrong in that sense.
And definitely go into halls/colleges. I couldn't afford the colleges in Melbourne and felt a bit out of the loop, and had to live in a sharehouse with people who weren't students (still enjoyed myself though!). Everybody goes into halls in the UK so you'll meet loads of new people who are all new to that city too.
